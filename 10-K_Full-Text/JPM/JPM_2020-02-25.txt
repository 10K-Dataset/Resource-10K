Part I

Item 1. Business.

Overview

JPMorgan Chase & Co.

(“JPMorgan Chase” or the “Firm”, NYSE: JPM),

a financial holding company incorporated under Delaware law in 1968, is a leading global financial services firm and one of the largest banking institutions in the United States of America

(“U.S.”)

, with operations worldwide; JPMorgan Chase had

$2.7 trillion

in assets and

$261.3 billion

in stockholders’ equity as of

December 31, 2019

. The Firm is a leader in investment banking, financial services for consumers and small businesses, commercial banking, financial transaction processing and asset management. Under the J.P. Morgan and Chase brands, the Firm serves millions of customers in the U.S. and many of the world’s most prominent corporate, institutional and government clients.

JPMorgan Chase’s principal bank subsidiary is JPMorgan Chase Bank, National Association (“JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.”), a national banking association with U.S. branches in 38 states and Washington, D.C. as of December 31, 2019. JPMorgan Chase’s principal nonbank subsidiary is J.P. Morgan Securities LLC (“J.P. Morgan Securities”), a U.S. broker-dealer. The bank and non-bank subsidiaries of JPMorgan Chase operate nationally as well as through overseas branches and subsidiaries, representative offices and subsidiary foreign banks. The Firm’s principal operating subsidiary outside the U.S. is J.P. Morgan Securities plc, a U.K.-based subsidiary of JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.

The Firm’s website is www.jpmorganchase.com. JPMorgan Chase makes available on its website, free of charge, annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K pursuant to Section 13(a) or Section 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as soon as reasonably practicable after it electronically files or furnishes such material to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) at www.sec.gov. The Firm has adopted, and posted on its website, a Code of Conduct for all employees of the Firm and a Code of Ethics for its Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Principal Accounting Officer and all other professionals of the Firm worldwide serving in a finance, accounting, treasury, tax or investor relations role.

Business segments

For management reporting purposes, JPMorgan Chase’s activities are organized into four major reportable business segments, as well as a Corporate

segment. The Firm’s consumer business is the Consumer & Community Banking (“CCB”) segment. The Firm’s wholesale business segments are the Corporate & Investment Bank (“CIB”), Commercial Banking (“CB”), and Asset & Wealth Management (“AWM”).

A description of the Firm’s business segments and the products and services they provide to their respective client bases is provided in the “Business segment results” section of Management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (“Management’s

discussion and analysis” or “MD&A”), beginning on page


and in Note


.

Competition

JPMorgan Chase and its subsidiaries and affiliates operate in highly competitive environments. Competitors include other banks, brokerage firms, investment banking companies, merchant banks, hedge funds, commodity trading companies, private equity firms, insurance companies, mutual fund companies, investment managers, credit card companies, mortgage banking companies, trust companies, securities processing companies, automobile financing companies, leasing companies, e-commerce and other internet-based companies, financial technology companies, and other companies engaged in providing similar products and services. The Firm’s businesses generally compete on the basis of the quality and variety of the Firm’s products and services, transaction execution, innovation, reputation and price. Competition also varies based on the types of clients, customers, industries and geographies served. With respect to some of its geographies and products, JPMorgan Chase competes globally; with respect to others, the Firm competes on a national or regional basis.

Competition in the financial services industry continues to be intense. In some cases, the Firm’s businesses compete with other financial institutions that may have a stronger local presence in certain geographies or that operate under different rules and regulatory regimes than the Firm, and with companies that provide new or innovative products or services, including those that the Firm does not provide.

Supervision and regulation

The Firm is subject to extensive and comprehensive regulation under U.S. federal and state laws, as well as the applicable laws of the jurisdictions outside the U.S. in which the Firm does business.

Financial holding company:

Consolidated supervision

. JPMorgan Chase & Co. is a bank holding company (“BHC”) and a financial holding company (“FHC”) under U.S. federal law, and is subject to comprehensive consolidated supervision, regulation and examination by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the “Federal Reserve”). The Federal Reserve acts as an “umbrella regulator,” and certain of JPMorgan Chase’s subsidiaries are also regulated directly by additional authorities based on the activities of those subsidiaries.

JPMorgan Chase’s national bank subsidiary, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., is supervised and regulated by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (“OCC”) and, with respect to certain matters, by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the “FDIC”).

JPMorgan Chase’s U.S. broker-dealers are supervised and regulated by the Securities and Exchange Commission


Part I

(“SEC”) and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (“FINRA”), and subsidiaries of the Firm that engage in certain futures-related and swaps-related activities are supervised and regulated by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (“CFTC”). J.P. Morgan Securities plc is a U.K.-based bank regulated by the U.K. Prudential Regulation Authority (the “PRA”) and the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority (“FCA”).

The Firm’s other non-U.S. subsidiaries are regulated by the banking, securities, prudential and conduct regulatory authorities in the countries in which they operate.

Permissible business activities

. The Bank Holding Company Act restricts BHCs from engaging in business activities other than the business of banking and certain closely-related activities. FHCs can engage in a broader range of financial activities, including underwriting, dealing and making markets in securities, and making merchant banking investments in non-financial companies. The Federal Reserve has the authority to limit an FHC’s ability to conduct otherwise permissible activities if the FHC or any of its depository institution subsidiaries ceases to meet applicable eligibility requirements. The Federal Reserve may also impose corrective capital and/or managerial requirements on the FHC, and if deficiencies are persistent, may require divestiture of the FHC’s depository institutions. If any depository institution controlled by an FHC fails to maintain a satisfactory rating under the Community Reinvestment Act, the Federal Reserve must prohibit the FHC and its subsidiaries from engaging in any activities other than those permissible for BHCs.

Capital and liquidity requirements

. The Federal Reserve establishes capital, liquidity and leverage requirements for JPMorgan Chase and evaluates the Firm’s compliance with those requirements. The OCC establishes similar requirements for JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. Banking supervisors globally continue to refine and enhance the Basel III capital framework for financial institutions.

In January 2019, the Basel Committee issued “Minimum capital requirements for market risk,” which supersedes a previous release from January 2016. The Basel Committee expects national regulators to implement these revised market risk requirements for banking organizations in their jurisdictions by January 1, 2022, in line with the other elements of the Basel III Reforms.

U.S. banking regulators have announced their support for the issuance of the Basel III Reforms and are considering how to appropriately apply such reforms in the U.S. Any changes to U.S. capital rules based on the Basel III Reforms would first be proposed for public comment. In 2018, the Federal Reserve and the OCC released a proposal to revise the enhanced supplementary leverage ratio (“eSLR”) requirements applicable to the U.S. global systemically important banks (“GSIBs”) and their insured depository institutions (“IDIs”) and to make conforming changes to the rules which are applicable to U.S. GSIBs relating to total loss-absorbing capacity (“TLAC”) and external long-term

debt that must satisfy certain eligibility criteria. Final requirements have not yet been issued. In November 2019, the U.S. banking regulators adopted a rule implementing “Standardized Approach for Counterparty Credit Risk” (“SA-CCR”), which will be effective in April 2020 and which has a mandatory compliance date of January 1, 2022.

Under Basel III, bank holding companies and banks are required to measure their liquidity against two specific liquidity tests: the liquidity coverage ratio (“LCR”) and the net stable funding ratio (“NSFR”).  In 2016, the U.S. banking regulators issued a proposed rule for NSFR, but no final rule has been issued.

Stress tests

. As a large BHC, JPMorgan Chase is subject to supervisory stress testing administered by the Federal Reserve as part of the Federal Reserve’s annual Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (“CCAR”) framework. The Firm must conduct annual company-run stress tests and must also submit an annual capital plan to the Federal Reserve, taking into account the results of separate stress tests designed by the Firm and the Federal Reserve. The Firm is required to receive a notice of non-objection from the Federal Reserve each year before taking capital actions, such as paying dividends, implementing common equity repurchase programs or redeeming or repurchasing capital instruments. The OCC requires JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. to perform separate, similar stress tests annually. The Firm publishes each year the results of the annual stress tests for the Firm and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. under the supervisory “severely adverse” scenarios provided by the Federal Reserve and the OCC. The Firm is required to file its 2020 annual CCAR submission on April 6, 2020. Results will be published by the Federal Reserve by June 30, 2020, with disclosures of results by BHCs, including the Firm, to follow within 15 days.

In April 2018, the Federal Reserve proposed the introduction of a stress buffer framework that would create a single, integrated set of capital requirements by combining the supervisory stress test results of the CCAR assessment and those under the Dodd-Frank Act with current point-in-time capital requirements. In December 2019, the Federal Reserve indicated that it intends to have the stress buffer framework in place for the 2020 stress tests. Final requirements have not yet been issued.

Refer to Capital Risk Management on

pages 85–92

for more information concerning the Firm’s CCAR.

Enhanced prudential standards

. As part of its mandate to identify and monitor risks to the financial stability of the U.S. posed by large banking organizations, the Financial Stability Oversight Council (“FSOC”) recommends prudential standards and reporting requirements to the Federal Reserve for systemically important financial institutions (“SIFIs”), such as JPMorgan Chase. The Federal Reserve has adopted several rules to implement those heightened


prudential standards, including rules relating to risk management and corporate governance of subject BHCs. Large BHCs such as JPMorgan Chase are required to comply with enhanced liquidity and overall risk management standards, including oversight by the board of directors of risk management activities.

Resolution and recovery

. The Firm is required to submit periodically to the Federal Reserve and the FDIC a plan for resolution under Title I of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (“Dodd-Frank Act”) in the event of material distress or failure (a “resolution plan”). On December 17, 2019, the Firm received feedback from the Federal Reserve and FDIC on its 2019 resolution plan that set forth certain expectations for further enhancement of the Firm’s resolution capabilities and provided initial expectations for the Firm’s next resolution plan, but did not identify shortcomings or deficiencies. In the future, the Firm’s resolution plan submissions will alternate between “targeted” and “full” plans, with the Firm’s next “targeted” resolution plan due to be filed on or before July 1, 2021. The Firm also has a comprehensive recovery plan summarizing the actions it would take to avoid failure by remaining well-capitalized and well-funded in the case of an adverse event.

JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. is also required to provide a resolution plan to the FDIC. The FDIC has proposed changes to its rules relating to the resolution plans of IDIs in an advanced notice of proposed rulemaking. The OCC has published guidelines establishing standards for recovery planning by insured national banks, and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. has submitted its recovery plan to the OCC.

Certain of the Firm’s non-U.S. subsidiaries are also subject to local resolution and recovery planning requirements.

Orderly liquidation authority

. Certain financial companies, including JPMorgan Chase and certain of its subsidiaries, can also be subjected to resolution under an “orderly liquidation authority.” The U.S. Treasury Secretary, in consultation with the President of the United States, must first make certain determinations concerning extraordinary financial distress and systemic risk, and action must be recommended by the FDIC and the Federal Reserve. Absent such actions, the Firm, as a BHC, would remain subject to resolution under the Bankruptcy Code. The FDIC has issued a draft policy statement describing its “single point of entry” strategy for resolution of SIFIs under the orderly liquidation authority, which seeks to keep operating subsidiaries of a BHC open and impose losses on shareholders and creditors of the BHC in receivership according to their statutory order of priority.

Holding company as a source of strength.

JPMorgan Chase & Co. is required to serve as a source of financial strength for its depository institution subsidiaries and to commit resources to support those subsidiaries, including when directed to do so by the Federal Reserve.

Regulation of acquisitions

. Acquisitions by BHCs and their banks are subject to multiple requirements established by the Federal Reserve and the OCC. For example, FHCs and BHCs are required to obtain the approval of the Federal Reserve before they may acquire more than 5% of the voting shares of an unaffiliated bank. In addition, acquisitions by financial companies are prohibited if, as a result of the acquisition, the total liabilities of the financial company would exceed 10% of the total liabilities of all financial companies. Furthermore, for certain acquisitions, the Firm must provide written notice to the Federal Reserve prior to acquiring direct or indirect ownership or control of any voting shares of any company with over $10 billion in assets that is engaged in activities that are “financial in nature.”

Volcker Rule

. The Volcker Rule prohibits banking entities, including the Firm, from engaging in certain “proprietary trading” activities, subject to exceptions for underwriting, market-making, risk-mitigating hedging and certain other activities. The Volcker Rule also limits the sponsorship of, and investment in, “covered funds,” and imposes limits on certain transactions between the Firm and covered funds for which a JPMorgan Chase entity serves as the investment manager, investment advisor, commodity trading advisor or sponsor, as well as certain covered funds controlled by such funds. The Volcker Rule requires banking entities to establish comprehensive compliance programs reasonably designed to help ensure and monitor compliance with the restrictions under the Volcker Rule. In August 2019, the

Federal Reserve and other regulatory agencies finalized

revisions to the proprietary trading restrictions of the

Volcker Rule, including simplifications to the Volcker Rule’s framework for demonstrating compliance with the

permitted activities under the rule. On January 30, 2020, the agencies proposed revisions to the Volcker Rule’s provisions relating to covered funds that would streamline the existing exclusion for non-U.S. public funds and introduce new exclusions for new classes of funds and from existing prohibitions on engaging in “covered transactions” with covered funds.

Consent orders

. The Firm remains subject to consent orders entered into with its banking regulators between 2014 and 2016 concerning foreign exchange trading and referral hiring practices.

Subsidiary banks:

The activities of JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., the Firm’s principal subsidiary bank, are limited to those specifically authorized under the National Bank Act and related interpretations of the OCC. The OCC has authority to bring an enforcement action against JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. for unsafe or unsound banking practices, which could include limiting JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.’s ability to conduct otherwise permissible activities, or imposing corrective capital and/or managerial requirements on the bank.


Part I

FDIC deposit insurance.

The

FDIC

deposit insurance fund provides insurance coverage for certain deposits and is funded through assessments on banks, such as JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.

FDIC powers upon a bank insolvency.

Upon the insolvency of an

IDI, such as JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.,

the FDIC could be appointed as conservator or receiver under the Federal Deposit Insurance Act. The FDIC has broad powers to transfer assets and liabilities without the approval of the institution’s creditors.

Prompt corrective action.

The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 requires the relevant federal banking regulator to take “prompt corrective action” with respect to a depository institution if that institution does not meet certain capital adequacy standards. Although these regulations apply only to banks, such as JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.

, the Federal Reserve is authorized to take appropriate action against the parent

BHC

, such as JPMorgan Chase & Co., based on the undercapitalized status of any bank subsidiary. In certain instances, the BHC would be required to guarantee the performance of the capital restoration plan for its undercapitalized subsidiary.

OCC Heightened Standards.

The OCC has established guidelines setting forth heightened standards for large banks, including minimum standards for the design and implementation of a risk governance framework for banks. Under these standards, a bank’s risk governance framework must ensure that the bank’s risk profile is easily distinguished and separate from that of its parent BHC for risk management purposes. The bank’s board or risk committee is responsible for approving the bank’s risk governance framework, providing active oversight of the bank’s risk-taking activities, and holding management accountable for adhering to the risk governance framework.

Restrictions on transactions with affiliates.

JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and its subsidiaries

are subject to restrictions imposed by federal law on extensions of credit to, investments in stock or securities of, and derivatives, securities lending and certain other transactions with, JPMorgan Chase & Co. and certain other affiliates. These restrictions prevent JPMorgan Chase & Co. and other affiliates from borrowing from such subsidiaries unless the loans are secured in specified amounts and comply with certain other requirements.

Dividend restrictions.

Federal law imposes limitations on the payment of dividends by national banks, such as JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. Refer to Note


for the amount of dividends that JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. could pay, at January 1, 2020, to JPMorgan Chase without the approval of the banking regulators. The OCC and the Federal Reserve also have authority to prohibit or limit the payment of dividends of a bank subsidiary that they supervise if, in the banking regulator’s opinion, payment of a dividend would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice in light of the financial condition of the bank.

Depositor preference.

Under federal law, the claims of a receiver of an IDI for administrative expense and the claims of holders of U.S. deposit liabilities (including the FDIC and deposits in non-U.S. branches that are dually payable in the U.S. and in a non-U.S. branch) have priority over the claims of other unsecured creditors of the institution, including depositors in non-U.S. branches and public noteholders.

Consumer supervision and regulation.

JPMorgan Chase and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. are subject to supervision and regulation by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (“CFPB”) with respect to federal consumer protection laws, including laws relating to fair lending and the prohibition of unfair, deceptive or abusive acts or practices in connection with the offer, sale or provision of consumer financial products and services. The CFPB also has jurisdiction over small business lending activities with respect to fair lending and the Equal Credit Opportunity Act. As part of its regulatory oversight, the CFPB has authority to take enforcement actions against firms that offer certain products and services to consumers using practices that are deemed to be unfair, deceptive or abusive. The Firm’s consumer activities are also subject to regulation under state statutes which are enforced by the Attorney General or empowered agency of each state.

Securities and broker-dealer regulation:

The Firm conducts securities underwriting, dealing and brokerage activities in the U.S. through J.P. Morgan Securities LLC and other non-bank broker-dealer subsidiaries, all of which are subject to regulations of the SEC, FINRA and the New York Stock Exchange, among others. The Firm conducts similar securities activities outside the U.S. subject to local regulatory requirements. In the U.K., those activities are conducted by J.P. Morgan Securities plc. Broker-dealers are subject to laws and

regulations covering all aspects of the securities business, including sales and trading practices, securities offerings, publication of research reports, use of customer funds, the financing of client purchases, capital structure, record-keeping and retention, and the conduct of their directors, officers and employees. Refer to Broker-dealer regulatory capital on

page 92

for information concerning the capital of J.P. Morgan Securities LLC and J.P. Morgan Securities plc.

Investment management regulation:

The Firm’s asset and wealth management businesses are subject to significant regulation in jurisdictions around the world relating to, among other things, the safeguarding and management of client assets, offerings of funds and marketing activities. Certain of the Firm’s subsidiaries are registered with, and subject to oversight by, the SEC as investment advisers. The Firm’s registered investment advisers are subject to the fiduciary and other obligations imposed under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as well as various state securities laws. The Firm’s fiduciary activities are also subject to supervision by the OCC.

The Firm’s asset and wealth management businesses continue to be affected by ongoing rule-making and


implementation of new regulations, including the SEC’s Regulation Best Interest, which becomes operative on June 30, 2020, and rules proposed or adopted by certain U.S. states relating to enhanced standards of conduct for broker-dealers and certain other market participants.

Derivatives regulation:

The Firm is subject to comprehensive regulation of its derivatives businesses, including regulations that impose capital and margin requirements, require central clearing of standardized over-the-counter (“OTC”) derivatives, mandate that certain standardized over-the-counter swaps be traded on regulated trading venues, and provide for reporting of certain mandated information. In accordance with requirements under the Dodd-Frank Act, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., J.P. Morgan Securities LLC and J.P. Morgan Securities plc have registered with the CFTC as “swap dealers” and may be required to register with the SEC as “security-based swap dealers.” As a result, these entities are or will be subject to a comprehensive regulatory framework applicable to their swap or security-based swap activities, including capital requirements, rules requiring the collateralization of uncleared swaps and security-based swaps, rules regarding segregation of counterparty collateral, business conduct and documentation standards, record-keeping and reporting obligations, and anti-fraud and anti-manipulation requirements. In the European Union (“EU”), the implementation of the European Market Infrastructure Regulation (“EMIR”) and substantial revisions to the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (“MiFID II”) has resulted in comparable, but not identical, changes to the European regulatory regime for derivatives.

The Firm and other derivatives market participants have agreed to adhere to several protocols developed by the International Swaps and Derivatives Association (“ISDA”) in response to regulator concerns that the close-out of derivatives and other financial transactions during the resolution of a large cross-border financial institution could impede resolution efforts and potentially destabilize markets. These protocols provide for the contractual recognition of cross-border stays under various statutory resolution regimes and, in the case of certain of the protocols, a contractual stay on certain cross-default rights.

J.P. Morgan Securities LLC is registered with the CFTC as a futures commission merchant, and is a member of the National Futures Association.

Data and cyber regulation:

The Firm and its subsidiaries are subject to numerous U.S. federal and state as well as international laws and regulations concerning the collection, use, confidentiality, disclosure, transfer, protection and handling of information, including personal information of individuals and confidential information (including the EU General Data Protection Regulation), as well as the management of internal and external threats and vulnerabilities to protect information assets and the supporting infrastructure from cyberattacks. These laws and regulations are evolving at a rapid pace, remain a focus of regulators globally and will

continue to have a significant impact on all of the Firm’s businesses.

The Bank Secrecy Act and Economic Sanctions:

The Bank Secrecy Act (“BSA”) requires all financial institutions, including banks and securities broker-dealers, to establish a risk-based system of internal controls reasonably designed to prevent money laundering and the financing of terrorism. The BSA includes a variety of record-keeping and reporting requirements, as well as due diligence/know-your-customer documentation requirements. The Firm is also subject to the regulations and economic sanctions programs administered by the U.S. Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (“OFAC”). In addition, the EU has adopted various economic sanctions programs targeted at entities or individuals that are, or are located in countries that are, involved in terrorism, hostilities, embezzlement or human rights violations.

Anti-Corruption:

The Firm is subject to laws and regulations relating to corrupt and illegal payments to government officials and others in the jurisdictions in which it operates, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the U.K. Bribery Act.

Compensation practices:

The Firm’s compensation practices are subject to oversight by the Federal Reserve, as well as other agencies. The Federal Reserve has issued guidance jointly with the FDIC and the OCC that is designed to ensure that incentive compensation paid by banking organizations does not encourage imprudent risk-taking that threatens the organizations’ safety and soundness. The Financial Stability Board (“FSB”) has also established standards covering compensation principles for banks. The Firm’s compensation practices are also subject to regulation and oversight by regulators in other jurisdictions, notably the EU Fourth Capital Requirements Directive (“CRD IV”), which includes compensation-related provisions. The European Banking Authority has instituted guidelines on compensation policies which in certain countries, such as the U.K., are implemented or supplemented by local regulations or guidelines. The Firm expects that the implementation of regulatory guidelines regarding compensation in the U.S. and other countries will continue to evolve, and may affect the manner in which the Firm structures its compensation programs and practices.

Other significant international regulatory initiatives:

The EU continues to implement an extensive and complex program of regulatory enhancement. Amendments to EMIR, known as “EMIR REFIT,” entered into force during 2019 and made targeted changes to EMIR to make the rules more streamlined and proportionate. While most of the changes already apply, some will take effect in 2020 and 2021. This will include a new requirement for clearing firms to provide clearing services on “fair, reasonable, non-discriminatory and transparent commercial terms” as well as changes to the EMIR reporting rules.


Part I

The European Commission (“EC”) has begun its review of MiFID II, which will continue into 2020, with the EC expected to publish a legislative proposal for changes to MiFID II. MiFID II, which became effective in 2018, requires the trading of shares and certain OTC derivatives to take place on trading venues, and also significantly enhanced requirements for pre- and post-trade transparency, transaction reporting and investor protection, and introduced position limits and a reporting regime for commodities. The extent of the changes that will be proposed under the MiFID II review is not known.

The EU capital and liquidity legislation for banks and investment firms implemented many of the finalized Basel III capital and liquidity standards, including in relation to the leverage ratio, market risk capital, and a net stable funding ratio. These changes will begin to take effect from June 2021. The final EU legislation also includes a requirement for certain non-EU banks operating in the EU to establish an intermediate parent undertaking (“IPU”) located in the EU. The IPU rule will allow a second IPU to be established if a single IPU would conflict with “home country” bank separation rules or impede resolvability.

The EU has also proposed or implemented significant revisions to laws covering securities settlement, mutual funds and pensions, payments, anti-money laundering controls, data security and privacy, transparency and disclosure of securities financing transactions, benchmarks, and resolution of banks, investment firms and market infrastructures, such as central counterparties.

Item 1A. Risk Factors.

The following discussion sets forth the material risk factors that could affect JPMorgan Chase’s financial condition and operations. Readers should not consider any descriptions of these factors to be a complete set of all potential risks that could affect the Firm. Any of the risk factors discussed below could by itself, or combined with other factors, materially and adversely affect JPMorgan Chase’s business, results of operations, financial condition, capital position, liquidity, competitive position or reputation, including by materially increasing expenses or decreasing revenues, which could result in material losses or a decrease in earnings.

Regulatory

JPMorgan Chase’s businesses are highly regulated, and the laws and regulations that apply to JPMorgan Chase have a significant impact on its business and operations.

JPMorgan Chase is a financial services firm with operations worldwide. JPMorgan Chase must comply with the laws, rules and regulations that apply to its operations in all of the jurisdictions around the world in which it does business. Regulation of financial services is extensive.

JPMorgan Chase has experienced an extended period of significant change in laws and regulations affecting the financial services industry, both within and outside the U.S. The supervision of financial services firms also expanded

significantly. The increased regulation and supervision of JPMorgan Chase has affected the way that it conducts its business and structures its operations. Existing and new laws and regulations and expanded supervision could require JPMorgan Chase to make further changes to its business and operations. These changes could result in JPMorgan Chase incurring additional costs for complying with laws and regulations and could reduce its profitability. For example, existing and new laws and regulations have in the past and could in the future require JPMorgan Chase to:

•

limit the products and services that it offers

•

reduce the liquidity that it can provide through its market-making activities

•

stop or discourage it from engaging in business opportunities that it might otherwise pursue

•

recognize losses in the value of assets that it holds

•

pay higher taxes, assessments, levies or other governmental charges, including in connection with the resolution of tax examinations

•

dispose of certain assets, and do so at times or prices that are disadvantageous

•

impose restrictions on certain business activities, or

•

increase the prices that it charges for products and services, which could reduce the demand for them.

Differences in financial services regulation can be disadvantageous for JPMorgan Chase’s business.

The content and application of laws and regulations affecting financial services firms sometimes vary according to factors such as the size of the firm, the jurisdiction in which it is organized or operates, and other criteria. For example:

•

larger firms are often subject to more stringent supervision and regulation

•

financial technology companies and other non-traditional competitors may not be subject to banking regulation, or may be supervised by a national or state regulatory agency that does not have the same resources or regulatory priorities as the regulatory agencies which supervise more diversified financial services firms, or

•

the financial services regulatory framework in a particular jurisdiction may favor financial institutions that are based in that jurisdiction.

These differences in the regulatory framework can result in a firm such as JPMorgan Chase losing market share to competitors that are less regulated or not subject to regulation, especially with respect to unregulated financial products.

There can also be significant differences in the ways that similar regulatory initiatives affecting the financial services industry are implemented in the U.S. and in other countries


and regions in which JPMorgan Chase does business. For example, when adopting rules that are intended to implement a global regulatory initiative or standard, a national regulator may introduce additional or more restrictive requirements, which can create competitive disadvantages for financial services firms, such as JPMorgan Chase, that may be subject to those enhanced regulations.

Legislative and regulatory initiatives outside the U.S. could require JPMorgan Chase to make significant modifications to its operations and legal entity structure in the relevant countries or regions in order to comply with those requirements. These include laws and regulations that have been adopted or proposed relating to:

•

the resolution of financial institutions

•

the establishment of locally-based intermediate holding companies or operating subsidiaries

•

requirements to maintain minimum amounts of capital or liquidity in locally-based subsidiaries

•

the separation (or “ring fencing”) of core banking products and services from markets activities

•

requirements for executing or settling transactions on exchanges or through central counterparties (“CCPs”)

•

position limits and reporting rules for derivatives

•

governance and accountability regimes

•

conduct of business requirements, and

•

restrictions on compensation.

These types of differences in financial services regulation, or inconsistencies or conflicts between laws and regulations between different jurisdictions, could require JPMorgan Chase to:

•

divest assets or restructure its operations

•

absorb increased operational, capital and liquidity costs

•

change the prices that it charges for its products and services

•

curtail the products and services that it offers to its customers and clients, or

•

incur higher costs for complying with different legal and regulatory frameworks.

Any or all of these factors could harm JPMorgan Chase’s ability to compete against other firms that are not subject to the same laws and regulations or supervisory oversight, or harm JPMorgan Chase’s businesses, results of operations and profitability.

Heightened regulatory scrutiny of JPMorgan Chase’s businesses has increased its compliance costs and could result in restrictions on its operations.

JPMorgan Chase’s operations are subject to heightened oversight and scrutiny from regulatory authorities in many jurisdictions where JPMorgan Chase does business. JPMorgan Chase has paid significant fines, provided other monetary relief, incurred other penalties and experienced other repercussions in connection with resolving several investigations and enforcement actions by governmental agencies. JPMorgan Chase could become subject to similar regulatory resolutions or other actions in the future, and addressing the requirements of any such resolutions or actions could result in JPMorgan Chase incurring higher operational and compliance costs or needing to comply with other restrictions.

In connection with resolving specific regulatory investigations or enforcement actions, certain regulators have required JPMorgan Chase and other financial institutions to admit wrongdoing with respect to the activities that gave rise to the resolution. These types of admissions can lead to:

•

greater exposure in civil litigation

•

damage to reputation

•

disqualification from doing business with certain clients or customers, or in specific jurisdictions, or

•

other direct and indirect adverse effects.

Furthermore, U.S. government officials have demonstrated a willingness to bring criminal actions against financial institutions and have demanded that institutions plead guilty to criminal offenses or admit other wrongdoing in connection with resolving regulatory investigations or enforcement actions. Resolutions of this type can have significant collateral consequences for the subject financial institution, including:

•

loss of clients, customers and business

•

restrictions on offering certain products or services, and

•

losing permission to operate certain businesses, either temporarily or permanently.

JPMorgan Chase expects that it and other financial services firms will continue to be subject to heightened regulatory scrutiny and governmental investigations and enforcement actions. JPMorgan Chase also expects that regulators will continue to insist that financial institutions be penalized for actual or deemed violations of law with formal and punitive enforcement actions, including the imposition of significant monetary and other sanctions, rather than resolving these matters through informal supervisory actions. Furthermore, if JPMorgan Chase fails to meet the requirements of any resolution of a governmental investigation or enforcement action, or to maintain risk and control processes that meet


Part I

the heightened standards established by its regulators, it could be required to:

•

enter into further resolutions of investigations or enforcement actions

•

pay additional regulatory fines, penalties or judgments, or

•

accept material regulatory restrictions on, or changes in the management of, its businesses.

In these circumstances, JPMorgan Chase could also become subject to other sanctions, or to prosecution or civil litigation with respect to the conduct that gave rise to an investigation or enforcement action.

Complying with economic sanctions and anti-corruption and anti-money laundering laws and regulations can increase JPMorgan Chase’s operational and compliance costs and risks.

JPMorgan Chase must comply with economic sanctions and embargo programs administered by the Office of Foreign Assets Control (“OFAC”) and similar national and multi-national bodies and governmental agencies outside the U.S., as well as anti-corruption and anti-money laundering laws and regulations throughout the world. JPMorgan Chase can incur higher costs and face greater compliance risks in structuring and operating its businesses to comply with these requirements. Furthermore, a violation of a sanction or embargo program or anti-corruption or anti-money laundering laws and regulations could subject JPMorgan Chase, and individual employees, to regulatory enforcement actions as well as significant civil and criminal penalties.

JPMorgan Chase’s operations can be constrained in countries with less predictable legal and regulatory frameworks.

If the legal and regulatory system in a particular country is less predictable, this can create a more difficult environment in which to conduct business. For example, any of the following could hamper JPMorgan Chase’s operations and reduce its earnings in these types of countries:

•

the absence of a statutory or regulatory basis or guidance for engaging in specific types of business or transactions

•

conflicting or ambiguous laws and regulations, or the inconsistent application or interpretation of existing laws and regulations

•

uncertainty concerning the enforceability of contractual, intellectual property or other obligations

•

difficulty in competing in economies in which the government controls or protects all or a portion of the local economy or specific businesses, or where graft or corruption may be pervasive, and

•

the threat of arbitrary regulatory investigations, civil litigations or criminal prosecutions, the termination of licenses required to operate in the local market or the

suspension of business relationships with governmental bodies.

Conducting business in countries with less predictable legal and regulatory regimes could require JPMorgan Chase to devote significant additional resources to understanding, and monitoring changes in, local laws and regulations, as well as structuring its operations to comply with local laws and regulations and implementing and administering related internal policies and procedures.

There can be no assurance that JPMorgan Chase will always be successful in its efforts to fully understand and to conduct its business in compliance with the laws and regulations of all of the jurisdictions in which it operates, and the risk of non-compliance can be greater in countries that have less predictable legal and regulatory systems.

Requirements for the orderly resolution of JPMorgan Chase could result in JPMorgan Chase having to restructure or reorganize its businesses.

JPMorgan Chase is required under Federal Reserve and FDIC rules to prepare and submit periodically to those agencies a detailed plan for rapid and orderly resolution in bankruptcy, without extraordinary government support, in the event of material financial distress or failure. The agencies’ evaluation of JPMorgan Chase’s resolution plan may change, and the requirements for resolution plans may be modified from time to time. Any such determinations or modifications could result in JPMorgan Chase needing to make changes to its legal entity structure or to certain internal or external activities, which could increase its funding or operational costs, or hamper its ability to serve clients and customers.

If the Federal Reserve and the FDIC were to determine that a resolution plan submitted by JPMorgan Chase has deficiencies, they could jointly impose more stringent capital, leverage or liquidity requirements or restrictions on JPMorgan Chase’s growth, activities or operations. After two years, if the deficiencies are not cured, the agencies could also require that JPMorgan Chase restructure, reorganize or divest assets or businesses in ways that could materially and adversely affect JPMorgan Chase’s operations and strategy.

Holders of JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s debt and equity securities will absorb losses if it were to enter into a resolution.

Federal Reserve rules require that JPMorgan Chase & Co. (the “Parent Company”)

maintain minimum levels of unsecured external long-term debt and other loss-absorbing capacity with specific terms (“eligible LTD”) for purposes of recapitalizing JPMorgan Chase’s operating subsidiaries if the Parent Company were to enter into a resolution either:

•

in a bankruptcy proceeding under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, or

•

in a receivership administered by the FDIC under Title II of the Dodd-Frank Act (“Title II”).


If the Parent Company were to enter into a resolution, holders of eligible LTD and other debt and equity securities of the Parent Company will absorb the losses of the Parent Company and its subsidiaries.

The preferred “single point of entry” strategy under JPMorgan Chase’s resolution plan contemplates that only the Parent Company would enter bankruptcy proceedings.

JPMorgan Chase’s subsidiaries would be recapitalized, as needed, so that they could continue normal operations or subsequently be divested or wound down in an orderly manner. As a result, the Parent Company’s losses and any losses incurred by its subsidiaries would be imposed first on holders of the Parent Company’s equity securities and thereafter on its unsecured creditors, including holders of eligible LTD and other debt securities. Claims of holders of those securities would have a junior position to the claims of creditors of JPMorgan Chase’s subsidiaries and to the claims of priority (as determined by statute) and secured creditors of the Parent Company.

Accordingly, in a resolution of the Parent Company in bankruptcy, holders of eligible LTD and other debt securities of the Parent Company would realize value only to the extent available to the Parent Company as a shareholder of JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and its other subsidiaries, and only after any claims of priority and secured creditors of the Parent Company have been fully repaid.

The FDIC has similarly indicated that a single point of entry recapitalization model could be a desirable strategy to resolve a systemically important financial institution, such as the Parent Company, under Title II. However, the FDIC has not formally adopted a single point of entry resolution strategy.

If the Parent Company were to approach, or enter into, a resolution, none of the Parent Company, the Federal Reserve or the FDIC is obligated to follow JPMorgan Chase’s preferred strategy, and losses to holders of eligible LTD and other debt and equity securities of the Parent Company, under whatever strategy is ultimately followed, could be greater than they might have been under JPMorgan Chase’s preferred strategy.

Political

The departure of the U.K. from the EU could negatively affect JPMorgan Chase’s business, results of operations and operating model.

It remains highly uncertain how the departure of the U.K. from the EU, which is commonly referred to as “Brexit,” will affect financial services firms such as JPMorgan Chase that conduct substantial operations in the EU from legal entities that are organized in or operating from the U.K. It is possible that the transition period following the U.K.’s departure from the EU on January 31, 2020 will expire on December 31, 2020 without any agreement having been reached between the U.K. and the EU concerning whether or to what extent U.K.-based firms may conduct financial services activities within the EU. It is also possible that any

agreement reached between the U.K. and the EU may, depending on the final outcome of the ongoing negotiations and related legislative developments:

•

impede the ability of U.K.-based financial services firms to conduct business in the EU

•

fail to address significant unresolved issues relating to the cross-border conduct of financial services activities, or

•

apply only temporarily.

JPMorgan Chase has been making appropriate modifications to its legal entity structure and operations in the EU, the locations in which it operates and the staffing in those locations to address the departure of the U.K. from the EU. If the U.K. and the EU fail to reach an agreement on their future relationship before the end of the transition period or if any other outcome persists that does not assure ongoing access for U.K.-based financial services firms to the EU market, the types of structural and operational changes that JPMorgan Chase is in the process of making to its European operations may result in JPMorgan Chase having to sustain a more fragmented operating model across its U.K., EU and other operating entities. Due to considerations such as operating expenses, liquidity, leverage and capital, the modified European operating framework will be more complex, less efficient and more costly than would otherwise have been the case.

A disorderly withdrawal of the U.K. from the EU, or unexpected consequences of the withdrawal, could have significant and immediate destabilizing effects on economic and market conditions in the region and globally. In particular, cross-border financial services activities could be severely disrupted depending on circumstances that may exist following the withdrawal, including:

•

the possibility that financial institutions, their clients and counterparties, and other market participants may not be positioned to continue to do business through EU-based legal entities

•

reduction or fragmentation of market liquidity that may be caused if significant market participants (including trading venues and CCPs) that are currently based in the U.K. have not completed arrangements to conduct operations from the EU either in the near term or, if authorized to continue to operate from the U.K. on a transitional basis, after any transitional or temporary relief has expired

•

uncertainties concerning the application and interpretation of laws and regulations relating to cross-border financial services activities

•

inability to engage in certain financial services activities through EU-based legal entities to the extent that licenses or temporary permission to engage in such activities have not been granted timely by local regulators


Part I

•

unexpected or unfavorable changes in laws and regulations, governmental policies or public sentiment, and

•

losses due to process errors or incorrect judgments concerning economic, political or regulatory developments.

Any or all of the above factors could have an adverse effect on the overall operation of the European financial services market as well as JPMorgan Chase’s business, operations and earnings in the U.K., the EU and globally.

Economic uncertainty or instability caused by political developments can hurt JPMorgan Chase’s businesses.

The economic environment and market conditions in which JPMorgan Chase operates continue to be uncertain due to political developments in the U.S. and other countries. Certain monetary, fiscal and other policy initiatives and proposals could cause a contraction in U.S. and global economic growth and higher volatility in the financial markets, including:

•

monetary and fiscal policies and actions taken by the Federal Reserve and other central banks or governmental authorities, including any suspension or reversal of large-scale asset purchases

•

inability to reach political consensus to keep the U.S. government open

•

isolationist foreign policies

•

the implementation of tariffs and other protectionist trade policies

•

political pressure on monetary policy decisions of central banks, or

•

the possible withdrawal or reduction of government support for the Federal National Mortgage Association and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (together, the “U.S. GSEs”).

These types of political developments, and uncertainty about the possible outcomes of these developments, could:

•

erode investor confidence in the U.S. economy and financial markets, which could potentially undermine the status of the U.S. dollar as a safe haven currency

•

provoke retaliatory countermeasures by other countries and otherwise heighten tensions in diplomatic relations

•

increase concerns about whether the U.S. government will be funded, and its outstanding debt serviced, at any particular time, and

•

result in periodic shutdowns of the U.S. government or governments in other countries.

These factors could lead to:

•

slower growth rates, rising inflation or recession

•

greater market volatility

•

a contraction of available credit and the widening of credit spreads

•

diminished investor and consumer confidence

•

lower investment growth

•

large-scale sales of government debt and other debt and equity securities in the U.S. and other countries

•

reduced commercial activity among trading partners

•

the potential for a currency redenomination by a particular country

•

the possible departure of a country from, or the dissolution of, a political or economic alliance or treaty

•

potential expropriation or nationalization of assets

•

other market dislocations, including the spread of unfavorable economic conditions from a particular country or region to other countries or regions.

Any of these potential outcomes could cause JPMorgan Chase to suffer losses on its market-making positions or in its investment portfolio, reduce its liquidity and capital levels, hamper its ability to deliver products and services to its clients and customers, and weaken its results of operations and financial condition.

Market

Economic and market events and conditions can materially affect JPMorgan Chase’s businesses and investment and market-making positions.

JPMorgan Chase’s results of operations can be negatively affected by adverse changes in any of the following:

•

investor, consumer and business sentiment

•

events that reduce confidence in the financial markets

•

inflation or deflation

•

high unemployment or, conversely, a tightening labor market

•

the availability and cost of capital, liquidity and credit

•

levels and volatility of interest rates (including overnight repo rates), credit spreads and market prices for currencies, equities and commodities, and the duration of any changes in levels or volatility

•

the economic effects of outbreaks of hostilities, terrorism or other geopolitical instabilities, cyberattacks, climate change, natural disasters, severe weather conditions, health emergencies, the spread of infectious diseases or pandemics, and

•

the health of the U.S. and global economies.

All of these are affected by global economic, market and political events and conditions, as well as regulatory restrictions.


In addition, JPMorgan Chase’s investment portfolio and market-making businesses can suffer losses due to unanticipated market events, including:

•

severe declines in asset values

•

unexpected credit events

•

unforeseen events or conditions that may cause previously uncorrelated factors to become correlated (and vice versa)

•

the inability to effectively hedge market and other risks related to market-making position, or

•

other market risks that may not have been appropriately taken into account in the development, structuring or pricing of a financial instrument.

If JPMorgan Chase experiences significant losses in its investment portfolio or from market-making activities, this could reduce JPMorgan Chase’s profitability and its liquidity and capital levels, and thereby constrain the growth of its businesses.

JPMorgan Chase’s consumer businesses can be negatively affected by adverse economic conditions.

JPMorgan Chase’s consumer businesses are particularly affected by U.S. and global economic conditions, including:

•

interest rates

•

the rates of inflation and unemployment

•

housing prices

•

the level of consumer and small business confidence

•

changes in consumer spending or in the level of consumer debt, and

•

the number of personal bankruptcies.

A rapid increase in interest rates could negatively affect consumer credit performance to the extent that consumers are less able to service their debts. Sustained low growth, low or negative interest rates, inflationary pressures or recessionary conditions could diminish customer demand for the products and services offered by JPMorgan Chase’s consumer businesses. These conditions could also increase the cost to provide those products and services. Adverse economic conditions could also lead to an increase in delinquencies and higher net charge-offs, which can reduce JPMorgan Chase’s earnings. These consequences could be significantly worse in certain geographies where high levels of unemployment have resulted from declining industrial or manufacturing activity, or where high levels of consumer debt, such as outstanding student loans, impair the ability of customers to pay their other consumer loan obligations.

JPMorgan Chase’s earnings from its consumer businesses could also be adversely affected by governmental policies and actions that affect consumers, including:

•

policies and initiatives relating to medical insurance, education, immigration and employment status

•

the inability to reach political consensus to keep the U.S. government open and funded, and

•

policies aimed at the economy more broadly, such as infrastructure spending and global trade, which could result in higher inflation or reductions in consumer disposable income.

In addition, governmental proposals to permit student loan obligations to be discharged in bankruptcy proceedings could, if enacted into law, encourage certain of JPMorgan Chase’s customers to declare personal bankruptcy and thereby trigger defaults and charge-offs of credit card and other consumer loans extended to those customers.

Unfavorable market and economic conditions can have an adverse effect on JPMorgan Chase’s wholesale businesses.

In JPMorgan Chase’s wholesale businesses, market and economic factors can affect the volume of transactions that JPMorgan Chase executes for its clients or for which it advises clients, and, therefore, the revenue that JPMorgan Chase receives from those transactions. These factors can also influence the willingness of other financial institutions and investors to participate in capital markets transactions that JPMorgan Chase manages, such as loan syndications or securities underwritings. Furthermore, if a significant and sustained deterioration in market conditions were to occur, the profitability of JPMorgan Chase’s capital markets businesses, including its loan syndication, securities underwriting and leveraged lending activities, could be reduced to the extent that those businesses:

•

earn less fee revenue due to lower transaction volumes, including when clients are unwilling or unable to refinance their outstanding debt obligations in unfavorable market conditions, or

•

dispose of portions of credit commitments at a loss, or hold larger residual positions in credit commitments that cannot be sold at favorable prices.

An adverse change in market conditions in particular segments of the economy, such as a sudden and severe downturn in oil and gas prices or an increase in commodity prices, could have a material adverse effect on clients of JPMorgan Chase whose operations or financial condition are directly or indirectly dependent on the health or stability of those market segments, as well as clients that are engaged in related businesses. JPMorgan Chase could incur losses on its loans and other credit commitments to clients that operate in, or are dependent on, any sector of the economy that is under stress.

The fees that JPMorgan Chase earns from managing client assets or holding assets under custody for clients could be diminished by declining asset values or other adverse macroeconomic conditions. For example, higher interest rates or a downturn in financial markets could affect the valuations of client assets that JPMorgan Chase manages or holds under custody, which, in turn, could affect JPMorgan Chase’s revenue from fees that are based on the amount of assets under management or custody. Similarly, adverse


Part I

macroeconomic or market conditions could prompt outflows from JPMorgan Chase funds or accounts, or cause clients to invest in products that generate lower revenue. Substantial and unexpected withdrawals from a JPMorgan Chase fund can also hamper the investment performance of the fund, particularly if the outflows create the need for the fund to dispose of fund assets at disadvantageous times or prices, and could lead to further withdrawals based on the weaker investment performance.

An economic downturn that results in lower consumer and business spending could also have a negative impact on certain of JPMorgan Chase’s wholesale clients, and thereby diminish JPMorgan Chase’s earnings from its wholesale operations. For example, the businesses of certain of JPMorgan Chase’s wholesale clients are dependent on consistent streams of rental income from commercial real estate properties which are owned or being built by those clients. Severe and sustained adverse economic conditions could reduce the rental cash flows that owners or developers receive from those properties which, in turn, could depress the values of the properties and impair the ability of borrowers to service or refinance their commercial real estate loans. These consequences could result in JPMorgan Chase experiencing higher delinquencies, defaults and write-offs within its commercial real estate loan portfolio and incurring higher costs for servicing a larger volume of delinquent loans in that portfolio, thereby reducing JPMorgan Chase’s earnings from its wholesale businesses.

Changes in interest rates and credit spreads can adversely affect certain of JPMorgan Chase’s revenue and income streams.

JPMorgan Chase can generally be expected to earn higher net interest income when interest rates are increasing. However, higher interest rates can also lead to:

•

fewer originations of commercial and residential real estate loans

•

losses on underwriting exposures

•

the loss of deposits, including in the event that JPMorgan Chase makes incorrect assumptions about depositor behavior

•

lower net interest income if central banks introduce interest rate increases more quickly than anticipated and this results in a misalignment in the pricing of short-term and long-term borrowings

•

less liquidity in the financial markets, and

•

higher funding costs.

All of these outcomes could adversely affect JPMorgan Chase’s revenues and its liquidity and capital levels. Higher interest rates can also negatively affect the payment performance on loans within JPMorgan Chase’s consumer and wholesale loan portfolios that are linked to variable interest rates. If borrowers of variable rate loans are unable to afford higher interest payments, those borrowers may

reduce or stop making payments, thereby causing JPMorgan Chase to incur losses and increased operational costs related to servicing a higher volume of delinquent loans.

On the other hand, a low or negative interest rate environment may cause:

•

net interest margins to be compressed, which could reduce the amounts that JPMorgan Chase earns on its investment portfolio to the extent that it is unable to reinvest contemporaneously in higher-yielding instruments

•

unanticipated or adverse changes in depositor behavior, which could negatively affect JPMorgan Chase’s broader asset and liability management strategy, and

•

a reduction in the value of JPMorgan Chase’s mortgage servicing rights (“MSRs”) asset, thereby decreasing revenues.

When credit spreads widen, it becomes more expensive for JPMorgan Chase to borrow. JPMorgan Chase’s credit spreads may widen or narrow not only in response to events and circumstances that are specific to JPMorgan Chase but also as a result of general economic and geopolitical events and conditions. Changes in JPMorgan Chase’s credit spreads will affect, positively or negatively, JPMorgan Chase’s earnings on certain liabilities, such as derivatives, that are recorded at fair value.

JPMorgan Chase’s results may be materially affected by market fluctuations and significant changes in the value of financial instruments.

The value of securities, derivatives and other financial instruments which JPMorgan Chase owns or in which it makes markets can be materially affected by market fluctuations. Market volatility, illiquid market conditions and other disruptions in the financial markets may make it extremely difficult to value certain financial instruments, particularly during periods of market displacement. Subsequent valuations of financial instruments in future periods, in light of factors then prevailing, may result in significant changes in the value of these instruments. In addition, at the time of any disposition of these financial instruments, the price that JPMorgan Chase ultimately realizes will depend on the demand and liquidity in the market at that time and may be materially lower than their current fair value. Any of these factors could cause a decline in the value of JPMorgan Chase’s financial instruments which may have an adverse effect on JPMorgan Chase’s results of operations.

JPMorgan Chase’s risk management and monitoring processes, including its stress testing framework, seek to quantify and control JPMorgan Chase’s exposure to more extreme market moves. However, JPMorgan Chase could realize significant losses if extreme market events were to occur. Under extreme market conditions, hedging and other risk management strategies may not be as effective at


mitigating losses as they would be under more normal market conditions.

Credit

JPMorgan Chase can be adversely affected by the financial condition of clients, counterparties, custodians and CCPs.

JPMorgan Chase routinely executes transactions with brokers and dealers, commercial and investment banks, mutual and hedge funds, investment managers and other types of financial institutions and market participants. Many of these transactions expose JPMorgan Chase to the credit risk of its clients and counterparties, and can involve JPMorgan Chase in disputes and litigation if a client or counterparty defaults. JPMorgan Chase can also be subject to losses or liability where a financial institution that it has appointed to provide custodial services for client assets or funds becomes insolvent as a result of fraud or the failure to abide by existing laws and obligations, including under the EU Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive.

A default by, or the financial or operational failure of, a CCP through which JPMorgan Chase executes contracts would require JPMorgan Chase to replace those contracts, thereby increasing its operational costs and potentially resulting in losses. JPMorgan Chase can also be exposed to losses if a member of a CCP in which JPMorgan Chase is also a member defaults on its obligations to the CCP because of requirements that each member of the CCP absorb a portion of those losses. As part of its clearing services activities, JPMorgan Chase is also exposed to the risk of nonperformance by its clients, which it seeks to mitigate by requiring clients to provide adequate collateral. JPMorgan Chase is also exposed to intra-day credit risk of its clients in connection with providing cash management, clearing, custodial and other transaction services to those clients. If a client for which JPMorgan Chase provides these services becomes bankrupt or insolvent, JPMorgan Chase may incur losses, become involved in disputes and litigation with one or more CCPs, the client’s bankruptcy estate and other creditors, or be subject to regulatory investigations. All of the foregoing events can increase JPMorgan Chase’s operational and litigation costs, and JPMorgan Chase may suffer losses to the extent that any collateral that it has received is insufficient to cover those losses. JPMorgan Chase can also be subject to bearing its share of non-default losses incurred by a CCP, including losses from custodial, settlement or investment activities or due to cyber or other security breaches.

Disputes may arise with counterparties to derivatives contracts with regard to the terms, the settlement procedures or the value of underlying collateral. The disposition of those disputes could cause JPMorgan Chase to incur unexpected transaction, operational and legal costs, or result in credit losses. These consequences can also impair JPMorgan Chase’s ability to effectively manage its credit risk exposure from its market activities, or cause harm to JPMorgan Chase’s reputation.

The financial or operational failure of a significant market participant, such as a major financial institution or a CCP, or concerns about the creditworthiness of such a market participant, can have a cascading effect within the financial markets. JPMorgan Chase’s businesses could be significantly disrupted by such an event, particularly if it leads to other market participants incurring significant losses, experiencing liquidity issues or defaulting. JPMorgan Chase is likely to have significant interrelationships with, and credit exposure to, such a significant market participant, and would seek to unwind or hedge positions in securities, derivatives and other obligations in multiple jurisdictions during a period of heightened market volatility.

JPMorgan Chase may suffer losses if the value of collateral declines in stressed market conditions.

During periods of market stress or illiquidity, JPMorgan Chase’s credit risk may be further increased when JPMorgan Chase cannot realize the fair value of the collateral held by it or when collateral is liquidated at prices that are not sufficient to recover the full amount of the loan, derivative or other exposure due to it. Furthermore, disputes with counterparties concerning the valuation of collateral may increase in times of significant market stress, volatility or illiquidity, and JPMorgan Chase could suffer losses during these periods if it is unable to realize the fair value of collateral or to manage declines in the value of collateral.

JPMorgan Chase could incur significant losses arising from concentrations of credit and market risk.

JPMorgan Chase is exposed to greater credit and market risk to the extent that groupings of its clients or counterparties:

•

engage in similar or related businesses, or in businesses in related industries

•

do business in the same geographic region, or

•

have business profiles, models or strategies that could cause their ability to meet their obligations to be similarly affected by changes in economic conditions.

For example, a significant deterioration in the credit quality of one of JPMorgan Chase’s borrowers or counterparties could lead to concerns about the creditworthiness of other borrowers or counterparties in similar, related or dependent industries. This type of interrelationship could exacerbate JPMorgan Chase’s credit, liquidity and market risk exposure and potentially cause it to incur losses, including fair value losses in its market-making businesses.

Similarly, challenging economic conditions that affect a particular industry or geographic area could lead to concerns about the credit quality of JPMorgan Chase’s borrowers or counterparties not only in that particular industry or geography but in related or dependent industries, wherever located. These conditions could also heighten concerns about the ability of customers of JPMorgan Chase’s consumer businesses who live in those areas or work in those affected industries or related or


Part I

dependent industries to meet their obligations to JPMorgan Chase. JPMorgan Chase regularly monitors various segments of its credit and market risk exposures to assess the potential risks of concentration or contagion, but its efforts to diversify or hedge its exposures against those risks may not be successful.

JPMorgan Chase’s consumer businesses can also be harmed by an excessive expansion of consumer credit by bank or non-bank competitors. Heightened competition for certain types of consumer loans could prompt industry-wide reactions such as significant reductions in the pricing or margins of those loans or the making of loans to less-creditworthy borrowers. If large numbers of consumers subsequently default on their loans, whether due to weak credit profiles, an economic downturn or other factors, this could impair their ability to repay obligations owed to JPMorgan Chase and result in higher charge-offs and other credit-related losses. More broadly, widespread defaults on consumer debt could lead to recessionary conditions in the U.S. economy, and JPMorgan Chase’s consumer businesses may earn lower revenues in such an environment.

If JPMorgan Chase is unable to reduce positions effectively during a market dislocation, this can increase both the market and credit risks associated with those positions and the level of risk-weighted assets (“RWA”) that JPMorgan Chase holds on its balance sheet. These factors could adversely affect JPMorgan Chase’s capital position, funding costs and the profitability of its businesses.

Liquidity

Liquidity is critical to JPMorgan Chase’s ability to operate its businesses.

JPMorgan Chase’s liquidity could be impaired at any given time by factors such as:

•

market-wide illiquidity or disruption

•

unforeseen liquidity or capital requirements, including as a result of changes in laws, rules and regulations

•

inability to sell assets, or to sell assets at favorable times or prices

•

default by a CCP or other significant market participant

•

unanticipated outflows of cash or collateral

•

unexpected loss of consumer deposits caused by changes in consumer behavior, and

•

lack of market or customer confidence in JPMorgan Chase or financial institutions in general.

A reduction in JPMorgan Chase’s liquidity may be caused by events over which it has little or no control. For example, during periods of market stress, low investor confidence and significant market illiquidity could result in higher funding costs for JPMorgan Chase and could limit its access to some of its traditional sources of liquidity. There is no assurance that severe conditions of this type will not occur.

JPMorgan Chase may need to raise funding from alternative sources if its access to stable and lower-cost sources of funding, such as deposits and borrowings from Federal Home Loan Banks, is reduced. Alternative sources of funding could be more expensive or limited in availability. JPMorgan Chase’s funding costs could also be negatively affected by actions that JPMorgan Chase may take in order to:

•

satisfy applicable liquidity coverage ratio and net stable funding ratio requirements

•

address obligations under its resolution plan, or

•

satisfy regulatory requirements in jurisdictions outside the U.S. relating to the pre-positioning of liquidity in subsidiaries that are material legal entities.

More generally, if JPMorgan Chase fails to effectively manage its liquidity, this could constrain its ability to fund or invest in its businesses and subsidiaries (including, in particular, its broker-dealer subsidiaries), and thereby adversely affect its results of operations.

JPMorgan Chase & Co. is a holding company and depends on the cash flows of its subsidiaries to make payments on its outstanding securities.

JPMorgan Chase & Co. is a holding company that holds the stock of JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and an intermediate holding company, JPMorgan Chase Holdings LLC (the “IHC”). The IHC in turn holds the stock of substantially all of JPMorgan Chase’s subsidiaries other than JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and its subsidiaries. The IHC also owns other assets and owes intercompany indebtedness to the holding company.

The holding company is obligated to contribute to the IHC substantially all the net proceeds received from securities issuances (including issuances of senior and subordinated debt securities and of preferred and common stock).

The ability of JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and the IHC to make payments to the holding company is also limited. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. is subject to restrictions on its dividend distributions, as well as capital adequacy and liquidity requirements and other regulatory restrictions on its ability to make payments to the holding company. The IHC is prohibited from paying dividends or extending credit to the holding company if certain capital or liquidity “thresholds” are breached or if limits are otherwise imposed by JPMorgan Chase’s management or Board of Directors.

As a result of these arrangements, the ability of the holding company to make various payments is dependent on its receiving dividends from JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and dividends and extensions of credit from the IHC. These limitations could affect the holding company’s ability to:

•

pay interest on its debt securities

•

pay dividends on its equity securities

•

redeem or repurchase outstanding securities, and


•

fulfill its other payment obligations.

These regulatory restrictions and limitations could also result in the holding company seeking protection under bankruptcy laws at a time earlier than would have been the case absent the existence of the capital and liquidity thresholds to which the IHC is subject.

Reductions in JPMorgan Chase’s credit ratings may adversely affect its liquidity and cost of funding.

JPMorgan Chase & Co. and certain of its principal subsidiaries are rated by credit rating agencies. Rating agencies evaluate both general and firm-specific and industry-specific factors when determining credit ratings for a particular financial institution, including:

•

expected future profitability

•

risk management practices

•

legal expenses

•

ratings differentials between bank holding companies and their bank and non-bank subsidiaries

•

regulatory developments

•

assumptions about government support, and

•

economic and geopolitical trends.

JPMorgan Chase closely monitors and manages, to the extent that it is able, factors that could influence its credit ratings. However, there is no assurance that JPMorgan Chase’s credit ratings will not be lowered in the future. Furthermore, any such downgrade could occur at times of broader market instability when JPMorgan Chase’s options for responding to events may be more limited and general investor confidence is low.

A reduction in JPMorgan Chase’s credit ratings could curtail JPMorgan Chase’s business activities and reduce its profitability in a number of ways, including:

•

reducing its access to capital markets

•

materially increasing its cost of issuing and servicing securities

•

triggering additional collateral or funding requirements, and

•

decreasing the number of investors and counterparties that are willing or permitted to do business with or lend to JPMorgan Chase.

Any rating reduction could also increase the credit spreads charged by the market for taking credit risk on JPMorgan Chase & Co. and its subsidiaries. This could, in turn, adversely affect the value of debt and other obligations of JPMorgan Chase & Co. and its subsidiaries.

The reform and replacement of benchmark rates could adversely affect JPMorgan Chase’s funding, investments and financial products, and expose it to litigation and other disputes.

Interest rate, equity, foreign exchange rate and other types of indices which are deemed to be “benchmarks,” including those in widespread and long-standing use, have been the subject of ongoing international, national and other regulatory scrutiny and initiatives and proposals for reform. Some of these reforms are already effective while others are still to be implemented or are under consideration. These reforms may cause benchmarks to perform differently than in the past, or to disappear entirely, or have other consequences which cannot be fully anticipated.

Any of the benchmark reforms which have been proposed or implemented, or the general increased regulatory scrutiny of benchmarks, could also increase the costs and risks of administering or otherwise participating in the setting of benchmarks and complying with regulations or requirements relating to benchmarks. Such factors may have the effect of discouraging market participants from continuing to administer or contribute to certain benchmarks, trigger changes in the rules or methodologies used in certain benchmarks or lead to the disappearance of certain benchmarks.

Any of these developments, and any future initiatives to regulate, reform or change the administration of benchmarks, could result in adverse consequences to the return on, value of and market for loans, mortgages, securities, derivatives and other financial instruments whose returns are linked to any such benchmark, including those issued, funded, serviced or held by JPMorgan Chase.

Various regulators, industry bodies and other market participants in the U.S. and other countries are engaged in initiatives to develop, introduce and encourage the use of alternative rates to replace certain benchmarks. There is no assurance that these new rates will be accepted or widely used by market participants, or that the characteristics of any of these new rates will be similar to, or produce the economic equivalent of, the benchmarks that they seek to replace. If a particular benchmark were to be discontinued and an alternative rate has not been successfully introduced to replace that benchmark, this could result in widespread dislocation in the financial markets, engender volatility in the pricing of securities, derivatives and other instruments, and suppress capital markets activities, all of which could have adverse effects on JPMorgan Chase’s results of operations. In addition, to the extent that appropriate relief is not provided by accounting standard setters with respect to the transition from benchmark rates, the transition could:

•

affect hedge accounting relationships between financial instruments linked to a particular benchmark and any related derivatives, which could adversely affect JPMorgan Chase’s results of operations, or

•

increase JPMorgan Chase’s operational costs with respect to the determination of whether the transition


Part I

has resulted in the modification or extinguishment of specific contracts for accounting purposes.

Representatives of the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority (the “FCA”), which regulates the London interbank offered rate (“LIBOR”), have made a series of public statements during the past several years to the effect that:

•

the FCA will no longer persuade or compel banks to submit rates for the calculation of the LIBOR benchmark after 2021, and

•

once a significant number of banks are no longer submitting such rates, the FCA may make a determination under applicable regulations that the LIBOR benchmark may not meet the standards required under those regulations for use as a benchmark.

These statements indicate that it is highly likely that LIBOR will be discontinued on or about the end of 2021. Vast amounts of loans, mortgages, securities, derivatives and other financial instruments are linked to the LIBOR benchmark, and any inability of market participants and regulators to successfully introduce benchmark rates to replace LIBOR and implement effective transitional arrangements to address the discontinuation of LIBOR could result in disruption in the financial markets and suppress capital markets activities, all of which could have a negative impact on JPMorgan Chase’s results of operations and on LIBOR-linked securities, credit or other instruments which are issued, funded, serviced or held by JPMorgan Chase.

JPMorgan Chase could also become involved in litigation and other types of disputes with clients, customers, counterparties and investors as a consequence of the transition from LIBOR and other benchmark rates to replacement rates, including claims that JPMorgan Chase has:

•

treated clients, customers, counterparties or investors unfairly, or caused them to experience losses, higher financing costs or lower returns on investments

•

failed to appropriately communicate the effects of the transition from benchmark rates on the products that JPMorgan Chase has sold to its clients and customers,   or failed to disclose purported conflicts of interest

•

made inappropriate product recommendations to or investments on behalf of its clients, or sold products that did not serve their intended purpose, in connection with the transition from benchmark rates

•

engaged in anti-competitive behavior, or in the manipulation of markets or specific benchmarks, in connection with the discontinuation of or transition from benchmark rates, or

•

disadvantaged clients, customers, counterparties or investors when interpreting or making determinations under the terms of agreements or financial instruments.

These types of claims could subject JPMorgan Chase to higher legal expenses and operational costs, require it to pay significant amounts in connection with resolving litigation and other disputes, and harm its reputation.

Capital

Maintaining the appropriate level and composition of capital is critical to support JPMorgan Chase’s business activities, meet regulatory requirements and distribute capital to shareholders.

JPMorgan Chase is subject to various regulatory capital requirements, and although many of these requirements have been finalized, prudential regulators have recently issued new regulatory capital proposals, and continued uncertainty remains as to the manner in which these requirements ultimately will apply to JPMorgan Chase. As a result, it is possible that these requirements could limit JPMorgan Chase’s ability to support its businesses and make capital distributions to its shareholders.

JPMorgan Chase is required to submit, on an annual basis, a capital plan describing proposed dividend payments to shareholders, redemptions and repurchases of its outstanding securities and other capital actions that it intends to take. JPMorgan Chase considers various factors in the management of capital, including the impact of stress on its capital levels, as determined by both internal modeling and the Federal Reserve’s modeling of JPMorgan Chase’s capital position in supervisory stress tests and CCAR. Because the Federal Reserve and JPMorgan Chase use different forecasting models and methodologies when determining stress test results, there can be significant differences between the estimates of stress loss as determined by the Federal Reserve and JPMorgan Chase, respectively. The Federal Reserve may object to or require modifications to JPMorgan Chase’s capital plan, or JPMorgan Chase may otherwise modify its capital plan, and any such modification could have an adverse effect on JPMorgan Chase’s shareholders, including by:

•

constraining the amount of dividends that may be paid on common stock

•

reducing the amount of common stock that JPMorgan Chase is permitted to repurchase

•

requiring the issuance of, or prohibiting the redemption of, capital instruments in a manner inconsistent with JPMorgan Chase’s capital management strategy

•

curtailing JPMorgan Chase’s business activities or operations, or

•

damaging JPMorgan Chase’s reputation.


Operational

JPMorgan Chase’s businesses are highly dependent on the effectiveness of its operational systems and those of other market participants.

JPMorgan Chase’s businesses rely comprehensively on the ability of JPMorgan Chase’s financial, accounting, transaction execution, data processing and other operational systems to process, record, monitor and report a large number of transactions on a continuous basis, and to do so accurately, quickly and securely. In addition to proper design, installation, maintenance and training, the effective functioning of JPMorgan Chase’s operational systems depends on:

•

the quality of the information contained in those systems, as inaccurate, outdated or corrupted data can significantly compromise the functionality or reliability of a particular system and other systems to which it transmits or from which it receives information, and

•

JPMorgan Chase’s ability to appropriately maintain and upgrade its systems on a regular basis, and to ensure that any changes introduced to its systems are managed carefully to ensure security and operational continuity and adhere to all applicable legal and regulatory requirements.

JPMorgan Chase also depends on its ability to access and use the operational systems of its vendors, custodians and other market participants, including clearing and payment systems, CCPs, securities exchanges and data processing, security and technology companies.

The ineffectiveness, failure or other disruption of operational systems upon which JPMorgan Chase depends, including due to a systems malfunction, cyberbreach or other systems failure, could result in unfavorable ripple effects in the financial markets and for JPMorgan Chase and its clients and customers, including:

•

delays or other disruptions in providing information, services and liquidity to clients and customers

•

the inability to settle transactions or obtain access to funds and other assets, including those for which physical settlement and delivery is required

•

failure to timely settle or confirm transactions

•

the possibility that funds transfers, capital markets trades or other transactions are executed erroneously, illegally or with unintended consequences

•

financial losses, including due to loss-sharing requirements of CCPs, payment systems or other market infrastructures, or as possible restitution to clients and customers

•

higher operational costs associated with replacing services provided by a system that is unavailable

•

client or customer dissatisfaction with JPMorgan Chase’s products and services

•

loss of confidence in the ability of JPMorgan Chase, or financial institutions generally, to protect against and withstand operational disruptions, or

•

harm to JPMorgan Chase’s reputation.

As the speed, frequency, volume, interconnectivity and complexity of transactions continue to increase, it becomes more challenging to effectively maintain and upgrade JPMorgan Chase’s operational systems and infrastructure, especially due to the heightened risks that:

•

errors made by JPMorgan Chase or another market participant, whether inadvertent or malicious, cause widespread system disruption

•

isolated or seemingly insignificant errors in operational systems compound, or migrate to other systems over time, to become larger issues

•

failures in synchronization or encryption software, or degraded performance of microprocessors due to design flaws, could cause disruptions in operational systems, or the inability of systems to communicate with each other, and

•

third parties may attempt to block the use of key technology solutions by claiming that the use infringes on their intellectual property rights.

If JPMorgan Chase’s operational systems, or those of external parties on which JPMorgan Chase’s businesses depend, are unable to meet the demanding standards of JPMorgan Chase’s businesses and operations, or if they fail or have other significant shortcomings, JPMorgan Chase could be materially and adversely affected.

JPMorgan Chase can be negatively affected if it fails to identify and address operational risks associated with the introduction of or changes to products, services and delivery platforms.

When JPMorgan Chase launches a new product or service, introduces a new platform for the delivery or distribution of products or services (including mobile connectivity, electronic trading and cloud computing), or makes changes to an existing product, service or delivery platform, it may not fully appreciate or identify new operational risks that may arise from those changes, or may fail to implement adequate controls to mitigate the risks associated with those changes. Any significant failure in this regard could diminish JPMorgan Chase’s ability to operate one or more of its businesses or result in:

•

potential liability to clients, counterparties and customers

•

increased operating expenses

•

higher litigation costs, including regulatory fines, penalties and other sanctions

•

damage to JPMorgan Chase’s reputation

•

impairment of JPMorgan Chase’s liquidity


Part I

•

regulatory intervention, or

•

weaker competitive standing.

Any of the foregoing consequences could materially and adversely affect JPMorgan Chase’s businesses and results of operations.

JPMorgan Chase’s connections to external operational systems expose it to greater operational risks.

External operational systems with which JPMorgan is connected, whether directly or indirectly, can be sources of operational risk to JPMorgan Chase. JPMorgan Chase may be exposed not only to a systems failure that may be experienced by a vendor or market infrastructure with which JPMorgan Chase is directly connected, but also to a systems breakdown of another party to which such a vendor or infrastructure is connected. Similarly, retailers, data aggregators and other external parties with which JPMorgan Chase’s customers do business can increase JPMorgan Chase’s operational risk. This is particularly the case where activities of customers or those parties are beyond JPMorgan Chase’s security and control systems, including through the use of the internet, cloud computing services and personal smart phones and other mobile devices or services.

If an external party obtains access to customer account data on JPMorgan Chase’s systems, and that party experiences a cyberbreach of its own systems or misappropriates that data, this could result in a variety of negative outcomes for JPMorgan Chase and its clients and customers, including:

•

heightened risk that external parties will be able to execute fraudulent transactions using JPMorgan Chase’s systems

•

losses from fraudulent transactions, as well as potential liability for losses that exceed thresholds established in consumer protection laws and regulations

•

increased operational costs to remediate the consequences of the external party’s security breach, and

•

harm to reputation arising from the perception that JPMorgan Chase’s systems may not be secure.

As JPMorgan Chase’s interconnectivity with clients, customers and other external parties expands, JPMorgan Chase increasingly faces the risk of operational failure with respect to the systems of those parties. Security breaches affecting JPMorgan Chase’s clients or customers, or systems breakdowns or failures, security breaches or human error or misconduct affecting other external parties, may require JPMorgan Chase to take steps to protect the integrity of its own operational systems or to safeguard confidential information, including restricting the access of customers to their accounts. These actions can increase JPMorgan Chase’s operational costs and potentially diminish customer satisfaction and confidence in JPMorgan Chase.

Furthermore, the widespread and expanding interconnectivity among financial institutions, central agents, CCPs, payment processors, securities exchanges, clearing houses and other financial market infrastructures increases the risk that an operational failure at one institution or entity may cause an industry-wide operational failure that could materially affect JPMorgan Chase’s ability to conduct business.

JPMorgan Chase’s operations depend on the competence and integrity of its employees and those of external parties.

JPMorgan Chase’s ability to operate its businesses efficiently and profitably, to offer products and services that meet the expectations of its clients and customers, and to maintain an effective risk management framework is highly dependent on the competence and integrity of its employees, as well as employees of other parties on which JPMorgan Chase’s operations rely, including vendors, custodians and financial markets infrastructures. JPMorgan Chase’s businesses could be materially and adversely affected by:

•

the ineffective implementation of business decisions

•

any failure to institute controls that appropriately address risks associated with business activities, or to appropriately train employees with respect to those risks and controls

•

a significant operational breakdown or failure, theft, fraud or other unlawful conduct, or

•

other negative outcomes caused by human error or misconduct by an employee of JPMorgan Chase or of another party on which JPMorgan Chase’s operations depend.

JPMorgan Chase faces substantial legal and operational risks in safeguarding personal information.

JPMorgan Chase’s businesses are subject to complex and evolving laws and regulations, both within and outside the U.S., governing the privacy and protection of personal information of individuals. The protected parties can include:

•

JPMorgan Chase’s clients and customers, and prospective clients and customers

•

clients and customers of JPMorgan Chase’s clients and customers

•

employees and prospective employees, and

•

employees of JPMorgan Chase’s vendors, counterparties and other external parties.

Ensuring that JPMorgan Chase’s collection, use, transfer and storage of personal information comply with all applicable laws and regulations in all relevant jurisdictions, including where the laws of different jurisdictions are in conflict, can:

•

increase JPMorgan Chase’s compliance and operating costs


•

hinder the development of new products or services, curtail the offering of existing products or services, or affect how products and services are offered to clients and customers

•

demand significant oversight by JPMorgan Chase’s management, and

•

require JPMorgan Chase to structure its businesses, operations and systems in less efficient ways.

Furthermore, JPMorgan Chase cannot ensure that all of its clients and customers, vendors, counterparties and other external parties have appropriate controls in place to protect the confidentiality of the information exchanged between them and JPMorgan Chase, particularly where information is transmitted by electronic means. JPMorgan Chase could be exposed to litigation or regulatory fines, penalties or other sanctions if personal, confidential or proprietary information of clients, customers, employees or others were to be mishandled or misused, such as situations where such information is:

•

erroneously provided to parties who are not permitted to have the information, or

•

intercepted or otherwise compromised by third parties.

Concerns regarding the effectiveness of JPMorgan Chase’s measures to safeguard personal information, or even the perception that those measures are inadequate, could cause JPMorgan Chase to lose existing or potential clients and customers, and thereby reduce JPMorgan Chase’s revenues. Furthermore, any failure or perceived failure by JPMorgan Chase to comply with applicable privacy or data protection laws and regulations may subject it to inquiries, examinations and investigations that could result in requirements to modify or cease certain operations or practices, significant liabilities or regulatory fines, penalties or other sanctions. Any of these could damage JPMorgan Chase’s reputation and otherwise adversely affect its businesses.

In recent years, well-publicized allegations involving the misuse or inappropriate sharing of personal information have led to expanded governmental scrutiny of practices relating to the safeguarding of personal information and the use or sharing of personal data by companies in the U.S. and other countries. That scrutiny has in some cases resulted in, and could in the future lead to, the adoption of stricter laws and regulations relating to the use and sharing of personal information. These types of laws and regulations could prohibit or significantly restrict financial services firms such as JPMorgan Chase from sharing information among affiliates or with third parties such as vendors, and thereby increase compliance costs, or could restrict JPMorgan Chase’s use of personal data when developing or offering products or services to customers. These restrictions could also inhibit JPMorgan Chase’s development or marketing of certain products or services, or increase the costs of offering them to customers.

A successful cyberattack against JPMorgan Chase could cause significant harm to JPMorgan Chase or its clients and customers.

JPMorgan Chase experiences numerous cyberattacks on its computer systems, software, networks and other technology assets on a daily basis from various actors, including cyber-criminals and “hacktivists” (i.e., individuals or groups that use technology to promote a political agenda or social change). These cyberattacks can take many forms, but a common objective of many of these attacks is to introduce computer viruses or malware into JPMorgan Chase’s systems. These viruses or malicious code are typically designed to:

•

obtain unauthorized access to confidential information belonging to JPMorgan Chase or its clients, customers, counterparties or employees

•

manipulate or destroy data

•

disrupt, sabotage or degrade service on JPMorgan Chase’s systems, or

•

steal money.

JPMorgan Chase has also experienced significant distributed denial-of-service attacks which are intended to disrupt online banking services.

JPMorgan Chase devotes significant resources to maintain and regularly upgrade its systems to protect them against cyberattacks. However, JPMorgan Chase has experienced security breaches due to cyberattacks in the past, and it is inevitable that additional breaches will occur in the future. Any such breach could result in serious and harmful consequences for JPMorgan Chase or its clients and customers.

A principal reason that JPMorgan Chase cannot provide absolute security against cyberattacks is that it may not always be possible to anticipate, detect or recognize threats to JPMorgan Chase’s systems, or to implement effective preventive measures against all breaches. This is because:

•

the techniques used in cyberattacks change frequently and are increasingly sophisticated, and therefore may not be recognized until launched

•

cyberattacks can originate from a wide variety of sources, including third parties who are or may be involved in organized crime or linked to terrorist organizations or hostile countries, or whose objective is to disrupt the operations of financial institutions more generally

•

JPMorgan Chase does not have control over the cybersecurity of the systems of the large number of clients, customers, counterparties and third-party service providers with which it does business

•

third parties may seek to gain access to JPMorgan Chase’s systems either directly or using equipment or security passwords belonging to employees, customers,


Part I

third-party service providers or other users of JPMorgan Chase’s systems, and

•

it is possible that a third party, after establishing a foothold on an internal network without being detected, might obtain access to other networks and systems.

The risk of a security breach due to a cyberattack could increase in the future as JPMorgan Chase continues to expand its mobile banking and other internet-based product offerings and its internal use of internet-based products and applications.

A successful penetration or circumvention of the security of JPMorgan Chase’s systems or the systems of a vendor, governmental body or another market participant could cause serious negative consequences, including:

•

significant disruption of JPMorgan Chase’s operations and those of its clients, customers and counterparties, including losing access to operational systems

•

misappropriation of confidential information of JPMorgan Chase or that of its clients, customers, counterparties, employees or regulators

•

damage to computers or systems of JPMorgan Chase and those of its clients, customers and counterparties

•

inability to fully recover and restore data that has been stolen, manipulated or destroyed, or to prevent systems from processing fraudulent transactions

•

violations by JPMorgan Chase of applicable privacy and other laws

•

financial loss to JPMorgan Chase or to its clients,  customers, counterparties or employees

•

loss of confidence in JPMorgan Chase’s cybersecurity measures

•

dissatisfaction among JPMorgan Chase’s clients, customers or counterparties

•

significant exposure to litigation and regulatory fines, penalties or other sanctions, and

•

harm to JPMorgan Chase’s reputation.

JPMorgan Chase could also suffer some of the above consequences if a third party were to misappropriate confidential information obtained by intercepting signals or communications from mobile devices used by JPMorgan Chase’s employees.

The extent of a particular cyberattack and the steps that JPMorgan Chase may need to take to investigate the attack may not be immediately clear, and it may take a significant amount of time before such an investigation can be completed. While such an investigation is ongoing, JPMorgan Chase may not necessarily know the full extent of the harm caused by the cyberattack, and that damage may continue to spread. These factors may inhibit JPMorgan Chase’s ability to provide full and reliable information about

the cyberattack to its clients, customers, counterparties and regulators, as well as the public. Furthermore, it may not be clear how best to contain and remediate the harm caused by the cyberattack, and certain errors or actions could be repeated or compounded before they are discovered and remediated. Any or all of these factors could further increase the costs and consequences of a cyberattack.

JPMorgan Chase’s operations, results and reputation could be harmed by catastrophes or other events.

JPMorgan Chase’s business and operational systems could be seriously disrupted, and its reputation could be harmed, by events or contributing factors that are wholly or partially beyond its control, including:

•

cyberbreaches or breaches of physical premises, including data centers

•

power, telecommunications or internet outages

•

failures of, or loss of access to, operational systems, including computer systems, servers, networks and other technology assets

•

damage to or loss of property or assets of JPMorgan Chase or third parties, and any consequent injuries, including in connection with any construction projects undertaken by JPMorgan Chase

•

effects of climate change

•

natural disasters or severe weather conditions

•

accidents such as explosions or structural failures

•

health emergencies, the spread of infectious diseases or pandemics, or

•

events arising from local or larger-scale political events, including outbreaks of hostilities or terrorist acts.

JPMorgan Chase maintains a firmwide resiliency program that is intended to enable it to recover critical business functions and supporting assets, including staff, technology and facilities, in the event of a business interruption. There can be no assurance that JPMorgan Chase’s resiliency plans will fully mitigate all potential business continuity risks to JPMorgan Chase or its clients and customers. In particular, JPMorgan Chase’s ability to respond effectively to a business interruption could be hampered to the extent that the members of its workforce, physical assets or systems and other support infrastructure needed to address the event are geographically dispersed, or conversely, if a catastrophic event occurs in an area in which a critical segment of JPMorgan Chase’s workforce, physical assets or systems and other support infrastructure is concentrated. In addition, should emergency or catastrophic events such as severe or abnormal weather conditions become more chronic, the disruptive effects of those events on JPMorgan Chase’s business and operations, and on its clients, customers, counterparties and employees, could become more significant and long-lasting.


Any significant failure or disruption of JPMorgan Chase’s operations or operational systems, or any catastrophic event, could:

•

hinder JPMorgan Chase’s ability to provide services to its clients and customers or to transact with its counterparties

•

require it to expend significant resources to correct the failure or disruption

•

cause it to incur losses or liabilities, including from loss of revenue, damage to or loss of property, or injuries

•

expose it to litigation or regulatory fines, penalties or other sanctions, and

•

harm its reputation.

JPMorgan Chase’s risk management framework may not be effective in identifying and mitigating every risk to JPMorgan Chase.

Any inadequacy or lapse in JPMorgan Chase’s risk management framework, governance structure, practices, models or reporting systems could expose it to unexpected losses, and its financial condition or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. In addition, any such inadequacy or lapse could:

•

require significant resources to remediate

•

attract heightened regulatory scrutiny

•

expose JPMorgan Chase to regulatory investigations or legal proceedings

•

subject it to litigation or regulatory fines, penalties or other sanctions

•

harm its reputation, or

•

otherwise diminish confidence in JPMorgan Chase.

JPMorgan Chase relies on data to assess its various risk exposures. Any deficiencies in the quality or effectiveness of JPMorgan Chase’s data gathering and validation processes could result in ineffective risk management practices. These deficiencies could also result in inaccurate risk reporting.

Many of JPMorgan Chase’s risk management strategies and techniques consider historical market behavior.  These strategies and techniques are based to some degree on management’s subjective judgment. For example, many models used by JPMorgan Chase are based on assumptions regarding historical correlations among prices of various asset classes or other market indicators. In times of market stress, including difficult or less liquid market environments, or in the event of other unforeseen circumstances, previously uncorrelated indicators may become correlated.  Conversely, previously-correlated indicators may make unrelated movements at those times. Sudden market movements and unanticipated or unidentified market or economic movements could, in some circumstances, limit the effectiveness of JPMorgan Chase’s risk management strategies, causing it to incur losses.

JPMorgan Chase could incur significant losses, its capital levels could be reduced and it could face greater regulatory scrutiny if its models or estimations prove to be inadequate.

JPMorgan Chase has developed and uses a variety of models and other analytical and judgment-based estimations to measure, monitor and implement controls over its market, credit, liquidity, operational and other risks. These models and estimations are based on a variety of assumptions and historical trends, and are periodically reviewed and modified as necessary. The models and estimations that JPMorgan Chase uses may not be effective in all cases to identify, observe and mitigate risk due to a variety of factors, such as:

•

reliance on historical trends that may not accurately predict future events, including assumptions underlying the models and estimations which predict correlation among certain market indicators or asset prices

•

inherent limitations associated with forecasting uncertain economic and financial outcomes

•

historical trend information may be incomplete, or may not anticipate severely negative market conditions such as extreme volatility, dislocation or lack of liquidity

•

technology that is introduced to run models or estimations may not perform as expected, or may not be well understood by the personnel using the technology

•

models and estimations may contain erroneous data, valuations, formulas or algorithms, and

•

review processes may fail to detect flaws in models and estimations.

Some of the models and other analytical and judgment-based estimations used by JPMorgan Chase in managing risks are subject to review by, and require the approval of, JPMorgan Chase’s regulators. These reviews are required before JPMorgan Chase may use those models and estimations in connection with calculating market risk RWA, credit risk RWA and operational risk RWA under Basel III. If JPMorgan Chase’s models or estimations are not approved by its regulators, it may be subject to higher capital charges, which could adversely affect its financial results or limit the ability to expand its businesses. JPMorgan Chase’s capital actions could also be constrained if a CCAR submission is not approved by its banking regulators due to the perceived inadequacy of its models or estimations.

Enhanced regulatory and other standards for the oversight of vendors and other service providers can result in higher costs and other potential exposures.

JPMorgan Chase must comply with enhanced regulatory and other standards associated with doing business with vendors and other service providers, including standards relating to the outsourcing of functions as well as the performance of significant banking and other functions by subsidiaries. JPMorgan Chase incurs significant costs and


Part I

expenses in connection with its initiatives to address the risks associated with oversight of its internal and external service providers. JPMorgan Chase’s failure to appropriately assess and manage these relationships, especially those involving significant banking functions, shared services or other critical activities, could materially adversely affect JPMorgan Chase. Specifically, any such failure could result in:

•

potential liability to clients and customers

•

regulatory fines, penalties or other sanctions

•

lower revenues, and the opportunity cost from lost revenues

•

increased operational costs, or

•

harm to JPMorgan Chase’s reputation.

JPMorgan Chase could incur unexpected losses if estimates and judgments underlying its financial statements are incorrect.

Under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“U.S. GAAP”), JPMorgan Chase is required to use estimates and apply judgments in preparing its financial statements, including in determining the allowance for credit losses and reserves related to litigation. Certain financial instruments require a determination of their fair value in order to prepare JPMorgan Chase’s financial statements, including:

•

trading assets and liabilities

•

instruments in the investment portfolio

•

certain loans

•

MSRs

•

structured notes, and

•

certain repurchase and resale agreements.

Where quoted market prices are not available for these types of financial instruments, JPMorgan Chase may make fair value determinations based on internally developed models or other means which ultimately rely to some degree on management estimates and judgment, and these types of estimates and judgments may not prove to be accurate due to a variety of factors, as noted above. In addition, sudden illiquidity in markets or declines in prices of certain loans and securities may make it more difficult to value certain financial instruments, which could lead to valuations being subsequently changed or adjusted. If estimates or judgments underlying JPMorgan Chase’s financial statements prove to have been incorrect, JPMorgan Chase may experience material losses.

JPMorgan Chase establishes an allowance for expected credit losses that are inherent in its credit exposures. It then employs stress testing and other techniques to determine the amounts of capital and liquidity that would be needed in the event of adverse economic or market events. These processes are critical to JPMorgan Chase’s results of operations and financial condition. They require difficult,

subjective and complex judgments, including forecasts of how economic conditions might impair the ability of JPMorgan Chase’s borrowers and counterparties to repay their loans or other obligations. It is possible that JPMorgan Chase will fail to identify the proper factors or that it will fail to accurately estimate the impact of factors that it identifies.

Lapses in controls over disclosure or financial reporting could materially affect JPMorgan Chase’s profitability or reputation.

There can be no assurance that JPMorgan Chase’s disclosure controls and procedures will be effective in every circumstance, or that a material weakness or significant deficiency in internal control over financial reporting will not occur. Any such lapses or deficiencies could:

•

materially and adversely affect JPMorgan Chase’s business and results of operations or financial condition

•

restrict its ability to access the capital markets

•

require it to expend significant resources to correct the lapses or deficiencies

•

expose it to litigation or regulatory fines, penalties or other sanctions

•

harm its reputation, or

•

otherwise diminish investor confidence in JPMorgan Chase.

JPMorgan Chase could be adversely affected by changes in accounting standards or policies.

The preparation of JPMorgan Chase’s financial statements is based on accounting standards established by the Financial Accounting Standards Board and the Securities and Exchange Commission, as well as more detailed accounting policies established by JPMorgan Chase’s management. From time to time these accounting standards or accounting policies may change, and in some cases these changes could have a significant effect on JPMorgan Chase’s financial statements and may adversely affect its financial results or investor perceptions of those results.

As of January 1, 2020, JPMorgan Chase has implemented a new accounting standard, commonly referred to as the Current Expected Credit Losses (“CECL”) framework, which requires earlier recognition of expected credit losses on loans and certain other instruments. The allowance for credit losses related to JPMorgan Chase’s loans and other lending-related commitments increased as a result of the implementation of CECL, which has a negative impact on JPMorgan Chase’s capital levels.

The ongoing impact of the adoption of CECL could include the following, each of which could result in diminished investor confidence:

•

greater volatility in JPMorgan Chase’s earnings and capital levels over economic cycles


•

potential reductions in its capital distributions, or

•

unexpected increases in the allowance for credit losses.

In addition, JPMorgan Chase could be adversely impacted by associated changes in the competitive environment in which it operates, including changes in the availability or pricing of loan products, particularly during periods of economic stress, as well as changes related to non-U.S. financial institutions or other competitors that are not subject to this accounting standard.

Strategic

If JPMorgan Chase’s management fails to develop and execute effective business strategies, and to anticipate changes affecting those strategies, JPMorgan Chase’s competitive standing and results could suffer.

JPMorgan Chase’s business strategies significantly affect its competitive standing and operations. These strategies relate to:

•

the products and services that JPMorgan Chase offers

•

the geographies in which it operates

•

the types of clients and customers that it serves

•

the counterparties with which it does business, and

•

the methods and distribution channels by which it offers products and services.

If management makes choices about these strategies and goals that prove to be incorrect, do not accurately assess the competitive landscape and industry trends, or fail to address changing regulatory and market environments, then the franchise values and growth prospects of JPMorgan Chase’s businesses may suffer and its earnings could decline.

JPMorgan Chase’s growth prospects also depend on management’s ability to develop and execute effective business plans to address these strategic priorities, both in the near term and over longer time horizons. Management’s effectiveness in this regard will affect JPMorgan Chase’s ability to develop and enhance its resources, control expenses and return capital to shareholders. Each of these objectives could be adversely affected by any failure on the part of management to:

•

devise effective business plans and strategies

•

offer products and services that meet changing expectations of clients and customers

•

allocate capital in a manner that promotes long-term stability to enable JPMorgan Chase to build and invest in market-leading businesses, even in a highly stressed environment

•

allocate capital appropriately due to imprecise modeling or subjective judgments made in connection with those allocations

•

appropriately address shareholder concerns

•

react quickly to changes in market conditions or market structures, or

•

develop and enhance the operational, technology, risk, financial and managerial resources necessary to grow and manage JPMorgan Chase’s businesses.

Additionally, JPMorgan Chase’s Board of Directors plays an important role in exercising appropriate oversight of management’s significant strategic decisions, and a failure by the Board to perform this function could also impair JPMorgan Chase’s results of operations.

JPMorgan Chase faces significant and increasing competition in the rapidly evolving financial services industry.

JPMorgan Chase operates in a highly competitive environment in which it must evolve and adapt to the significant changes as a result of financial regulatory reform, technological advances, increased public scrutiny and current economic conditions. JPMorgan Chase expects that competition in the U.S. and global financial services industry will continue to be intense. Competitors include:

•

other banks and financial institutions

•

trading, advisory and investment management firms

•

finance companies and technology companies, and

•

other nonbank firms that are engaged in providing similar products and services.

JPMorgan Chase cannot provide assurance that the significant competition in the financial services industry will not materially and adversely affect its future results of operations.

New competitors in the financial services industry continue to emerge. For example, technological advances and the growth of e-commerce have made it possible for non-depository institutions to offer products and services that traditionally were banking products. These advances have also allowed financial institutions and other companies to provide electronic and internet-based financial solutions, including electronic securities trading, payments processing and online automated algorithmic-based investment advice. Furthermore, both financial institutions and their non-banking competitors face the risk that payments processing and other services could be significantly disrupted by technologies, such as cryptocurrencies, that require no intermediation. New technologies have required and could require JPMorgan Chase to spend more to modify or adapt its products to attract and retain clients and customers or to match products and services offered by its competitors, including technology companies. In addition, new technologies may be used by customers, or breached or infiltrated by third parties, in unexpected ways, which can increase JPMorgan Chase’s costs for complying with laws and regulations that apply to the offering of products and services through those technologies and reduce the income


Part I

that JPMorgan Chase earns from providing products and services through those new technologies.

Ongoing or increased competition may put pressure on the pricing for JPMorgan Chase’s products and services or may cause JPMorgan Chase to lose market share, particularly with respect to traditional banking products such as deposits and bank accounts. This competition may be on the basis of quality and variety of products and services offered, transaction execution, innovation, reputation and price. The failure of any of JPMorgan Chase’s businesses to meet the expectations of clients and customers, whether due to general market conditions, under-performance, a decision not to offer a particular product or service, changes in client and customer expectations or other factors, could affect JPMorgan Chase’s ability to attract or retain clients and customers. Any such impact could, in turn, reduce JPMorgan Chase’s revenues. Increased competition also may require JPMorgan Chase to make additional capital investments in its businesses, or to extend more of its capital on behalf of its clients in order to remain competitive.

Climate change could have a material adverse impact on JPMorgan Chase’s business operations, clients and customers.

JPMorgan Chase operates in many regions, countries and communities around the world where its businesses, and the activities of its clients and customers, could be disrupted by climate change. Potential physical risks from climate change may include:

•

altered distribution and intensity of rainfall

•

prolonged droughts or flooding

•

increased frequency of wildfires

•

rising sea levels

•

rising heat index

In addition, these physical changes may prompt changes in regulations or consumer preferences which in turn could have negative consequences for the business models of JPMorgan Chase’s clients.

These climate driven changes could have a material adverse impact on asset values and the financial performance of JPMorgan Chase’s businesses, and those of its clients and customers.

Conduct

Conduct failure by JPMorgan Chase employees can harm clients and customers, impact market integrity, damage JPMorgan Chase’s reputation and trigger litigation and regulatory action.

JPMorgan Chase’s employees interact with clients, customers and counterparties, and with each other, every day. All employees are expected to demonstrate values and exhibit the behaviors that are an integral part of JPMorgan Chase’s How We Do Business Principles, including JPMorgan

Chase’s commitment to “do first class business in a first class way.” JPMorgan Chase endeavors to embed conduct risk management throughout an employee’s life cycle, including recruiting, onboarding, training and development, and performance management. Conduct risk management is also an integral component of JPMorgan Chase’s promotion and compensation processes.

Notwithstanding these expectations, policies and practices, certain employees have in the past engaged in improper or illegal conduct, and these instances of misconduct have resulted in litigation as well as resolutions of governmental investigations or enforcement actions involving consent orders, deferred prosecution agreements, non-prosecution agreements and other civil or criminal sanctions. There is no assurance that further inappropriate or unlawful actions by employees will not occur or that any such actions will always be detected, deterred or prevented.

JPMorgan Chase’s reputation could be harmed, and collateral consequences could result, from a failure by one or more employees to act consistently with JPMorgan Chase’s expectations, policies and practices, including by acting in ways that harm clients, customers, other market participants or other employees. Some examples of this include:

•

improperly selling and marketing JPMorgan Chase’s products or services

•

engaging in insider trading, market manipulation or unauthorized trading

•

facilitating illegal or aggressive tax-motivated transactions, or transactions designed to circumvent economic sanction programs

•

failing to fulfill fiduciary obligations or other duties owed to clients or customers

•

violating anti-trust or anti-competition laws by colluding with other market participants to manipulate markets, prices or indices

•

engaging in discriminatory behavior or harassment

•

making risk decisions in ways that subordinate JPMorgan Chase’s risk appetite to employee compensation objectives, and

•

misappropriating property, confidential or proprietary information, or technology assets belonging to JPMorgan Chase, its clients and customers or third parties.

The consequences of any failure by employees to act consistently with JPMorgan Chase’s expectations, policies or practices could include litigation, or regulatory or other governmental investigations or enforcement actions. Any of these proceedings or actions could result in judgments, settlements, fines, penalties or other sanctions, or lead to:

•

financial losses

•

increased operational and compliance costs


•

greater scrutiny by regulators and other parties

•

regulatory actions that require JPMorgan Chase to restructure, curtail or cease certain of its activities

•

the need for significant oversight by JPMorgan Chase’s management

•

loss of clients or customers, and

•

harm to JPMorgan Chase’s reputation.

Reputation

Damage to JPMorgan Chase’s reputation could harm its businesses.

Maintaining trust in JPMorgan Chase is critical to its ability to attract and retain clients, customers, investors and employees. Damage to JPMorgan Chase’s reputation can therefore cause significant harm to JPMorgan Chase’s business and prospects. Harm to JPMorgan Chase’s reputation can arise from numerous sources, including:

•

employee misconduct, including discriminatory behavior or harassment

•

security breaches, including cyberattacks

•

failure to safeguard client, customer or employee information

•

failure to manage environmental, social and sustainability risk issues associated with its business activities or those of its clients

•

compliance or operational failures

•

litigation or regulatory fines, penalties or other sanctions

•

regulatory investigations or enforcement actions, or resolutions of these matters, and

•

failure or perceived failure of clients, customers, counterparties or other parties to comply with laws or regulations, including companies in which JPMorgan Chase has made principal investments, parties to joint ventures with JPMorgan Chase, and vendors with which JPMorgan Chase does business.

JPMorgan Chase’s reputation may be significantly damaged by adverse publicity or negative information regarding JPMorgan Chase, whether or not true, that may be published or broadcast by the media or posted on social media, non-mainstream news services or other parts of the internet. This latter risk can be magnified by the speed and pervasiveness with which information is disseminated through those channels.

Social and environmental activists are increasingly targeting financial services firms such as JPMorgan Chase with public criticism for their relationships with clients that are engaged in certain sensitive industries, including businesses whose products are or are perceived to be harmful to human health, or whose activities negatively affect or are perceived to negatively affect the environment, workers’

rights or communities. Activists have also engaged in public protests at JPMorgan Chase’s headquarters and other properties. Activist criticism of JPMorgan Chase’s relationships with clients in sensitive industries could potentially engender dissatisfaction among clients, customers, investors and employees with how JPMorgan Chase addresses social and environmental concerns in its business activities. Alternatively, yielding to activism targeted at certain sensitive industries could damage JPMorgan Chase’s relationships with clients and customers, and with governmental bodies in jurisdictions in which JPMorgan Chase does business, whose views are not aligned with those of social and environmental activists. In either case, the resulting harm to JPMorgan Chase’s reputation could:

•

cause certain clients and customers to cease doing business with JPMorgan Chase

•

impair JPMorgan Chase’s ability to attract new clients and customers, or to expand its relationships with existing clients and customers

•

diminish JPMorgan Chase’s ability to hire or retain employees, or

•

prompt JPMorgan Chase to cease doing business with certain clients or customers.

Actions by the financial services industry generally or individuals in the industry can also affect JPMorgan Chase’s reputation. For example, concerns that consumers have been treated unfairly by a financial institution, or that a financial institution has acted inappropriately with respect to the methods used to offer products to customers, can damage the reputation of the industry as a whole. If JPMorgan Chase is perceived to have engaged in these types of behaviors, this could weaken its reputation among clients or customers.

Failure to effectively manage potential conflicts of interest can result in litigation and enforcement actions, as well as damage JPMorgan Chase’s reputation.

JPMorgan Chase’s ability to manage potential conflicts of interest is highly complex due to the broad range of its business activities which encompass a variety of transactions, obligations and interests with and among JPMorgan Chase’s clients and customers. JPMorgan Chase can become subject to litigation and enforcement actions, and its reputation can be damaged, by the failure or perceived failure to:

•

adequately address or appropriately disclose conflicts of interest, including potential conflicts of interest that may arise in connection with providing multiple products and services in the same transaction

•

deliver appropriate standards of service and quality

•

treat clients and customers with the appropriate standard of care


Part I

•

use client and customer data responsibly and in a manner that meets legal requirements and regulatory expectations

•

provide fiduciary products or services in accordance with the applicable legal and regulatory standards, or

•

handle or use confidential information of customers or clients appropriately or in compliance with applicable data protection and privacy laws and regulations.

In the future, a failure or perceived failure to appropriately address conflicts of interest or fiduciary obligations could result in customer dissatisfaction, litigation and regulatory fines, penalties or other sanctions, and heightened regulatory scrutiny and enforcement actions, all of which can lead to lost revenue and higher operating costs and cause serious harm to JPMorgan Chase’s reputation.

Country

An outbreak of hostilities between countries or within a country or region could have a material adverse effect on the global economy and on JPMorgan Chase’s businesses within the affected region or globally.

Aggressive actions by hostile governments or groups, including armed conflict or intensified cyberattacks, could expand in unpredictable ways by drawing in other countries or escalating into full-scale war with potentially catastrophic consequences, particularly if one or more of the combatants possess nuclear weapons. Depending on the scope of the conflict, the hostilities could result in:

•

worldwide economic disruption

•

heightened volatility in financial markets

•

severe declines in asset values, accompanied by widespread sell-offs of investments

•

substantial depreciation of local currencies, potentially leading to defaults by borrowers and counterparties in the affected region

•

disruption of global trade, and

•

diminished consumer, business and investor confidence.

Any of the above consequences could have significant negative effects on JPMorgan Chase’s operations and earnings, both in the countries or regions directly affected by the hostilities or globally. Further, if the U.S. were to become directly involved in such a conflict, this could lead to a curtailment of any operations that JPMorgan Chase may have in the affected countries or region, as well as in any nation that is aligned against the U.S. in the hostilities. JPMorgan Chase could also experience more numerous and aggressive cyberattacks launched by or under the sponsorship of one or more of the adversaries in such a conflict.

JPMorgan Chase’s business activities with governmental entities can pose an enhanced risk of loss.

Several of JPMorgan Chase’s businesses engage in transactions with, or trade in obligations of, governmental entities, including national, state, provincial, municipal and local authorities, both within and outside the U.S. These activities can expose JPMorgan Chase to enhanced sovereign, credit-related, operational and reputation risks, as governmental entities have in the past, and may in the future, taken actions such as:

•

defaulting on or restructuring their obligations

•

claiming that actions taken by government officials were beyond the legal authority of those officials, or

•

repudiating transactions authorized by a previous incumbent government.

Any or all of these actions could adversely affect JPMorgan Chase’s financial condition and results of operations and could hurt its reputation, particularly if JPMorgan Chase pursues claims against a government obligor in a jurisdiction in which it has significant business relationships with clients or customers.

JPMorgan Chase’s business and revenues in emerging markets can be hampered by local economic, political, regulatory and social factors.

Some of the countries in which JPMorgan Chase conducts business have economies or markets that are less developed and more volatile, and may have legal and regulatory regimes that are less established or predictable, than the U.S. and other developed markets in which JPMorgan Chase operates. Some of these countries have in the past experienced severe economic disruptions, including:

•

extreme currency fluctuations

•

high inflation

•

low or negative growth, and

•

defaults or potential defaults on sovereign debt.

The governments in these countries have sometimes reacted to these developments by imposing restrictive policies that adversely affect the local and regional business environment, including:

•

price, capital or exchange controls, including imposition of punitive transfer and convertibility restrictions

•

expropriation or nationalization of assets or confiscation of property, including intellectual property, and

•

changes in laws and regulations.

The impact of these actions could be accentuated in trading markets that are smaller, less liquid and more volatile than more-developed markets. These types of government actions can negatively affect JPMorgan Chase’s operations


in the relevant country, either directly or by suppressing the business activities of local clients or multi-national clients that conduct business in the jurisdiction. For example, some or all of these governmental actions can result in funds belonging to JPMorgan Chase, or that it places with a local custodian on behalf of a client, being effectively trapped in a country. In addition to the ultimate risk of losing the funds entirely, JPMorgan Chase could be exposed for an extended period of time to the credit risk of a local custodian that is now operating in a deteriorating domestic economy.

In addition, emerging markets countries, as well as certain more developed countries, have been susceptible to unfavorable social developments arising from poor economic conditions and related governmental actions, as well as natural disasters, including:

•

social unrest

•

general strikes and demonstrations

•

crime and corruption

•

security and personal safety issues

•

outbreaks of hostilities

•

overthrow of incumbent governments

•

terrorist attacks, and

•

other forms of internal discord.

These economic, political, regulatory and social developments have in the past resulted in, and in the future could lead to, conditions that can adversely affect JPMorgan Chase’s operations in those countries and impair the revenues, growth and profitability of those operations. In addition, any of these events or circumstances in one country can affect JPMorgan Chase’s operations and investments in another country or countries, including in the U.S.

People

JPMorgan Chase’s ability to attract and retain qualified employees is critical to its success.

JPMorgan Chase’s employees are its most important resource, and in many areas of the financial services industry, competition for qualified personnel is intense. JPMorgan Chase endeavors to attract talented and diverse new employees and retain and motivate its existing employees. If JPMorgan Chase were unable to continue to attract or retain qualified employees, including successors to the Chief Executive Officer or members of the Operating Committee, JPMorgan Chase’s performance, including its competitive position, could be materially and adversely affected.

Unfavorable changes in immigration policies could adversely affect the quality of JPMorgan Chase’s businesses and operations.

JPMorgan Chase relies on the skills, knowledge and expertise of employees located throughout the world. Changes in immigration policies in the U.S. and other countries that unduly restrict or otherwise make it more difficult for employees or their family members to work in, or transfer among, jurisdictions in which JPMorgan Chase has operations or conducts its business could inhibit JPMorgan Chase’s ability to attract and retain qualified employees, and thereby dilute the quality of its workforce, or could prompt JPMorgan Chase to make structural changes to its worldwide operating model that are less efficient or more costly.

Legal

JPMorgan Chase faces significant legal risks from private actions and formal and informal regulatory and government investigations.

JPMorgan Chase is named as a defendant or is otherwise involved in many legal proceedings, including class actions and other litigation or disputes with third parties. Actions currently pending against JPMorgan Chase may result in judgments, settlements, fines, penalties or other sanctions adverse to JPMorgan Chase. Any of these matters could materially and adversely affect JPMorgan Chase’s business, financial condition or results of operations, or cause serious reputational harm. As a participant in the financial services industry, it is likely that JPMorgan Chase will continue to experience a high level of litigation and regulatory and government investigations related to its businesses and operations.

Regulators and other government agencies conduct examinations of JPMorgan Chase and its subsidiaries both on a routine basis and in targeted exams, and JPMorgan Chase’s businesses and operations are subject to heightened regulatory oversight. This heightened regulatory scrutiny, or the results of such an investigation or examination, may lead to additional regulatory investigations or enforcement actions. There is no assurance that those actions will not result in resolutions or other enforcement actions against JPMorgan Chase. Furthermore, a single event involving a potential violation of law or regulation may give rise to numerous and overlapping investigations and proceedings, either by multiple federal, state or local agencies and officials in the U.S. or, in some instances, regulators and other governmental officials in non-U.S. jurisdictions.

If another financial institution violates a law or regulation relating to a particular business activity or practice, this will often give rise to an investigation by regulators and other governmental agencies of the same or similar activity or practice by JPMorgan Chase.


Part I

These and other initiatives by U.S. and non-U.S. governmental authorities may subject JPMorgan Chase to judgments, settlements, fines, penalties or other sanctions, and may require JPMorgan Chase to restructure its operations and activities or to cease offering certain products or services. All of these potential outcomes could harm JPMorgan Chase’s reputation or lead to higher operational costs, thereby reducing JPMorgan Chase’s profitability, or result in collateral consequences. In addition, the extent of JPMorgan Chase’s exposure to legal and regulatory matters can be unpredictable and could, in some cases, exceed the amount of reserves that JPMorgan Chase has established for those matters.

Item 9A. Controls and Procedures.

The internal control framework promulgated by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”), “Internal Control — Integrated Framework” (“COSO 2013”), provides guidance for designing, implementing and conducting internal control and assessing its effectiveness. The Firm used the COSO 2013 framework to assess the effectiveness of the Firm’s internal control over financial reporting as of

December 31, 2019

. Refer to “Management’s report on internal control over financial reporting” on

page 142

.

As of the end of the period covered by this report, an evaluation was carried out under the supervision and with the participation of the Firm’s management, including its Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and its Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of its disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934). Based on that evaluation, the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer concluded that these disclosure controls and procedures were effective. Refer to Exhibits 31.1 and 31.2 for the Certifications furnished by the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, respectively.

The Firm is committed to maintaining high standards of internal control over financial reporting. Nevertheless, because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. In addition, in a firm as large and complex as JPMorgan Chase, lapses or deficiencies in internal controls may occur from time to time, and there can be no assurance that any such deficiencies will not result in significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in internal control in the future and collateral consequences therefrom. Refer to “Management’s report on internal control over financial reporting” on

page 142

for further information. There was no change in the Firm’s internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) that occurred during the

three months ended

December 31, 2019

, that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Firm’s internal control over financial reporting.

(a)

The Basel III capital rules became fully phased-in effective January 1, 2019. Prior to this date, the required capital measures were subject to the transitional rules which, as of December 31, 2018, were the same on a fully phased-in and transitional basis. Refer to Capital Risk Management on

pages 85–92

for additional information on these measures.

Comparisons noted in the sections below are for the full year of 2019 versus the full year of 2018, unless otherwise specified.

Firmwide overview

JPMorgan Chase reported strong results for


, with record revenue, net income and EPS of $115.6 billion, $36.4 billion and $10.72 per share, respectively. The Firm reported ROE of 15% and ROTCE of 19%.

•

Net income was $36.4 billion, up 12%.

•

Total net revenue increased 6%. Net interest income was $57.2 billion, up 4%, driven by continued balance sheet growth and mix as well as higher average short-term rates, partially offset by higher deposit pay rates. Noninterest revenue was $58.4 billion, up 8%, driven by growth across CCB as well as higher Markets revenue in CIB. Noninterest revenue included approximately $500 million of gains on the sales of certain mortgage loans in Home Lending.

•

Noninterest expense was $65.5 billion, up 3%, driven by continued investments across the businesses including employees, technology, real estate, and marketing, as well as higher volume- and revenue-related expenses, including depreciation expense on auto lease assets, partially offset by lower FDIC charges.

•

Income tax expense included $1.1 billion of tax benefits related to the resolution of certain tax audits.

•

The provision for credit losses was $5.6 billion, up $714 million, reflecting increases in both wholesale and consumer. The increase in the wholesale provision reflects additions to the allowance for credit losses in the current year on select client downgrades. The prior year reflected a benefit related to a single name in the Oil & Gas portfolio and higher recoveries. The increase in the consumer provision reflects higher net charge-offs and additions to the allowance for loan losses in Card, predominantly offset by a higher reduction in the allowance for loan losses in Home Lending. The prior year also benefited from larger recoveries in Home Lending on loan sales.

•

The total allowance for credit losses was $14.3 billion at

December 31, 2019

, and the Firm had a loan loss coverage ratio of 1.39%, flat compared with the prior year; excluding the PCI portfolio, the equivalent ratio was 1.31% compared with 1.23% in the prior year. The Firm’s nonperforming assets totaled $4.5 billion at

December 31, 2019

, a decrease from $5.2 billion in the prior year, primarily reflecting paydowns in the wholesale portfolio and improved credit performance in the consumer portfolio.

•

Firmwide average total loans of $955 billion were up 1%, or up 3% excluding the impact of certain loan sales in Home Lending.

Selected capital-related metrics

•

The Firm’s CET1 capital was $188 billion, and the Standardized and Advanced CET1 ratios were 12.4% and 13.4%, respectively.

•

The Firm’s SLR was 6.3%.

•

The Firm continued to grow tangible book value per share (“TBVPS”), ending 2019 at $60.98, up 8%.

ROTCE and TBVPS are non-GAAP financial measures. Refer to Explanation and Reconciliation of the Firm’s Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Key Performance Measures on

Recent events

On February 25, 2020, JPMorgan Chase announced additional steps in its initiatives to address climate change and further promote sustainable development. This year, JPMorgan Chase commits to facilitate $200 billion to advance the objectives of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), including $50 billion toward green initiatives.  The new commitment is intended to address a broader set of challenges in the developing world and developed countries where social and economic development gaps persist. As part of this commitment, the Firm had previously announced the creation of the J.P. Morgan Development Finance Institution to expand its financing activities for developing countries.

On December 18, 2019, JPMorgan Chase announced that the China Securities Regulatory Commission has approved the application of J.P. Morgan Securities (China) Company Limited for a Securities and Futures Business Permit. This approval allows J.P. Morgan’s majority-owned securities company in China to commence operations.

2020 outlook

These current expectations are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such forward-looking statements are based on the current beliefs and expectations of JPMorgan Chase’s management and are subject to significant risks and uncertainties. Refer to Forward-Looking Statements on

page 141

, and the Risk Factors section on

pages 6–28

of the Firm’s 2019 Form 10-K, for a further discussion of certain of those risks and uncertainties and the other factors that could cause JPMorgan Chase’s actual results to differ materially because of those risks and uncertainties. There is no assurance that actual results in 2019 will be in line with the outlook set forth below, and the Firm does not undertake to update any forward-looking statements.

JPMorgan Chase’s outlook for 2020 should be viewed against the backdrop of the global and U.S. economies, financial markets activity, the geopolitical environment, the competitive environment, client and customer activity levels, and regulatory and legislative developments in the U.S. and other countries where the Firm does business. Each of these factors will affect the performance of the Firm and its LOBs. The Firm will continue to make appropriate adjustments to its businesses and operations in response to ongoing developments in the business, economic, regulatory, and legal environments in which it operates.

Firmwide full-year 2020

•

Management expects full-year 2020 net interest income, on a managed basis, to be approximately $57 billion, market dependent, reflecting the impact of lower interest rates offset by balance sheet growth and mix.

•

The Firm continues to take a disciplined approach to managing expenses, while investing for growth and innovation. As a result, management expects Firmwide adjusted expense for the full-year 2020 to be approximately $67 billion.

•

The Firm continues to experience charge-off rates at very low levels, reflecting favorable credit trends across the consumer and wholesale portfolios. Management expects full-year 2020 net charge-offs to be just over $6 billion, an increase from prior year, driven by Card on growth and mix.

•

Management expects the full-year 2020 effective tax rate, on a reported basis, to be approximately 20%, and approximately 5 to 7 percentage points higher on a managed basis.

First-quarter 2020

•

Management expects first-quarter 2020 net interest income, on a managed basis, to be approximately $14.2 billion, market dependent.

•

Firmwide adjusted expense for the first-quarter 2020 is expected to be approximately $17 billion.

•

The effective tax rate, on a reported basis, for the first quarter of 2020 is expected to be approximately 17% largely as a result of tax benefits related to the vesting of employee share-based awards.

•

Markets revenue for the first-quarter of 2020 is expected to be higher when compared with the prior-year quarter by mid-teens percentage points, depending on market conditions.

Management’s discussion and analysis

Business Developments

Departure of the U.K. from the EU

The U.K.’s departure from the EU, which is commonly referred to as “Brexit,” occurred on January 31, 2020.

Following this departure, the U.K. has entered a transition period that is scheduled to expire on December 31, 2020. The purpose of the transition period is to enable the U.K. and the EU to negotiate the terms of their future relationship. The transition period can be extended, but both sides need to agree to extend it by July 1, 2020. It is not clear whether the terms of the future relationship can be agreed before the end of 2020, and so significant uncertainty remains about the relationship between the U.K. and the EU after the end of the transition period.

The Firm has a long-standing presence in the U.K., which currently serves as the regional headquarters of the Firm’s operations in over 30 countries across Europe, the Middle East, and Africa (“EMEA”). In the region, the Firm serves clients and customers across its business segments. The Firm has approximately 17,000 employees in the U.K., of which approximately two-thirds are in London, with operational and technology support centers in locations such as Bournemouth, Glasgow and Edinburgh.

In light of the ongoing uncertainty, the Firm continues to execute the relevant elements of its Firmwide Brexit Implementation program with the objective of being able to continue delivering the Firm’s capabilities to its EU clients.  The program covers strategic implementation across all impacted businesses and functions and includes an ongoing assessment of implementation risks including political, legal and regulatory risks and plans for addressing and mitigating those risks under any scenario, including where the U.K. and the EU fail to reach an agreement on their future relationship by the end of 2020 and the transition period is not extended.

The principal operational risks associated with Brexit continue to be the potential for disruption caused by insufficient preparations by individual market participants or in the overall market ecosystem, and risks related to potential disruptions of connectivity among market participants. There continues to be regulatory and legal uncertainty with respect to various matters including contract continuity, access by market participants to liquidity in certain products, such as products subject to potentially conflicting U.K. and EU regulatory requirements in relation to eligible trading venues, including certain cross-border derivative contracts and equities that are listed on both U.K. and EU exchanges, as well as ongoing access to central banks. It is uncertain as to whether any of these issues will be resolved in the negotiations, or whether any of the previous temporary solutions will be available at the end of the transition period to mitigate these risks.

The Firm is focused on the following key areas to ensure continuation of service to its EU clients: regulatory and legal entity readiness; client readiness; and business and operational readiness. Following are the significant updates.

Regulatory and legal entity readiness

The Firm’s legal entities in Germany, Luxembourg and Ireland are now prepared and licensed to provide services to the Firm’s EU clients, including a branch network covering locations such as Paris, Madrid and Milan.

Client readiness

The agreements covering a significant proportion of the Firm’s EU client activity have been re-documented to other EU legal entities to help facilitate continuation of service. The Firm continues to actively engage with clients that have not completed re-documentation to ensure preparedness both in terms of documentation and any operational changes that may be required. The Firm may be negatively impacted by any operational disruption stemming from delays of or lapses in the readiness of other market participants or market infrastructures.

Business and operational readiness

The Firm relocated certain employees during 2019 and added specific employees to certain EU legal entities, where appropriate, to support the level of client activity that has been migrated. The Firm’s longer term staffing plan will develop in accordance with the increasing level of activity in the EU entities and alongside the future legal and regulatory framework between the U.K. and EU. The Firm continues to closely monitor legislative developments, and its implementation plan allows for flexibility given the continued uncertainties.


JPMorgan Chase & Co./2019 Form 10-K

IBOR transition

As a result of the expected discontinuation of certain unsecured benchmark interest rates, including the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) and other Interbank Offered Rates (“IBORs”) regulators and market participants in various jurisdictions have been working to identify alternative reference rates that are compliant with the International Organization of Securities Commission’s standards for transaction-based benchmarks. In the U.S., the Alternative Reference Rates Committee (the “ARRC”), a group of market and official sector participants, identified the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”) as its recommended alternative benchmark rate. Other alternative reference rates have been recommended in other jurisdictions. Industry sources estimate that IBORs are referenced in approximately $400 trillion of wholesale and consumer transactions globally spanning a broad range of financial products and contracts. The Firm has a significant number of IBOR-referenced contracts, including derivatives, bilateral and syndicated loans, securities, and debt and preferred stock issuances.

To manage the risks associated with the transition from IBORs, JPMorgan Chase established a Firmwide LIBOR Transition program in early 2018 that is overseen by the Firmwide CFO and the CEO of the CIB. When assessing risks associated with IBOR transition, the program monitors a variety of scenarios, including disorderly transition, measured/regulated transition considering volatility along the SOFR curve and clearinghouse plans to change their discount rates to alternative reference rates, and IBOR in continuity beyond December 2021.

The Firm continues to monitor and facilitate the transition by clients from IBOR-referencing products to products referencing alternative reference rates. The Firm’s transition efforts to date include:

•

ongoing implementation of new fallback provisions that provide for the determination of replacement rates for LIBOR-linked syndicated loans, securitizations, floating rate notes and bi-lateral business loans based on the recommendations of the ARRC, and introducing SOFR as a replacement benchmark rate for certain of these products;

•

planning to adopt further fallback provisions recommended by the ARRC, including for residential ARMs, in conjunction with the adoption of these provisions by market participants; and

•

completing its first bilateral SOFR loan in the U.S. and executing its first interest rate swap linked to the Euro short-term rate in Europe.

Market participants are continuing to work closely with the public sector as part of National Working Groups (“NWGs”) towards the common goal of facilitating an orderly transition from IBORs. Current NWG efforts include the continued development of cash and derivative markets referencing alternative reference rates, as well as the development of industry consensus for fallback language that would determine the replacement rates to use in various IBOR-indexed contracts when a particular IBOR ceases to be produced. The Firm is monitoring and providing input in the development of the IBOR Fallbacks Protocol of the International Swaps and Derivatives Association (“ISDA”), which is expected to be published in 2020, and is encouraging its clients to actively participate in ISDA and industry consultations in order to ensure the broadest possible industry engagement in and understanding of IBOR transition. The Firm continues to monitor the development of alternative reference rates in other jurisdictions with NWGs.

The Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) has confirmed that it will issue an accounting standards update in 2020 providing optional expedients and exceptions for applying generally accepted accounting principles to contracts and hedge relationships affected by benchmark reform. The International Accounting Standards Board (“IASB”) has made amendments to IFRS hedge accounting requirements that provide relief to market participants on the accounting treatment of IBOR-linked products in the period leading up to the expected cessation of IBORs and is also considering further relief for the accounting impacts upon transition to an alternative reference rate.

The U.S. Treasury Department has issued proposed regulations that are intended to avoid adverse tax consequences in connection with the transition from IBORs. Under the proposed regulations, amendments to contracts meeting certain requirements will not be treated as taxable for U.S. federal income tax purposes.

The Firm continues to monitor the transition relief being considered by the FASB, IASB and U.S. Treasury Department regarding accounting and tax implications of reference rate reform. The Firm also continues to develop and implement plans to appropriately mitigate the risks associated with IBOR discontinuation as identified alternative reference rates develop and liquidity in these rates increases. The Firm will continue to engage with regulators and clients as the transition from IBORs progresses.

December 31, 2019

, unless otherwise specified. Refer to Consolidated Results of Operations on pages 48-51 of the Firm’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018 (the “2018 Form 10-K”) for a discussion of the 2018 versus 2017 results. Factors that relate primarily to a single business segment are discussed in more detail within that business segment. Refer to

pages 136–138

for a discussion of the Critical Accounting Estimates Used by the Firm that affect the Consolidated Results of Operations.

Effective January 1, 2018, the Firm adopted several accounting standards. Certain of the accounting standards were applied retrospectively and, accordingly, prior period amounts were revised. Refer to Note 1 for additional information.

(a)

Included operating lease income of

$5.5 billion

,

$4.5 billion

and

$3.6 billion

for the years ended

December 31, 2019

,


and


, respectively.

2019 compared with 2018

Investment banking fees

were relatively flat, reflecting in CIB:

•

higher debt underwriting fees driven by wallet share gains and increased activity in investment-grade and high-yield bonds,

offset by

•

lower advisory fees driven by a decline in industry-wide fees despite wallet share gains.

Refer to CIB segment results on

pages 66-70

and Note


for additional information.

Principal transactions revenue

increased reflecting:

•

higher revenue in CIB, which included a gain on the initial public offering (“IPO”) of Tradeweb in the second quarter of 2019. Excluding this gain, the increase in CIB’s revenue was driven by:

–

higher revenue in Fixed Income Markets, reflecting an overall strong performance, primarily in agency mortgage trading within Securitized Products; the increase in 2019 also reflected the impact of challenging market conditions in Credit in the fourth quarter of 2018; and

–

the favorable impact of tighter funding spreads on derivatives in Credit Adjustments & Other.

The net increase in CIB was partially offset by

•

lower revenue in AWM related to hedges on certain investments. The impact of these hedges was more than offset by higher valuation gains on the related investments reflected in other income

Principal transactions revenue in Corporate was relatively flat, reflecting the combined impact of losses on cash deployment transactions in Treasury and CIO, which were more than offset by the related net interest income earned on those transactions, and lower net markdowns on certain legacy private equity investments.

Principal transactions revenue in CIB may in certain cases have offsets across other revenue lines, including net interest income. The Firm assesses its CIB Markets business performance on a total revenue basis.

Refer to CIB, AWM and Corporate segment results on

pages 66-70

,

pages 74–76

and

pages 77–78

, respectively, and Note


for additional information.

Lending- and deposit-related fees

increased primarily due to higher deposit-related fees in CCB, reflecting growth in customer accounts and transactions, and higher lending-related commitment fees in the wholesale businesses.

Refer to CCB, CIB and CB segment results on

pages 62–65

,

pages 66-70

and

pages 71–73

, respectively, and Note


for additional information.

Asset management, administration and commissions revenue

increased primarily due to higher asset management fees from growth in client investment assets in CCB.

Refer to CCB and AWM segment results on

pages 62–65

and

pages 74–76

, respectively, and Note


for additional information.

Investment securities gains/(losses)

in both periods reflect the impact of repositioning the investment securities portfolio. Refer to Corporate segment results on

pages 77–78

and Note


for additional information.


JPMorgan Chase & Co./2019 Form 10-K

Mortgage fees and related income

increased driven by:

•

higher net mortgage production revenue reflecting approximately $500 million of gains on sales of certain loans, as well as higher mortgage production volumes and margins,

partially offset by

•

lower net mortgage servicing revenue driven by lower operating revenue reflecting faster prepayment speeds on lower rates and the impact of reclassifying certain loans to held-for-sale.

Refer to CCB segment results on

pages 62–65

, Note


and


for further information.

Card income

increased as the prior year included an adjustment of approximately $330 million to the credit card rewards liability. Excluding this item, Card income was relatively flat. Refer to CCB segment results on

pages 62–65

and Note


for further information.

Other income

increased reflecting:

•

higher operating lease income from growth in auto operating lease volume in CCB, and

•

higher investment valuation gains in AWM, which were largely offset by the impact of the related hedges that were reflected in principal transactions revenue,

largely offset by

•

lower other income in CIB largely related to increased amortization on a higher level of alternative energy investments. The increased amortization was more than offset by lower income tax expense from the associated tax credits.

The prior year included:

•

$505 million of fair value gains related to the adoption in the first quarter of 2018 of the recognition and measurement accounting guidance for certain equity investments previously held at cost.

Refer to Note


for further information.

Net interest income

increased driven by continued balance sheet growth and changes in mix, as well as higher average short-term rates, partially offset by higher rates paid on deposits.

The Firm’s average interest-earning assets were $2.3 trillion, up $133 billion, and the yield was 3.61%, up 14 bps. The net yield on these assets, on an FTE basis, was 2.46%, a decrease of 6 bps. The net yield excluding CIB Markets was 3.27%, up 2bps.

Net yield excluding CIB Markets is a non-GAAP financial measure. Refer to Explanation and Reconciliation of the Firm’s Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Key Performance Measures on

pages 57–59

for a further discussion of this measure.

Management’s discussion and analysis

2019 compared with 2018

The

provision for credit losses

increased driven by both the wholesale and consumer portfolios.

The increase in the

wholesale

provision reflects additions to the allowance for credit losses in the current year on select client downgrades. The prior year reflected a benefit related to a single name in the Oil & Gas portfolio and higher recoveries.

The increase in the

total consumer

provision reflects:

•

an increase in credit card due to

–

higher net charge-offs on loan growth, in line with expectations, and

–

a $500 million addition to the allowance for loan losses reflecting loan growth and higher loss rates, as newer vintages season and become a larger part of the portfolio, compared to a $300 million addition in the prior year

largely offset by

•

a decrease in consumer, excluding credit card, in CCB due to

–

a $650 million reduction in the allowance for loan losses in the purchase credit-impaired (“PCI”) residential real estate portfolio, reflecting continued improvement in home prices and delinquencies, and a $100 million reduction in the allowance for loan losses in the non credit-impaired residential real estate portfolio, compared to a $250 million reduction in the PCI residential real estate portfolio in the prior year, and

–

a $50 million reduction in the allowance for loan losses in the business banking portfolio

partially offset by

–

lower net recoveries in the residential real estate portfolio as the prior year benefited from larger recoveries on loan sales.

and

$(35) million

for the years ended

December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017

$1.2 billion

and

$1.5 billion

for the years ended

December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017

, respectively.

2019 compared with 2018

Compensation expense

increased driven by investments across the businesses, including front office, as well as technology staff hires.

Noncompensation expense

increased as a result of:

•

higher investments across the businesses, including technology, real estate and marketing

•

higher volume-related expense, including depreciation from growth in auto lease assets in CCB, and brokerage expense in certain businesses in CIB

•

higher legal expense, and

•

higher pension costs due to changes to actuarial assumptions and estimates,

largely offset by

•

lower FDIC charges as a result of the elimination of the surcharge at the end of the third quarter of 2018

•

the impact of efficiencies

•

lower other regulatory-related assessments in CIB.

The prior year included a loss of $174 million on the liquidation of a legal entity in Corporate recorded in other expense. Refer to Note


for additional information on the liquidation of a legal entity.

2019 compared with 2018

The

effective tax rate

decreased due to the recognition of $1.1 billion of tax benefits related to the resolution of certain tax audits, and changes in the mix of income and expense subject to U.S. federal, and state and local taxes. The decrease was partially offset by lower tax benefits related to the vesting of employee share-based awards. In addition, the prior year included a $302 million net tax benefit resulting from changes in the estimates under the TCJA related to the remeasurement of certain deferred taxes and the deemed repatriation tax on non-U.S. earnings.

Management’s discussion and analysis

CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS AND CASH FLOWS ANALYSIS

Consolidated balance sheets analysis

The following is a discussion of the significant changes between

December 31, 2019

and


.

Cash and due from banks and deposits with banks

decreased primarily as a result of a shift in the deployment of cash to investment securities, and net maturities of short-term borrowings and long term debt in Treasury and CIO, partially offset by an increase in deposits. Deposits with banks reflect the Firm’s placements of its excess cash with various central banks, including the Federal Reserve Banks.

Federal funds sold and securities purchased under resale agreements

decreased as a result of client-driven market-making activities in Fixed Income Markets in CIB and a shift in the deployment of cash in Treasury and CIO. Refer to Liquidity Risk Management on

pages 93–98

and Note


for additional information.

Securities borrowed

increased in CIB related to client-driven market-making activities in Fixed Income Markets, and to cover customer short positions in prime brokerage. Refer to Liquidity Risk Management on

pages 93–98

and Note


for additional information.

Trading assets

was relatively flat, reflecting:

•

a reduction in short-term instruments associated with cash deployment activities in Treasury and CIO,

offset by

•

growth in client-driven activities in CIB Markets, primarily debt instruments, and

•

in CCB, growth related to originations of mortgage warehouse loans, resulting from the favorable rate environment.

Refer to Notes


and


for additional information.

Investment securities

increased primarily due to net purchases of U.S. Treasuries and U.S. GSE and government agency MBS in Treasury and CIO. The net purchases were primarily driven by cash deployment and interest rate risk management activities. Refer to Corporate segment results on

pages 77–78

, Investment Portfolio Risk Management on

page 118

and Notes


and


for additional information on investment securities.

Loans

decreased reflecting loan sales in Home Lending, and lower loans in CIB, primarily driven by a loan syndication and net paydowns, partially offset by growth in AWM and Card.

The allowance for loan losses

decreased driven by:

•

an $800 million reduction in the CCB allowance for loan losses, which included $650 million in the PCI residential real estate portfolio, reflecting continued improvement in home prices and delinquencies; $100 million in the non credit-impaired residential real estate portfolio; and $50 million in the business banking portfolio; as well as

•

a $151 million reduction for write-offs of PCI loans,

largely offset by

•

a $500 million addition to the allowance for loan losses in the credit card portfolio reflecting loan growth and  higher loss rates as newer vintages season and become a larger part of the portfolio, and

•

a $115 million addition in the wholesale allowance for loan losses driven by select client downgrades.

and


for further discussion of loans and the allowance for loan losses.


JPMorgan Chase & Co./2019 Form 10-K

Premises and equipment

increased primarily due to the adoption of the new lease accounting guidance effective January 1, 2019. Refer to Note


for additional information.

Goodwill, MSRs and other intangibles

decreased reflecting lower MSRs as a result of the realization of expected cash flows and faster prepayment speeds on lower rates, partially offset by net additions to the MSRs. The decrease

in MSRs was partially offset by an increase in goodwill related to the acquisition of InstaMed. Refer to Note


for additional information.

Other assets

increased reflecting higher cash collateral placed with central counterparties in CIB, and higher auto operating lease assets from growth in the business in CCB.

Deposits

increased reflecting:

•

Management’s discussion and analysis

Consolidated cash flows analysis

The following is a discussion of cash flow activities during the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018. Refer to Consolidated cash flows analysis on page 54 of the Firm’s 2018 Form 10-K for a discussion of the 2017 activities.

Operating activities

JPMorgan Chase’s operating assets and liabilities primarily support the Firm’s lending and capital markets activities. These assets and liabilities can vary significantly in the normal course of business due to the amount and timing of cash flows, which are affected by client-driven and risk management activities and market conditions. The Firm believes that cash flows from operations, available cash and other liquidity sources, and its capacity to generate cash through secured and unsecured sources, are sufficient to meet its operating liquidity needs.

•

In 2019, cash provided primarily reflected net income excluding noncash adjustments and net proceeds of sales, securitizations, and paydowns of loans held-for-sale, partially offset by higher securities borrowed, an increase in other assets and a decrease in trading liabilities.

•

In 2018, cash provided primarily reflected net income excluding noncash adjustments, increased trading liabilities and accounts payable and other liabilities, partially offset by an increase in trading assets and net originations of loans held-for-sale.

Investing activities

The Firm’s investing activities predominantly include originating held-for-investment loans and investing in the investment securities portfolio and other short-term instruments.

•

In 2019, cash used reflected net purchases of investment securities, partially offset by lower securities purchased under resale agreements, and net proceeds from sales and securitizations of loans held-for-investment.

•

In 2018, cash used reflected an increase in securities purchased under resale agreements, higher net originations of loans and net purchases of investment securities.

Financing activities

The Firm’s financing activities include acquiring customer deposits and issuing long-term debt, as well as preferred and common stock.

•

In 2019, cash provided reflected higher deposits, partially offset by a decrease in short-term borrowings and net payments of long term borrowings.

•

In 2018, cash provided reflected higher deposits, short-term borrowings, and securities loaned or sold under repurchase agreements, partially offset by net payments of long term borrowings.

•

For both periods, cash was used for repurchases of common stock and cash dividends on common and preferred stock.

OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS AND CONTRACTUAL CASH OBLIGATIONS

In the normal course of business, the Firm enters into various off-balance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations that may require future cash payments. Certain obligations are recognized on-balance sheet, while others are disclosed off-balance sheet under accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (“U.S. GAAP”).

Special-purpose entities

The Firm has several types of off–balance sheet arrangements, including through nonconsolidated special-purpose entities (“SPEs”), which are a type of VIE, and through lending-related financial instruments (e.g., commitments and guarantees).

The Firm holds capital, as appropriate, against all SPE-related transactions and related exposures, such as derivative contracts and lending-related commitments and guarantees.

The Firm has no commitments to issue its own stock to support any SPE transaction, and its policies require that transactions with SPEs be conducted at arm’s length and reflect market pricing. Consistent with this policy, no JPMorgan Chase employee is permitted to invest in SPEs with which the Firm is involved where such investment would violate the Firm’s Code of Conduct.

The table below provides an index of where in this 2019 Form 10-K a discussion of the Firm’s various off-balance sheet arrangements can be found. Refer to Note

JPMorgan Chase & Co./2019 Form 10-K

EXPLANATION AND RECONCILIATION OF THE FIRM’S USE OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES AND KEY PERFORMANCE MEASURES

Non-GAAP financial measures

The Firm prepares its Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP; these financial statements appear on

pages 146–150

. That presentation, which is referred to as “reported” basis, provides the reader with an understanding of the Firm’s results that can be tracked consistently from year-to-year and enables a comparison of the Firm’s performance with other companies’ U.S. GAAP financial statements.

In addition to analyzing the Firm’s results on a reported basis, management reviews Firmwide results, including the overhead ratio, on a “managed” basis; these Firmwide managed basis results are non-GAAP financial measures. The Firm also reviews the results of the LOBs on a managed basis. The Firm’s definition of managed basis starts, in each case, with the reported U.S. GAAP results and includes certain reclassifications to present total net revenue for the Firm (and each of the reportable business segments) on an FTE basis. Accordingly, revenue from investments that receive tax credits and tax-exempt securities is presented in the managed results on a basis comparable to taxable investments and securities. These financial measures allow

management to assess the comparability of revenue from year-to-year arising from both taxable and tax-exempt sources. The corresponding income tax impact related to tax-exempt items is recorded within income tax expense. These adjustments have no impact on net income as reported by the Firm as a whole or by the LOBs.

Management also uses certain non-GAAP financial measures at the Firm and business-segment level, because these other non-GAAP financial measures provide information to investors about the underlying operational performance and trends of the Firm or of the particular business segment, as the case may be, and, therefore, facilitate a comparison of the Firm or the business segment with the performance of its relevant competitors. Refer to Business Segment Results on

pages 60–78

for additional information on these non-GAAP measures. Non-GAAP financial measures used by the Firm may not be comparable to similarly named non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies.

The following summary table provides a reconciliation from the Firm’s reported U.S. GAAP results to managed basis.

(a) Predominantly recognized in CIB, CB and Corporate.

(b) The decrease in fully taxable-equivalent adjustments for the year ended December 31, 2018, reflects the impact of the TCJA.

JPMorgan Chase & Co./2019 Form 10-K


Management’s discussion and analysis

Net interest income and net yield excluding CIB’s Markets businesses

In addition to reviewing net interest income and the net yield on a managed basis, management also reviews these metrics excluding CIB’s Markets businesses, as shown below; these metrics, which exclude CIB’s Markets businesses, are non-GAAP financial measures. Management reviews these metrics to assess the performance of the Firm’s lending, investing (including asset-liability management) and deposit-raising activities. The resulting metrics that exclude CIB’s Markets businesses are referred to as non-markets-related net interest income and net yield. CIB’s Markets businesses are Fixed Income Markets and Equity Markets. Management believes that disclosure of non-markets-related net interest income and net yield provides investors and analysts with other measures by which to analyze the non-markets-related business trends of the Firm and provides a comparable measure to other financial institutions that are primarily focused on lending, investing and deposit-raising activities.

(a)

Interest includes the effect of related hedges. Taxable-equivalent amounts are used where applicable.

(b)

Refer to page


for further information on CIB’s Markets businesses.

(c)

In the second quarter of 2019, the Firm reclassified balances related to certain instruments from interest-earning to noninterest-earning assets, as the associated returns are recorded in principal transactions revenue and not in net interest income. These changes were applied retrospectively and, accordingly, prior period amounts were revised to conform with the current presentation.

The Firm also reviews adjusted expense, which is noninterest expense excluding Firmwide legal expense and is therefore a non-GAAP financial measure. Additionally, certain credit metrics and ratios disclosed by the Firm exclude PCI loans, and are therefore non-GAAP measures. Management believes that these measures help investors understand the effect of these items on reported results and provide an alternate presentation of the Firm’s performance. Refer to Credit and Investment Risk Management on

pages 100–118

for additional information on credit metrics and ratios excluding PCI loans.


JPMorgan Chase & Co./2019 Form 10-K

Tangible common equity, ROTCE and TBVPS

Tangible common equity (“TCE”), ROTCE and TBVPS are each non-GAAP financial measures. TCE represents the Firm’s common stockholders’ equity (i.e., total stockholders’ equity less preferred stock) less goodwill and identifiable intangible assets (other than MSRs), net of related deferred tax liabilities. ROTCE measures the Firm’s net income applicable to common equity as a percentage of average TCE. TBVPS represents the Firm’s TCE at period-end divided by common shares at period-end. TCE, ROTCE and TBVPS are utilized by the Firm, as well as investors and analysts, in assessing the Firm’s use of equity.

The following summary table provides a reconciliation from the Firm’s common stockholders’ equity to TCE.

(a)

Represents deferred tax liabilities related to tax-deductible goodwill and to identifiable intangibles created in nontaxable transactions, which are netted against goodwill and other intangibles when calculating TCE.

Key performance measures

Core loans is considered a key performance measure. Core loans represents loans considered central to the Firm’s ongoing businesses, and excludes loans classified as trading assets, runoff portfolios, discontinued portfolios and portfolios the Firm has an intent to exit. Core loans is a measure utilized by the Firm and its investors and analysts in assessing actual growth in the loan portfolio.

JPMorgan Chase & Co./2019 Form 10-K


Management’s discussion and analysis

BUSINESS SEGMENT RESULTS

The Firm is managed on an LOB basis. There are four major reportable business segments – Consumer & Community Banking, Corporate & Investment Bank, Commercial Banking and Asset & Wealth Management. In addition, there is a Corporate segment.

The business segments are determined based on the products and services provided, or the type of customer served, and they reflect the manner in which financial information is currently evaluated by the Firm’s Operating Committee. Segment results are presented on a managed basis.

Refer to Explanation and Reconciliation of the Firm’s use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Key Performance Measures, on

pages 57–59

for a definition of managed basis.

(a)

Effective in the first quarter of 2020, the Merchant Services business was realigned from CCB to CIB as part of the Firm’s Wholesale Payments business. The revenue and expenses of the Merchant Services business will be reported across CCB, CIB and CB based primarily on client relationship.

Description of business segment reporting methodology

Results of the business segments are intended to present each segment as if it were a stand-alone business. The management reporting process that derives business segment results includes the allocation of certain income and expense items, described in more detail below. The Firm also assesses the level of capital required for each LOB on at least an annual basis. The Firm periodically assesses the assumptions, methodologies and reporting classifications used for segment reporting, and further refinements may be implemented in future periods.

Revenue sharing

When business segments join efforts to sell products and services to the Firm’s clients, the participating business segments may agree to share revenue from those transactions. Revenue is generally recognized in the segment responsible for the related product or service on a gross basis, with an allocation to the other segment(s) involved in the transaction. The segment results reflect these revenue-sharing agreements.


JPMorgan Chase & Co./2019 Form 10-K

Expense Allocation

Where business segments use services provided by corporate support units, or another business segment, the costs of those services are allocated to the respective business segments. The expense is generally allocated based on the actual cost and use of services provided. In contrast, certain costs and investments related to corporate support units, technology and operations not currently leveraged by any LOB, are not allocated to the business segments and are retained in Corporate. Expense retained in Corporate generally includes parent company costs that would not be incurred if the segments were stand-alone businesses; adjustments to align corporate support units; and other items not aligned with a particular business segment.

Funds transfer pricing

Funds transfer pricing is the process by which the Firm allocates interest income and expense to each business segment and transfers the primary interest rate risk and liquidity risk exposures to Treasury and CIO within Corporate. The funds transfer pricing process considers the interest rate risk, liquidity risk and regulatory requirements on a product-by-product basis within each business segment. This process is overseen by senior management and reviewed by the Firm’s Treasurer Committee.

Debt expense and preferred stock dividend allocation

As part of the funds transfer pricing process, almost all of the cost of the credit spread component of outstanding unsecured long-term debt and preferred stock dividends is allocated to the reportable business segments, while the balance of the cost is retained in Corporate. The methodology to allocate the cost of unsecured long-term debt and preferred stock dividends to the business segments is aligned with the Firm’s process to allocate capital. The allocated cost of unsecured long-term debt is included in a business segment’s net interest income, and net income is reduced by preferred stock dividends to arrive at a business segment’s net income applicable to common equity.

Business segment capital allocation

The amount of capital assigned to each business is referred to as equity.

Periodically, the assumptions and methodologies used to allocate capital are assessed and as a result, the capital allocated to the LOBs may change.

Refer to Line of business equity on

page 90

for additional information on business segment capital allocation.

Segment Results – Managed Basis

The following tables summarize the Firm’s results by segment for the periods indicated.

Note: Net income in 2019 and 2018 for each of the business segments reflects the favorable impact of the reduction in the U.S. federal statutory income tax rate as a result of the TCJA.

The following sections provide a comparative discussion of the Firms results by segment as of or for the years ended December 31,

Net income was

$16.6 billion

, an increase of

12%

.

Net revenue was

$55.9 billion

, an increase of

7%

. Net production revenue included approximately $500 million of gains on the sales of certain mortgage loans that were predominantly offset by charges in net interest income for the unwind of the related internal funding from Treasury and CIO associated with these loans. The charges reflect the net present value of that funding and is recognized as interest income in Treasury and CIO. Refer to Corporate on

pages 77–78

and Funds Transfer Pricing (“FTP”) on

page 61

of this Form 10-K for further information.

Net interest income was

$37.2 billion

, up

4%

, and included charges from the loan sales mentioned above. Excluding these charges, net interest income increased, driven by:

•

higher loan balances and margin expansion in Card, as well as higher deposit margins and growth in deposit balances in CBB,

partially offset by

•

lower loan balances due to loan sales, as well as loan spread compression in Home Lending.

Noninterest revenue was

$18.6 billion

, up

15%

, and included gains from the loan sales mentioned above as well as the impact of the prior-year adjustment of approximately $330 million to the credit card rewards liability. Excluding these notable items, noninterest revenue increased 9%, driven by:

•

higher auto lease volume, and

•

higher net mortgage production revenue reflecting higher production volumes and margins,

partially offset by

•

lower net mortgage servicing revenue driven by lower operating revenue reflecting faster prepayment speeds on lower rates and the impact of reclassifying certain loans to held-for-sale.

Refer to Note


for further information regarding changes in value of the MSR asset and related hedges, and mortgage fees and related income.

Noninterest expense was

$28.9 billion

, up

4%

, driven by:

•

investments in the business including technology and marketing and higher depreciation on auto lease assets,

partially offset by

•

expense efficiencies and lower FDIC charges.

The provision for credit losses was

$5.0 billion

, an increase of

4%

, reflecting:

•

an increase in credit card due to

–

higher net charge-offs on loan growth, in line with expectations, and

–

a $500 million addition to the allowance for loan losses reflecting loan growth and higher loss rates, as newer vintages season and become a larger part of the portfolio, compared to a $300 million addition in the prior year

largely offset by

•

a decrease in consumer, excluding credit card due to

–

a $650 million reduction in the allowance for loan losses in the PCI residential real estate portfolio, reflecting continued improvement in home prices and delinquencies, and a $100 million reduction in the allowance for loan losses in the non credit-impaired residential real estate portfolio, compared to a $250 million reduction in the PCI residential real estate portfolio in the prior year, and

–

a $50 million reduction in the allowance for loan losses in the business banking portfolio

partially offset by

–

lower net recoveries in the residential real estate portfolio as the prior year benefited from larger recoveries on loan sales.

Markets revenue

The following table summarizes select income statement data for the Markets businesses. Markets includes both Fixed Income Markets and Equity Markets. Markets revenue comprises principal transactions, fees, commissions and other income, as well as net interest income. The Firm assesses its Markets business performance on a total revenue basis, as offsets may occur across revenue line items. For example, securities that generate net interest income may be risk-managed by derivatives that are recorded in principal transactions revenue. Refer to Notes


and


for a description of the composition of these income statement line items.

Principal transactions reflects revenue on financial instruments and commodities transactions that arise from client-driven market-making activity. Principal transactions revenue includes amounts recognized upon executing new transactions with market participants, as well as “inventory-related revenue”, which is revenue recognized from gains and losses on derivatives and other instruments that the Firm has been holding in anticipation of, or in response to,

client demand, and changes in the fair value of instruments used by the Firm to actively manage the risk exposure arising from such inventory. Principal transactions revenue recognized upon executing new transactions with market participants is driven by many factors including the level of client activity, the bid-offer spread (which is the difference between the price at which a market participant is willing and able to sell an instrument to the Firm and the price at which another market participant is willing and able to buy it from the Firm, and vice versa), market liquidity and volatility. These factors are interrelated and sensitive to the same factors that drive inventory-related revenue, which include general market conditions, such as interest rates, foreign exchange rates, credit spreads, and equity and commodity prices, as well as other macroeconomic conditions.

For the periods presented below, the predominant source of principal transactions revenue was the amount recognized upon executing new transactions.

The decline in Markets net interest income in 2018 was driven by higher funding costs.

FIRMWIDE RISK MANAGEMENT

Risk is an inherent part of JPMorgan Chase’s business activities. When the Firm extends a consumer or wholesale

loan, advises customers and clients on their investment decisions, makes markets in securities, or offers other products or services, the Firm takes on some degree of risk. The Firm’s overall objective is to manage its businesses, and the associated risks, in a manner that balances serving the interests of its clients, customers and investors and protects the safety and soundness of the Firm.

The Firm believes that effective risk management requires, among other things:

•

Acceptance of responsibility, including identification and escalation of risk issues, by all individuals within the Firm;

•

Ownership of risk identification, assessment, data and management within each of the LOBs and Corporate; and

•

Firmwide structures for risk governance.

The Firm strives for continual improvement in its efforts to enhance controls, ongoing employee training and development, talent retention, and other measures. The Firm follows a disciplined and balanced compensation framework with strong internal governance and independent oversight by the Board of Directors (the “Board”). The impact of risk and control issues is carefully considered in the Firm’s performance evaluation and incentive compensation processes.

Risk governance and oversight framework

The Firm’s risk management governance and oversight framework involves understanding drivers of risks, types of risks, and impacts of risks.

Drivers of Risks

are factors that cause a risk to exist. Drivers of risks include the economic environment, regulatory and government policy, competitor and market evolution, business decisions, process and judgment error, deliberate wrongdoing, dysfunctional markets, and natural disasters.

Types of Risks

are categories by which risks manifest themselves. Risks are generally categorized in the following four risk types:

•

Strategic risk is the risk to earnings, capital, liquidity or reputation associated with poorly designed or failed business plans or inadequate response to changes in the operating environment.

•

Credit and investment risk is the risk associated with the default or change in credit profile of a client, counterparty or customer; or loss of principal or a reduction in expected returns on investments, including consumer credit risk, wholesale credit risk, and investment portfolio risk.

•

Market risk is the risk associated with the effect of changes in market factors, such as interest and foreign exchange rates, equity and commodity prices, credit spreads or implied volatilities, on the value of assets and liabilities held for both the short and long term.

•

Operational risk is the risk associated with an adverse outcome resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes or systems; human factors; or external events impacting the Firm’s processes or systems; it includes compliance, conduct, legal, and estimations and model risk.

Impacts of Risks

are consequences of risks, both quantitative and qualitative. There may be many consequences of risks manifesting, such as a reduction in earnings and capital, liquidity outflows, and fines or penalties, or qualitative impacts such as reputation damage, loss of clients and customers, and regulatory and enforcement actions.

The Firm’s risk governance and oversight framework is managed on a Firmwide basis. The Firm has an Independent Risk Management (“IRM”) function, which consists of the Risk Management and Compliance organizations. The Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) appoints, subject to approval by

the Risk Committee of the Board (“Board Risk Committee”), the Firm’s Chief Risk Officer (“CRO”) to lead the IRM organization and manage the risk governance structure of the Firm. The framework is subject to approval by the Board Risk Committee in the form of the primary risk management policies. The Firm’s CRO oversees and delegates authorities to LOB CROs, Firmwide Risk Executives (“FREs”), and the Firm’s Chief Compliance Officer (“CCO”), who each establish Risk Management and Compliance organizations, set the Firm’s risk governance policies and standards, and define and oversee the implementation of the Firm’s risk governance. The LOB CROs are responsible for risks that arise in their LOBs, while FREs oversee risk areas that span across the individual LOB, functions and regions.

Three lines of defense

The Firm relies upon each of its LOBs and Corporate areas giving rise to risk to operate within the parameters identified by the IRM function, and within its own management-identified risk and control standards. Each LOB and Treasury & CIO, including their aligned Operations, Technology and Control Management are the Firm’s “first line of defense” and own the identification of risks, as well as the design and execution of controls to manage those risks. The first line of defense is responsible for adherence

JPMorgan Chase & Co./2019 Form 10-K


Management’s discussion and analysis

to applicable laws, rules and regulations and for the implementation of the risk management structure (which may include policy, standards, limits, thresholds and controls) established by IRM.

The IRM function is independent of the businesses and is the Firm’s “second line of defense.” The IRM function sets and oversees the risk management structure for Firmwide risk governance, and independently assesses and challenges the first line of defense risk management practices. IRM is also responsible for its own adherence to applicable laws, rules and regulations and for the implementation of policies and standards established by IRM with respect to its own processes.

The Internal Audit function operates independently from other parts of the Firm and performs independent testing and evaluation of processes and controls across the Firm as the “third line of defense.” The Internal Audit Function is headed by the General Auditor, who reports to the Audit Committee and administratively to the CEO.

In addition, there are other functions that contribute to the Firmwide control environment including Finance, Human Resources, Legal and Control Management.

Risk identification and ownership

Each LOB and Corporate area owns the ongoing identification of risks, as well as the design and execution of controls, inclusive of IRM-specified controls, to manage those risks. To support this activity, the Firm has a risk identification process designed to facilitate their responsibility to identify material risks inherent to the Firm, catalog them in a central repository and review the most material risks on a regular basis. The IRM function reviews and challenges the LOB and Corporate’s identification of risks, maintains the central repository and provides the consolidated Firmwide results to the Firmwide Risk Committee (“FRC”) and Board Risk Committee.

Risk appetite

The Firm’s overall appetite for risk is governed by a “Risk Appetite” framework. The framework and the Firm’s risk appetite are set and approved by the Firm’s CEO, Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”) and CRO. Quantitative parameters and qualitative factors are used to monitor and measure the Firm’s capacity to take risk consistent with its stated risk appetite. Qualitative factors have been established to assess select operational risks that impact the Firm’s reputation. Risk Appetite results are reported to the Board Risk Committee.


JPMorgan Chase & Co./2019 Form 10-K

Risk governance and oversight structure

The independent status of the IRM function is supported by a governance structure that provides for escalation of risk issues to senior management, the FRC, and the Board of Directors, as appropriate.

The chart below illustrates the Board of Directors’ and key senior management-level committees in the Firm’s risk governance structure. In addition, there are other committees, forums and paths of escalation that support the oversight of risk which are not shown in the chart below or described in this Form 10-K.

The Firm’s Operating Committee, which consists of the Firm’s CEO, CRO, CFO and other senior executives, is accountable to and may refer matters to the Firm’s Board of Directors. The Operating Committee is responsible for escalating to the Board the information necessary to facilitate the Board’s exercise of its duties.

Board oversight

The Firm’s Board of Directors provides oversight of risk. The Board Risk Committee is the principal committee that oversees risk matters. The Audit Committee oversees the control environment, and the Compensation & Management Development Committee oversees compensation and other management-related matters. Each committee of the Board oversees reputational risks and conduct risks within its scope of responsibility.

The JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. Board of Directors is responsible for the oversight of management of the bank. The JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. Board accomplishes this function acting directly and through the principal standing committees of the Firm’s Board of Directors. Risk and control oversight on behalf of JPMorgan Chase Bank N.A. is primarily the responsibility of the Risk Committee and the Audit Committee, respectively, and, with respect to compensation and other management-related matters, the Compensation & Management Development Committee.

Management’s discussion and analysis

STRATEGIC RISK MANAGEMENT

Strategic risk is the risk to earnings, capital, liquidity or reputation associated with poorly designed or failed business plans or inadequate response to changes in the operating environment.

Management and oversight

The Operating Committee and the senior leadership of each LOB and Corporate are responsible for managing the Firm’s most significant strategic risks. Strategic risks are overseen by IRM through participation in business reviews, LOB and Corporate senior management committees and other relevant governance forums and ongoing discussions. The Board of Directors oversees management’s strategic decisions, and the Board Risk Committee oversees IRM and the Firm’s risk management framework.

In the process of developing business plans and strategic initiatives, LOB and Corporate leadership identify the associated risks that are incorporated into the Firmwide Risk Identification process and monitored and assessed as part of the Firmwide Risk Appetite framework.

In addition, IRM conducts a qualitative assessment of the LOB and Corporate strategic initiatives to assess their impact on the risk profile of the Firm.

The Firm’s strategic planning process, which includes the development and execution of strategic initiatives, is one component of managing the Firm’s strategic risk. Guided by the

Firm’s How We Do Business Principles (the “Principles”)

, the Operating Committee and management teams in each LOB and Corporate review and update the strategic plan periodically. The process includes evaluating the high-level strategic framework and performance against prior-year initiatives, assessing the operating environment, refining existing strategies and developing new strategies.

These strategic initiatives, along with IRM’s assessment, are incorporated in the Firm’s budget and provided to the Board for review.

The Firm’s balance sheet strategy, which focuses on risk-adjusted returns, strong capital and robust liquidity, is also a component in the management of strategic risk. Refer to Capital Risk Management on

pages 85–92

for further information on capital risk. Refer to Liquidity Risk Management on

JPMorgan Chase & Co./2019 Form 10-K

CAPITAL RISK MANAGEMENT

Capital risk is the risk the Firm has an insufficient level or composition of capital to support the Firm’s business activities and associated risks during normal economic environments and under stressed conditions.

A strong capital position is essential to the Firm’s business strategy and competitive position. Maintaining a strong balance sheet to manage through economic volatility is considered a strategic imperative of the Firm’s Board of Directors, CEO and Operating Committee. The Firm’s fortress balance sheet philosophy focuses on risk-adjusted returns, strong capital and robust liquidity. The Firm’s capital risk management strategy focuses on maintaining long-term stability to enable the Firm to build and invest in market-leading businesses, including in highly stressed environments.

Senior management considers the implications on the Firm’s capital prior to making any significant decisions that could impact future business activities. In addition to considering the Firm’s earnings outlook, senior management evaluates all sources and uses of capital with a view to ensuring the Firm’s capital strength.

Capital management oversight

The Firm has a Capital Management Oversight function whose primary objective is to provide independent assessment, measuring, monitoring and control of capital risk across the Firm.

Capital Management Oversight’s responsibilities include:

•

Defining, monitoring and reporting capital risk metrics;

•

Establishing, calibrating and monitoring capital risk limits and indicators, including capital risk appetite;

•

Developing a process to classify, monitor and report limit breaches; and

•

Performing an independent assessment of the Firm’s capital management activities, including changes made to the contingency capital plan described below.

In addition, the Basel Independent Review function (“BIR”), which is a part of the IRM function, conducts independent assessments of the Firm’s regulatory capital framework. These assessments are intended to ensure compliance with the applicable regulatory capital rules in support of senior management’s responsibility for managing capital and for the Board Risk Committee’s oversight of management in executing that responsibility.

Capital management

Treasury & CIO is responsible for capital management.

The primary objectives of effective capital management are to:

•

Maintain sufficient capital in order to continue to build and invest in the Firm’s businesses through the cycle and in stressed environments;

•

Retain flexibility to take advantage of future investment opportunities;

•

Promote the Firm’s ability to serve as a source of strength to its subsidiaries;

•

Ensure the Firm operates above the minimum regulatory capital ratios as well as maintain “well-capitalized” status for the Firm and its insured depository institution (“IDI”) subsidiaries at all times under applicable regulatory capital requirements;

•

Meet capital distribution objectives; and

•

Maintain sufficient capital resources to operate throughout a resolution period in accordance with the Firm’s preferred resolution strategy.

The Firm addresses these objectives through establishing internal minimum capital requirements and a strong capital management governance framework, both in business as usual conditions and in the event of stress.

Capital risk management is intended to be flexible in order to react to a range of potential events. In its management of capital, the Firm takes into consideration economic risk and all applicable regulatory capital requirements to determine the level of capital needed.

The Firm considers regulatory capital requirements as well as an internal assessment of capital adequacy, in normal economic cycles and in stress events, when setting its minimum capital levels. The capital governance framework requires regular monitoring of the Firm’s capital positions, stress testing and defining escalation protocols, both at the Firm and material legal entity levels.

Committees responsible for overseeing the Firm’s capital management include the Capital Governance Committee, the Treasurer Committee and the Firmwide ALCO. Capital management oversight is governed through the CIO, Treasury and Corporate (“CTC”) risk committee. In addition, the Board Risk Committee periodically reviews the Firm’s capital risk tolerance. Refer to Firmwide Risk Management on

pages 79–83

for additional discussion on the Board Risk Committee and the ALCO.

Capital planning and stress testing

Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review

The Federal Reserve requires large bank holding companies, including the Firm, to submit on an annual basis a capital plan that has been reviewed and approved by the Board of Directors. The Federal Reserve uses Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (“CCAR”) and other stress testing processes to ensure that large bank holding companies (“BHC”) have sufficient capital during periods of economic and financial stress, and have robust, forward-looking capital assessment and planning processes in place that address each BHC’s unique risks to enable it to absorb losses under certain stress scenarios.

Through CCAR, the Federal Reserve evaluates each BHC’s capital adequacy and

internal capital adequacy assessment processes (“

ICAAP

”),

as well as its plans to make capital distributions, such as dividend payments or stock repurchases.

JPMorgan Chase & Co./2019 Form 10-K


Management’s discussion and analysis

On June 27, 2019, the Federal Reserve informed the Firm that it did not object to the Firm’s 2019 capital plan. Refer to Capital actions on pages 90-91 for information on actions taken by the Firm’s Board of Directors following the 2019 CCAR results.

Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process

Annually, the Firm prepares the ICAAP, which informs the Board of Directors of the ongoing assessment of the Firm’s processes for managing the sources and uses of capital as well as compliance with supervisory expectations for capital planning and capital adequacy. The Firm’s ICAAP integrates stress testing protocols with capital planning.

The CCAR and other stress testing processes assess the potential impact of alternative economic and business scenarios on the Firm’s earnings and capital. Economic scenarios, and the parameters underlying those scenarios, are defined centrally and applied uniformly across the businesses. These scenarios are articulated in terms of macroeconomic factors, which are key drivers of business results; global market shocks, which generate short-term but severe trading losses; and idiosyncratic operational risk events. The scenarios are intended to capture and stress key vulnerabilities and idiosyncratic risks facing the Firm. However, when defining a broad range of scenarios, actual events can always be worse. Accordingly, management considers additional stresses outside these scenarios, as necessary. These results are reviewed by management and the Board of Directors.

Contingency capital plan

The Firm’s contingency capital plan establishes the capital management framework for the Firm and specifies the principles underlying the Firm’s approach towards capital management in normal economic conditions and during stress. The contingency capital plan defines how the Firm calibrates its targeted capital levels and meets minimum capital requirements, monitors the ongoing appropriateness of planned capital distributions, and sets out the capital contingency actions that are expected to be taken or considered at various levels of capital depletion during a period of stress.

Regulatory capital

The Federal Reserve establishes capital requirements, including well-capitalized standards, for the consolidated financial holding company. The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (“OCC”) establishes similar minimum capital requirements for the Firm’s IDI subsidiaries, including JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.

The U.S. capital requirements generally follow the Capital Accord of the Basel Committee, as amended from time to time.

Basel III Overview

The capital rules under Basel III establish minimum capital ratios and overall capital adequacy standards for large and internationally active U.S. BHCs and banks, including the Firm and its

IDI

subsidiaries, including JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.

The minimum amount of regulatory capital that must be held by BHCs and banks is determined by calculating risk-weighted assets (“RWA”), which are on-

balance sheet assets and off-balance sheet exposures, weighted according to risk.

Two comprehensive approaches are prescribed for calculating RWA: a standardized approach (“Basel III Standardized”), and an advanced approach (“Basel III Advanced”). Effective January 1, 2019, the capital adequacy

of the Firm is evaluated against the fully phased-in measures under

Basel III and represents the lower of the Standardized or Advanced approaches.

During

2018, the required capital measures were subject to the transitional rules and as of December 31, 2018 the results were the same on a fully phased-in and on a transitional basis.

Basel III establishes capital requirements for calculating credit risk RWA and market risk RWA, and in the case of Basel III Advanced, operational risk RWA. Key differences in the calculation of credit risk RWA between the Standardized and Advanced approaches are that for Basel III Advanced, credit risk RWA is based on risk-sensitive approaches which largely rely on the use of internal credit models and parameters, whereas for Basel III Standardized, credit risk RWA is generally based on supervisory risk-weightings which vary primarily by counterparty type and asset class. Market risk RWA is calculated on a generally consistent basis between Basel III Standardized and Basel III Advanced.

In addition to the RWA calculated under these approaches, the Firm may supplement such amounts to incorporate management judgment and feedback from its regulators.

Basel III also includes a requirement for Advanced Approach banking organizations, including the Firm, to calculate the

SLR

. Refer to SLR on

page 90

for additional information.

Key Regulatory Developments

Effective January 1, 2020, the Firm adopted the Financial Instruments – Credit Losses (“CECL”) guidance under U.S. GAAP. As provided by the U.S. banking agencies, the Firm elected to phase-in the impact to retained earnings of

$2.7 billion

to regulatory capital, at 25 percent per year in each of 2020 to 2023 (“CECL transitional period”).

Based on the Firm’s capital as of December 31, 2019, the estimated impact to the Standardized CET1 capital ratio will be a reduction of approximately 4 bps for each transitional year. Refer to Accounting and Reporting Developments on

pages 139-140

and Note 1 for further information.


JPMorgan Chase & Co./2019 Form 10-K

Risk-based Capital Regulatory Minimums

The following chart presents the Firm’s Basel III minimum CET1 capital ratio during the Basel III transitional periods and on a fully phased-in basis under the Basel III rules currently in effect.

The Firm’s Basel III Standardized

risk-based ratios are currently more binding than the Basel III Advanced

risk-based ratios, and the Firm expects that this will remain the case for the foreseeable future.

Additional information regarding the Firm’s capital ratios, as well as the U.S. federal regulatory capital standards to which the Firm is subject, is presented in Note


. Refer to the Firm’s Pillar 3 Regulatory Capital Disclosures reports, which are available on the Firm’s website, for further information on the Firm’s Basel III measures.

All banking institutions are currently required to have a minimum CET1 capital ratio of 4.5% of risk-weighted assets. Certain banking organizations, including the Firm, are also

required to hold additional amounts of capital to serve as a “capital conservation buffer”. The capital conservation buffer is intended to be used to absorb losses in times of financial or economic stress.

The capital conservation buffer was subject to a phase-in period that began January 1, 2016 and continued through the end of 2018.

As an expansion of the capital conservation buffer, the Firm is also required to hold additional levels of capital in the form of a global systemically important bank (“GSIB”) surcharge and a countercyclical capital buffer.

Under the Federal Reserve’s GSIB rule, the Firm is required to calculate its GSIB surcharge on an annual basis under two separately prescribed methods, and is subject to the higher of the two. The first (“Method 1”), reflects the GSIB surcharge as prescribed by the Basel Committee’s assessment methodology, and is calculated across five criteria: size, cross-jurisdictional activity, interconnectedness, complexity and substitutability. The second (“Method 2”), modifies the Method 1 requirements to include a measure of short-term wholesale funding in place of substitutability, and introduces a GSIB score

“multiplication factor”. The following table presents the Firm’s GSIB surcharge.

(a)

The GSIB surcharge was subject to transition provisions (in 25% increments) through the end of 2018.

The Firm’s effective regulatory minimum GSIB surcharge calculated under Method 2 remains unchanged at 3.5% for 2020.

The Federal Reserve's framework for setting the countercyclical capital buffer takes into account the macro financial environment in which large, internationally active banks function. As of December 31, 2019, the U.S. countercyclical capital buffer remained at 0%. The Federal Reserve will continue to review the buffer at least annually. The buffer can be increased if the Federal Reserve, FDIC and OCC determine that systemic risks are meaningfully above normal and can be calibrated up to an additional 2.5% of RWA subject to a 12-month implementation period.

Failure to maintain regulatory capital equal to or in excess of the risk-based regulatory capital minimum plus the capital conservation buffer

(inclusive of the GSIB surcharge)

and any countercyclical buffer may result in limitations to the amount of capital that the Firm may distribute

, such as through dividends and common equity repurchases.

Leverage-based Capital Regulatory Minimums

Supplementary leverage ratio

The SLR is defined as Tier 1 capital under Basel III divided by

the Firm’s

total leverage exposure. Total leverage exposure is calculated by taking

the Firm’s

total average on-balance sheet assets, less amounts permitted to be

JPMorgan Chase & Co./2019 Form 10-K


Management’s discussion and analysis

deducted for Tier 1 capital, and adding certain off-balance sheet exposures, such as undrawn commitments and derivatives potential future exposure.

Failure to maintain an SLR ratio equal to or greater than the regulatory minimum may result in limitations on the amount of capital that the Firm may distribute such as through dividends and common equity repurchases.

Other regulatory capital

In addition to meeting the capital ratio requirements of Basel III, the Firm and its IDI subsidiaries also must maintain minimum capital and leverage ratios in order to be “well-capitalized” under the regulations issued by the Federal Reserve and the Prompt Corrective Action (“PCA”) requirements of the FDIC Improvement Act (“FDICIA”), respectively. Refer to Note


for additional information.

The following tables present the Firm’s risk-based and leverage-based capital measures under both the Basel III Standardized and Advanced approaches.

(a)

Adjusted average assets, for purposes of calculating the Tier 1 leverage ratio, includes total quarterly average assets adjusted for on-balance sheet assets that are subject to deduction from Tier 1 capital, predominantly goodwill and other intangible assets.

(b)

The Firm’s capital ratios as of December 31, 2018 were equivalent whether calculated on a transitional or fully phased-in basis.

(c)

Represents minimum SLR requirement of 3.0%, as well as supplementary leverage buffer of 2.0%.

The Firm believes that it will operate with a Basel III CET1 capital ratio between 11.5% and 12% over the medium term.

Line of business equity

Each business segment is allocated capital by taking into consideration a variety of factors including capital levels of similarly rated peers and applicable regulatory capital requirements. ROE is measured and internal targets for expected returns are established as key measures of a business segment’s performance.

The Firm’s allocation methodology incorporates Basel III Standardized RWA, Basel III Advanced RWA, leverage, the GSIB surcharge, and a simulation of capital in a severe stress environment.

Periodically, the assumptions and methodologies used to allocate capital are assessed and as a result, the capital allocated to the LOBs may change.

The Firm will assess impacts from any regulatory changes to the capital framework as changes are finalized.

The table below presents the Firm’s assessed level of capital allocated to each LOB as of the dates indicated.

The following table shows the common dividend payout ratio based on net income applicable to common equity.

Common equity

The Firm’s Board of Directors has authorized the repurchase of up to $29.4 billion of gross common equity between July 1, 2019 and June 30, 2020 as part of the Firm’s annual capital plan. As of

December 31, 2019

,

$15.6 billion

of authorized repurchase capacity remained under this common equity repurchase program.

The following table sets forth the Firm’s repurchases of common equity for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017.

The Firm from time to time enters into written trading plans under Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 to facilitate repurchases in accordance with the common equity repurchase program. A Rule 10b5-1 repurchase plan allows the Firm to repurchase its equity during periods when it may otherwise not be repurchasing common equity — for example, during internal trading blackout periods.

The authorization to repurchase common equity is utilized at management’s discretion, and the timing of purchases and the exact amount of common equity that may be repurchased is subject to various factors, including market conditions; legal and regulatory considerations affecting the amount and timing of repurchase activity; the Firm’s capital position (taking into account goodwill and intangibles); internal capital generation; and alternative investment opportunities. The repurchase program does not include specific price targets or timetables; may be executed through open market purchases or privately negotiated transactions, or utilizing Rule 10b5-1 plans; and may be suspended by management at any time.

Broker-dealer regulatory capital

J.P. Morgan Securities

JPMorgan Chase’s principal U.S. broker-dealer subsidiary is J.P. Morgan Securities. J.P. Morgan Securities is subject to Rule 15c3-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Net Capital Rule”). J.P. Morgan Securities is also registered as a futures commission merchant and subject to the Rules of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (“CFTC”).

J.P. Morgan Securities has elected to compute its minimum net capital requirements in accordance with the “Alternative Net Capital Requirements” of the Net Capital Rule.

The following table presents J.P. Morgan Securities’ net capital:

In addition to its alternative minimum net capital requirements, J.P. Morgan Securities is required to hold “tentative net capital” in excess of $1.0 billion and is also required to notify the SEC in the event that its tentative net capital is less than $5.0 billion. Tentative net capital is net capital before deducting market and credit risk charges as defined by the Net Capital Rule. As of December 31, 2019, J.P. Morgan Securities maintained tentative net capital in excess of the minimum and notification requirements.

J.P. Morgan Securities plc

J.P. Morgan Securities plc is a wholly-owned subsidiary of JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and has authority to engage in banking, investment banking and broker-dealer activities. J.P. Morgan Securities plc is jointly regulated by the U.K. Prudential Regulation Authority (“PRA”) and the Financial Conduct Authority (“FCA”). J.P. Morgan Securities plc is subject to the European Union Capital Requirements Regulation and the PRA capital rules, each of which implemented Basel III and thereby subject J.P. Morgan Securities plc to its requirements.

The Bank of England requires, on a transitional basis, that U.K. banks, including U.K. regulated subsidiaries of overseas groups, maintain a minimum requirement for own funds and eligible liabilities (“MREL”). As of

December 31, 2019

, J.P. Morgan Securities plc was compliant with the requirements of the MREL rule.

LIQUIDITY RISK MANAGEMENT

Liquidity risk is the risk that the Firm will be unable to meet its contractual and contingent financial obligations as they arise or that it does not have the appropriate amount, composition and tenor of funding and liquidity to support its assets and liabilities.

Liquidity risk oversight

The Firm has a liquidity risk oversight function whose primary objective is to provide independent assessment, measurement, monitoring, and control of liquidity risk across the Firm.

Liquidity Risk Oversight’s responsibilities include:

•

Defining, monitoring and reporting liquidity risk metrics;

•

Establishing and monitoring limits and indicators, including Liquidity Risk Appetite;

•

Developing a process to classify, monitor and report limit breaches;

•

Performing an independent review of liquidity risk management processes;

•

Monitoring and reporting internal firmwide and legal entity liquidity stress tests as well as regulatory defined liquidity stress tests;

•

Approving or escalating for review new or updated liquidity stress assumptions; and

•

Monitoring liquidity positions, balance sheet variances and funding activities;

Liquidity management

Treasury and CIO is responsible for liquidity management. The primary objectives of effective liquidity management are to:

•

Ensure that the Firm’s core businesses and material legal entities are able to operate in support of client needs and meet contractual and contingent financial obligations through normal economic cycles as well as during stress events, and

•

Manage an optimal funding mix and availability of liquidity sources.

As part of the Firm’s overall liquidity management strategy, the Firm manages liquidity and funding using a centralized, global approach in order to:

•

Optimize liquidity sources and uses;

•

Monitor exposures;

•

Identify constraints on the transfer of liquidity between the Firm’s legal entities; and

•

Maintain the appropriate amount of surplus liquidity at a firmwide and legal entity level, where relevant.

In the context of the Firm’s liquidity management, Treasury and CIO is responsible for:

•

Analyzing and understanding the liquidity characteristics of the assets and liabilities of the Firm, LOBs and legal entities, taking into account legal, regulatory, and operational restrictions;

•

Developing internal liquidity stress testing assumptions;

•

Defining and monitoring firmwide and legal entity-specific liquidity strategies, policies, reporting and contingency funding plans;

•

Managing liquidity within the Firm’s approved liquidity risk appetite tolerances and limits;

•

Managing compliance with regulatory requirements related to funding and liquidity risk; and

•

Setting transfer pricing in accordance with underlying liquidity characteristics of balance sheet assets and liabilities as well as certain off-balance sheet items.

Governance

Committees responsible for liquidity governance include the firmwide

ALCO

as well as

LOB

and regional ALCOs, the Treasurer Committee, and the CTC Risk Committee. In addition, the

Board Risk Committee

reviews and recommends to the Board of Directors, for formal approval, the Firm’s liquidity risk tolerances, liquidity strategy, and liquidity policy. Refer to Firmwide Risk Management on

pages 79–83

for further discussion of ALCO and other risk-related committees.

Internal stress testing

Liquidity stress tests are intended to ensure that the Firm has sufficient liquidity under a variety of adverse scenarios, including scenarios analyzed as part of the Firm’s resolution and recovery planning. Stress scenarios are produced for

JPMorgan Chase & Co. (“Parent Company”)

and the Firm’s material legal entities on a regular basis, and other stress tests are performed in response to specific market events or concerns. Liquidity stress tests assume all of the Firm’s contractual financial obligations are met and take into consideration:

•

Varying levels of access to unsecured and secured funding markets,

•

Estimated non-contractual and contingent cash outflows, and

•

Potential impediments to the availability and transferability of liquidity between jurisdictions and material legal entities such as regulatory, legal or other restrictions.

Liquidity outflow assumptions are modeled across a range of time horizons and currency dimensions and contemplate both market and idiosyncratic stresses.

Results of stress tests are considered in the formulation of the Firm’s funding plan and assessment of its liquidity position. The Parent Company acts as a source of funding for the Firm through equity and long-term debt issuances, and its intermediate holding company, JPMorgan Chase Holdings LLC (the “IHC”) provides funding support to the ongoing operations of the Parent Company and its subsidiaries. The Firm maintains liquidity at the Parent Company, IHC, and operating subsidiaries at levels sufficient to comply with liquidity risk tolerances and minimum

JPMorgan Chase & Co./2019 Form 10-K


Management’s discussion and analysis

liquidity requirements, and to manage through periods of stress when access to normal funding sources may be disrupted.

Contingency funding plan

The Firm’s contingency funding plan (“CFP”), which is approved by the firmwide ALCO and the Board Risk Committee, is a compilation of procedures and action plans for managing liquidity through stress events. The CFP incorporates the limits and indicators set by the Liquidity Risk Oversight group. These limits and indicators are reviewed regularly to identify emerging risks or vulnerabilities in the Firm’s liquidity position. The CFP identifies the alternative contingent funding and liquidity resources available to the Firm and its legal entities in a period of stress.

Liquidity Coverage Ratio

The LCR rule requires that the Firm maintain an amount of unencumbered High Quality Liquid Assets (“HQLA”) that

is sufficient to meet its estimated total net cash outflows over a prospective 30 calendar-day period of significant stress.

HQLA is the amount of liquid assets that qualify for inclusion in the LCR. HQLA primarily consist of unencumbered cash and certain high-quality liquid securities as defined in the LCR rule.

Under the LCR rule, the amount of HQLA held by

JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.

that is in excess of its stand-alone 100% minimum LCR requirement, and that is not transferable to non-bank affiliates, must be excluded from the Firm’s reported HQLA.

Estimated net cash outflows are based on standardized stress outflow and inflow rates prescribed in the LCR rule, which are applied to the balances of the Firm’s assets, sources of funds, and obligations.

The LCR is required to be a minimum of 100%.

The following table summarizes the Firm’s average LCR for the three months ended

December 31, 2019

, September 30, 2019 and

December 31, 2018

based on the Firm’s interpretation of the finalized LCR framework.

(a)

Represents cash on deposit at central banks, primarily the Federal Reserve Banks.

(b)

Predominantly U.S. Treasuries, U.S. GSE and government agency MBS, and sovereign bonds net of applicable haircuts under the LCR rule.

(c)

HQLA eligible securities may be reported in securities borrowed or purchased under resale agreements, trading assets, or investment securities on the Firm’s Consolidated balance sheets.

(d)

Excludes average excess HQLA at JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. that are not transferable to non-bank affiliates.

The Firm’s average LCR increased during the three months ended December 31, 2019, compared with both the three-month periods ended September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018, due to an increase in HQLA from unsecured long-term debt issuances. Additionally, liquidity in JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. increased during the fourth quarter and from the prior year period primarily due to growth in stable deposits. This increase in excess liquidity is excluded from the Firm’s reported LCR under the LCR rule.

The Firm’s average LCR fluctuates from period to period,

due to changes in its HQLA and estimated net cash outflows

as a result of ongoing business activity.

Refer to the Firm’s U.S. LCR Disclosure reports, which are available on the Firm’s website for a further discussion of the Firm’s LCR.

Other liquidity sources

In addition to the assets reported in the Firm’s HQLA above, the Firm had unencumbered marketable securities, such as equity securities and fixed income debt securities, that the Firm believes would be available to raise liquidity of approximately $

315 billion

and

$226 billion

as of December 31, 2019

and 2018, respectively.

This includes securities included as part of the excess liquidity at JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. that are not transferable to non-bank affiliates, as described above.

The amount of such securities increased from the prior year.

The Firm also had available borrowing capacity at FHLBs and the discount window at the Federal Reserve Bank as a result of collateral pledged by the Firm to such banks of approximately

$322 billion

and

$276 billion

as of December 31, 2019

and 2018, respectively.

This borrowing capacity excludes the benefit of cash and securities reported in the Firm’s HQLA or other unencumbered securities that are currently pledged at the Federal Reserve Bank discount window and other central banks.

Available borrowing capacity increased from the prior year primarily as a result of an increase in collateral available to be pledged as a result of the merger of Chase Bank USA, N.A. with and into JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., and an increase in available collateral as a result of maturities of borrowings from FHLBs.

Although available, the Firm does not view this borrowing capacity at the Federal Reserve Bank discount window and the other central banks as a primary source of liquidity.


JPMorgan Chase & Co./2019 Form 10-K

Funding

Sources of funds

Management believes that the Firm’s unsecured and secured funding capacity is sufficient to meet its on- and off-balance sheet obligations.

The Firm funds its global balance sheet through diverse sources of funding including stable deposits, secured and unsecured funding in the capital markets and stockholders’ equity. Deposits are the primary funding source for JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. Additionally, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. may also access funding through short- or long-term secured

borrowings, through the issuance of unsecured long-term debt, or from borrowings from the Parent company or the IHC.

The Firm’s non-bank subsidiaries are primarily funded from long-term unsecured borrowings and short-term secured borrowings, primarily securities loaned or sold under repurchase agreements. Excess funding is invested by

Treasury and CIO

in the Firm’s investment securities portfolio or deployed in cash or other short-term liquid investments based on their interest rate and liquidity risk characteristics.

Deposits

The table below summarizes, by LOB, the period-end and average deposit balances as of and for the years ended

December 31, 2019

and


.

Deposits provide a stable source of funding and reduce the Firm’s reliance on the wholesale funding markets. A significant portion of the Firm’s deposits are consumer deposits and wholesale operating deposits, which are both considered to be stable sources of liquidity.

Wholesale operating deposits are considered to be stable sources of liquidity because they are generated from customers that maintain operating service relationships with the Firm.

The table below shows the loan and deposit balances, the loans-to-deposits ratios, and deposits as a percentage of total liabilities, as of

December 31, 2019

and


.

The Firm believes that average deposit balances are generally more representative of deposit trends than period-end deposit balances.

Average deposits across the Firm increased for the year ended December 31, 2019.

The increase in CIB reflects growth in operating deposits driven by client activity, primarily in Treasury Services, and an increase in client-driven net issuances of structured notes in Markets. The increase in CCB was driven by continued growth in new accounts. The increases in AWM and CB were primarily driven by growth in interest-bearing deposits; for AWM, the growth was partially offset by migration, predominantly into the Firm’s investment-related products.

as the net increase from the Firm’s participation in the Federal Reserve’s open market operations was offset by client-driven activities, and lower secured financing of trading assets-debt instruments, all in CIB.

The balances associated with securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase fluctuate over time due to customers’ investment and financing activities, the Firm’s demand for financing, the ongoing management of the mix of the Firm’s liabilities, including its secured and unsecured financing (for both the investment securities and market-making portfolios), and other market and portfolio factors.

The Firm’s sources of short-term unsecured funding primarily consist of issuance of wholesale commercial paper.

The decrease in commercial paper at

December 31, 2019

, from

December 31, 2018

, was due to lower net issuance primarily for short-term liquidity management.

Long-term funding and issuance

Long-term funding provides additional sources of stable funding and liquidity for the Firm. The Firm’s long-term funding plan is driven primarily by expected client activity, liquidity considerations, and regulatory requirements,

including TLAC.

Long-term funding objectives include maintaining diversification, maximizing market access and optimizing funding costs. The Firm evaluates various funding markets, tenors and currencies in creating its optimal long-term funding plan.


JPMorgan Chase & Co./2019 Form 10-K

The significant majority of the Firm’s long-term unsecured funding is issued by

the Parent Company

to provide flexibility in support of both bank and non-bank subsidiary funding needs.

The Parent Company advances substantially all net funding proceeds to its subsidiary,

the IHC.

The IHC does not issue debt to external counterparties.

Management’s discussion and analysis

Credit ratings

The cost and availability of financing are influenced by

credit ratings. Reductions in these ratings could have an

adverse effect on the Firm’s access to liquidity sources,

increase the cost of funds, trigger additional collateral or

funding requirements and decrease the number of investors

and counterparties willing to lend to the Firm. The nature

and magnitude of the impact of ratings downgrades

depends on numerous contractual and behavioral factors,

which the Firm believes are incorporated in its liquidity risk

and stress testing metrics. The Firm believes that it

maintains sufficient liquidity to withstand a potential

decrease in funding capacity due to ratings downgrades.

Additionally, the Firm’s funding requirements for VIEs and other third- party commitments may be adversely affected by a decline in credit ratings.

The credit ratings of the Parent Company and the Firm’s principal bank and non-bank subsidiaries as of

December 31, 2019

, were as follows.

(a)

On May 18, 2019, Chase Bank USA, N.A. merged with and into JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. as the surviving bank. The credit rating for JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. reflects the credit rating of the merged entity.

JPMorgan Chase’s unsecured debt does not contain requirements that would call for an acceleration of payments, maturities or changes in the structure of the existing debt, provide any limitations on future borrowings or require additional collateral, based on unfavorable changes in the Firm’s credit ratings, financial ratios, earnings, or stock price.

Critical factors in maintaining high credit ratings include a stable and diverse earnings stream, strong capital and

liquidity ratios, strong credit quality and risk management controls, and diverse funding sources. Rating agencies continue to evaluate economic and geopolitical trends, regulatory developments, future profitability, risk management practices, and litigation matters, as well as their broader ratings methodologies. Changes in any of these factors could lead to changes in the Firm’s credit ratings.

REPUTATION RISK MANAGEMENT

Reputation risk is the risk that an action or inaction may negatively impact the Firm’s integrity and reduce confidence in the Firm’s competence held by various constituents, including clients, counterparties, customers, investors, regulators, employees, communities or the broader public.

Organization and management

Reputation Risk Management is an independent risk management function that establishes the governance framework for managing reputation risk across the Firm. As reputation risk is inherently difficult to identify, manage, and quantify, an independent reputation risk management governance function is critical.

The Firm’s reputation risk management function includes the following activities:

•

Establishing a Firmwide Reputation Risk Governance policy and standards consistent with the reputation risk framework

•

Managing the governance infrastructure and processes that support consistent identification, escalation, management and monitoring of reputation risk issues Firmwide

•

Providing guidance to LOB Reputation Risk Offices (“RRO”), as appropriate

The types of events that give rise to reputation risk are broad and could be introduced in various ways, including by the Firm’s employees and the clients, customers and counterparties with which the Firm does business. These events could result in financial losses, litigation and regulatory fines, as well as other damages to the Firm.

Governance and oversight

The Firm’s Reputation Risk Governance policy establishes the principles for managing reputation risk for the Firm. It is the responsibility of employees in each LOB and Corporate to consider the reputation of the Firm when deciding whether to offer a new product, engage in a transaction or client relationship, enter a

new jurisdiction, initiate a business process or other matters. Increasingly, sustainability, social responsibility and environmental impacts are important considerations in assessing the Firm’s reputation risk, and are considered as part of reputation risk governance.

Reputation risk issues deemed material

are escalated as appropriate.

Management’s discussion and analysis

CREDIT AND INVESTMENT RISK MANAGEMENT

Credit and investment risk is the risk associated with the default or change in credit profile of a client, counterparty or customer; or loss of principal or a reduction in expected returns on investments, including consumer credit risk, wholesale credit risk, and investment portfolio risk.

Credit risk management

Credit risk is the risk associated with the default or change in credit profile of a client, counterparty or customer. The Firm provides credit to a variety of customers, ranging from large corporate and institutional clients to individual consumers and small businesses.

In its consumer businesses, the Firm is exposed to credit risk primarily through its home lending, credit card, auto, and business banking businesses. In its wholesale businesses, the Firm is exposed to credit risk through its underwriting, lending, market-making, and hedging activities with and for clients and counterparties, as well as through its operating services activities (such as cash management and clearing activities), securities financing activities, investment securities portfolio, and cash placed with banks.

Credit Risk Management is an independent risk management function that monitors, measures and manages credit risk throughout the Firm and defines credit risk policies and procedures. The Firm’s credit risk management governance includes the following activities:

•

Establishing a credit risk policy framework

•

Monitoring, measuring and managing credit risk across all portfolio segments, including transaction and exposure approval

•

Setting industry and geographic concentration limits, as appropriate, and establishing underwriting guidelines

•

Assigning and managing credit authorities in connection with the approval of credit exposure

•

Managing criticized exposures and delinquent loans

•

Estimating credit losses and ensuring appropriate credit risk-based capital management

Risk identification and measurement

The Credit Risk Management function monitors, measures, manages and limits credit risk across the Firm’s businesses. To measure credit risk, the Firm employs several methodologies for estimating the likelihood of obligor or counterparty default. Methodologies for measuring credit risk vary depending on several factors, including type of asset (e.g., consumer versus wholesale), risk measurement parameters (e.g., delinquency status and borrower’s credit score versus wholesale risk-rating) and risk management and collection processes (e.g., retail collection center versus centrally managed workout groups). Credit risk measurement is based on the probability of default of an obligor or counterparty, the loss severity given a default event and the exposure at default.

Based on these factors and the methodology and estimates described in Note 13, the Firm estimates credit losses for its exposures. The allowance for loan losses reflects credit losses related to the consumer and wholesale held-for-investment loan portfolios, and the allowance for lending-related commitments reflects credit losses related to the Firm’s lending-related commitments. Refer to Note 13 and Critical Accounting Estimates used by the Firm on pages 136-138 for further information.

In addition, potential and unexpected credit losses are reflected in the allocation of credit risk capital and represent the potential volatility of actual losses relative to the established allowances for loan losses and lending-related commitments. The analyses for these losses include stress testing that considers alternative economic scenarios as described in the Stress testing section below.

Stress testing

Stress testing is important in measuring and managing credit risk in the Firm’s credit portfolio. The process assesses the potential impact of alternative economic and business scenarios on estimated credit losses for the Firm. Economic scenarios and the underlying parameters are defined centrally, articulated in terms of macroeconomic factors and applied across the businesses. The stress test results may indicate credit migration, changes in delinquency trends and potential losses in the credit portfolio. In addition to the periodic stress testing processes, management also considers additional stresses outside these scenarios, including industry and country- specific stress scenarios, as necessary. The Firm uses stress testing to inform decisions on setting risk appetite both at a Firm and LOB level, as well as to assess the impact of stress on individual counterparties.


JPMorgan Chase & Co./2019 Form 10-K

Risk monitoring and management

The Firm has developed policies and practices that are designed to preserve the independence and integrity of the approval and decision-making process of extending credit to ensure credit risks are assessed accurately, approved properly, monitored regularly and managed actively at both the transaction and portfolio levels. The policy framework establishes credit approval authorities, concentration limits, risk-rating methodologies, portfolio review parameters and guidelines for management of distressed exposures. In addition, certain models, assumptions and inputs used in evaluating and monitoring credit risk are independently validated by groups that are separate from the LOBs.

Consumer credit risk is monitored for delinquency and other trends, including any concentrations at the portfolio level, as certain of these trends can be modified through changes in underwriting policies and portfolio guidelines. Consumer Risk Management evaluates delinquency and other trends against business expectations, current and forecasted economic conditions, and industry benchmarks. Historical and forecasted economic performance and trends are incorporated into the modeling of estimated consumer credit losses and are part of the monitoring of the credit risk profile of the portfolio.

Wholesale credit risk is monitored regularly at an aggregate portfolio, industry, and individual client and counterparty level with established concentration limits that are reviewed and revised periodically as deemed appropriate by management. Industry and counterparty limits, as measured in terms of exposure and economic risk appetite, are subject to stress-based loss constraints. In addition, wrong-way risk, that is the risk that exposure to a counterparty is positively correlated with the impact of a default by the same counterparty, which could cause exposure to increase at the same time as the counterparty’s capacity to meet its obligations is decreasing - is actively monitored as this risk could result in greater exposure at default compared with a transaction with another counterparty that does not have this risk.

Management of the Firm’s wholesale credit risk exposure is accomplished through a number of means, including:

•

Loan underwriting and credit approval process

•

Loan syndications and participations

•

Loan sales and securitizations

•

Credit derivatives

•

Master netting agreements

•

Collateral and other risk-reduction techniques

In addition to Credit Risk Management, an independent Credit Review function is responsible for:

•

I

ndependently validating or changing the risk grades assigned to exposures in the Firm’s wholesale and commercial-oriented retail credit portfolios, and assessing the timeliness of risk grade changes initiated by responsible business units; and

•

Evaluating the effectiveness of business units’ credit management processes, including the adequacy of credit analyses and risk grading/

LGD

rationales, proper monitoring and management of credit exposures, and compliance with applicable grading policies and underwriting guidelines.

Refer to Note


for further discussion of consumer and wholesale loans.

Risk reporting

To enable monitoring of credit risk and effective decision-making, aggregate credit exposure, credit quality forecasts, concentration levels and risk profile changes are reported regularly to senior members of Credit Risk Management. Detailed portfolio reporting of industry, clients, counterparties and customers, product and geography are prepared, and the appropriateness of the allowance for credit losses is reviewed by senior management at least on a quarterly basis. Through the risk reporting and governance structure, credit risk trends and limit exceptions are provided regularly to, and discussed with, risk committees, senior management and the Board of Directors as appropriate.

CONSUMER CREDIT PORTFOLIO

The Firm’s retained

consumer portfolio consists primarily of residential real estate loans, credit card loans, auto loans, and business banking loans, as well as associated lending-related commitments.

The Firm’s focus is on serving primarily the prime segment of the consumer credit market. Originated mortgage loans are retained in the mortgage portfolio, securitized or sold to U.S. government agencies and U.S. government-sponsored enterprises; other types of consumer loans are typically retained on the balance sheet. The credit performance of the consumer portfolio continues to benefit from discipline in credit underwriting as well as improvement in the economy driven by low unemployment and increasing home prices.

Consumer, excluding credit card

Portfolio analysis

Loan balances decreased from

December 31, 2018

due to lower residential real estate loans, predominantly driven by loan sales.

The following discussions provide information concerning individual loan products, excluding PCI loans which are addressed separately. Refer to Note


for further information about this portfolio, including information about delinquencies, loan modifications and other credit quality indicators.

Residential mortgage:

The residential mortgage portfolio, including loans held-for-sale, predominantly consists of prime mortgage loans. The portfolio decreased from

December 31, 2018

driven by paydowns as well as loan sales in Home Lending, largely offset by originations of prime mortgage loans that have been retained on the balance sheet. Net recoveries for the year ended

December 31, 2019

were lower when compared with the prior year as the prior year benefited from larger recoveries on loan sales.

At

December 31, 2019

and


, the Firm’s residential mortgage portfolio included

$22.4 billion

and

$21.6 billion

, respectively, of interest-only loans. These loans have an interest-only payment period generally followed by an adjustable-rate or fixed-rate fully amortizing payment period to maturity and are typically originated as higher-balance loans to higher-income borrowers, predominantly in AWM. Performance of this portfolio for the year ended

December 31, 2019

was consistent with the performance of the broader residential mortgage portfolio for the same period.

The following table provides a summary of the Firm’s

residential mortgage portfolio insured and/or guaranteed

by U.S. government agencies, including loans held-for-sale.

The Firm monitors its exposure to certain potential unrecoverable claim payments related to government insured loans and considers this exposure in estimating the allowance for loan losses.

Home equity:

The home equity portfolio declined from

December 31, 2018

primarily reflecting paydowns.

At

December 31, 2019

, approximately

90%

of the Firm’s home equity portfolio consists of home equity lines of credit

(“HELOCs”) and the remainder consisted of home equity loans (“HELOANs”). HELOANs are generally fixed-rate, closed-end, amortizing loans, with terms ranging from 3–30 years. In general, HELOCs originated by the Firm are revolving loans for a 10-year period, after which time the HELOC recasts into a loan with a 20-year amortization period.

The carrying value of HELOCs outstanding was

$22 billion

at

December 31, 2019

. This amount included

$10 billion

of HELOCs that have recast from interest-only to fully amortizing payments or have been modified and

$3 billion

of interest-only balloon HELOCs, which primarily mature after 2030. The Firm manages the risk of HELOCs during their revolving period by closing or reducing the undrawn line to the extent permitted by law when borrowers are exhibiting a material deterioration in their credit risk profile.

Auto:

The auto portfolio predominantly consists of prime-quality loans. The portfolio declined when compared with

December 31, 2018

, as paydowns and charge-offs or liquidation of delinquent loans were predominantly offset by new originations.

Consumer & Business Banking:

Consumer & Business Banking loans increased when compared with

December 31, 2018

as loan originations were predominantly offset by paydowns and charge-offs of delinquent loans. Net charge-offs for the year ended

December 31, 2019

increased when compared with the prior year primarily due to higher deposit overdraft losses.

Purchased credit-impaired loans:

PCI loans represent certain loans that were acquired and deemed to be credit-impaired on the acquisition date. PCI loans decreased from

December 31, 2018

due to portfolio run-off. As of

December 31, 2019

, approximately

9%

of the option ARM PCI loans were delinquent and approximately

71%

of the portfolio has been modified into fixed-rate, fully amortizing loans. The borrowers for substantially all of the remaining option ARM loans are making amortizing payments, although such payments are not necessarily fully amortizing. This latter group of loans is subject to the risk of payment shock due to future payment recast. Default rates generally increase on option ARM loans when payment recast results in a payment increase. The expected increase in default rates is considered in the Firm’s quarterly impairment assessment.

Management’s discussion and analysis

WHOLESALE CREDIT PORTFOLIO

In its wholesale businesses, the Firm is exposed to credit risk primarily through its underwriting, lending, market-making, and hedging activities with and for clients and counterparties, as well as through various operating services (such as cash management and clearing activities), securities financing activities and cash placed with banks. A portion of the loans originated or acquired by the Firm’s wholesale businesses is generally retained on the balance sheet. The Firm distributes a significant percentage of the loans that it originates into the market as part of its syndicated loan business and to manage portfolio concentrations and credit risk.

The credit performance of the wholesale portfolio remained favorable for the year ended

December 31, 2019

, characterized by continued low levels of criticized exposure, nonaccrual loans and charge-offs. Refer to the industry discussion on

pages 109–111

for further information. Loans held-for-sale decreased, driven by a loan syndication in CIB. The wholesale portfolio is actively managed, in part by conducting ongoing, in-depth reviews of client credit quality and transaction structure inclusive of collateral where applicable, and of industry, product and client concentrations.

In the following tables, the Firm’s wholesale credit portfolio includes exposure held in CIB, CB, AWM and Corporate. It excludes all exposure managed by CCB, scored prime mortgage and scored home equity loans held in AWM and scored prime mortgage loans held in Corporate.

Wholesale credit exposure – industry exposures

The Firm focuses on the management and diversification of its industry exposures, and pays particular attention to industries with actual or potential credit concerns. Exposures deemed criticized align with the U.S. banking regulators’ definition of criticized exposures, which consist of the special mention, substandard and doubtful

categories. The total criticized component of the portfolio, excluding loans held-for-sale and loans at fair value, was

$14.3 billion

at

December 31, 2019

, compared with

$12.1 billion

at

December 31, 2018

. The increase was driven by select client downgrades.

JPMorgan Chase & Co./2019 Form 10-K

Lending-related commitments

The Firm uses lending-related financial instruments, such as commitments (including revolving credit facilities) and guarantees, to address the financing needs of its clients. The contractual amounts of these financial instruments represent the maximum possible credit risk should the clients draw down on these commitments or when the Firm fulfills its obligations under these guarantees, and the clients subsequently fail to perform according to the terms of these contracts. Most of these commitments and guarantees are refinanced, extended, cancelled, or expire without being drawn upon or a default occurring. As a result, the Firm does not believe that the total contractual amount of these wholesale lending-related commitments is  representative of the Firm’s expected future credit exposure or funding requirements. Refer to Note


for further information on wholesale lending-related commitments.

Receivables from Customers

Receivables from customers primarily represent held-for-investment margin loans to brokerage clients in CIB and AWM that are collateralized by assets maintained in the clients’ brokerage accounts (e.g., cash on deposit, liquid and readily marketable debt or equity securities), as such no allowance is held against these receivables. To manage its credit risk the Firm establishes margin requirements and monitors the required margin levels on an ongoing basis, and requires clients to deposit additional cash or other collateral, or to reduce positions, when appropriate. These receivables are reported within accrued interest and accounts receivable on the Firm’s Consolidated balance sheets.

Clearing services

The Firm provides clearing services for clients entering into certain securities and derivative contracts. Through the provision of these services the Firm is exposed to the risk of non-performance by its clients and may be required to share in losses incurred by CCPs. Where possible, the Firm seeks to mitigate its credit risk to its clients through the collection of adequate margin at inception and throughout the life of the transactions and can also cease the provision of clearing services if clients do not adhere to their obligations under the clearing agreement. Refer to Note


for a further discussion of clearing services.

Derivative contracts

Derivatives enable clients and counterparties to manage risks including credit risk and risks arising from fluctuations in interest rates, foreign exchange, equities, and commodities. The Firm makes markets in derivatives in order to meet these needs and uses derivatives to manage certain risks associated with net open risk positions from its market-making activities, including the counterparty credit risk arising from derivative receivables. The Firm also uses derivative instruments to manage its own credit and other market risk exposure. The nature of the counterparty and the settlement mechanism of the derivative affect the credit risk to which the Firm is exposed. For OTC derivatives the Firm is exposed to the credit risk of the derivative

counterparty. For exchange-traded derivatives (“ETD”), such as futures and options, and cleared over-the-counter (“OTC-cleared”) derivatives, the Firm is generally exposed to the credit risk of the relevant CCP. Where possible, the Firm seeks to mitigate its credit risk exposures arising from derivative contracts through the use of legally enforceable master netting arrangements and collateral agreements. Refer to Note


for a further discussion of derivative contracts, counterparties and settlement types.

The following table summarizes the net derivative receivables for the periods presented.

(a)

Includes collateral related to derivative instruments where appropriate legal opinions have not been either sought or obtained with respect to master netting agreements.

The fair value of derivative receivables reported on the Consolidated balance sheets were

$49.8 billion

and

$54.2 billion

at

December 31, 2019

and


, respectively.

Derivative receivables represent the fair value of the derivative contracts after giving effect to legally enforceable master netting agreements and cash collateral held by the Firm. However, in management’s view, the appropriate measure of current credit risk should also take into consideration additional liquid securities (primarily U.S. government and agency securities and other group of seven nations (“G7”) government securities) and other cash collateral held by the Firm aggregating

$16.0 billion

and

$15.3 billion

at

December 31, 2019

and


, respectively, that may be used as security when the fair value of the client’s exposure is in the Firm’s favor.

The Firm also holds additional collateral (primarily cash, G7 government securities, other liquid government agency and guaranteed securities, and corporate debt and equity securities) delivered by clients at the initiation of transactions, as well as collateral related to contracts that have a non-daily call frequency and collateral that the Firm has agreed to return but has not yet settled as of the reporting date. Although this collateral does not reduce the balances and is not included in the table above, it is available as security against potential exposure that could arise should the fair value of the client’s derivative contracts move in the Firm’s favor. The derivative receivables fair value, net of all collateral, also does not include other credit enhancements, such as letters of credit. Refer to Note


for additional information on the Firm’s use of collateral agreements.

While useful as a current view of credit exposure, the net fair value of the derivative receivables does not capture the potential future variability of that credit exposure. To capture the potential future variability of credit exposure, the Firm calculates, on a client-by-client basis, three measures of potential derivatives-related credit loss: Peak, Derivative Risk Equivalent (“DRE”), and Average exposure

JPMorgan Chase & Co./2019 Form 10-K


Management’s discussion and analysis

(“AVG”). These measures all incorporate netting and collateral benefits, where applicable.

Peak represents a conservative measure of potential exposure to a counterparty calculated in a manner that is broadly equivalent to a 97.5% confidence level over the life of the transaction. Peak is the primary measure used by the Firm for setting credit limits for derivative contracts, senior management reporting and derivatives exposure management.

DRE exposure is a measure that expresses the risk of derivative exposure on a basis intended to be equivalent to the risk of loan exposures. DRE is a less extreme measure of potential credit loss than Peak and is used as an input for aggregating derivative credit risk exposures with loans and other credit risk.

Finally, AVG is a measure of the expected fair value of the Firm’s derivative receivables at future time periods, including the benefit of collateral. AVG over the total life of the derivative contract is used as the primary metric for pricing purposes and is used to calculate credit risk capital and CVA, as further described below.

The fair value of the Firm’s derivative receivables incorporates CVA to reflect the credit quality of counterparties. CVA is based on the Firm’s AVG to a counterparty and the counterparty’s credit spread in the credit derivatives market. The Firm believes that active risk management is essential to controlling the dynamic credit risk in the derivatives portfolio. In addition, the Firm’s risk management process takes into consideration the potential impact of wrong-way risk, which is broadly defined as the potential for increased correlation between the Firm’s

exposure to a counterparty (AVG) and the counterparty’s credit quality. Many factors may influence the nature and magnitude of these correlations over time. To the extent that these correlations are identified, the Firm may adjust the CVA associated with that counterparty’s AVG. The Firm risk manages exposure to changes in CVA by entering into credit derivative contracts, as well as interest rate, foreign exchange, equity and commodity derivative contracts.

The below graph shows exposure profiles to the Firm’s current derivatives portfolio over the next 10 years as calculated by the Peak, DRE and AVG metrics. The three measures generally show that exposure will decline after the first year, if no new trades are added to the portfolio.

Exposure profile of derivatives measures

The following table summarizes the ratings profile of the Firm’s derivative receivables, including credit derivatives, net of all collateral, at the dates indicated. The Firm considers internal ratings equivalent to BBB-/Baa3 or higher as investment grade. Refer to Note


for further information on internal risk ratings.

As previously noted, the Firm uses collateral agreements to mitigate counterparty credit risk. The percentage of the Firm’s over-the-counter derivative transactions subject to collateral agreements — excluding foreign exchange spot trades, which are not typically covered by collateral agreements due to their short maturity and centrally cleared trades that are settled daily — was approximately

90%

Credit derivatives

The Firm uses credit derivatives for two primary purposes: first, in its capacity as a market-maker, and second, as an end-user, to manage the Firm’s own credit risk associated with various exposures.

Credit portfolio management activities

Included in the Firm’s end-user activities are credit derivatives used to mitigate the credit risk associated with traditional lending activities (loans and unfunded commitments) and derivatives counterparty exposure in the Firm’s wholesale businesses (collectively, “credit portfolio management” activities). Information on credit portfolio management activities is provided in the table below.

The Firm also uses credit derivatives as an end-user to manage other exposures, including credit risk arising from certain securities held in the Firm’s market-making businesses. These credit derivatives are not included in credit portfolio management activities.

(a)

Amounts are presented net, considering the Firm’s net protection purchased or sold with respect to each underlying reference entity or index.

The credit derivatives used in credit portfolio management activities do not qualify for hedge accounting under U.S. GAAP; these derivatives are reported at fair value, with gains and losses recognized in principal transactions revenue. In contrast, the loans and lending-related commitments being risk-managed are accounted for on an accrual basis. This asymmetry in accounting treatment, between loans and lending-related commitments and the credit derivatives used in credit portfolio management activities, causes earnings volatility that is not representative, in the Firm’s view, of the true changes in value of the Firm’s overall credit exposure.

The effectiveness of credit default swaps (“CDS”) as a hedge against the Firm’s exposures may vary depending on a number of factors, including the named reference entity (i.e., the Firm may experience losses on specific exposures that are different than the named reference entities in the purchased CDS); the contractual terms of the CDS (which may have a defined credit event that does not align with an actual loss realized by the Firm); and the maturity of the Firm’s CDS protection (which in some cases may be shorter than the Firm’s exposures). However, the Firm generally seeks to purchase credit protection with a maturity date that is the same or similar to the maturity date of the exposure for which the protection was purchased, and remaining differences in maturity are actively monitored and managed by the Firm. Refer to Credit derivatives in Note


for a detailed description of credit derivatives.

ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES

The Firm’s allowance for credit losses covers the retained consumer and wholesale loan portfolios, as well as the Firm’s wholesale and certain consumer lending-related commitments.

Refer to Critical Accounting Estimates Used by the Firm on

pages 136–138

and Note


for further information on the components of the allowance for credit losses and related management judgments.

At least quarterly, the allowance for credit losses is reviewed by the CRO, the CFO and the Controller of the Firm. As of

December 31, 2019

,

JPMorgan Chase

deemed the allowance for credit losses to be appropriate and sufficient to absorb probable credit losses inherent in the portfolio.

The allowance for credit losses decreased compared with

December 31, 2018

driven by:

•

an $800 million reduction in the CCB allowance for loan losses, which included $650 million in the PCI residential real estate portfolio, reflecting continued improvement in home prices and delinquencies; $100 million in the non credit-impaired residential real estate portfolio; and $50 million in the business banking portfolio; as well as

•

a $151 million reduction for write-offs of PCI loans,

predominantly offset by

•

a $500 million addition to the allowance for loan losses in the credit card portfolio reflecting loan growth and  higher loss rates as newer vintages season and become a larger part of the portfolio, and

•

a $251 million addition in the wholesale allowance for credit losses driven by select client downgrades.

JPMorgan Chase & Co./2019 Form 10-K

Note:

In the table above, the financial measures which exclude the impact of PCI loans are non-GAAP financial measures.

(a)

Write-offs of PCI loans are recorded against the allowance for loan losses when actual losses for a pool exceed estimated losses that were recorded as purchase accounting adjustments at the time of acquisition. A write-off of a PCI loan is recognized when the underlying loan is removed from a pool.

(b)

Includes risk-rated loans that have been placed on nonaccrual status and loans that have been modified in a TDR. The asset-specific credit card allowance for loan losses modified in a TDR is calculated based on the loans’ original contractual interest rates and does not consider any incremental penalty rates.

(c)

The allowance for lending-related commitments is reported in accounts payable and other liabilities on the Consolidated balance sheets.

(d)

The Firm’s policy is generally to exempt credit card loans from being placed on nonaccrual status as permitted by regulatory guidance.

Management’s discussion and analysis

INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO RISK MANAGEMENT

Investment portfolio risk is the risk associated with the loss of principal or a reduction in expected returns on investments arising from the investment securities portfolio or from principal investments. The investment securities portfolio is predominantly held by Treasury and CIO in connection with the Firm's balance sheet or asset-liability management objectives. Principal investments are predominantly privately-held financial instruments and are managed in the LOBs and Corporate. Investments are typically intended to be held over extended periods and, accordingly, the Firm has no expectation for short-term realized gains with respect to these investments.

Investment securities risk

Investment securities risk includes the exposure associated with a default in the payment of principal and interest. This risk is mitigated given that the investment securities portfolio held by Treasury and CIO is predominantly invested in high-quality securities. At

December 31, 2019

, the Treasury and CIO investment securities portfolio was

$396.4 billion

, and the average credit rating of the securities comprising the portfolio was AA+ (based upon external ratings where available and where not available, based primarily upon internal risk ratings. Refer to Corporate segment results on

pages 77–78

and Note


for further information on the investment securities portfolio and internal risk ratings. Refer to Market Risk Management on

pages 119–126

for further information on the market risk inherent in the portfolio. Refer to Liquidity Risk Management on

pages 93–98

for further information on related liquidity risk.

Governance and oversight

Investment securities risks are governed by the Firm’s Risk Appetite framework, and reviewed at the CTC Risk Committee with regular updates to the Board Risk Committee.

The Firm’s independent control functions are responsible for reviewing the appropriateness of the carrying value of investment securities in accordance with relevant policies. Approved levels for investment securities are established for each risk category, including capital and credit risks.

Principal investment risk

Principal investments are typically private non-traded financial instruments representing ownership or other forms of junior capital. Principal investments span multiple asset classes and are made either in stand-alone investing businesses or as part of a broader business platform.

In general, new principal investments include tax-oriented investments, as well as investments made to enhance or accelerate LOB and Corporate strategic business initiatives.

The Firm’s principal investments are managed by the LOBs and Corporate and are reflected within their respective financial results.

As of

December 31, 2019

and


, the aggregate carrying values of the principal investment portfolios were

$24.2 billion

and

$22.2 billion

, respectively, which included

tax-oriented investments (e.g., affordable housing and alternative energy investments)

of

$18.2 billion

and

$16.6 billion

, respectively, and private equity, various debt and equity instruments, and real assets of

$6.0 billion

and

$5.6 billion

, respectively.

Governance and oversight

The Firm’s approach to managing principal risk is consistent with the Firm’s risk governance structure. A Firmwide risk policy framework exists for all principal investing activities and includes approval by executives who are independent from the investing businesses, as appropriate.

The Firm’s independent control functions

are responsible for reviewing the appropriateness of the carrying value of investments in accordance with relevant policies. As part of the risk governance structure, approved levels for investments are established and monitored for each relevant business or segment in order to manage the overall size of the portfolios. The Firm also conducts stress testing on these portfolios using specific scenarios that estimate losses based on significant market moves and/or other risk events.

MARKET RISK MANAGEMENT

Market risk

is

the risk associated with the effect of changes in market factors, such as interest and foreign exchange rates, equity and commodity prices, credit spreads or implied volatilities, on the value of assets and liabilities held for both the short and long term.

Market Risk Management

Market Risk Management monitors market risks throughout the Firm and defines market risk policies and procedures.

Market Risk Management seeks to manage risk, facilitate efficient risk/return decisions, reduce volatility in operating performance and provide transparency into the Firm’s market risk profile for senior management, the Board of Directors and regulators. Market Risk Management is responsible for the following functions:

•

Establishing a market risk policy framework

•

Independently measuring, monitoring and controlling LOB, Corporate, and Firmwide market risk

•

Defining, approving and monitoring of limits

•

Performing stress testing and qualitative risk assessments

Risk measurement

Measures used to capture market risk

There is no single measure to capture market risk and therefore Market Risk Management uses various metrics, both statistical and nonstatistical, to assess risk including:

•

Value-at-risk (VaR)

•

Stress testing

•

Profit and loss drawdowns

•

Earnings-at-risk

•

Other sensitivity-based measures

Risk monitoring and control

Market risk exposure is managed primarily through a series of limits set in the context of the market environment and business strategy. In setting limits, Market Risk Management takes into consideration factors such as market volatility, product liquidity, accommodation of client business, and management experience. Market Risk Management maintains different levels of limits. Firm level limits include VaR and stress limits. Similarly, LOB and Corporate limits include VaR and stress limits and may be supplemented by certain nonstatistical risk measures such as profit and loss drawdowns. Limits may also be set within the LOBs and Corporate, as well as at the legal entity level.

Market Risk Management sets limits and regularly reviews and updates them as appropriate. Senior management is responsible for reviewing and approving certain of these risk limits on an ongoing basis. Limits that have not been reviewed within specified time periods by Market Risk Management are escalated to senior management. The LOBs and Corporate are responsible for adhering to established limits against which exposures are monitored and reported.

Limit breaches are required to be reported in a timely manner to limit approvers, which include Market Risk Management and senior management. In the event of a breach, Market Risk Management consults with appropriate members of the Firm to determine the suitable course of action required to return the applicable positions to compliance, which may include a reduction in risk in order to remedy the breach or granting a temporary increase in limits to accommodate an expected increase in client activity and/or market volatility. Certain Firm, Corporate or LOB-level limit breaches are escalated as appropriate.

Management’s discussion and analysis

The following table summarizes the predominant business activities and related market risks, as well as positions which give rise to market risk and certain measures used to capture those risks, for each LOB and Corporate.

In addition to the predominant business activities, each LOB and Corporate may engage in principal investing activities. To the extent principal investments are deemed market risk sensitive, they are reflected in relevant risk measures (i.e., VaR or Other sensitivity-based measures) and captured in the table below. Refer to Investment Portfolio Risk Management on

JPMorgan Chase & Co./2019 Form 10-K

Value-at-risk

JPMorgan Chase utilizes VaR,

a statistical risk measure

,

to estimate the potential loss from adverse market moves in the current market environment. The Firm has a single VaR framework used as a basis for calculating

Risk Management VaR

and

Regulatory VaR

.

The framework is employed across the Firm using historical simulation based on data for the previous 12 months. The framework’s approach assumes that historical changes in market values are representative of the distribution of potential outcomes in the immediate future. The Firm believes the use of Risk Management VaR

provides a daily measure of risk that is closely aligned to risk management decisions made by the LOBs and Corporate and, along with other market risk measures, provides the appropriate information needed to respond to risk events.

The Firm’s

Risk Management VaR is calculated assuming a one-day holding period and an expected tail-loss methodology which approximates a 95% confidence level.

Risk Management

VaR provides a consistent framework to measure risk profiles and levels of diversification across product types and is used for aggregating risks and monitoring limits across businesses. VaR results are reported to senior management, the Board of Directors and regulators.

Under the Firm’s Risk Management VaR methodology, assuming current changes in market values are consistent with the historical changes used in the simulation, the Firm would expect to incur VaR “back-testing exceptions,” defined as losses greater than that predicted by VaR estimates,

an

average of five times every 100 trading days.

The number of VaR back-testing exceptions observed can differ from the statistically expected number of back-testing exceptions if the current level of market volatility is materially different from the level of market volatility during the 12 months of historical data used in the VaR calculation.

Underlying the overall VaR model framework are individual VaR models that simulate historical market returns for individual risk factors and/or product types. To capture material market risks as part of the Firm’s risk management framework, comprehensive VaR model calculations are performed daily for businesses whose activities give rise to market risk. These VaR models are granular and incorporate numerous risk factors and inputs to simulate daily changes in market values over the historical period; inputs are selected based on the risk profile of each portfolio, as sensitivities and historical time series used to generate daily market values may be different across product types or risk management systems. The VaR model results across all portfolios are aggregated at the Firm level.

As

VaR is based on historical data, it is an imperfect measure of market risk exposure and potential future losses.

In addition, based on their reliance on available historical data, limited time horizons, and other factors, VaR measures are inherently limited in their ability to measure certain risks and to predict losses, particularly those associated with market illiquidity and sudden or severe shifts in market conditions.

For certain products, specific risk parameters are not captured in VaR due to the lack of inherent liquidity and availability of appropriate historical data. The Firm uses proxies to estimate the VaR for these and other products when daily time series are not available. It is likely that using an actual price-based time series for these products, if available, would affect the VaR results presented.

The Firm therefore considers other nonstatistical measures such as stress testing, in addition to VaR, to capture and manage its market risk positions.

The daily market data used in VaR models may be different than the independent third-party data collected for VCG price testing in its monthly valuation process. For example, in cases where market prices are not observable, or where proxies are used in VaR historical time series, the data sources may differ. Refer to Valuation process in Note


for further information on the Firm’s valuation process. As VaR model calculations require daily data and a consistent source for valuation, it may not be practical to use the data collected in the VCG monthly valuation process for VaR model calculations.

The Firm’s VaR model calculations are periodically evaluated and enhanced in response to changes in the composition of the Firm’s portfolios, changes in market conditions, improvements in the Firm’s modeling techniques and measurements, and other factors. Such changes may affect historical comparisons of VaR results. Refer to Estimations and Model Risk Management on

page 135

for information regarding model reviews and approvals.

The Firm calculates separately a daily aggregated VaR in accordance with regulatory rules (“Regulatory VaR”), which is used to derive the Firm’s regulatory VaR-based capital requirements under Basel III. This Regulatory VaR model framework currently assumes a ten business-day holding period and an expected tail loss methodology which approximates a 99% confidence level. Regulatory VaR is applied to “covered” positions as defined by Basel III, which may be different than the positions included in the Firm’s Risk Management VaR. For example, credit derivative hedges of accrual loans are included in the Firm’s Risk Management VaR, while Regulatory VaR excludes these credit derivative hedges. In addition, in contrast to the Firm’s Risk Management VaR, Regulatory VaR currently excludes the diversification benefit for certain VaR models.

JPMorgan Chase & Co./2019 Form 10-K


Management’s discussion and analysis

Refer to JPMorgan Chase’s Basel III Pillar 3 Regulatory Capital Disclosures reports, which are available on the Firm’s website, for additional information on Regulatory

VaR and the other components of market risk regulatory capital for the Firm (e.g., VaR-based measure, stressed VaR-based measure and the respective backtesting).

The table below shows the results of the Firm’s Risk Management VaR measure using a 95% confidence level. VaR can vary significantly as positions change, market volatility fluctuates, and diversification benefits change.

(a)

Average portfolio VaR is less than the sum of the VaR of the components described above, which is due to portfolio diversification. The diversification effect reflects that the risks are not perfectly correlated.

(b)

Diversification benefit represents the difference between the total VaR and each reported level and the sum of its individual components. Diversification benefit reflects the non-additive nature of VaR due to imperfect correlation across LOBs, Corporate, and risk types. The maximum and minimum VaR for each portfolio may have occurred on different trading days than the components and consequently diversification benefit is not meaningful.

Average Total VaR increased $2 million for the year-ended

December 31, 2019

as compared with the prior year. This was predominantly due to increased exposure in the Fixed Income risk type, increases in the Equities risk type driven by the inclusion of Tradeweb following its IPO in the second quarter of 2019, and increased volatility in the one-year historical look-back period, partially offset by increases in diversification benefit.

In addition, average CCB VaR increased by $4 million, driven by MSR risk management activities.

VaR back-testing

The Firm performs daily VaR model back-testing, which compares the daily Risk Management VaR results with the daily gains and losses actually recognized on market-risk related revenue.

The Firm’s definition, of market risk-related gains and losses is consistent with the definition used by the banking regulators under Basel III. Under this definition, market risk-related gains and losses are defined as: gains and losses on the positions included in the Firm’s Risk Management VaR excluding select components of revenue such as fees, commissions, certain valuation adjustments, net interest income, and gains and losses arising from intraday trading.

Other risk measures

Stress testing

Along with VaR, stress testing is an important tool used to assess risk. While VaR reflects the risk of loss due to adverse changes in markets using recent historical market behavior, stress testing reflects the risk of loss from hypothetical changes in the value of market risk sensitive positions applied simultaneously. Stress testing measures the Firm’s vulnerability to losses under a range of stressed but possible economic and market scenarios. The results are used to understand the exposures responsible for those potential losses and are measured against limits.

The Firm’s stress framework covers Corporate and all LOBs with market risk sensitive positions.

The framework is used to calculate multiple magnitudes of potential stress for both market rallies and market sell-offs, assuming significant changes in market factors such as credit spreads, equity prices, interest rates, currency rates and commodity prices, and combines them in multiple ways to capture an array of hypothetical economic and market scenarios.

The Firm generates a number of scenarios that focus on tail events in specific asset classes and geographies, including how the event may impact multiple market factors simultaneously. Scenarios also incorporate specific idiosyncratic risks and stress basis risk between different products. The flexibility in the stress framework allows the Firm to construct new scenarios that can test the outcomes against possible future stress events. Stress testing results are reported on a regular basis to senior management of the Firm, as appropriate.

Stress scenarios are governed by an overall stress framework and are subject to the standards outlined in the Firm’s policies related to model risk management. Significant changes to the framework are reviewed as appropriate.

The Firm’s stress testing framework is utilized in calculating  the Firm’s CCAR and other stress test results, which are reported to the Board of Directors. In addition, stress testing results are incorporated into the Firm’s Risk Appetite framework, and are reported periodically to the Board Risk Committee.

Profit and loss drawdowns

Profit and loss drawdowns are used to highlight trading losses above certain levels of risk tolerance. A profit and loss drawdown is a decline in revenue from its year-to-date peak level.

Earnings-at-risk

The effect of interest rate exposure on the Firm’s reported net income is important as interest rate risk represents one of the Firm’s significant market risks. Interest rate risk arises not only from trading activities but also from the Firm’s traditional banking activities, which include extension of loans and credit facilities, taking deposits and issuing debt as well as from the investment securities portfolio.

Refer to the table on

page 120

for a summary by LOB and Corporate, identifying positions included in earnings-at-risk

.

The CTC Risk Committee establishes the Firm’s structural interest rate risk policy and related limits, which are subject to approval by the Board Risk Committee. Treasury and CIO, working in partnership with the LOBs, calculates the Firm’s structural interest rate risk profile and reviews it with senior management, including the CTC Risk Committee.

In addition, oversight of structural interest rate risk is managed through a dedicated risk function reporting to the CTC. This risk function is responsible for providing independent oversight and governance around assumptions and establishing and monitoring limits for structural interest rate risk. The Firm manages structural interest rate risk generally through its investment securities portfolio and interest rate derivatives.

Structural interest rate risk can occur due to a variety of factors, including:

•

Differences in timing among the maturity or repricing of assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet instruments

•

Differences in the amounts of assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet instruments that are maturing or repricing at the same time

•

Differences in the amounts by which short-term and long-term market interest rates change (for example, changes in the slope of the yield curve)

•

The impact of changes in the maturity of various assets, liabilities or off-balance sheet instruments as interest rates change

The Firm manages interest rate exposure related to its assets and liabilities on a consolidated, Firmwide basis. Business units transfer their interest rate risk to Treasury and CIO through funds transfer pricing, which takes into account the elements of interest rate exposure that can be risk-managed in financial markets. These elements include asset and liability balances and contractual rates of interest, contractual principal payment schedules, expected prepayment experience, interest rate reset dates and maturities, rate indices used for repricing, and any interest rate ceilings or floors for adjustable rate products. All transfer-pricing assumptions are dynamically reviewed.


JPMorgan Chase & Co./2019 Form 10-K

One way the Firm evaluates its structural interest rate risk is through earnings-at-risk. Earnings-at-risk estimates the Firm’s interest rate exposure for a given interest rate scenario. It is presented as a sensitivity to a baseline, which includes net interest income and certain interest rate sensitive fees. The baseline uses market interest rates and in the case of deposits, pricing assumptions. The Firm conducts simulations of changes to this baseline for interest rate-sensitive assets and liabilities denominated in U.S. dollars and other currencies (“non-U.S. dollar” currencies). These simulations primarily include retained loans, deposits, deposits with banks, investment securities, long-term debt and any related interest rate hedges, and exclude other positions in risk management VaR and other sensitivity-based measures

as described on

page 120

.

Earnings-at-risk scenarios estimate the potential change to a net interest income baseline, over the following 12 months, utilizing multiple assumptions.

These scenarios include a parallel shift involving changes to both short-term and long-term rates by an equal amount; a steeper yield curve involving holding short-term rates constant and increasing long-term rates or decreasing short-term rates and holding long-term rates constant; and a flatter yield curve involving increasing short-term rates and holding long-term rates constant or holding short-term rates constant and decreasing long-term rates. These scenarios consider many different factors, including:

•

The impact on exposures as a result of instantaneous changes in interest rates from baseline rates.

•

Forecasted balance sheet, as well as modeled prepayment and reinvestment behavior, but do not include assumptions about actions that could be taken by the Firm in response to any such instantaneous rate changes. Mortgage prepayment assumptions are based on the interest rates used in the scenarios compared with underlying contractual rates, the time since origination, and other factors which are updated periodically based on historical experience.

•

The pricing sensitivity of deposits, using normalized deposit betas which represent the amount by which deposit rates paid could change upon a given change in market interest rates over the cycle. The deposit rates paid in these scenarios differ from actual deposit rates paid, particularly for retail deposits, due to repricing lags and other factors.

The Firm’s earnings-at-risk scenarios are periodically evaluated and enhanced in response to changes in the composition of the Firm’s balance sheet, changes in market conditions, improvements in the Firm’s simulation and other factors.

While a relevant measure of the Firm’s interest rate exposure, the earnings at risk analysis does not represent a forecast of the Firm’s net interest income (Refer to the 2020 Outlook on

page 45

for additional information)

.

The Firm’s U.S. dollar sensitivities are presented in the table below.

The change in the

Firm’s U.S. dollar sensitivities as of December 31, 2019

compared to December 31, 2018

reflected updates to the Firm’s baseline for lower short-term and long-term rates as well as the impact of changes in the Firm’s balance sheet.

The Firm’s sensitivity to short-term rates reflected updates to the Firm’s baseline for lower rates but changes in the Firm’s balance sheet more than offset the impacts of the lower rates. The Firm’s sensitivity to long-term rates increased as a result of updates to the Firm’s baseline to reflect lower rates in addition to changes in the Firm’s balance sheet. The increased sensitivity to long-term rates is more impactful to the downward scenario due to the Firm’s sensitivity to mortgage prepayments

Non-U.S. dollar foreign exchange risk

Non-U.S. dollar FX risk is the risk that changes in foreign exchange rates affect the value of the Firm’s assets or liabilities or future results. The Firm has structural non-U.S. dollar FX exposures arising from capital investments, forecasted expense and revenue, the investment securities

portfolio and non-U.S. dollar-denominated debt issuance. Treasury and CIO, working in partnership with the LOBs, primarily manage these risks on behalf of the Firm. Treasury and CIO may hedge certain of these risks using derivatives.

Other sensitivity-based measures

The Firm quantifies the market risk of certain investment and funding activities by assessing the potential impact on net revenue and other comprehensive income (“OCI”) due to changes in relevant market variables. Refer to the table Predominant business activities that give rise to market risk on

page 120

for additional information on the positions captured in other sensitivity-based measures.

The table below represents the potential impact to net revenue or OCI for market risk sensitive instruments that are not included in VaR or earnings-at-risk.

COUNTRY RISK MANAGEMENT

The Firm, through its LOBs and Corporate, may be exposed to country risk resulting from financial, economic, political or other significant developments which adversely affect the value of the Firm’s exposures related to a particular country or set of countries. The Country Risk Management group actively monitors the various portfolios which may be impacted by these developments and measures the extent to which

the Firm’s exposures are diversified given the Firm’s strategy and risk tolerance relative to a country.

Organization and management

Country Risk Management is an independent risk management function that assesses, manages and monitors country risk originated across the Firm.

The Firm’s country risk management function includes the following activities:

•

Establishing policies, procedures and standards consistent with a comprehensive country risk framework

•

Assigning sovereign ratings, assessing country risks and establishing risk tolerance relative to a country

•

Measuring and monitoring country risk exposure and stress across the Firm

•

Managing and approving country limits and reporting trends and limit breaches to senior management

•

Developing surveillance tools, such as signaling models and ratings indicators, for early identification of potential country risk concerns

•

Providing country risk scenario analysis

Sources and measurement

The Firm is exposed to country risk through its lending and deposits, investing, and market-making activities, whether cross-border or locally funded. Country exposure includes activity with both government and private-sector entities in a country. Under the Firm’s internal country risk management approach, attribution of exposure to a specific country is based on the country where the largest proportion of the assets of the

counterparty, issuer, obligor or guarantor are located or where the largest proportion of its revenue is derived, which may be different than the domicile (i.e. legal residence) or country of incorporation of the counterparty, issuer, obligor or guarantor. Country exposures are generally measured by considering the Firm’s risk to an immediate default of the counterparty, issuer, obligor or guarantor, with zero recovery. Assumptions are sometimes required in determining the measurement and allocation of country exposure, particularly in the case of certain non-linear or index exposures. The use of different measurement approaches or assumptions could affect the amount of reported country exposure.

Under the Firm’s internal country risk measurement framework:

•

Lending exposures are measured at the total committed amount (funded and unfunded), net of the allowance for credit losses and eligible cash and marketable securities collateral received

•

Deposits are measured as the cash balances placed with central and commercial banks

•

Securities financing exposures are measured at their receivable balance, net of eligible collateral received

•

Debt and equity securities are measured at the fair value of all positions, including both long and short positions

•

Counterparty exposure on derivative receivables is measured at the derivative’s fair value, net of the fair value of the eligible collateral received

•

Credit derivatives protection purchased and sold is reported based on the underlying reference entity and is measured at the notional amount of protection purchased or sold, net of the fair value of the recognized derivative receivable or payable. Credit derivatives protection purchased and sold in the Firm’s market-making activities is measured on a net basis, as such activities often result in selling and purchasing protection related to the same underlying reference entity; this reflects the manner in which the Firm manages these exposures

Some activities may create contingent or indirect exposure related to a country (for example, providing clearing services or secondary exposure to collateral on securities financing receivables). These exposures are managed in the normal course of business through the Firm’s credit, market, and operational risk governance, rather than through Country Risk Management.

The Firm’s internal country risk reporting differs from the reporting provided under the FFIEC bank regulatory requirements. Refer to Cross-border outstandings on

page 306

of the


Form 10-K for further information on the FFIEC’s reporting methodology.

Management’s discussion and analysis

Stress testing

Stress testing is an important component of the Firm’s country risk management framework, which aims to estimate and limit losses arising from a country crisis by measuring the impact of adverse asset price movements to a country based on market shocks combined with counterparty specific assumptions. Country Risk Management periodically designs and runs tailored stress scenarios to test vulnerabilities to individual countries or  sets

of countries in response to specific or potential market events, sector performance concerns, sovereign actions and geopolitical risks. These tailored stress results are used to  inform potential risk reduction across the Firm, as necessary.

Risk reporting

Country exposure and stress are measured and reported regularly, and used by Country Risk Management to identify trends, and monitor high usages and breaches against limits.

For country risk management purposes, the Firm may report exposure to jurisdictions that are not fully autonomous, including Special Administrative Regions (“SAR”) and dependent territories, separately from the independent sovereign states with which they are associated.

The following table presents the Firm’s top 20 exposures by country (excluding the U.S.) as of

December 31, 2019

, and their comparative exposures as of

OPERATIONAL RISK MANAGEMENT

Operational risk

is

the risk associated with an adverse outcome resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes or systems; human factors; or external events impacting the Firm’s processes or systems

;

it includes compliance, conduct, legal, and estimations and model risk.

Operational risk is inherent in the Firm’s activities and can manifest

itself in various ways, including fraudulent acts, business interruptions, cybersecurity attacks, inappropriate employee behavior, failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations or failure of vendors to perform in accordance with their agreements. Operational Risk Management attempts to manage operational risk at appropriate levels in light of the Firm’s financial position, the characteristics of its businesses, and the markets and regulatory environments in which it operates.

Operational Risk Management Framework

The Firm’s Compliance, Conduct, and Operational Risk (“CCOR”) Management Framework is designed to enable the Firm to govern, identify, measure, monitor and test, manage and report on the Firm’s operational risk.

Operational Risk Governance

The LOBs and Corporate hold ownership, responsibility and accountability for the management of operational risk. The Control Management Organization, which consists of control managers within each LOB and Corporate, is responsible for the day-to-day execution of the CCOR Framework and the evaluation of the effectiveness of their control environments to determine where targeted remediation efforts may be required.

LOBs and Corporate control committees are responsible for reviewing data that indicates the quality and stability of processes, addressing key operational risk issues, focusing on processes with control concerns, and overseeing control remediation.

The Firm’s Global Chief Compliance Officer (“CCO”) and FRE for Operational Risk is responsible for defining the CCOR Management Framework and establishing minimum standards for its execution. Operational Risk Officers (“OROs”) report to both the LOB CROs and to the FRE for Operational Risk, and are independent of the respective businesses or functions they oversee.

The Firm’s CCOR Management policy establishes the CCOR Management Framework for the Firm. The CCOR Management Framework is articulated in the Risk

Governance and Oversight Policy which is reviewed and approved by the Board Risk Committee periodically.

Operational Risk identification

The Firm utilizes a structured risk and control self-assessment process that is executed by the LOBs and Corporate. As part of this process, the LOBs and Corporate evaluate the effectiveness of their control environment to assess where controls have failed, and to determine where remediation efforts may be required. CCOR Management

provides oversight of these activities and may also perform independent assessments of significant operational risk events and areas of concentrated or emerging risk.

Operational Risk Measurement

CCOR Management performs independent risk assessments of the Firm’s operational risks, which includes assessing the effectiveness of the control environment and reporting the results to senior management.

In addition, o

perational risk measurement includes operational risk-based capital and operational risk loss projections under both baseline and stressed conditions.

The primary component of the operational risk capital estimate is the Loss Distribution Approach (“LDA”) statistical model, which simulates the frequency and severity of future operational risk loss projections based on historical data. The LDA model is used to estimate an aggregate operational risk loss over a one-year time horizon, at a 99.9% confidence level. The LDA model incorporates actual internal operational risk losses in the quarter following the period in which those losses were realized, and the calculation generally continues to reflect such losses even after the issues or business activities giving rise to the losses have been remediated or reduced.

As required under the Basel III capital framework, the Firm’s operational risk-based capital methodology, which uses the Advanced Measurement Approach (“AMA”), incorporates internal and external losses as well as management’s view of tail risk captured through operational risk scenario analysis, and evaluation of key business environment and internal control metrics. The Firm does not reflect the impact of insurance in its AMA estimate of operational risk capital.

The Firm considers the impact of stressed economic conditions on operational risk losses and develops a forward looking view of material operational risk events that may occur in a stressed environment. The Firm’s operational risk stress testing framework is utilized in calculating results for the Firm’s CCAR and other stress testing processes.

Refer to Capital Risk Management section, on

pages 85–92

for information related to operational risk RWA, and CCAR.

Operational Risk Monitoring and testing

The results of risk assessments performed by CCOR Management are leveraged as one of the key criteria in the independent monitoring and testing of the LOBs and Corporate’s compliance with laws and regulation. Through monitoring and testing, CCOR Management independently identifies areas of operational risk and tests the effectiveness of controls within the LOBs and Corporate.

JPMorgan Chase & Co./2019 Form 10-K


Management’s discussion and analysis

Management of Operational Risk

The operational risk areas or issues identified through monitoring and testing are escalated to the LOBs and Corporate to be remediated through action plans, as needed, to mitigate operational risk. CCOR Management may advise the LOBs and Corporate in the development and implementation of action plans.

Operational Risk Reporting

Escalation of risks is a fundamental expectation for employees at the Firm. Risks identified by CCOR Management are escalated to the appropriate LOB and Corporate Control Committees, as needed. CCOR Management has established standards to ensure that consistent operational risk reporting and operational risk reports are produced on a Firmwide basis as well as by LOBs and Corporate.  Reporting includes the evaluation of key risk indicators and key performance indicators against established thresholds as well as the assessment of different types of operational risk against stated risk appetite. The standards reinforce escalation protocols to senior management and to the Board of Directors.

Subcategories and examples of operational risks

Operational risk can manifest itself in various ways. Operational risk subcategories such as Compliance risk, Conduct risk, Legal risk, and Estimations and Model risk as well as other operational risks, can lead to losses which are captured through the Firm’s operational risk measurement processes

. Refer to pages


,


, and


, respectively for more information on Compliance, Conduct, Legal, and Estimations and Model risk. Details on other select examples of operational risks are provided below.

Cybersecurity risk

Cybersecurity risk is an important, continuous and evolving focus for the Firm. The Firm devotes significant resources to protecting and continuing to improve the security of its computer systems, software, networks and other technology assets. The Firm’s security efforts are designed to protect against, among other things, cybersecurity attacks by unauthorized parties attempting to obtain access to confidential information, destroy data, disrupt or degrade service, sabotage systems or cause other damage. The Firm continues to make significant investments in enhancing its cyberdefense capabilities and to strengthen its partnerships with the appropriate government and law enforcement agencies and other businesses in order to understand the full spectrum of cybersecurity risks in the operating environment, enhance defenses and improve resiliency against cybersecurity threats. The Firm actively participates in discussions of cybersecurity risks with law enforcement, government officials, peer and industry groups, and has significantly increased efforts to educate employees and certain clients on the topic.

Third parties with which the Firm does business or that facilitate the Firm’s business activities (e.g., vendors, exchanges, clearing houses, central depositories, and financial intermediaries) are also sources of cybersecurity

risk to the Firm. Third party cybersecurity incidents such as system breakdowns or failures, misconduct by the employees of such parties, or cyberattacks could affect their ability to deliver a product or service to the Firm or result in lost or compromised information of the Firm or its clients. Clients are also sources of cybersecurity risk to the Firm, particularly when their activities and systems are beyond the Firm’s own security and control systems. As a result, the Firm engages in regular and ongoing discussions with certain vendors and clients regarding cybersecurity risks and opportunities to improve security. However, where cybersecurity incidents occur as a result of client failures to maintain the security of their own systems and processes, clients are responsible for losses incurred.

To protect the confidentiality, integrity and availability of the Firm’s infrastructure, resources and information, the Firm maintains a cybersecurity program designed to prevent, detect, and respond to cyberattacks. The Audit Committee is updated periodically on the Firm’s Information Security Program, recommended changes, cybersecurity policies and practices, ongoing efforts to improve security, as well as its efforts regarding significant cybersecurity events. In addition, the Firm has a cybersecurity incident response plan (“IRP”) designed to enable the Firm to respond to attempted cybersecurity incidents, coordinate such responses with law enforcement and other government agencies, and notify clients and customers, as applicable. Among other key focus areas, the IRP is designed to mitigate the risk of insider trading connected to a cybersecurity incident, and includes various escalation points.

The Cybersecurity and Technology Control functions are responsible for governance and oversight of the Firm’s Information Security Program. In partnership with the Firm’s LOBs and Corporate, the Cybersecurity and Technology Control organization identifies information security risk issues and oversees programs for the technological protection of the Firm’s information resources including applications, infrastructure as well as confidential and personal information related to the Firm’s customers. The Cybersecurity and Technology organization is comprised of business aligned information security managers that are supported within the organization by the following products that execute the Information Security Program for the Firm:

•

Cyber Defense & Fraud

•

Data Management, Protection & Privacy

•

Identity & Access Management

•

Governance & Controls

•

Production Management & Resiliency

•

Software & Platform Enablement

The Global Cybersecurity and Technology Control governance structure is designed to identify, escalate, and mitigate information security risks. This structure uses key governance forums to disseminate information and monitor


JPMorgan Chase & Co./2019 Form 10-K

technology efforts. These forums are established at multiple levels throughout the Firm and include representatives from each LOB and Corporate. Reports containing overviews of key technology risks and efforts to enhance related controls are produced for these forums, and are reviewed by management at multiple levels. The forums are used to escalate information security risks or other matters as appropriate.

The IRM function provides oversight of the activities designed to identify, assess, measure, and mitigate cybersecurity risk.

The Firm’s Security Awareness Program includes training that reinforces the Firm's Information Technology Risk and Security Management policies, standards and practices, as well as the expectation that employees comply with these policies. The Security Awareness Program engages personnel through training

on how to identify potential cybersecurity risks and protect the Firm’s resources and information. This training is mandatory for all employees globally on a periodic basis, and it is supplemented by Firmwide testing initiatives, including periodic phishing tests. Finally, the Firm’s Global Privacy Program requires all employees to take periodic awareness training on data privacy. This privacy-focused training includes information about confidentiality and security, as well as responding to unauthorized access to or use of information.

Business and technology resiliency risk

Business disruptions can occur due to forces beyond the Firm’s control such as severe weather, power or telecommunications loss, accidents, failure of a third party to provide expected services, cyberattack, flooding, transit strikes, terrorism, health emergencies, the spread of infectious diseases or pandemics. The safety of the Firm’s employees and customers is of the highest priority. The Firmwide resiliency program is intended to enable the Firm to recover its critical business functions and supporting assets (i.e., staff, technology and facilities) in the event of a business interruption. The program includes governance, awareness training, and testing of recovery strategies, as well as strategic and tactical initiatives to identify, assess, and manage business interruption and public safety risks. The strength and proficiency of the Firmwide resiliency program has played an integral role in maintaining the Firm’s business operations during and after various events.

Payment fraud risk

Payment fraud risk is the risk of external and internal parties unlawfully obtaining personal monetary benefit through misdirected or otherwise improper payment. The risk of payment fraud remains at a heightened level across the industry. The complexities of these incidents and the strategies used by perpetrators continue to evolve. Under the Payments Control Program, methods are developed for managing the risk, implementing controls, and providing employee and client education and awareness trainings. The Firm’s monitoring of customer behavior is periodically

evaluated and enhanced in an effort to detect and mitigate new strategies implemented by fraud perpetrators.

Third-party outsourcing risk

The Firm‘s Third-Party Oversight (“TPO”) and Inter-affiliates Oversight (“IAO”) framework assist the LOBs and Corporate in selecting, documenting, onboarding, monitoring and managing their supplier relationships including services provided by affiliates. The objectives of the TPO framework is to hold suppliers to a high level of operational performance and to mitigate key risks including data loss and business disruption. The Corporate Third-Party Oversight group is responsible for Firmwide training, monitoring, reporting and standards.

Insurance

One of the ways in which operational risk may be mitigated is through insurance maintained by the Firm. The Firm purchases insurance from commercial insurers and maintains a wholly-owned captive insurer, Park Assurance Company. Insurance may also be required by third parties with whom the Firm does business.

Management’s discussion and analysis

COMPLIANCE RISK MANAGEMENT

Compliance risk, a subcategory of operational risk, is the risk of failing to comply with laws, rules, regulations or codes of conduct and standards of self-regulatory organizations.

Overview

Each LOB and Corporate hold primary ownership of and accountability for managing compliance risk. The Firm’s Compliance Organization (“Compliance”), which is independent of the LOBs, provides independent review, monitoring and oversight of business operations with a focus on compliance with the legal and regulatory obligations applicable to the delivery of the Firm’s products and services to clients and customers.

These compliance risks relate to a wide variety of legal and regulatory obligations, depending on the LOB and the jurisdiction, and include risks related to financial products and services, relationships and interactions with clients and customers, and employee activities. For example, compliance risks include those associated with anti-money laundering compliance, trading activities, market conduct, and complying with the rules and regulations related to the offering of products and services across jurisdictional borders. Compliance risk is also inherent in the Firm’s fiduciary activities, including the failure to exercise the applicable standard of care (such as the duties of loyalty or care), to act in the best interest of clients and customers or to treat clients and customers fairly.

Other functions provide oversight of significant regulatory obligations that are specific to their respective areas of responsibility.

CCOR Management implements policies and standards designed to govern, identify, measure, monitor and test, manage, and report compliance risk.

Governance and oversight

Compliance is led by the Firm’s Global CCO and FRE for Operational Risk.

The Firm maintains oversight and coordination of its compliance risk through the implementation of the CCOR Risk Management Framework. The Firm’s CCO also provides regular updates to the Audit Committee and

t

he Board Risk Committee. In addition, certain Special Purpose Committees of the Board have previously been established to oversee the Firm’s compliance with regulatory Consent Orders.

Code of Conduct

The Firm has a Code of Conduct (the “Code”) that sets forth the Firm’s expectation that employees will conduct themselves with integrity at all times and provides the principles that govern employee conduct with clients, customers, shareholders and one another, as well as with the markets and communities in which the Firm does business.

The Code requires employees to promptly report any known or suspected violation of the Code, any internal Firm policy, or any law or regulation applicable to the Firm’s business. It also requires employees to report any illegal conduct, or conduct that violates the underlying principles of the Code, by any of the Firm’s employees, clients, customers, suppliers, contract workers, business partners, or agents. All newly hired employees are assigned Code training and current employees are periodically assigned Code training on an ongoing basis. Employees are required to affirm their compliance with the Code periodically.

Employees can report any potential or actual violations of the Code through the Code Reporting Hotline by phone or the internet. The Hotline is anonymous, except in certain non-U.S. jurisdictions where laws prohibit anonymous reporting, and is available at all times globally, with translation services. It is administered by an outside service provider. The Code prohibits retaliation against anyone who raises an issue or concern in good faith. Periodically, the Audit Committee receives reports on the Code of Conduct program.


JPMorgan Chase & Co./2019 Form 10-K

CONDUCT RISK MANAGEMENT

Conduct risk, a subcategory of operational risk, is the risk that any action or inaction by an employee or employees could lead to unfair client or customer outcomes, impact the integrity of the markets in which the Firm operates, or compromise the Firm’s reputation.

Overview

Each LOB and Corporate is accountable for identifying and managing its conduct risk to provide appropriate engagement, ownership and sustainability of a culture consistent with the Firm’s How We Do Business Principles (the “Principles”). The Principles serve as a guide for how employees are expected to conduct themselves. With the Principles serving as a guide, the Firm’s Code sets out the Firm’s expectations for each employee and provides information and resources to help e

mployees conduct business ethically and in compliance with the laws everywhere the Firm operates. Refer to Compliance Risk Management on

page 132

for further discussion of the Code.

Governance and oversight

The Conduct Risk Program is governed by the CCOR Management policy, which establishes the framework for governance, identification, measurement, monitoring and testing, management and reporting conduct ris

k in the Firm.

The Conduct Risk Steering Committee (CRSC) provides oversight of the Firm’s conduct initiatives to develop a more holistic view of conduct risks and to connect key programs across the Firm in order to identify opportunities and emerging areas of focus.

Each committee of the Board oversees conduct risks within its scope of responsibilities, and the CRSC may escalate to such committees as appropriate.

Conduct risk management encompasses various aspects of people management practices throughout the employee life cycle, including recruiting, onboarding, training and development, performance management, promotion and compensation processes. Each LOB, Treasury and CIO, and designated corporate functions completes an assessment of conduct risk periodically, reviews metrics and issues which may involve conduct risk, and provides business conduct training as appropriate.

Management’s discussion and analysis

LEGAL RISK MANAGEMENT

Legal risk, a subcategory of operational risk, is the risk of loss primarily caused by the actual or alleged failure to meet legal obligations that arise from the rule of law in jurisdictions in which the Firm operates, agreements with clients and customers, and products and services offered by the Firm.

Overview

The global Legal function (“Legal”) provides legal services and advice to the Firm. Legal is responsible for managing the Firm’s exposure to legal risk by:

•

managing actual and potential litigation and enforcement matters, including internal reviews and investigations related to such matters

•

advising on products and services, including contract negotiation and documentation

•

advising on offering and marketing documents and new business initiatives

•

managing dispute resolution

•

interpreting existing laws, rules and regulations, and advising on changes thereto

•

advising on advocacy in connection with contemplated and proposed laws, rules and regulations, and

•

providing legal advice to the LOBs and Corporate, in alignment with the lines of defense described under Firmwide Risk Management on

pages 79–83

.

Legal selects, engages and manages outside counsel for the Firm on all matters in which outside counsel is engaged. In addition, Legal advises the Firm’s Conflicts Office which reviews the Firm’s wholesale transactions that may have the potential to create conflicts of interest for the Firm.

Governance and oversight

The Firm’s General Counsel reports to the CEO and is a member of the Operating Committee, the Firmwide Risk Committee and the Firmwide Control Committee. The Firm’s General Counsel and other members of Legal report on significant legal matters to the Firm’s Board of Directors and periodically to the Audit Committee.

Legal serves on and advises various committees (including new business initiative and reputation risk committees) and advises the Firm’s LOBs and Corporate on potential reputation risk issues.


JPMorgan Chase & Co./2019 Form 10-K

ESTIMATIONS AND MODEL RISK MANAGEMENT

Estimations and Model risk, a subcategory of operational risk, is the potential for adverse consequences from decisions based on incorrect or misused estimation outputs.

The Firm uses models and other analytical and judgment-based estimations across various businesses and functions. The estimation methods are of varying levels of sophistication and are used for many purposes, such as the valuation of positions and measurement of risk, assessing regulatory capital requirements, conducting stress testing, and making business decisions. A dedicated independent function, Model Risk Governance and Review (“MRGR”), defines and governs the Firm’s policies relating to the management of model risk and risks associated with certain analytical and judgment-based estimations, such as those used in risk management, budget forecasting and capital planning and analysis.

The governance of analytical and judgment-based estimations within MRGR’s scope follows a consistent approach to the approach used for models, which is described in detail below.

Model risks are owned by the users of the models within the Firm based on the specific purposes of such models. Users and developers of models are responsible for developing, implementing and testing their models, as well as referring models to the Model Risk function for review and approval. Once models have been approved, model users and developers are responsible for maintaining a robust operating environment, and must monitor and evaluate the performance of the models on an ongoing basis. Model users and developers may seek to enhance models in response to changes in the portfolios and in product and market developments, as well as to capture improvements in available modeling techniques and systems capabilities.

Models are tiered based on an internal standard according to their complexity, the exposure associated with the model and the Firm’s reliance on the model. This tiering is subject to the approval of the Model Risk function. In its review of a model, the Model Risk function considers whether the model is suitable for the specific purposes for which it will be used. When reviewing a model, the Model Risk function analyzes and challenges the model methodology and the reasonableness of model assumptions, and may perform or require additional testing, including back-testing of model outcomes. Model reviews are approved by the appropriate level of management within the Model Risk function based on the relevant model tier.

Under the Firm’s Estimations and Model Risk Management Policy, the Model Risk function reviews and approves new models, as well as material changes to existing models, prior to implementation in the operating environment. In certain circumstances exceptions may be granted to the Firm’s policy to allow a model to be used prior to review or approval. The Model Risk function may also require the user to take appropriate actions to mitigate the model risk if it is to be used in the interim. These actions will depend on the model and may include, for example, limitation of trading activity.

Management’s discussion and analysis

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES USED BY THE FIRM

JPMorgan Chase

’s accounting policies and use of estimates are integral to understanding its reported results. The Firm’s most complex accounting estimates require management’s judgment to ascertain the appropriate carrying value of assets and liabilities. The Firm has established policies and control procedures intended to ensure that estimation methods, including any judgments made as part of such methods, are well-controlled, independently reviewed and applied consistently from period to period. The methods used and judgments made reflect, among other factors, the nature of the assets or liabilities and the related business and risk management strategies, which may vary across the Firm’s businesses and portfolios. In addition, the policies and procedures are intended to ensure that the process for changing methodologies occurs in an appropriate manner. The Firm believes its estimates for determining the carrying value of its assets and liabilities are appropriate. The following is a brief description of the Firm’s critical accounting estimates involving significant judgments.

Allowance for credit losses

The Firm’s allowance for credit losses covers the retained consumer and wholesale loan portfolios, as well as the Firm’s wholesale and certain consumer lending-related commitments. The allowance for loan losses is intended to adjust the carrying value of the Firm’s loans to reflect probable credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio as of the balance sheet date. Similarly, the allowance for lending-related commitments is established to cover probable credit losses inherent in the lending-related commitments portfolio as of the balance sheet date.

The allowance for credit losses includes a formula-based component, an asset-specific component, and a component related to PCI loans. The determination of each of these components involves significant judgment on a number of matters. Refer to Allowance for credit losses on

pages 116–117

and Note


for further information on these components, areas of judgment and methodologies used in establishing the Firm’s allowance for credit losses.

Allowance for credit losses sensitivity

The Firm’s allowance for credit losses is sensitive to numerous factors, which may differ depending on the portfolio. Changes in economic conditions or in the Firm’s assumptions and estimates could affect its estimate of probable credit losses inherent in the portfolio at the balance sheet date. The Firm uses its best judgment to assess these economic conditions and loss data in estimating the allowance for credit losses and these estimates are subject to periodic refinement based on changes to underlying external or Firm-specific historical data. Refer to Note


for further discussion.

To illustrate the potential magnitude of certain alternate judgments, the Firm estimates that changes in the following inputs would have the following effects on the Firm’s modeled credit loss estimates as of

December 31, 2019

, without consideration of any offsetting or correlated effects of other inputs in the Firm’s allowance for loan losses:

•

A combined

5%

decline in housing prices and a


basis point increase in unemployment rates from expectations could imply:

◦

an increase to modeled credit loss estimates of approximately

$250 million

for PCI loans.

◦

an increase to modeled annual credit loss estimates of approximately

$50 million

for residential real estate loans, excluding PCI loans.

•

For credit card loans, a


basis point increase in unemployment rates from expectations could imply an increase to modeled annual credit loss estimates of approximately

$850 million

.

•

An increase in probability of default (“PD”) factors consistent with a one-notch downgrade in the Firm’s internal risk ratings for its entire wholesale loan portfolio could imply an increase in the Firm’s modeled credit loss estimates of approximately

$1.6 billion

.

•

A 100 basis point increase in estimated loss given default (“LGD”) for the Firm’s entire wholesale loan portfolio could imply an increase in the Firm’s modeled credit loss estimates of approximately

$200 million

.

The purpose of these sensitivity analyses is to provide an indication of the isolated impacts of hypothetical alternative assumptions on modeled loss estimates. The changes in the inputs presented above are not intended to imply management’s expectation of future deterioration of those risk factors. In addition, these analyses are not intended to estimate changes in the overall allowance for loan losses, which would also be influenced by the judgment management applies to the modeled loss estimates to reflect the uncertainty and imprecision of these modeled loss estimates based on then-current circumstances and conditions.

It is difficult to estimate how potential changes in specific factors might affect the overall allowance for credit losses because management considers a variety of factors and inputs in estimating the allowance for credit losses. Changes in these factors and inputs may not occur at the same rate and may not be consistent across all geographies or product types, and changes in factors may be directionally inconsistent, such that improvement in one factor may offset deterioration in other factors. In addition, it is difficult to predict how changes in specific economic conditions or assumptions could affect borrower behavior or other factors considered by management in estimating the allowance for credit losses. Given the process the Firm follows and the judgments made in evaluating the risk factors related to its loss estimates, management believes that its current estimate of the allowance for credit losses is appropriate.

Fair value

JPMorgan Chase carries a portion of its assets and liabilities at fair value. The majority of such assets and liabilities are measured at fair value on a recurring basis, including, derivatives and structured note products. Certain assets and liabilities are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis, including certain mortgage, home equity and other


JPMorgan Chase & Co./2019 Form 10-K

loans, where the carrying value is based on the fair value of the underlying collateral.

Assets measured at fair value

The following table includes the Firm’s assets measured at fair value and the portion of such assets that are classified within level 3 of the valuation hierarchy. Refer to Note


for further information.

(a)

For purposes of the table above, the derivative receivables total reflects the impact of netting adjustments; however, the

$4.7 billion

of derivative receivables classified as level 3 does not reflect the netting adjustment as such netting is not relevant to a presentation based on the transparency of inputs to the valuation of an asset. The level 3 balances would be reduced if netting were applied, including the netting benefit associated with cash collateral.

Valuation

Details of the Firm’s processes for determining fair value are set out in Note


. Estimating fair value requires the application of judgment. The type and level of judgment required is largely dependent on the amount of observable market information available to the Firm. For instruments valued using internally developed valuation models and other valuation techniques that use significant unobservable inputs and are therefore classified within level 3 of the valuation hierarchy, judgments used to estimate fair value are more significant than those required when estimating the fair value of instruments classified within levels 1 and 2.

In arriving at an estimate of fair value for an instrument within level 3, management must first determine the appropriate valuation technique to use. Second, the lack of observability of certain significant inputs requires management to assess all relevant empirical data in deriving valuation inputs including, for example, transaction details, yield curves, interest rates, prepayment rates, default rates, volatilities, correlations, equity or debt prices, valuations of comparable instruments, foreign exchange rates and credit curves. Refer to Note


for a further discussion of the valuation of level 3 instruments, including unobservable inputs used.

For instruments classified in levels 2 and 3, management judgment must be applied to assess the appropriate level of valuation adjustments to reflect counterparty credit quality,

the Firm’s creditworthiness, market funding rates, liquidity considerations, unobservable parameters, and for portfolios that meet specified criteria, the size of the net open risk position. The judgments made are typically affected by the type of product and its specific contractual terms, and the level of liquidity for the product or within the market as a whole. Refer to Note


for a further discussion of valuation adjustments applied by the Firm.

Imprecision in estimating unobservable market inputs or other factors can affect the amount of gain or loss recorded for a particular position. Furthermore, while the Firm believes its valuation methods are appropriate and consistent with those of other market participants, the methods and assumptions used reflect management judgment and may vary across the Firm’s businesses and portfolios.

The Firm uses various methodologies and assumptions in the determination of fair value. The use of methodologies or assumptions different than those used by the Firm could result in a different estimate of fair value at the reporting date. Refer to Note


for a detailed discussion of the Firm’s valuation process and hierarchy, and its determination of fair value for individual financial instruments.

Goodwill impairment

Under U.S. GAAP, goodwill must be allocated to reporting units and tested for impairment at least annually. The Firm’s process and methodology used to conduct goodwill impairment testing is described in Note


.

Management applies significant judgment when testing goodwill for impairment. The goodwill associated with each business combination is allocated to the related reporting units for goodwill impairment testing.

For the year ended

December 31, 2019

, the Firm reviewed current economic conditions, estimated market cost of equity, as well as actual and projections of business performance for all its businesses. Based upon such reviews, the Firm concluded that the goodwill allocated to its reporting units was not impaired as of

December 31, 2019

. The fair values of these reporting units exceeded their carrying values by approximately 15% or higher and did not indicate a significant risk of goodwill impairment based on current projections and valuations.

The projections for all of the Firm’s reporting units are consistent with management’s current short-term business outlook assumptions, and in the longer term, incorporate a set of macroeconomic assumptions and the Firm’s best estimates of long-term growth and returns on equity of its businesses. Where possible, the Firm uses third-party and peer data to benchmark its assumptions and estimates.

Refer to Note

Credit card rewards liability

JPMorgan Chase offers credit cards with various rewards programs which allow cardholders to earn rewards points based on their account activity and the terms and conditions of the rewards program. Generally, there are no limits on the points that an eligible cardholder can earn, nor

JPMorgan Chase & Co./2019 Form 10-K


Management’s discussion and analysis

do the points expire, and the points can be redeemed for a variety of rewards, including cash (predominantly in the form of account credits), gift cards and travel. The Firm maintains a rewards liability which represents the estimated cost of rewards points earned and expected to be redeemed by cardholders. The rewards liability is sensitive to various assumptions, including cost per point and redemption rates for each of the various rewards programs, which are evaluated periodically. The liability is accrued as the cardholder earns the benefit and is reduced when the cardholder redeems points. This liability was

$6.4 billion

and

$5.8 billion

at

December 31, 2019

and


, respectively, and is recorded in accounts payable and other liabilities on the Consolidated balance sheets.

Income taxes

JPMorgan Chase is subject to the income tax laws of the various jurisdictions in which it operates, including U.S. federal, state and local, and non-U.S. jurisdictions. These laws are often complex and may be subject to different interpretations. To determine the financial statement impact of accounting for income taxes, including the provision for income tax expense and unrecognized tax benefits, JPMorgan Chase must make assumptions and judgments about how to interpret and apply these complex tax laws to numerous transactions and business events, as well as make judgments regarding the timing of when certain items may affect taxable income in the U.S. and non-U.S. tax jurisdictions.

JPMorgan Chase’s interpretations of tax laws around the world are subject to review and examination by the various taxing authorities in the jurisdictions where the Firm operates, and disputes may occur regarding its view on a tax position. These disputes over interpretations with the various taxing authorities may be settled by audit, administrative appeals or adjudication in the court systems of the tax jurisdictions in which the Firm operates. JPMorgan Chase regularly reviews whether it may be assessed additional income taxes as a result of the resolution of these matters, and the Firm records additional reserves as appropriate. In addition, the Firm may revise its estimate of income taxes due to changes in income tax laws, legal interpretations, and business strategies. It is possible that revisions in the Firm’s estimate of income taxes may materially affect the Firm’s results of operations in any reporting period.

The Firm’s provision for income taxes is composed of current and deferred taxes. Deferred taxes arise from differences between assets and liabilities measured for financial reporting versus income tax return purposes. Deferred tax assets are recognized if, in management’s judgment, their realizability is determined to be more likely than not. The Firm has also recognized deferred tax assets in connection with certain tax attributes, including net operating loss (“NOL”) carryforwards and foreign tax credit (“FTC”) carryforwards. The Firm performs regular reviews to ascertain whether its deferred tax assets are realizable. These reviews include management’s estimates and assumptions regarding future taxable income, which also incorporates various tax planning strategies, including strategies that may be available to utilize NOLs before they expire. In connection with these reviews, if it is determined

that a deferred tax asset is not realizable, a valuation allowance is established. The valuation allowance may be reversed in a subsequent reporting period if the Firm determines that, based on revised estimates of future taxable income or changes in tax planning strategies, it is more likely than not that all or part of the deferred tax asset will become realizable. As of

December 31, 2019

, management has determined it is more likely than not that the Firm will realize its deferred tax assets, net of the existing valuation allowance.

The Firm adjusts its unrecognized tax benefits as necessary when additional information becomes available. Uncertain tax positions that meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold are measured to determine the amount of benefit to recognize. An uncertain tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that management believes is more likely than not to be realized upon settlement. It is possible that the reassessment of JPMorgan Chase’s unrecognized tax benefits may have a material impact on its effective income tax rate in the period in which the reassessment occurs.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of JPMorgan Chase & Co.:

Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of JPMorgan Chase & Co. and its subsidiaries (the “Firm”) as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, changes in stockholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2019, including the related notes (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). We also have audited the Firm’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019, based on criteria established in

Internal Control - Integrated Framework

(2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Firm as of

December 31, 2019

and 2018, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended

December 31, 2019

in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Firm maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of

December 31, 2019

, based on criteria established in

Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013)

issued by the COSO.

Basis for Opinions

The Firm’s management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s report on internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Firm’s consolidated financial statements and on the Firm’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Firm in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.

Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.

Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.  Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Critical Audit Matters

The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.

Fair Value of Certain Level 3 Financial Instruments

As described in Notes 2 and 3 to the consolidated financial statements, the Firm carries $802.8 billion of its assets and $233.8 billion of its liabilities at fair value on a recurring basis. Included in these balances are $8.1 billion of trading assets and $37.7 billion of liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis, collectively financial instruments, which are classified as level 3 as they contain one or more inputs to valuation which are unobservable and significant to their fair value measurement. The Firm utilized internally developed valuation models and unobservable inputs to estimate fair value of the level 3 financial instruments. The unobservable inputs used by management to estimate the fair value of certain of these financial instruments include volatility relating to interest rates and correlation relating to interest rates, equity prices and foreign exchange rates.

The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the fair value of certain level 3 financial instruments is a critical audit matter are (i) there was significant judgment and estimation by management in determining the inputs to estimate fair value, which in turn led to a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures related to the fair value of these financial instruments, and (ii) the audit effort involved professionals with specialized skill and knowledge to assist in evaluating the audit evidence obtained from these procedures.

Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the Firm’s processes for determining fair value which include controls over models, inputs, and data. These procedures also included, among others, the involvement of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge to assist in developing an independent estimate of fair value for a sample of these financial instruments. Developing the independent estimate involved testing the completeness and accuracy of data provided by management, developing independent inputs and, as appropriate, evaluating and utilizing management’s aforementioned unobservable inputs; and comparing management’s estimate to the independently developed estimate of fair value.

Fair Value of Mortgage Servicing Rights Assets

As described in Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements, the Firm has elected to account for the Firm’s mortgage servicing rights assets at fair value, with balances of $4.7 billion as of December 31, 2019. Management estimates the fair value of mortgage servicing rights using an option-adjusted spread model, which projects cash flows over multiple interest rate scenarios in conjunction with the Firm’s prepayment model, and then discounts these cash flows at risk-adjusted rates. The key economic assumptions used to determine the fair value of mortgage servicing rights are prepayment speeds and option adjusted spread.

The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the fair value of mortgage servicing rights assets is a critical audit matter are (i) there was significant judgment and estimation by management in determining the fair value of mortgage servicing rights, which in turn led to a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity and effort in performing procedures and in evaluating the audit evidence obtained related to the prepayment speed and option adjusted spread assumptions, and (ii) the audit effort involved professionals with specialized skill and knowledge to assist in evaluating the audit evidence obtained from these procedures.

Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the valuation of mortgage servicing rights, including controls over the Firm’s models, assumptions, and data. These procedures also included, among others, the involvement of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge to assist in testing management’s process including testing and evaluating the reasonableness of prepayment speed and option adjusted spread assumptions used in the model.

Allowance for Loan Losses - Wholesale Loan, Credit Card Loan and Consumer Loan Portfolios

As described in Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements, the Firm’s allowance for loan losses represents management’s estimate of probable credit losses inherent in the Firm’s retained loan portfolios, which primarily consists of wholesale loans, credit card loans and consumer loans. As of December 31, 2019, the allowance for loan losses was $13.1 billion on total retained loans of $945.6 billion. The Firm’s allowance for loan losses is determined for each of the retained loan portfolios utilizing a statistical credit loss estimate. These statistical credit loss estimates are calculated using statistical credit loss factors, specifically the probability of default and loss severity for the credit card and consumer loans and the probability of default and loss given default for the wholesale loans. Management then applies judgment to adjust these statistical loss estimates to take into consideration model imprecision, external factors and economic events that have occurred but are not yet reflected in the loss factors.

The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the allowance for loan losses for the wholesale loan, credit card loan, and consumer loan portfolios is a critical audit matter are (i) there was


JPMorgan Chase & Co./2019 Form 10-K

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

significant judgment and estimation by management in determining the modeling techniques utilized in their statistical credit loss estimates, which in turn led to a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity and effort in performing procedures and in evaluating audit evidence obtained relating to the statistical credit loss estimates and the appropriateness of the adjustments to the statistical loss estimates, and (ii) the audit effort involved professionals with specialized skill and knowledge to assist in evaluating the audit evidence.

Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the Firm’s allowance for loan losses estimation processes. These procedures also included, among others, testing management’s process for estimating the allowance for loan losses, which included evaluating the appropriateness of the models and methodologies used in the statistical credit loss estimates for the wholesale, credit card and consumer loan portfolios; testing the completeness and accuracy of data; and evaluating the reasonableness of assumptions and judgments used in the statistical credit loss estimate and the adjustments to the statistical credit loss

estimates. This included, as relevant, evaluating the reasonableness of probabilities of default, loss severities and loss given default. Evaluating management’s adjustment to the statistical credit loss estimate included evaluating the reasonableness of the impacts of model imprecision and external factors and economic events which have occurred but are not yet otherwise reflected in the statistical credit loss estimate. The procedures included the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge to assist in evaluating the appropriateness of certain models, methodologies and inputs into the statistical credit loss estimates.

Basis of presentation

JPMorgan Chase & Co. (“

JPMorgan Chase

” or the “Firm”), a financial holding company incorporated under Delaware law in 1968, is a leading global financial services firm and one of the largest banking institutions in the U.S. with operations worldwide. The Firm is a leader in investment banking, financial services for consumers and small business, commercial banking, financial transaction processing and asset management. Refer to Note


for a discussion of the Firm’s business segments.

The accounting and financial reporting policies of

JPMorgan Chase

and its subsidiaries conform to

U.S. GAAP.

Additionally, where applicable, the policies conform to the accounting and reporting guidelines prescribed by regulatory authorities.

Certain amounts reported in prior periods have been reclassified to conform with the current presentation.

Consolidation

The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of

JPMorgan Chase

and other entities in which

the Firm

has a controlling financial interest. All material intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.

Assets held for clients in an agency or fiduciary capacity by

the Firm

are not assets of

JPMorgan Chase

and are not included on the Consolidated balance sheets.

The Firm

determines whether it has a controlling financial interest in an entity by first evaluating whether the entity is a voting interest entity or a variable interest entity.

Voting interest entities

Voting interest entities are entities that have sufficient equity and provide the equity investors voting rights that enable them to make significant decisions relating to the entity’s operations. For these types of entities,

the Firm’s

determination of whether it has a controlling interest is primarily based on the amount of voting equity interests held. Entities in which

the Firm

has a controlling financial interest, through ownership of the majority of the entities’ voting equity interests, or through other contractual rights that give

the Firm

control, are consolidated by

the Firm.

Investments in companies in which

the Firm

has significant influence over operating and financing decisions (but does not own a majority of the voting equity interests) are accounted for (i) in accordance with the equity method of accounting (which requires

the Firm

to recognize its proportionate share of the entity’s net earnings), or (ii) at fair value if the fair value option was elected. These investments are generally included in other assets, with income or loss included in noninterest revenue.

Certain

Firm

-sponsored asset management funds are structured as limited partnerships or limited liability companies. For many of these entities,

the Firm is the

general partner or managing member, but the non-affiliated partners or members have the ability to remove

the Firm

as

the general partner or managing member without cause (i.e., kick-out rights), based on a simple majority vote, or the non-affiliated partners or members have rights to participate in important decisions. Accordingly,

the Firm

does not consolidate these voting interest entities. However, in the limited cases where the non-managing partners or members do not have substantive kick-out or participating rights,

the Firm

evaluates the funds as VIEs and consolidates the funds if

the Firm

is t

h

e general partner or managing member and has a potentially significant interest.

The Firm’s

investment companies and asset management funds have investments in both publicly-held and privately-held entities

, including investments in buyouts, growth equity and venture opportunities.

These investments are accounted for under investment company guidelines and, accordingly, irrespective of the percentage of equity ownership interests held, are carried on the Consolidated balance sheets at fair value, and are recorded in other assets, with income or loss included in noninterest revenue. If consolidated, the Firm retains such specialized investment company guidelines.

Variable interest entities

VIEs are entities that, by design, either (1) lack sufficient equity to permit the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties, or (2) have equity investors that do not have the ability to make significant decisions relating to the entity’s operations through voting rights, or do not have the obligation to absorb the expected losses, or do not have the right to receive the residual returns of the entity.

The most common type of VIE is a

n SPE.

SPEs are commonly used in securitization transactions in order to isolate certain assets and distribute the cash flows from those assets to investors. The basic SPE structure involves a company selling assets to the SPE; the SPE funds the purchase of those assets by issuing securities to investors. The legal documents that govern the transaction specify how the cash earned on the assets must be allocated to the SPE’s investors and other parties that have rights to those cash flows. SPEs are generally structured to insulate investors from claims on the SPE’s assets by creditors of other entities, including the creditors of the seller of the assets.

The primary beneficiary of a VIE (i.e., the party that has a controlling financial interest) is required to consolidate the assets and liabilities of the VIE. The primary beneficiary is the party that has both (1) the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the VIE’s economic performance; and (2) through its interests in the VIE, the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits from the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE.

To assess whether

the Firm

has the power to direct the activities of a VIE that most significantly impact the VIE’s economic performance,

the Firm

considers all the facts and

JPMorgan Chase & Co./2019 Form 10-K


Notes to consolidated financial statements

circumstances, including its role in establishing the VIE and its ongoing rights and responsibilities. This assessment includes, first, identifying the activities that most significantly impact the VIE’s economic performance; and second, identifying which party, if any, has power over those activities. In general, the parties that make the most significant decisions affecting the VIE (such as asset managers, collateral managers, servicers, or owners of call options or liquidation rights over the VIE’s assets) or have the right to unilaterally remove those decision-makers are deemed to have the power to direct the activities of a VIE.

To assess whether

the Firm

has the obligation to absorb losses of the VIE or the right to receive benefits from the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE,

the Firm

considers all of its economic interests, including debt and equity investments, servicing fees, and derivatives or other arrangements deemed to be variable interests in the VIE. This assessment requires that

the Firm

apply judgment in determining whether these interests, in the aggregate, are considered potentially significant to the VIE. Factors considered in assessing significance include: the design of the VIE, including its capitalization structure; subordination of interests; payment priority; relative share of interests held across various classes within the VIE’s capital structure; and the reasons why the interests are held by

the Firm.

The Firm

performs on-going reassessments of: (1) whether entities previously evaluated under the majority voting-interest framework have become VIEs, based on certain events, and are therefore subject to the VIE consolidation framework; and (2) whether changes in the facts and circumstances regarding

the Firm’s

involvement with a VIE cause

the Firm’s

consolidation conclusion to change.

Refer to Note 14 for further discussion of the Firm’s VIEs.

Revenue recognition

Interest income

The Firm

recognizes interest income on loans, debt securities, and other debt instruments, generally on a level-yield basis, based on the underlying contractual rate. Refer to Note


for further discussion of interest income.

Revenue from contracts with customers

JPMorgan Chase

recognizes noninterest revenue from certain contracts with customers

,

in investment banking fees, deposit-related fees, asset management administration and commissions, and components of card income, when

the Firm’s

related performance obligations are satisfied. Refer to Note


for further discussion of

the Firm’s

revenue from contracts with customers.

Principal transactions revenue

JPMorgan Chase

carries a portion of its assets and liabilities at fair value. Changes in fair value are reported primarily in principal transactions revenue. Refer to Notes

2 and 3

for further discussion of fair value measurement. Refer to Note


for further discussion of principal transactions revenue.

Use of estimates in the preparation of consolidated financial statements

The preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenue and expense, and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. Actual results could be different from these estimates.

Foreign currency translation

JPMorgan Chase

revalues assets, liabilities, revenue and expense denominated in non-U.S. currencies into U.S. dollars using applicable exchange rates.

Gains and losses relating to translating functional currency financial statements for U.S. reporting are included

in the Consolidated statements of comprehensive income.

Gains and losses relating to nonfunctional currency transactions, including non-U.S. operations where the functional currency is the U.S. dollar, are reported in the Consolidated statements of income.

Offsetting assets and liabilities

U.S. GAAP permits entities to present derivative receivables and derivative payables with the same counterparty and the related cash collateral receivables and payables on a net basis on the Consolidated balance sheets when a legally enforceable master netting agreement exists. U.S. GAAP also permits securities sold and purchased under repurchase agreements and securities borrowed or loaned under securities loan agreements to be presented net when specified conditions are met, including the existence of a legally enforceable master netting agreement.

The Firm

has elected to net such balances when the specified conditions are met.

The Firm

uses master netting agreements

to mitigate counterparty credit risk in certain transactions, including derivative contracts, resale, repurchase, securities borrowed and securities loaned agreements. A master netting agreement is a single agreement with a counterparty that permits multiple transactions governed by that agreement to be terminated or accelerated and settled through a single payment in a single currency in the event of a default (e.g., bankruptcy, failure to make a required payment or securities transfer or deliver collateral or margin when due). Upon the exercise of derivatives termination rights by the non-defaulting party (i) all transactions are terminated, (ii) all transactions are valued and the positive values of “in the money” transactions are netted against the negative values of “out of the money” transactions and (iii) the only remaining payment obligation is of one of the parties to pay the netted termination amount. Upon exercise of default rights under repurchase agreements and securities loan agreements in general (i) all transactions are terminated and accelerated, (ii) all values of securities or cash held or to be delivered are calculated, and all such sums are netted against each other and (iii) the only remaining payment obligation is of one of the parties to pay the netted termination amount.


JPMorgan Chase & Co./2019 Form 10-K

Typical master netting agreements for these types of transactions also often contain a collateral/margin agreement that provides for a security interest in, or title transfer of, securities or cash collateral/margin to the party that has the right to demand margin (the “demanding party”). The collateral/margin agreement typically requires a party to transfer collateral/margin to the demanding party with a value equal to the amount of the margin deficit on a net basis across all transactions governed by the master netting agreement, less any threshold. The collateral/margin agreement grants to the demanding party, upon default by the counterparty, the right to set-off any amounts payable by the counterparty against any posted collateral or the cash equivalent of any posted collateral/margin. It also grants to the demanding party the right to liquidate collateral/margin and to apply the proceeds to an amount payable by the counterparty.

Refer to Note 5 for further discussion of the Firm’s derivative instruments. Refer to Note


for further discussion of the Firm’s securities financing agreements.

Statements of cash flows

For

JPMorgan Chase’s

Consolidated statements of cash flows, cash is defined as those amounts included in cash and due from banks and deposits with banks.

Accounting standard adopted January 1, 2020

Financial Instruments – Credit Losses (“CECL”)

The adoption of this guidance established a single allowance framework for all financial assets carried at amortized cost and certain off-balance sheet credit exposures. This framework requires that management’s estimate reflects credit losses over the full remaining expected life and considers expected future changes in macroeconomic conditions.

The following table presents the impacts to the allowance for credit losses and retained earnings upon adoption of this guidance on January 1, 2020:

(a)

Represents the recognition of the nonaccretable difference on purchased credit deteriorated assets and the Firm's election to recognize the reserve for uncollectible accrued interest on credit card loans in the allowance, both of which resulted in a corresponding increase to loans.

Accounting standards adopted January 1, 2018

Effective January 1, 2018, the Firm adopted several accounting standards resulting in a net decrease of

$


million

to retained earnings and a net increase of

$


million

to AOCI. Certain of these standards were adopted retrospectively and, accordingly, prior period amounts were revised. The adoption of the recognition and measurement guidance resulted in

$


million

of fair value gains in the first quarter of 2018, recorded in total net revenue, on certain equity investments that were previously held at cost.

Fair value measurement

JPMorgan Chase

carries a portion of its assets and liabilities at fair value. These assets and liabilities are predominantly carried at fair value on a recurring basis (i.e., assets and liabilities that are measured and reported at fair value on

the Firm’s

Consolidated balance sheets). Certain assets, liabilities and unfunded lending-related commitments are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis; that is, they are not measured at fair value on an ongoing basis but are subject to fair value adjustments only in certain circumstances (for example, when there is evidence of impairment).

Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Fair value is based on quoted market prices or inputs, where available. If prices or quotes are not available, fair value is based on valuation models and other valuation techniques that consider relevant transaction characteristics (such as maturity) and use, as inputs, observable or unobservable market parameters, including  yield curves, interest rates, volatilities, prices (such as commodity, equity or debt prices), correlations, foreign exchange rates and credit curves. Valuation adjustments may be made to ensure that financial instruments are recorded at fair value, as described below.

The level of precision in estimating unobservable market inputs or other factors can affect the amount of gain or loss recorded for a particular position. Furthermore, while

the Firm

believes its valuation methods are appropriate and consistent with those of other market participants, the methods and assumptions used reflect management judgment and may vary across

the Firm’s

businesses and portfolios.

The Firm

uses various methodologies and assumptions in the determination of fair value. The use of different methodologies or assumptions by other market participants compared with those used by

the Firm

could result in

the Firm

deriving a different estimate of fair value at the reporting date.

Valuation process

Risk-taking functions are responsible for providing fair value estimates for assets and liabilities carried on the Consolidated balance sheets at fair value.

The Firm’s

VCG

,

which is part of

the Firm’s

Finance function and independent of the risk-taking functions, is responsible for verifying these estimates and determining any fair value adjustments that may be required to ensure that

the Firm’s

positions are recorded at fair value.

The

VGF

is composed of senior finance and risk executives and is responsible for overseeing the management of risks arising from valuation activities conducted across

the Firm.

The Firmwide VGF is chaired by the Firmwide head of the VCG (under the direction of

the Firm’s Controller), and includes sub-forums covering the CIB, CCB, CB, AWM and certain corporate functions including Treasury and CIO.

Price verification process

The VCG verifies fair value estimates provided by the risk-taking functions by leveraging independently derived prices, valuation inputs and other market data, where available. Where independent prices or inputs are not available, the VCG performs additional review to ensure the reasonableness of the estimates. The additional review may include evaluating the limited market activity including client unwinds, benchmarking valuation inputs to those used for similar instruments, decomposing the valuation of structured instruments into individual components, comparing expected to actual cash flows, reviewing profit and loss trends, and reviewing trends in collateral valuation. There are also additional levels of management review for more significant or complex positions.

The VCG determines any valuation adjustments that may be required to the estimates provided by the risk-taking functions. No adjustments to quoted prices are applied for instruments classified within level 1 of the fair value hierarchy (refer to the discussion below for further information on the fair value hierarchy). For other positions, judgment is required to assess the need for valuation adjustments to appropriately reflect liquidity considerations, unobservable parameters, and, for certain portfolios that meet specified criteria, the size of the net open risk position. The determination of such adjustments follows a consistent framework across

the Firm:

•

Liquidity valuation adjustments are considered where an observable external price or valuation parameter exists but is of lower reliability, potentially due to lower market activity. Liquidity valuation adjustments are made based on current market conditions. Factors that may be considered in determining the liquidity adjustment include analysis of: (1) the estimated bid-offer spread for the instrument being traded; (2) alternative pricing points for similar instruments in active markets; and (3) the range of reasonable values that the price or parameter could take.

•

The Firm

manages certain portfolios of financial instruments on the basis of net open risk exposure and, as permitted by U.S. GAAP, has elected to estimate the fair value of such portfolios on the basis of a transfer of the entire net open risk position in an orderly transaction. Where this is the case, valuation adjustments may be necessary to reflect the cost of exiting a larger-than-normal market-size net open risk position. Where applied, such adjustments are based on factors that a relevant market participant would consider in the transfer of the net open risk position, including the size of the adverse market move that is likely to occur during the period required to reduce the net open risk position to a normal market-size.

•

Uncertainty adjustments related to unobservable parameters may be made when positions are valued using prices or input parameters to valuation models that are unobservable due to a lack of market activity or because they cannot be implied from observable market data. Such prices or parameters must be estimated and are, therefore, subject to management judgment.


JPMorgan Chase & Co./2019 Form 10-K

Adjustments are made to reflect the uncertainty inherent in the resulting valuation estimate.

•

Where appropriate,

the Firm

also applies adjustments to its estimates of fair value in order to appropriately reflect counterparty credit quality

(CVA), the Firm’s

own creditworthiness

(DVA)

and the impact of funding

(

FVA

),

using a consistent framework across

the Firm.

Refer to Credit and funding adjustments on

page 171

of this Note for more information on such adjustments.

Valuation model review and approval

If prices or quotes are not available for an instrument or a similar instrument, fair value is generally determined using valuation models that consider relevant transaction terms such as maturity and use as inputs market-based or independently sourced parameters. Where this is the case the price verification process described above is applied to the inputs in those models.

Under

the Firm’s

Estimations and Model Risk Management Policy, the Model Risk function reviews and approves new models, as well as material changes to existing models, prior to implementation in the operating environment. In certain circumstances exceptions may be granted to

the Firm’s

policy to allow a model to be used prior to review or approval. The Model Risk function may also require the user to take appropriate actions to mitigate the model risk if it is to be used in the interim. These actions will depend on the model and may include, for example, limitation of trading activity.

Valuation hierarchy

A three-level valuation hierarchy has been established under U.S. GAAP for disclosure of fair value measurements. The valuation hierarchy is based on the observability of inputs to the valuation of an asset or liability as of the measurement date. The three levels are defined as follows.

•

Level 1 – inputs to the valuation methodology are quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.

•

Level 2 – inputs to the valuation methodology include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, and inputs that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the financial instrument.

•

Level 3 – one or more inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable and significant to the fair value measurement.

A financial instrument’s categorization within the valuation hierarchy is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.

Physical commodities inventories are generally accounted for at the lower of cost or net realizable value. “Net realizable value” is a term defined in U.S. GAAP as not exceeding fair value less costs to sell (“transaction costs”). Transaction costs for the Firm’s physical commodities inventories are either not applicable or immaterial to the value of the inventory. Therefore, net realizable value approximates fair value for the Firm’s physical commodities inventories. When fair value hedging has been applied (or when net realizable value is below cost), the carrying value of physical commodities


JPMorgan Chase & Co./2019 Form 10-K

approximates fair value, because under fair value hedge accounting, the cost basis is adjusted for changes in fair value. Refer to Note

Notes to consolidated financial statements

Level 3 valuations

The Firm

has established well-structured processes for determining fair value, including for instruments where fair value is estimated using significant unobservable inputs (level 3).

Refer to

pages 154–158

of this Note for further information on

the Firm’s

valuation process and a detailed discussion of the determination of fair value for individual financial instruments.

Estimating fair value requires the application of judgment. The type and level of judgment required is largely dependent on the amount of observable market information available to

the Firm.

For instruments valued using internally developed valuation models and other valuation techniques that use significant unobservable inputs and are therefore classified within level 3 of the fair value hierarchy, judgments used to estimate fair value are more significant than those required when estimating the fair value of instruments classified within levels 1 and 2.

In arriving at an estimate of fair value for an instrument within level 3, management must first determine the appropriate valuation model or other valuation technique to use. Second, due to the lack of observability of significant inputs, management must assess relevant empirical data in deriving valuation inputs including transaction details, yield curves, interest rates, prepayment speed, default rates, volatilities, correlations, prices (such as commodity, equity or debt prices), valuations of comparable instruments, foreign exchange rates and credit curves.

The following table presents

the Firm’s

primary level 3 financial instruments, the valuation techniques used to measure the fair value of those financial instruments, the significant unobservable inputs, the range of values for those inputs and, for certain instruments, the weighted averages of such inputs. While the determination to classify an instrument within level 3 is based on the significance of the unobservable inputs to the overall fair value measurement, level 3 financial instruments typically include observable components (that is, components that are actively quoted and can be validated to external sources) in addition to the unobservable components. The level 1 and/or level 2 inputs are not included in the table. In addition,

the Firm

manages the risk of the observable components of level 3 financial instruments using securities and derivative positions that are classified within levels 1 or 2 of the fair value hierarchy.

The range of values presented in the table is representative of the highest and lowest level input used to value the significant groups of instruments within a product/instrument classification. Where provided, the weighted averages of the input values presented in the table are calculated based on the fair value of the instruments that the input is being used to value.

In

the Firm’s

view, the input range and the weighted average value do not reflect the degree of input uncertainty or an assessment of the reasonableness of

the Firm’s

estimates and assumptions. Rather, they reflect the characteristics of the various instruments held by

the Firm

and the relative distribution of instruments within the range of characteristics. For example, two option contracts may have similar levels of market risk exposure and valuation uncertainty, but may have significantly different implied volatility levels because the option contracts have different underlyings, tenors, or strike prices. The input range and weighted average values will therefore vary from period-to-period and parameter-to-parameter based on the characteristics of the instruments held by

the Firm

at each balance sheet date.

For

the Firm’s

derivatives and structured notes positions classified within level 3 at

December 31, 2019

,

interest rate correlation inputs used in estimating fair value were distributed across the range; equity correlation, equity-FX and equity-IR correlation inputs were concentrated in the middle of the range; commodity correlation inputs were concentrated in the middle of the range; credit correlation inputs were concentrated towards the lower end of the range; and forward equity prices and the interest rate-foreign exchange (“IR-FX”) correlation inputs were distributed across the range. In addition, the interest rate volatility and interest rate spread volatility inputs used in estimating fair value were distributed across the range; equity volatilities and commodity volatilities were concentrated towards the lower end of the range; and forward commodity prices used in estimating the fair value of commodity derivatives were concentrated in the middle of the range. Prepayment speed inputs used in estimating the fair value of interest rate derivatives were concentrated towards the lower end of the range. Recovery rate inputs used in estimating the fair value of credit derivatives were distributed across the range; credit spreads were concentrated towards the lower end of the range; conditional default rates and loss severity inputs were concentrated towards the upper end of the range and price inputs were concentrated towards the lower end of the range.

Notes to consolidated financial statements

Changes in and ranges of unobservable inputs

The following discussion provides a description of the impact on a fair value measurement of a change in each unobservable input in isolation, and the interrelationship between unobservable inputs, where relevant and significant. The impact of changes in inputs may not be independent, as a change in one unobservable input may give rise to a change in another unobservable input. Where relationships do exist between two unobservable inputs, those relationships are discussed below. Relationships may also exist between observable and unobservable inputs (for example, as observable interest rates rise, unobservable prepayment rates decline); such relationships have not been included in the discussion below. In addition, for each of the individual relationships described below, the inverse relationship would also generally apply.

The following discussion also provides a description of attributes of the underlying instruments and external market factors that affect the range of inputs used in the valuation of

the Firm’s

positions.

Yield – The yield of an asset is the interest rate used to discount future cash flows in a discounted cash flow calculation. An increase in the yield, in isolation, would result in a decrease in a fair value measurement.

Credit spread – The credit spread is the amount of additional annualized return over the market interest rate that a market participant would demand for taking exposure to the credit risk of an instrument. The credit spread for an instrument forms part of the discount rate used in a discounted cash flow calculation. Generally, an increase in the credit spread would result in a decrease in a fair value measurement.

The yield and the credit spread of a particular mortgage-backed security primarily reflect the risk inherent in the instrument. The yield is also impacted by the absolute level of the coupon paid by the instrument (which may not correspond directly to the level of inherent risk). Therefore, the range of yield and credit spreads reflects the range of risk inherent in various instruments owned by

the Firm.

The risk inherent in mortgage-backed securities is driven by the subordination of the security being valued and the characteristics of the underlying mortgages within the collateralized pool, including borrower FICO scores,

LTV

ratios for residential mortgages and the nature of the property and/or any tenants for commercial mortgages. For corporate debt securities, obligations of U.S. states and municipalities and other similar instruments, credit spreads reflect the credit quality of the obligor and the tenor of the obligation.

Prepayment speed – The prepayment speed is a measure of the voluntary unscheduled principal repayments of a prepayable obligation in a collateralized pool. Prepayment speeds generally decline as borrower delinquencies rise. An increase in prepayment speeds, in isolation, would result in a decrease in a fair value measurement of assets valued at a premium to par and an increase in a fair value measurement of assets valued at a discount to par.

Prepayment speeds may vary from collateral pool to collateral pool, and are driven by the type and location of the

underlying borrower, and the remaining tenor of the obligation as well as the level and type (e.g., fixed or floating) of interest rate being paid by the borrower. Typically collateral pools with higher borrower credit quality have a higher prepayment rate than those with lower borrower credit quality, all other factors being equal.

Conditional default rate – The conditional default rate is a measure of the reduction in the outstanding collateral balance underlying a collateralized obligation as a result of defaults. While there is typically no direct relationship between conditional default rates and prepayment speeds, collateralized obligations for which the underlying collateral has high prepayment speeds will tend to have lower conditional default rates. An increase in conditional default rates would generally be accompanied by an increase in loss severity and an increase in credit spreads. An increase in the conditional default rate, in isolation, would result in a decrease in a fair value measurement. Conditional default rates reflect the quality of the collateral underlying a securitization and the structure of the securitization itself. Based on the types of securities owned in

the Firm’s

market-making portfolios, conditional default rates are most typically at the lower end of the range presented.

Loss severity – The loss severity (the inverse concept is the recovery rate) is the expected amount of future realized losses resulting from the ultimate liquidation of a particular loan, expressed as the net amount of loss relative to the outstanding loan balance. An increase in loss severity is generally accompanied by an increase in conditional default rates. An increase in the loss severity, in isolation, would result in a decrease in a fair value measurement.

The loss severity applied in valuing a mortgage-backed security investment depends on factors relating to the underlying mortgages, including the LTV ratio, the nature of the lender’s lien on the property and other instrument-specific factors.


JPMorgan Chase & Co./2019 Form 10-K

Correlation – Correlation is a measure of the relationship between the movements of two variables. Correlation is a pricing input for a derivative product where the payoff is driven by one or more underlying risks. Correlation inputs are related to the type of derivative

(e.g., interest rate, credit, equity, foreign exchange and commodity

)

due to the nature of the underlying risks. When parameters are positively correlated, an increase in one parameter will result in an increase in the other parameter. When parameters are negatively correlated, an increase in one parameter will result in a decrease in the other parameter. An increase in correlation can result in an increase or a decrease in a fair value measurement. Given a short correlation position, an increase in correlation, in isolation, would generally result in a decrease in a fair value measurement.

The level of correlation used in the valuation of derivatives with multiple underlying risks depends on a number of factors including the nature of those risks. For example, the correlation between two credit risk exposures would be different than that between two interest rate risk exposures. Similarly, the tenor of the transaction may also impact the correlation input, as the relationship between the underlying risks may be different over different time periods. Furthermore, correlation levels are very much dependent on market conditions and could have a relatively wide range of levels within or across asset classes over time, particularly in volatile market conditions.

Volatility – Volatility is a measure of the variability in possible returns for an instrument, parameter or market index given how much the particular instrument, parameter or index changes in value over time. Volatility is a pricing input for options, including equity options, commodity options, and interest rate options. Generally, the higher the volatility of the underlying, the riskier the instrument. Given a long position in an option, an increase in volatility, in isolation, would generally result in an increase in a fair value measurement.

The level of volatility used in the valuation of a particular option-based derivative depends on a number of factors, including the nature of the risk underlying the option (e.g., the volatility of a particular equity security may be significantly different from that of a particular commodity index), the tenor of the derivative as well as the strike price of the option.

Forward price - Forward price is the price at which the buyer agrees to purchase the asset underlying a forward contract on the predetermined future delivery date, and is such that the value of the contract is zero at inception.

The forward price is used as an input in the valuation of certain derivatives and depends on a number of factors including interest rates, the current price of the underlying asset, and the expected income to be received and costs to be incurred by the seller as a result of holding that asset until the delivery date. An increase in the forward can result in an increase or a decrease in a fair value measurement.

Changes in level 3 recurring fair value measurements

and


.

When a determination is made to classify a financial instrument within level 3, the determination is based on the significance of the unobservable inputs to the overall fair value measurement. However, level 3 financial instruments typically include, in addition to the unobservable or level 3 components, observable components (that is, components that are actively quoted and can be validated to external sources); accordingly, the gains and losses in the table below include changes in fair value due in part to observable factors that are part of the valuation methodology. Also,

the Firm

risk-manages the observable components of level 3 financial instruments using securities and derivative positions that are classified within level 1 or 2 of the fair value hierarchy; as these level 1 and level 2 risk management instruments are not included below, the gains or losses in the following tables do not reflect the effect of

the Firm’s

risk management activities related to such level 3 instruments.

Credit and funding adjustments – derivatives

Derivatives are generally valued using models that use as their basis observable market parameters. These market parameters generally do not consider factors such as counterparty nonperformance risk, the Firm’s own credit quality, and funding costs. Therefore, it is generally necessary to make adjustments to the base estimate of fair value to reflect these factors.

CVA represents the adjustment, relative to the relevant benchmark interest rate, necessary to reflect counterparty nonperformance risk. The Firm estimates CVA using a scenario analysis to estimate the expected positive credit exposure across all of the Firm’s existing positions with each counterparty, and then estimates losses based on the probability of default and estimated recovery rate as a result of a counterparty credit event considering contractual factors designed to mitigate the Firm’s credit exposure, such as collateral and legal rights of offset. The key inputs to this methodology are (i) the probability of a default event occurring for each counterparty, as derived from observed or estimated CDS spreads; and (ii) estimated recovery rates implied by CDS spreads, adjusted to consider the differences in recovery rates as a derivative creditor relative to those reflected in CDS spreads, which generally reflect senior unsecured creditor risk.

FVA represents the adjustment to reflect the impact of funding and is recognized where there is evidence that a market participant in the principal market would incorporate it in a transfer of the instrument. The Firm’s FVA framework, applied to uncollateralized (including partially collateralized) over-the-counter (“OTC”) derivatives incorporates key inputs such as: (i) the expected funding requirements arising from the Firm’s positions with

each counterparty and collateral arrangements; and (ii) the estimated market funding cost in the principal market which, for derivative liabilities, considers the Firm’s credit risk (DVA). For collateralized derivatives, the fair value is estimated by discounting expected future cash flows at the relevant overnight indexed swap rate given the underlying collateral agreement with the counterparty, and therefore a separate FVA is not necessary.

The following table provides the impact of credit and funding adjustments on principal transactions revenue in the respective periods, excluding the effect of any associated hedging activities. The FVA presented below includes the impact of the Firm’s own credit quality on the inception value of liabilities as well as the impact of changes in the Firm’s own credit quality over time.

Valuation adjustments on fair value option elected liabilities

The valuation of the Firm’s liabilities for which the fair value option has been elected requires consideration of the Firm’s own credit risk. DVA on fair value option elected liabilities reflects changes (subsequent to the issuance of the liability) in the Firm’s probability of default and LGD, which are estimated based on changes in the Firm’s credit spread observed in the bond market. Realized (gains)/losses due to DVA for fair value option elected liabilities are reported in principal transactions revenue. Unrealized (gains)/losses are reported in OCI. Refer to page 169 in this Note and Note

Additional disclosures about the fair value of financial instruments that are not carried on the Consolidated balance sheets at fair value

U.S. GAAP requires disclosure of the estimated fair value of certain financial instruments, which are included in the following table. However, this table does not include other items, such as nonfinancial assets, intangible assets, certain financial instruments, and customer relationships. In the opinion of management, these items, in the aggregate, add significant value to JPMorgan Chase, but their fair value is not disclosed in this table.

Financial instruments for which carrying value approximates fair value

Certain financial instruments that are not carried at fair value on the Consolidated balance sheets are carried at amounts that approximate fair value, due to their short-term nature and generally negligible credit risk. These instruments include cash and due from banks, deposits with banks, federal funds sold, securities purchased under resale agreements and securities borrowed, short-term receivables and accrued interest receivable, short-term borrowings, federal funds purchased, securities loaned and sold under repurchase agreements, accounts payable, and accrued liabilities. In addition, U.S. GAAP requires that the fair value of deposit liabilities with no stated maturity (i.e., demand, savings and certain money market deposits) be equal to their carrying value; recognition of the inherent funding value of these instruments is not permitted.

Notes to consolidated financial statements

The following table presents by fair value hierarchy classification the carrying values and estimated fair values at

December 31, 2019

and


,

of financial assets and liabilities, excluding financial instruments that are carried at fair value on a recurring basis, and their classification within the fair value hierarchy.

(a)

Fair value is typically estimated using a discounted cash flow model that incorporates the characteristics of the underlying loans (including principal, contractual interest rate and contractual fees) and other key inputs, including expected lifetime credit losses, interest rates, prepayment rates, and primary origination or secondary market spreads. For certain loans, the fair value is measured based on the value of the underlying collateral. The difference between the estimated fair value and carrying value of a financial asset or liability is the result of the different methodologies used to determine fair value as compared with carrying value. For example, credit losses are estimated for a financial asset’s remaining life in a fair value calculation but are estimated for a loss emergence period in the allowance for loan losses calculation; future loan income (interest and fees) is incorporated in a fair value calculation but is generally not considered in the allowance for loan losses.

The majority of

the Firm’s

lending-related commitments are not carried at fair value on a recurring basis on the Consolidated balance sheets. The carrying value of the wholesale allowance for lending-related commitments and the estimated fair value of

these wholesale lending-related commitments were as follows for the periods indicated.

Fair value option

The fair value option provides an option to elect fair value as an alternative measurement for selected financial assets, financial liabilities, unrecognized firm commitments, and written loan commitments.

The Firm

has elected to measure certain instruments at fair value for several reasons including to mitigate income statement volatility caused by the differences between the measurement basis of elected instruments (e.g., certain instruments that otherwise would be accounted for on an accrual basis) and the associated risk management arrangements that are accounted for on a fair value basis, as well as to

better reflect those instruments that are managed on a fair value basis.

The Firm’s

election of fair value includes the following instruments:

•

Loans purchased or originated as part of securitization warehousing activity, subject to bifurcation accounting, or managed on a fair value basis, including lending-related commitments

•

Certain

securities financing agreements, such as those with an embedded derivative and/or a maturity of greater than one year

•

Owned beneficial interests in securitized financial assets that contain embedded credit derivatives, which would otherwise be required to be separately accounted for as a derivative instrument

•

Structured notes, which are predominantly financial instruments that contain embedded derivatives, that are issued as part of

client-driven activities

•

Certain long-term beneficial interests issued by

CIB’s

consolidated securitization trusts where the underlying assets are carried at fair value

Unrealized gains/(losses) due to instrument-specific credit risk (DVA) for liabilities for which the fair value option has been elected is recorded in OCI,  while realized gains/(losses) are recorded in principal transactions revenue. Realized gains/(losses) due to instrument-specific credit risk recorded in principal transactions revenue were not material for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017.

(b)

Long-term debt measured at fair value predominantly relates to structured notes. Although the risk associated with the structured notes is actively managed, the gains/(losses) reported in this table do not include the income statement impact of the risk management instruments used to manage such risk.

Determination of instrument-specific credit risk for items for which a fair value election was made

The following describes how the gains and losses that are attributable to changes in instrument-specific credit risk, were determined.

•

Loans and lending-related commitments: For floating-rate instruments, all changes in value are attributed to instrument-specific credit risk. For fixed-rate instruments, an allocation of the changes in value for the period is made between those changes in value that are interest rate-related and changes in value that are credit-related. Allocations are generally based on an analysis of borrower-specific credit spread and recovery information, where available, or benchmarking to similar entities or industries.

•

Long-term debt: Changes in value attributable to instrument-specific credit risk were derived principally from observable changes in

the Firm’s

credit spread as observed in the bond market.

•

Securities financing agreements: Generally, for these types of agreements, there is a requirement that collateral be maintained with a market value equal to or in excess of the principal amount loaned; as a result, there would be no adjustment or an immaterial adjustment for instrument-specific credit risk related to these agreements.

.

(b)

Remaining contractual principal is not applicable to nonprincipal-protected structured notes and long-term beneficial interests. Unlike principal-protected structured notes and long-term beneficial interests, for which the Firm is obligated to return a stated amount of principal at maturity, nonprincipal-protected structured notes and long-term beneficial interests do not obligate the Firm to return a stated amount of principal at maturity, but for structured notes to return an amount based on the performance of an underlying variable or derivative feature embedded in the note. However, investors are exposed to the credit risk of the Firm as issuer for both nonprincipal-protected and principal-protected notes.

(c)

Where the Firm issues principal-protected zero-coupon or discount notes, the balance reflects the contractual principal payment at maturity or, if applicable, the contractual principal payment at the Firm’s next call date.

Credit risk concentrations

Concentrations of credit risk arise when a number of clients, counterparties or customers are engaged in similar business activities or activities in the same geographic region, or when they have similar economic features that would cause their ability to meet contractual obligations to be similarly affected by changes in economic conditions.

JPMorgan Chase

regularly monitors various segments of its credit portfolios to assess potential credit risk concentrations and to obtain additional collateral when deemed necessary and permitted under

the Firm’s

agreements. Senior management is significantly involved in the credit approval and review process, and risk levels are adjusted as needed to reflect

the Firm’s

risk appetite.

In

the Firm’s

consumer portfolio, concentrations are managed primarily by product and by U.S. geographic region, with a key focus on trends and concentrations at the portfolio level, where potential credit risk concentrations can be remedied through changes in underwriting policies and portfolio guidelines.

Refer to Note


for additional information on the geographic composition of

the Firm’s

consumer loan portfolios

.

In the wholesale portfolio, credit risk concentrations are evaluated primarily by industry and monitored regularly on both an aggregate portfolio level and on an individual client or counterparty basis.

wholesale exposure is managed through loan syndications and participations, loan sales, securitizations, credit derivatives, master netting agreements, collateral and other risk-reduction techniques. Refer to Note


for additional information on loans.

The Firm

does not believe that its exposure to any particular loan product

or industry segment (e.g., real estate), or its exposure to residential real estate loans with high LTV ratios, results in a significant concentration of credit risk.

Terms of loan products and collateral coverage are included in

the Firm’s

assessment when extending credit and establishing its allowance for loan losses.

Note

Derivative instruments

Derivative contracts derive their value from underlying asset prices, indices, reference rates, other inputs or a combination of these factors and may expose counterparties to risks and rewards of an underlying asset or liability without having to initially invest in, own or exchange the asset or liability.

JPMorgan Chase

makes markets in derivatives for clients and also uses derivatives to hedge or manage its own risk exposures. Predominantly all of

the Firm’s

derivatives are entered into for market-making or risk management purposes.

Market-making derivatives

The majority of

the Firm’s

derivatives are entered into for market-making purposes. Clients use derivatives to mitigate or modify interest rate, credit, foreign exchange, equity and commodity risks.

The Firm

actively manages the risks from its exposure to these derivatives by entering into other derivative contracts or by purchasing or selling other financial instruments that partially or fully offset the exposure from client derivatives.

Risk management derivatives

The Firm

manages certain market and credit risk exposures using derivative instruments, including derivatives in hedge accounting relationships and other derivatives that are used to manage risks associated with specified assets and liabilities.

The Firm

generally uses interest rate derivatives to manage the risk associated with changes in interest rates. Fixed-rate assets and liabilities appreciate or depreciate in market value as interest rates change. Similarly, interest income and expense increase or decrease as a result of variable-rate assets and liabilities resetting to current market rates, and as a result of the repayment and subsequent origination or issuance of fixed-rate assets and liabilities at current market rates.

Gains and losses on the derivative instruments related to these assets and liabilities are expected to substantially offset this variability.

Foreign currency derivatives are used to manage the foreign exchange risk associated with certain foreign currency–denominated (i.e., non-U.S. dollar) assets and liabilities and forecasted transactions, as well as

the Firm’s

net investments in certain non-U.S. subsidiaries or branches whose functional currencies are not the U.S. dollar. As a result of fluctuations in foreign currencies, the U.S. dollar–equivalent values of the foreign currency–denominated assets and liabilities or the forecasted revenues or expenses increase or decrease. Gains or losses on the derivative instruments related to these foreign currency–denominated assets or liabilities, or forecasted transactions, are expected to substantially offset this variability.

Commodities derivatives are used to manage the price risk of certain commodities inventories. Gains or losses on these derivative instruments are expected to substantially offset the depreciation or appreciation of the related inventory.

Credit derivatives are used to manage the counterparty credit risk associated with loans and lending-related commitments. Credit derivatives compensate the purchaser when the entity referenced in the contract experiences a credit event, such as bankruptcy or a failure to pay an obligation when due. Credit derivatives primarily consist of CDS.

Refer to the discussion in the Credit derivatives section on

pages 191–194

of this Note for a further discussion of credit derivatives.

Refer to the risk management derivatives gains and losses table on

page 191

of this Note, and the hedge accounting gains and losses tables on

pages 188–191

of this Note for more information about risk management derivatives.

Derivative counterparties and settlement types

The Firm

enters into OTC derivatives

,

which are negotiated and settled bilaterally with the derivative counterparty.

The Firm

also enters into, as principal, certain

ETD

such as futures and options, and

OTC-cleared

derivative contracts with CCPs.

ETD contracts are generally standardized contracts traded on an exchange and cleared by the CCP, which is

the Firm’s

counterparty from the inception of the transactions. OTC-cleared derivatives are traded on a bilateral basis and then novated to the CCP for clearing.

Derivative clearing services

The Firm

provides clearing services for clients in which

the Firm

acts as a clearing member at certain derivative exchanges and clearing houses.

The Firm

does not reflect the clients’ derivative contracts in its Consolidated Financial Statements.

Refer to Note


f

or further information on

the Firm’s

clearing services.

Accounting for derivatives

All free-standing derivatives that

the Firm

executes for its own account are required to be recorded on the Consolidated balance sheets at fair value.

As permitted under U.S. GAAP

, the Firm

nets derivative assets and liabilities, and the related cash collateral receivables and payables, when a legally enforceable master netting agreement exists between

the Firm

and the derivative counterparty.

Refer to Note


for further discussion of the offsetting of assets and liabilities.

The accounting for changes in value of a derivative depends on whether or not the transaction has been designated and qualifies for hedge accounting. Derivatives that are not designated as hedges are reported and measured at fair value through earnings. The tabular disclosures on

pages 184–191

of this Note provide additional information on the amount of, and reporting for, derivative assets, liabilities, gains and losses.

Refer to Notes


and


for further discussion of derivatives embedded in structured notes.


JPMorgan Chase & Co./2019 Form 10-K

Derivatives designated as hedges

The Firm

applies hedge accounting to certain derivatives executed for risk management purposes – generally interest rate, foreign exchange and commodity derivatives. However,

JPMorgan Chase

does not seek to apply hedge accounting to all of the derivatives involved in

the Firm’s

risk management activities. For example,

the Firm

does not apply hedge accounting to purchased CDS used to manage the credit risk of loans and lending-related commitments, because of the difficulties in qualifying such contracts as hedges. For the same reason,

the Firm

does not apply hedge accounting to certain interest rate

,

foreign exchange

, and commodity

derivatives used for risk management purposes.

To qualify for hedge accounting, a derivative must be highly effective at reducing the risk associated with the exposure being hedged. In addition, for a derivative to be designated as a hedge, the risk management objective and strategy must be documented. Hedge documentation must identify the derivative hedging instrument, the asset or liability or forecasted transaction and type of risk to be hedged, and how the effectiveness of the derivative is assessed prospectively and retrospectively. To assess effectiveness,

the Firm

uses statistical methods such as regression analysis, nonstatistical methods such as dollar-value comparisons of the change in the fair value of the derivative to the change in the fair value or cash flows of the hedged item, and qualitative comparisons of critical terms and the evaluation of any changes in those terms. The extent to which a derivative has been, and is expected to continue to be, highly effective at offsetting changes in the fair value or cash flows of the hedged item must be assessed and documented at least quarterly. If it is determined that a derivative is not highly effective at hedging the designated exposure, hedge accounting is discontinued.

There are three types of hedge accounting designations: fair value hedges, cash flow hedges and net investment hedges.

JPMorgan Chase

uses fair value hedges primarily to hedge fixed-rate long-term debt, AFS securities and certain commodities inventories. For qualifying fair value hedges, the changes in the fair value of the derivative, and in the value of the hedged item for the risk being hedged, are recognized in earnings. Certain amounts excluded from the assessment of effectiveness are recorded in OCI and recognized in earnings over the life of the derivative. If the hedge relationship is terminated, then the adjustment to the hedged item continues to be reported as part of the basis of the hedged item, and for benchmark interest rate hedges, is amortized to earnings as a yield adjustment. Derivative amounts affecting earnings are recognized consistent with the classification of the hedged item – primarily net interest income and principal transactions revenue.

JPMorgan Chase

uses cash flow hedges primarily to hedge the exposure to variability in forecasted cash flows from floating-rate assets and liabilities and foreign currency–denominated revenue and expense. For qualifying cash flow hedges, changes in the fair value of the derivative are recorded in OCI and recognized in earnings as the hedged item affects earnings. Derivative amounts affecting earnings are recognized consistent with the classification of the hedged item – primarily noninterest revenue, net interest income and compensation expense. If the hedge relationship is terminated, then the change in value of the derivative recorded in

AOCI

is recognized in earnings when the cash flows that were hedged affect earnings. For hedge relationships that are discontinued because a forecasted transaction is not expected to occur according to the original hedge forecast, any related derivative values recorded in AOCI are immediately recognized in earnings.

JPMorgan Chase

uses net investment hedges to protect the value of

the Firm’s

net investments in certain non-U.S. subsidiaries or branches whose functional currencies are not the U.S. dollar. For qualifying net investment hedges, changes in the fair value of the derivatives due to changes in spot foreign exchange rates are recorded in OCI as translation adjustments. Amounts excluded from the assessment of effectiveness are recorded directly in earnings.

Derivatives netting

The following tables present, as of

, gross and net derivative receivables and payables by contract and settlement type. Derivative receivables and payables, as well as the related cash collateral from the same counterparty, have been netted on the Consolidated balance sheets where

the Firm

has obtained an appropriate legal opinion with respect to the master netting agreement. Where such a legal opinion has not been either sought or obtained, amounts are not eligible for netting on the Consolidated balance sheets, and those derivative receivables and payables are shown separately in the tables below.

In addition to the cash collateral received and transferred that is presented on a net basis with derivative receivables and payables,

the Firm

receives and transfers additional collateral (financial instruments and cash). These amounts mitigate counterparty credit risk associated with

the Firm’s

derivative instruments, but are not eligible for net presentation:

•

collateral that consists of non-cash financial instruments (generally U.S. government and agency securities and other

G7

government securities) and cash collateral held at third-party custodians, which are shown separately as “Collateral not nettable on the Consolidated balance sheets” in the tables below, up to the fair value exposure amount;

•

the amount of collateral held or transferred that exceeds the fair value exposure at the individual counterparty level, as of the date presented, which is excluded from the tables below; and

•

collateral held or transferred that relates to derivative receivables or payables where an appropriate legal opinion has not been either sought or obtained with respect to the master netting agreement, which is excluded from the tables below.

Liquidity risk and credit-related contingent features

In addition to the specific market risks introduced by each derivative contract type, derivatives expose

JPMorgan Chase

to credit risk — the risk that derivative counterparties may fail to meet their payment obligations under the derivative contracts and the collateral, if any, held by

the Firm

proves to be of insufficient value to cover the payment obligation. It is the policy of

JPMorgan Chase

to actively pursue, where possible, the use of legally enforceable master netting arrangements and collateral agreements to mitigate derivative counterparty credit risk inherent in derivative receivables.

While derivative receivables expose

the Firm

to credit risk, derivative payables expose

the Firm

to liquidity risk, as the derivative contracts typically require

the Firm

to post cash or securities collateral with counterparties as the fair value of the contracts moves in the counterparties’ favor or upon specified downgrades in

the Firm’s and

its subsidiaries’ respective credit ratings. Certain derivative contracts also provide for termination of the contract, generally upon a downgrade of either

the Firm

or the counterparty, at the fair value of the derivative contracts. The following table shows the aggregate fair value of net derivative payables related to OTC and OTC-cleared derivatives that contain contingent collateral or termination features that may be triggered upon a ratings downgrade, and the associated collateral

the Firm

has posted in the normal course of business, at

and


,

related to OTC and OTC-cleared derivative contracts with contingent collateral or termination features that may be triggered upon a ratings downgrade. Derivatives contracts generally require additional collateral to be posted or terminations to be triggered when the predefined threshold rating is breached. A downgrade by a single rating agency that does not result in a rating lower than a preexisting corresponding rating provided by another major rating agency will generally not result in additional collateral (except in certain instances in which additional initial margin may be required upon a ratings downgrade), nor in termination payments requirements. The liquidity impact in the table is calculated based upon a downgrade below the lowest current rating of the rating agencies referred to in the derivative contract.

(a)

Includes the additional collateral to be posted for initial margin.

(b)

Amounts represent fair values of derivative payables, and do not reflect collateral posted.

Derivatives executed in contemplation of a sale of the underlying financial asset

In certain instances

the Firm

enters into transactions in which it transfers financial assets but maintains the economic exposure to the transferred assets by entering into a derivative with the same counterparty in contemplation of the initial transfer.

The Firm

generally accounts for such transfers as collateralized financing transactions as described in

Impact of derivatives on the Consolidated statements of income

The following tables provide information related to gains and losses recorded on derivatives based on their hedge accounting

designation or purpose.

Fair value hedge gains and losses

December 31, 2019

,


and


,

respectively.

The Firm

includes gains/(losses) on the hedging derivative in the same line item in the Consolidated statements of income as the related hedged item.

(a)

Primarily consists of hedges of the benchmark (e.g., London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”)) interest rate risk of fixed-rate long-term debt and AFS securities. Gains and losses were recorded in net interest income.

(b)

Excludes the amortization expense associated with the inception hedge accounting adjustment applied to the hedged item. This expense is recorded in net interest income and substantially offsets the income statement impact of the excluded components. Also excludes the accrual of interest on interest rate swaps and the related hedged items.

(c)

Primarily consists of hedges of the foreign currency risk of long-term debt and AFS securities for changes in spot foreign currency rates. Gains and losses related to the derivatives and the hedged items due to changes in foreign currency rates and the income statement impact of excluded components were recorded primarily in principal transactions revenue and net interest income.

(d)

Consists of overall fair value hedges of physical commodities inventories that are generally carried at the lower of cost or net realizable value (net realizable value approximates fair value). Gains and losses were recorded in principal transactions revenue.

(e)

Hedge ineffectiveness is the amount by which the gain or loss on the designated derivative instrument does not exactly offset the gain or loss on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk.

(f)

The assessment of hedge effectiveness excludes certain components of the changes in fair values of the derivatives and hedged items such as forward points on foreign exchange forward contracts, time values and cross-currency basis spreads. Excluded components may impact earnings either through amortization of the initial amount over the life of the derivative or through fair value changes recognized in the current period.

(g)

Represents the change in value of amounts excluded from the assessment of effectiveness under the amortization approach, predominantly cross-currency basis spreads. The amount excluded at inception of the hedge is recognized in earnings over the life of the derivative.


JPMorgan Chase & Co./2019 Form 10-K

As of December 31, 2019, the following amounts were recorded on the Consolidated balance sheets related to certain cumulative fair value hedge basis adjustments that are expected to reverse through the income statement in future periods as an adjustment to yield.

(a)

Excludes physical commodities with a carrying value of

$

6.5

billion

and

$

6.8

billion

at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, to which the Firm applies fair value hedge accounting. As a result of the application of hedge accounting, these inventories are carried at fair value, thus recognizing unrealized gains and losses in current periods. Since the Firm exits these positions at fair value, there is no incremental impact to net income in future periods.

(b)

Excludes hedged items where only foreign currency risk is the designated hedged risk, as basis adjustments related to foreign currency hedges will not reverse through the income statement in future periods. At December 31, 2019 and 2018, the carrying amount excluded for available-for-sale securities is

The Firm

includes the gain/(loss) on the hedging derivative in the same line item in the Consolidated statements of income as the change in cash flows on the related hedged item.

(a)

Primarily consists of hedges of LIBOR-indexed floating-rate assets and floating-rate liabilities. Gains and losses were recorded in net interest income.

(b)

Primarily consists of hedges of the foreign currency risk of non-U.S. dollar-denominated revenue and expense. The income statement classification of gains and losses follows the hedged item – primarily noninterest revenue and compensation expense.

(c)

Represents the effective portion of changes in value of the related hedging derivative. Hedge ineffectiveness is the amount by which the cumulative gain or loss on the designated derivative instrument exceeds the present value of the cumulative expected change in cash flows on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk. The Firm did not recognize any ineffectiveness on cash flow hedges during 2017.

five years

,

corresponding to the timing of the originally hedged forecasted cash flows.

For open cash flow hedges, the maximum length of time over which forecasted transactions are hedged is approximately

, and foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities.

(a)

Primarily represents interest rate derivatives used to hedge the interest rate risk inherent in mortgage commitments, warehouse loans and MSRs, as well as written commitments to originate warehouse loans. Gains and losses were recorded predominantly in mortgage fees and related income.

(b)

Relates to credit derivatives used to mitigate credit risk associated with lending exposures in the Firm’s wholesale businesses. These derivatives do not include credit derivatives used to mitigate counterparty credit risk arising from derivative receivables, which is included in gains and losses on derivatives related to market-making activities and other derivatives. Gains and losses were recorded in principal transactions revenue.

(c)

Primarily relates to derivatives used to mitigate foreign exchange risk of specified foreign currency-denominated assets and liabilities. Gains and losses were recorded in principal transactions revenue.

Gains and losses on derivatives related to market-making activities and other derivatives

The Firm

makes markets in derivatives in order to meet the needs of customers and uses derivatives to manage certain risks associated with net open risk positions from

its

market-making activities, including the counterparty credit risk arising from derivative receivables. All derivatives not included in the hedge accounting or specified risk management categories above are included in this category. Gains and losses on these derivatives are primarily recorded in principal transactions revenue. Refer to Note


for information on principal transactions revenue.

Credit derivatives

Credit derivatives are financial instruments whose value is derived from the credit risk associated with the debt of a third-party issuer (the reference entity) and which allow one party (the protection purchaser) to transfer that risk to another party (the protection seller). Credit derivatives expose the protection purchaser to the creditworthiness of the protection seller, as the protection seller is required to make payments under the contract when the reference entity experiences a credit event, such as a bankruptcy, a failure to pay its obligation or a restructuring. The seller of credit protection receives a premium for providing protection but has the risk that the underlying instrument referenced in the contract will be subject to a credit event.

The Firm

is both a purchaser and seller of protection in the credit derivatives market and uses these derivatives for two primary purposes. First, in its capacity as a market-maker,

the Firm

actively manages a portfolio of credit derivatives by purchasing and selling credit protection, predominantly on corporate debt obligations, to meet the needs of customers. Second, as an end-user,

the Firm

uses credit derivatives to manage credit risk associated with lending exposures (loans and unfunded commitments) and derivatives counterparty exposures in

the Firm’s

wholesale businesses, and to manage the credit risk arising from certain financial instruments in

the Firm’s

market-making businesses. Following is a summary of various types of credit derivatives.

JPMorgan Chase & Co./2019 Form 10-K


Notes to consolidated financial statements

Credit default swaps

Credit derivatives may reference the credit of either a single reference entity (“single-name”) or a broad-based index.

The Firm

purchases and sells protection on both single- name and index-reference obligations. Single-name CDS and index CDS contracts are either OTC or OTC-cleared derivative contracts. Single-name CDS are used to manage the default risk of a single reference entity, while index CDS contracts are used to manage the credit risk associated with the broader credit markets or credit market segments. Like the S&P 500 and other market indices, a CDS index consists of a portfolio of CDS across many reference entities. New series of CDS indices are periodically established with a new underlying portfolio of reference entities to reflect changes in the credit markets. If one of the reference entities in the index experiences a credit event, then the reference entity that defaulted is removed from the index. CDS can also be referenced against specific portfolios of reference names or against customized exposure levels based on specific client demands: for example, to provide protection against the first

$


million

of realized credit losses in a

$


million

portfolio of exposure. Such structures are commonly known as tranche CDS.

For both single-name CDS contracts and index CDS contracts, upon the occurrence of a credit event, under the terms of a CDS contract neither party to the CDS contract has recourse to the reference entity. The protection purchaser has recourse to the protection seller for the difference between the face value of the CDS contract and the fair value of the reference obligation at settlement of the credit derivative contract, also known as the recovery value. The protection purchaser does not need to hold the debt instrument of the underlying reference entity in order to receive amounts due under the CDS contract when a credit event occurs.

Credit-related notes

A credit-related note is a funded credit derivative where the issuer of the credit-related note purchases from the note investor credit protection on a reference entity or an index. Under the contract, the investor pays the issuer the par value of the note at the inception of the transaction, and in return, the issuer pays periodic payments to the investor, based on the credit risk of the referenced entity. The issuer also repays the investor the par value of the note at maturity unless the reference entity (or one of the entities that makes up a reference index) experiences a specified credit event. If a credit event occurs, the issuer is not obligated to repay the par value of the note, but rather, the issuer pays the investor the difference between the par value of the note and the fair value of the defaulted reference obligation at the time of settlement. Neither party to the credit-related note has recourse to the defaulting reference entity.

The following tables present a summary of the notional amounts of credit derivatives and credit-related notes

the Firm

sold and purchased as of

December 31, 2019

and


.

Upon a credit event,

the Firm

as a seller of protection would typically pay out only a percentage of the full notional amount of net protection sold, as the amount actually required to be paid on the contracts takes into account the recovery value of the reference obligation at the time of settlement.

The Firm

manages the credit risk on contracts to sell protection by purchasing protection with identical or similar underlying reference entities. Other purchased protection referenced in the following tables includes credit derivatives bought on related, but not identical, reference positions (including indices, portfolio coverage and other reference points) as well as protection purchased through credit-related notes.


JPMorgan Chase & Co./2019 Form 10-K

The Firm

does not use notional amounts of credit derivatives as the primary measure of risk management for such derivatives, because the notional amount does not take into account the probability of the occurrence of a credit event, the recovery value of the reference obligation, or related cash instruments and economic hedges, each of which reduces, in

the Firm’s

view, the risks associated with such derivatives.

(a)

Other credit derivatives predominantly consist of credit swap options and total return swaps.

(b)

Represents the total notional amount of protection purchased where the underlying reference instrument is identical to the reference instrument on protection sold; the notional amount of protection purchased for each individual identical underlying reference instrument may be greater or lower than the notional amount of protection sold.

(c)

Does not take into account the fair value of the reference obligation at the time of settlement, which would generally reduce the amount the seller of protection pays to the buyer of protection in determining settlement value.

(d)

Represents protection purchased by the Firm on referenced instruments (single-name, portfolio or index) where the Firm has not sold any protection on the identical reference instrument.

Noninterest revenue and noninterest expense

Noninterest revenue

The Firm

records noninterest revenue from certain contracts with customers in investment banking fees, deposit-related fees, asset management, administration, and commissions, and components of card income. The related contracts are often terminable on demand and

the Firm

has no remaining obligation to deliver future services. For arrangements with a fixed term,

the Firm

may commit to deliver services in the future. Revenue associated with these remaining performance obligations typically depends on the occurrence of future events or underlying asset values, and is not recognized until the outcome of those events or values are known.

Investment banking fees

This revenue category includes debt and equity underwriting and advisory fees. As an underwriter,

the Firm

helps clients raise capital via public offering and private placement of various types of debt and equity instruments. Underwriting fees are primarily based on the issuance price and quantity of the underlying instruments, and are recognized as revenue typically upon execution of the client’s transaction.

The Firm

also manages and syndicates loan arrangements. Credit arrangement and syndication fees, included within debt underwriting fees, are recorded as revenue after satisfying certain retention, timing and yield criteria.

The Firm

also provides advisory services, by assisting its clients with mergers and acquisitions, divestitures, restructuring and other complex transactions. Advisory fees are recognized as revenue typically upon execution of the client’s transaction.

The following table presents the components of investment banking fees.

Investment banking fees are earned primarily by CIB. Refer to Note


for segment results.

Principal transactions

Principal transactions revenue is driven by many factors, including:

•

the bid-offer spread, which is the difference between the price at which a market participant is willing and able to sell an instrument to

the Firm

and the price at which another market participant is willing and able to buy it from

the Firm

, and vice versa; and

•

realized and unrealized gains and losses on financial instruments and commodities transactions, including those accounted for under the fair value option, primarily used in client-driven market-making activities, and on private equity investments.

–

Realized gains and losses result from the sale of instruments, closing out or termination of transactions, or interim cash payments.

–

Unrealized gains and losses result from changes in valuation.

In connection with its client-driven market-making activities,

the Firm

transacts in debt and equity instruments, derivatives and commodities, including physical commodities inventories and financial instruments that reference commodities.

Principal transactions revenue also includes realized and unrealized gains and losses related to:

•

derivatives designated in qualifying hedge accounting relationships, primarily fair value hedges of commodity and foreign exchange risk;

•

derivatives used for specific risk management purposes, primarily to mitigate credit risk and foreign exchange risk

.

Refer to Note


for further information on the income statement classification of gains and losses from derivatives activities.

In the financial commodity markets,

the Firm

transacts in OTC derivatives (e.g., swaps, forwards, options) and ETD that reference a wide range of underlying commodities. In the physical commodity markets,

the Firm

primarily purchases and sells precious

and base

metals

and may hold other commodities inventories under financing and other arrangements with clients.

The following table presents all realized and unrealized gains and losses recorded in principal transactions revenue. This table excludes interest income and interest expense on trading assets and liabilities, which are an integral part of the overall performance of

the Firm’s

client-driven market-making activities

in CIB

and cash deployment activities

in Treasury and CIO.

Refer to Note


for further information on interest income and interest expense.

Trading revenue is presented primarily by instrument type.

The Firm’s

client-driven market-making businesses generally utilize a variety of instrument types in connection with their market-making and related risk-management activities; accordingly, the trading revenue presented in the table below is not representative of the total revenue of any individual LOB.

JPMorgan Chase & Co./2019 Form 10-K


Notes to consolidated financial statements

Principal transactions revenue is earned primarily by CIB. Refer to Note


for segment results.

Lending- and deposit-related fees

Lending-related fees include fees earned from loan commitments, standby letters of credit, financial guarantees, and other loan-servicing activities. Deposit-related fees include fees earned in lieu of compensating balances, and fees earned from performing cash management activities and other deposit account services. Lending- and deposit-related fees in this revenue category are recognized over the period in which the related service is provided.

The following table presents the components of lending- and deposit-related fees.

Lending- and deposit-related fees are earned by CCB, CIB, CB, and AWM. Refer to Note


for segment results.

Asset management, administration and commissions

This revenue category includes fees from investment management and related services, custody, brokerage services and other products.

The Firm

manages assets on behalf of its clients, including investors in

Firm

-sponsored funds and owners of separately managed investment accounts. Management fees are typically based on the value of assets under management and are collected and recognized at the end of each period over which the management services are provided and the value of the managed assets is known.

The Firm

also receives performance-based management fees, which are earned based on exceeding certain benchmarks or other performance targets and are accrued and recognized when the probability of reversal is remote, typically at the end of the related billing period.

The Firm

has contractual arrangements with third parties to provide distribution and other services in connection with its asset management activities. Amounts paid to these third-party service providers are generally recorded in professional and outside services expense.

The following table presents the components of

Firmwide

asset management, administration and commissions.

(a)

Represents fees earned from managing assets on behalf of the Firm’s clients, including investors in Firm-sponsored funds and owners of separately managed investment accounts.

(b)

Represents fees for services that are ancillary to investment management services, such as commissions earned on the sales or distribution of mutual funds to clients. These fees are recorded as revenue at the time the service is rendered or, in the case of certain distribution fees based on the underlying fund’s asset value and/or investor redemption, recorded over time as the investor remains in the fund or upon investor redemption.

(c)

Predominantly includes fees for custody, securities lending, funds services and securities clearance. These fees are recorded as revenue over the period in which the related service is provided.

(d)

Represents commissions earned when the Firm acts as a broker, by facilitating its clients’ purchases and sales of securities and other financial instruments. Brokerage commissions are collected and recognized as revenue upon occurrence of the client transaction. The Firm reports certain costs paid to third-party clearing houses and exchanges net against commission revenue.

Asset management, administration and commissions are earned primarily by AWM, CIB, CCB, and CB. Refer to Note


for segment results.

Mortgage fees and related income

This revenue category primarily reflects

CCB’s Home Lending

net production and net mortgage servicing revenue.

Net production revenue includes fees and income recognized as earned on mortgage loans originated with the intent to sell, and the impact of risk management activities associated with the mortgage pipeline and warehouse loans. Net production revenue also includes gains and losses on sales and lower of cost or fair value adjustments on mortgage loans held-for-sale (excluding certain repurchased loans insured by U.S. government agencies), and changes in the fair value of financial instruments measured under the fair value option.


JPMorgan Chase & Co./2019 Form 10-K

Net mortgage servicing revenue includes operating revenue earned from servicing third-party mortgage loans, which is recognized over the period in which the service is provided; changes in the fair value of MSRs; the impact of risk management activities associated with MSRs; and gains and losses on securitization of excess mortgage servicing. Net mortgage servicing revenue also includes gains and losses on sales and lower of cost or fair value adjustments of certain repurchased loans insured by U.S. government agencies.

Refer to Note


for further information on risk management activities and MSRs.

Net interest income from mortgage loans is recorded in interest income.

Card income

This revenue category includes interchange and other income from credit and debit card transactions, and fees earned from processing card transactions for merchants, both of which are recognized when purchases are made by a cardholder and presented net of certain transaction-related costs. Card income also includes account origination costs and annual fees, which are deferred and recognized on a straight-line basis over a


-month period.

Certain

Chase

credit card products offer the cardholder the ability to earn points based on account activity, which the cardholder can choose to redeem for cash and non-cash rewards. The cost to

the Firm

related to these proprietary rewards programs varies based on multiple factors including the terms and conditions of the rewards programs, cardholder activity, cardholder reward redemption rates and cardholder reward selections.

The Firm

maintains a liability for its obligations under its rewards programs and reports the current-period cost as a reduction of card income.

Credit card revenue sharing agreements

The Firm

has contractual agreements with numerous co-brand partners that grant

the Firm

exclusive rights to issue co-branded credit card products and market them to the customers of such partners. These partners endorse the co-brand credit card programs and provide their customer or member lists to

the Firm.

The partners may also conduct marketing activities and provide rewards redeemable under their own loyalty programs that

the Firm

will grant to co-brand credit cardholders based on account activity.

The terms of these agreements generally range from

five

to

ten

years.

The Firm

typically makes payments to the co-brand credit card partners based on the cost of partners’ marketing activities and loyalty program rewards provided to credit cardholders, new account originations and sales volumes. Payments to partners based on marketing efforts undertaken by the partners are expensed by

the Firm

as incurred and reported as marketing expense. Payments for partner loyalty program rewards are reported as a reduction of card income when incurred. Payments to partners based on new credit card account originations are accounted for as direct loan origination costs and are deferred and recognized as a reduction of card income on a straight-line basis over a


-month period. Payments to partners based on sales volumes are reported as a reduction of card income when the related interchange income is earned.

The following table presents the components of card income:

(a)

Predominantly represents account origination costs and annual fees, which are deferred and recognized on a straight-line basis over a


-month period.

(b)

Includes an adjustment to the credit card rewards liability of approximately

$


million

, recorded in the second quarter of 2018.

Interest income and Interest expense

Interest income and interest expense are recorded in the Consolidated statements of income and classified based on the nature of the underlying asset or liability.

The following table presents the components of interest income and interest expense:

(a)

Includes the amortization/accretion of unearned income (e.g., purchase premiums/discounts, net deferred fees/costs, etc.).

(b)

Represents securities that are tax-exempt for U.S. federal income tax purposes.

(c)

In the second quarter of 2019, the Firm implemented certain presentation changes that impacted interest income and interest expense, but had no effect on net interest income. These changes were made to align the accounting treatment between the balance sheet and the related interest income or expense, primarily by offsetting interest income and expense for certain prime brokerage-related held-for-investment customer receivables and payables that are currently presented as a single margin account on the balance sheet. These changes were applied retrospectively and, accordingly, prior period amounts were revised to conform with the current presentation.

(d)

Includes interest earned on prime brokerage-related held-for-investment customer receivables, which are classified in accrued interest and accounts receivable, and all other interest-earning assets, which are classified in other assets on the Consolidated balance sheets.

(e)

Includes commercial paper.

(f)

Other interest-bearing liabilities includes interest expense on prime brokerage-related customer payables.

Interest income and interest expense includes the current-period interest accruals for financial instruments measured at fair value, except for derivatives and financial instruments containing embedded derivatives that would be separately accounted for in accordance with U.S. GAAP, absent the fair value option election; for those instruments, all changes in fair value including any interest elements, are reported in principal transactions revenue. For financial instruments that are not measured at fair value, the related interest is included within interest income or interest expense, as applicable.

Pension and other postretirement employee benefit plans

The Firm has various defined benefit pension plans and OPEB plans that provide benefits to its employees in the U.S. and certain non-U.S. locations. The Firm also provides a qualified defined contribution plan in the U.S. and maintains other similar arrangements in certain non-U.S. locations.

The principal defined benefit pension plan in the U.S. is a qualified noncontributory plan that provides benefits to substantially all U.S. employees

.

In connection with changes to the U.S. Retirement Savings Program during the fourth quarter of 2018,

the Firm

announced that it will freeze the U.S. defined benefit pension plan (the “Plan Freeze”). Commencing on January 1, 2020 (and January 1, 2019 for new hires), new pay credits are directed to the U.S. defined contribution plan. Interest credits on the U.S. defined benefit pension plan will continue to accrue. As a result, a curtailment was triggered and a remeasurement of the U.S. defined benefit pension obligation and plan assets occurred as of November 30, 2018. The plan design change

did not have a material impact on the U.S. defined benefit pension plan or

the Firm’s

Consolidated Financial Statements.

The Firm

also has defined benefit pension plans that are offered in certain non-U.S. locations based on factors such as eligible compensation, age and/or years of service. It is

the Firm’s

policy to fund the pension plans in amounts sufficient to meet the requirements under applicable laws.

The Firm

does not anticipate at this time making any contribution to the U.S. defined benefit pension plan in 2020. The 2020 contributions to the non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans are expected to be

$


million

,

of which

$


million

are contractually required.

The Firm also has

a number of nonqualified noncontributory defined benefit pension plans that are unfunded. These plans provide supplemental defined pension benefits to certain employees.

The Firm

offers postretirement medical and life insurance benefits to certain U.S. retirees and postretirement medical benefits to certain qualifying U.S.

and U.K.

employees

.

The Firm partially defrays the cost of its U.S. OPEB obligation through corporate-owned life insurance (“COLI”) purchased on the lives of eligible employees and retirees. While the Firm owns the COLI policies, certain COLI proceeds (death benefits, withdrawals and other distributions) may be used only to reimburse the Firm for its net postretirement benefit claim payments and related administrative expense. The Firm has prefunded its U.S. postretirement benefit obligations. The U.K. OPEB plan is unfunded.

Pension and OPEB accounting guidance generally requires that the difference between plan assets at fair value and the benefit obligation be measured and recorded on the balance sheet. Plans that are overfunded (excess of plan assets over benefit obligation) are recorded in other assets and plans that are underfunded (excess benefit obligation over plan assets) are recorded in other liabilities. Gains or losses resulting from changes in the benefit obligation and the value of plan assets are recorded in OCI and recognized as part of the net periodic benefit cost over subsequent periods as discussed in the Gains and losses section of this Note. Additionally, benefits earned during the year are reported in compensation expense; all other components of net periodic defined benefit costs are reported in other expense in the Consolidated statements of income.

Gains and losses

For

the Firm’s

defined benefit pension plans, fair value is used to determine the expected return on plan assets. Amortization of net gains and losses is included in annual net periodic benefit cost if, as of the beginning of the year, the net gain or loss exceeds


%

of the greater of the projected benefit obligation or the fair value of the plan assets. Any excess is amortized over the average future service period of defined benefit pension plan participants, which for the U.S. defined benefit pension plan is currently

eight years

and for the non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans is the period appropriate for the affected plan. As a result of the Plan Freeze, beginning in 2020, any excess for the U.S. defined benefit pension plan will be amortized over the average expected lifetime of plan participants which is currently 38 years. In addition, prior service costs are amortized over the average remaining service period of active employees expected to receive benefits under the plan when the prior service cost is first recognized.

For the Firm’s OPEB plans, a calculated value that recognizes changes in fair value over a

five

-year period is used to determine the expected return on plan assets. This value is referred to as the market-related value of assets. Amortization of net gains and losses, adjusted for gains and losses not yet recognized, is included in annual net periodic benefit cost if, as of the beginning of the year, the net gain or loss exceeds


%

of the greater of the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation or the market-related value of assets. Any excess is amortized over the average expected lifetime of retired participants, which is currently

eleven years

.

Notes to consolidated financial statements

The following table presents the components of net periodic benefit costs reported in the Consolidated statements of income for the Firm’s U.S. and non-U.S. defined benefit pension, defined contribution and OPEB plans, and in other comprehensive income for the defined benefit pension and OPEB plans, and the weighted-average annualized actuarial assumptions for the net periodic benefit cost.

(d)

Excludes participants whose benefits under the plan are capped.

Plan assumptions

The Firm’s

expected long-term rate of return for defined benefit pension

and OPEB

plan assets is a blended weighted average, by asset allocation of the projected long-term returns for the various asset classes, taking into consideration local market conditions and the specific allocation of plan assets. Returns on asset classes are developed using a forward-looking approach and are not strictly based on historical returns. Consideration is also given to current market conditions and the short-term portfolio mix of each plan.

The discount rate used in determining the benefit obligation under the U.S. defined benefit pension

and OPEB plans

was provided by

the Firm’s

actuaries. This rate was selected by reference to the yields on portfolios of bonds with maturity dates and coupons that closely match each of the plan’s projected cash flows. The discount rate for the U.K. defined benefit pension plan represents a rate of appropriate duration from the analysis of yield curves provided by

the Firm’s

actuaries.

At

December 31, 2019

, the Firm

decreased the discount rates used to determine its benefit obligations for the U.S.


JPMorgan Chase & Co./2019 Form 10-K

defined benefit pension

and OPEB plans

in light of current market interest rates, which is expected to decrease expense by approximately

$


million

in 2020

.

The 2020 expected long-term rate of return on U.S. defined benefit pension plan assets

and U.S. OPEB plan assets are

4.00

%

and

4.11

%

, respectively.

The following table represents the effect of a 25-basis point decline in the two listed rates below on estimated


defined benefit pension

and OPEB

plan expense, as well as the effect on the postretirement benefit obligations.

Investment strategy and asset allocation

The assets of

the Firm’s

defined benefit pension plans are held in various trusts and are invested in well-diversified portfolios of equity and fixed income securities, cash and cash equivalents, and alternative investments.

The trust-owned assets of the Firm’s U.S. OPEB plan are invested primarily in fixed income securities. COLI policies used to partially defray the cost of the Firm’s U.S. OPEB plan are invested in separate accounts of an insurance company and are allocated to investments intended to replicate equity and fixed income indices.

The investment policies for the assets of

the Firm’s

defined benefit pension plans are to optimize the risk-return relationship as appropriate to the needs and goals of each

plan using a global portfolio of various asset classes diversified by market segment, economic sector, and issuer. Assets are managed by a combination of internal and external investment managers.

The Firm

regularly reviews the asset allocations and asset managers, as well as other factors that impact the portfolios, which are rebalanced when deemed necessary.

Investments held by the plans include financial instruments which are exposed to various risks such as interest rate, market and credit risks. Exposure to a concentration of credit risk is mitigated by the broad diversification of both U.S. and non-U.S. investments. Additionally, the investments in each of the collective investment funds and/or registered investment companies are further diversified into various financial instruments. As of

December 31, 2019

, assets held by

the Firm’s

defined benefit pension

and OPEB plans

do not include securities issued by

JPMorgan Chase or its affiliates,

except through indirect exposures through investments in ETFs, mutual funds and collective investment funds managed by third-parties. The plans hold investments that are sponsored or managed by affiliates of JPMorgan Chase in the amount of

$

3.1

billion

and

$

3.7

billion

, as of

December 31, 2019

and


, respectively.

Employee share-based incentives

Employee share-based awards

In


,


and

JPMorgan Chase

granted long-term share-based awards to certain employees under its

LTIP,

as amended and restated effective May 15, 2018. Under the terms of the LTIP, as of

December 31, 2019

,


million

shares of

common stock were available for issuance through May 2022. The LTIP is the only active plan under which

the Firm

is currently granting share-based incentive awards. In the following discussion, the LTIP, plus prior

Firm

plans and plans assumed as the result of acquisitions, are referred to collectively as the “LTI Plans,” and such plans constitute

the Firm’s

share-based incentive plans.

RSUs

are awarded at no cost to the recipient upon their grant. Generally, RSUs are granted annually and vest at a rate of 50% after

two years

and 50% after

three years

and are converted into shares of common stock as of the vesting date. In addition, RSUs typically include full-career eligibility provisions, which allow employees to continue to vest upon voluntary termination based on age or service-related requirements, subject to post-employment and other restrictions. All RSU awards are subject to forfeiture until vested and contain clawback provisions that may result in cancellation under certain specified circumstances. Predominantly all RSUs entitle the recipient to receive cash payments equivalent to any dividends paid on the underlying common stock during the period the RSUs are outstanding

.

Performance share units (“PSUs”) are granted annually, and approved by the Firm’s Board of Directors, to members of

the Firm’s

Operating Committee under the variable compensation program. PSUs are subject to

the Firm’s

achievement of specified performance criteria over a three-year period. The number of awards that vest can range from zero to 150% of the grant amount. In addition, dividends that accrue during the vesting period are reinvested in dividend equivalent share units. PSUs and the related dividend equivalent share units are converted into shares of common stock after vesting.

Once the PSUs and dividend equivalent share units have vested, the shares of common stock that are delivered, after applicable tax withholding, must be held for an additional two-year period, for a total combined vesting and holding period of approximately five to eight years from the grant date depending on regulations in certain countries.

Under the LTI Plans, stock appreciation rights (“SARs”) and stock options have generally been granted with an exercise price equal to the fair value of JPMorgan Chase’s common stock on the grant date.

SARs and stock options generally expire ten years after the grant date.

There were no material grants of employee SARs or stock options

in 2019, 2018 and 2017.

The Firm

separately recognizes compensation expense for each tranche of each award, net of estimated forfeitures, as if it were a separate award with its own vesting date. Generally, for each tranche granted, compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis from the grant date until the vesting date of the respective tranche, provided that the employees will not become full-career eligible during the vesting period. For awards with full-career eligibility provisions and awards granted with no future substantive service requirement,

the Firm

accrues the estimated value of awards expected to be awarded to employees as of the grant date without giving consideration to the impact of post-employment restrictions. For each tranche granted to employees who will become full-career eligible during the vesting period, compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis from the grant date until the earlier of the employee’s full-career eligibility date or the vesting date of the respective tranche.

The Firm’s policy for issuing shares upon settlement of employee share-based incentive awards is to issue either new shares of common stock or treasury shares. During

and


, the Firm settled all of its employee share-based awards by issuing treasury shares.

Refer to Note 23 for further information on the classification of share-based awards for purposes of calculating earnings per share.


JPMorgan Chase & Co./2019 Form 10-K

RSUs, PSUs, employee SARs and stock options activity

Generally, compensation expense for RSUs and PSUs is measured based on the number of units granted multiplied by the stock price at the grant date, and for employee SARs and stock options, is measured at the grant date using the Black-Scholes valuation model. Compensation expense for these awards is recognized in net income as described previously. The following table summarizes

Investment securities

Investment securities consist of debt securities that are classified as AFS or HTM. Debt securities classified as trading assets are discussed in Note


.

Predominantly all of

the Firm’s

AFS and HTM securities are held by

Treasury and CIO

in connection with its asset-liability management activities. At

December 31, 2019

,

the investment securities portfolio consisted of debt securities with an average credit rating of

AA+

(based upon external ratings where available, and where not available, based primarily upon internal ratings).

The Firm’s

internal risk ratings generally align with the qualitative characteristics (e.g., borrower capacity to meet financial commitments and vulnerability to changes in the economic environment) defined by S&P and Moody’s, however the quantitative characteristics (e.g., PDs and LGDs) may differ as they reflect internal historical experiences and assumptions.

AFS securities are carried at fair value on the Consolidated balance sheets. Unrealized gains and losses, after any applicable hedge accounting adjustments, are reported as

net increases or decreases to AOCI. The specific identification method is used to determine realized gains and losses on AFS securities, which are included in securities gains/(losses) on the Consolidated statements of income. HTM debt securities, which

the Firm

has the intent and ability to hold until maturity, are carried at amortized cost on the Consolidated balance sheets.

For both AFS and HTM debt securities, purchase discounts or premiums are generally amortized into interest income on a level-yield basis over the contractual life of the security.

However, premiums on certain callable debt securities are amortized to the earliest call date.

During the

fourth quarter of 2019, the Firm

transferred

$

6.2

billion

of collateralized loan obligations from AFS to HTM for capital management purposes. These securities were transferred at fair value in a non-cash transaction.

Investment securities impairment

The following tables present the fair value and gross unrealized losses for investment securities by aging category at

December 31, 2019

and


.


JPMorgan Chase & Co./2019 Form 10-K

Other-than-temporary impairment

AFS and HTM debt securities in unrealized loss positions are analyzed as part of

the Firm’s

ongoing assessment of OTTI.

The Firm

considers a decline in fair value to be other-than-temporary when

the Firm

does not expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the security.

For AFS debt securities,

the Firm

recognizes OTTI losses in earnings if

the Firm

has the intent to sell the debt security, or if it is more likely than not that

the Firm

will be required to sell the debt security before recovery of its amortized cost basis. In these circumstances the impairment loss is equal to the full difference between the amortized cost basis and the fair value of the securities.

For debt securities in an unrealized loss position that

the Firm

has the intent and ability to hold, the securities are evaluated to determine if a credit loss exists. In the event of a credit loss, only the amount of impairment associated with the credit loss is recognized in income. Amounts relating to factors other than credit losses are recorded in OCI.

Factors considered in evaluating potential OTTI include adverse conditions specifically related to the industry, geographic area or financial condition of the issuer or underlying collateral of a security; payment structure of the

security; changes to the rating of the security by a rating

agency; the volatility of the fair value changes; and

the Firm’s

intent and ability to hold the security until recovery.

The Firm’s

cash flow evaluations take into account the factors noted above and expectations of relevant market and economic data as of the end of the reporting period. When assessing securities issued in a securitization for OTTI,

the Firm

estimates cash flows considering underlying loan-level data and structural features of the securitization, such as subordination, excess spread, overcollateralization or other forms of credit enhancement, and compares the losses projected for the underlying collateral (“pool losses”) against the level of credit enhancement in the securitization structure to determine whether these features are sufficient to absorb the pool losses, or whether a credit loss exists.

The Firm

also performs other analyses to support its cash flow projections, such as first-loss analyses or stress scenarios.

For beneficial interests in securitizations that are rated below “AA” at their acquisition, or that can be contractually prepaid or otherwise settled in such a way that

the Firm

would not recover substantially all of its recorded investment,

the Firm

considers an impairment to be other-than-temporary when there is an adverse change in expected cash flows.

JPMorgan Chase & Co./2019 Form 10-K


Notes to consolidated financial statements

The Firm

recognizes unrealized losses on investment securities that it intends to sell as OTTI.

The Firm

does not intend to sell any of the remaining investment securities with an unrealized loss in AOCI as of

December 31, 2019

the Firm

will be required to sell these securities before recovery of their amortized cost basis. Further,

the Firm

did not recognize any credit-related OTTI losses during the year ended

December 31, 2019

the Firm

believes that the investment securities with an unrealized loss in AOCI as of

(a)

Average yield is computed using the effective yield of each security owned at the end of the period, weighted based on the amortized cost of each security. The effective yield considers the contractual coupon, amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts, and the effect of related hedging derivatives. Taxable-equivalent amounts are used where applicable. The effective yield excludes unscheduled principal prepayments; and accordingly, actual maturities of securities may differ from their contractual or expected maturities as certain securities may be prepaid.

Securities financing activities

JPMorgan Chase

enters into resale, repurchase, securities borrowed and securities loaned agreements (collectively, “securities financing agreements”) primarily to finance

the Firm’s

inventory positions, acquire securities to cover short sales, accommodate customers’ financing needs,

settle other securities obligations

and to deploy

the Firm’s

excess cash.

Securities financing agreements are treated as collateralized financings on

the Firm’s

Consolidated balance sheets. Resale and repurchase agreements are generally carried at the amounts at which the securities will be subsequently sold or repurchased. Securities borrowed and securities loaned agreements are generally carried at the amount of cash collateral advanced or received. Where appropriate under applicable accounting guidance, securities financing agreements with the same counterparty are reported on a net basis. Refer to

Note


for further discussion of the offsetting of assets and liabilities. Fees received and paid in connection with securities financing agreements are recorded over the life of the agreement in interest income and interest expense on the Consolidated statements of income.

The Firm

has elected the fair value option for certain securities financing agreements. Refer to Note


for further information regarding the fair value option. The securities financing agreements for which the fair value option has been elected are reported within securities purchased under resale agreements, securities loaned or sold under repurchase agreements, and securities borrowed on the Consolidated balance sheets. Generally, for agreements carried at fair value, current-period interest accruals are recorded within interest income and interest expense, with changes in fair value reported in principal transactions revenue. However, for financial instruments containing embedded derivatives that would be separately accounted for in accordance with accounting guidance for hybrid instruments, all changes in fair value, including any interest elements, are reported in principal transactions revenue.

Securities financing agreements expose

the Firm

primarily to credit and liquidity risk. To manage these risks,

the Firm

monitors the value of the underlying securities (predominantly high-quality securities collateral, including government-issued debt and U.S. GSEs and government agencies MBS) that it has received from or provided to its counterparties compared to the value of cash proceeds and exchanged collateral, and either requests additional collateral or returns securities or collateral when appropriate. Margin levels are initially established based upon the counterparty, the type of underlying securities, and the permissible collateral, and are monitored on an ongoing basis.

In resale and securities borrowed agreements,

the Firm

is exposed to credit risk to the extent that the value of the securities received is less than initial cash principal advanced and any collateral amounts exchanged. In repurchase and securities loaned agreements, credit risk exposure arises to the extent that the value of underlying securities advanced exceeds the value of the initial cash principal received, and any collateral amounts exchanged.

Additionally,

the Firm

typically enters into master netting agreements and other similar arrangements with its counterparties, which provide for the right to liquidate the underlying securities and any collateral amounts exchanged in the event of a counterparty default.

It is also

the Firm’s

policy to take possession, where possible, of the securities underlying resale and securities borrowed agreements.

Refer to Note


for further information regarding assets pledged and collateral received in securities financing agreements.

As a result of

the Firm’s

credit risk mitigation practices with respect to resale and securities borrowed agreements as described above,

the Firm

did not hold any reserves for credit impairment with respect to these agreements as

of December 31, 2019 and 2018.

Loans

Loan accounting framework

The accounting for a loan depends on management’s strategy for the loan, and on whether the loan was credit-impaired at the date of acquisition.

The Firm

accounts for loans based on the following categories:

•

Originated or purchased loans held-for-investment (i.e., “retained”), other than PCI loans

•

Loans held-for-sale

•

Loans at fair value

•

PCI loans held-for-investment

The following provides a detailed accounting discussion of these loan categories:

Loans held-for-investment (other than PCI loans)

Originated or purchased loans held-for-investment, other than PCI loans, are recorded at the principal amount outstanding, net of the following: charge-offs; interest applied to principal (for loans accounted for on the cost recovery method); unamortized discounts and premiums; and net deferred loan fees or costs. Credit card loans also include billed finance charges and fees net of an allowance for uncollectible amounts.

Interest income

Interest income on performing loans held-for-investment, other than PCI loans, is accrued and recognized as interest income at the contractual rate of interest. Purchase price discounts or premiums, as well as net deferred loan fees or costs, are amortized into interest income over the contractual life of the loan as an adjustment of yield.

Nonaccrual loans

Nonaccrual loans are those on which the accrual of interest has been suspended. Loans (other than credit card loans and certain consumer loans insured by U.S. government agencies) are placed on nonaccrual status and considered nonperforming when full payment of principal and interest is not expected, regardless of delinquency status, or when principal and interest has been in default for a period of


days

or more, unless the loan is both well-secured and in the process of collection. A loan is determined to be past due when the minimum payment is not received from the borrower by the contractually specified due date or for certain loans (e.g., residential real estate loans), when a monthly payment is due and unpaid for


days

or more. Finally, collateral-dependent loans are typically maintained on nonaccrual status.

On the date a loan is placed on nonaccrual status, all interest accrued but not collected is reversed against interest income. In addition, the amortization of deferred amounts is suspended. Interest income on nonaccrual loans may be recognized as cash interest payments are received (i.e., on a cash basis) if the recorded loan balance is deemed fully collectible; however, if there is doubt regarding the ultimate collectibility of the recorded loan balance, all interest cash receipts are applied to reduce the

carrying value of the loan (the cost recovery method). For consumer loans, application of this policy typically results in

the Firm

recognizing interest income on nonaccrual consumer loans on a cash basis.

A loan may be returned to accrual status when repayment is reasonably assured and there has been demonstrated performance under the terms of the loan or, if applicable, the terms of the restructured loan.

As permitted by regulatory guidance, credit card loans are generally exempt from being placed on nonaccrual status; accordingly, interest and fees related to credit card loans continue to accrue until the loan is charged off or paid in full.

The Firm

separately establishes an allowance, which reduces loans and is charged to interest income, for the estimated uncollectible portion of accrued and billed interest and fee income on credit card loans.

Allowance for loan losses

The allowance for loan losses represents the estimated probable credit losses inherent in the held-for-investment loan portfolio at the balance sheet date and is recognized on the balance sheet as a contra asset, which brings the recorded investment to the net carrying value. Changes in the allowance for loan losses are recorded in the provision for credit losses on

the Firm’s

Consolidated statements of income. Refer to Note


for further information on

the Firm’s

accounting policies for the allowance for loan losses.

Charge-offs

Consumer loans, other than risk-rated business banking and auto loans, and PCI loans, are generally charged off or charged down to the net realizable value of the underlying collateral (i.e., fair value less costs to sell), with an offset to the allowance for loan losses, upon reaching specified stages of delinquency in accordance with standards established by the

FFIEC.

Residential real estate loans and non-modified credit card loans are generally charged off no later than


days

past due.

Scored auto and modified credit card loans are charged off no later than


days

past due.

Certain consumer loans will be charged off or charged down to their net realizable value earlier than the FFIEC charge-off standards in certain circumstances as follows:

•

Loans modified in a

TDR

that are determined to be collateral-dependent.

•

Loans to borrowers who have experienced an event that suggests a loss is either known or highly certain are subject to accelerated charge-off standards (e.g., residential real estate and auto loans are charged off within 60 days of receiving notification of a bankruptcy filing).

•

Auto loans upon repossession of the automobile.

Other than in certain limited circumstances,

the Firm

typically does not recognize charge-offs on government-guaranteed loans.

JPMorgan Chase & Co./2019 Form 10-K


Notes to consolidated financial statements

Wholesale loans, risk-rated business banking loans and risk-rated auto loans are charged off when it is highly certain that a loss has been realized, including situations where a loan is determined to be both impaired and collateral-dependent. The determination of whether to recognize a charge-off includes many factors, including the prioritization of

the Firm’s

claim in bankruptcy, expectations of the workout/restructuring of the loan and valuation of the borrower’s equity or the loan collateral.

When a loan is charged down to the estimated net realizable value, the determination of the fair value of the collateral depends on the type of collateral (e.g., securities, real estate). In cases where the collateral is in the form of liquid securities, the fair value is based on quoted market prices or broker quotes. For illiquid securities or other financial assets, the fair value of the collateral is generally estimated using a discounted cash flow model.

For residential real estate loans, collateral values are based upon external valuation sources. When it becomes likely that a borrower is either unable or unwilling to pay,

the Firm

utilizes a broker’s price opinion, appraisal and/or an automated valuation model of the home based on an exterior-only valuation (“exterior opinions”), which is then updated at least every

twelve months

,

or more frequently depending on various market factors. As soon as practicable after

the Firm

receives the property in satisfaction of a debt (e.g., by taking legal title or physical possession),

the Firm

generally obtains an appraisal based on an inspection that includes the interior of the home (“interior appraisals”). Exterior opinions and interior appraisals are discounted based upon

the Firm’s

experience with actual liquidation values as compared with the estimated values provided by exterior opinions and interior appraisals, considering state-specific factors.

For commercial real estate loans, collateral values are generally based on appraisals from internal and external valuation sources. Collateral values are typically updated every

six

to

twelve months

,

either by obtaining a new appraisal or by performing an internal analysis, in accordance with

the Firm’s

policies.

The Firm

also considers both borrower- and market-specific factors, which may result in obtaining appraisal updates or broker price opinions at more frequent intervals.

Loans held-for-sale

Loans held-for-sale are measured at the lower of cost or fair value, with valuation changes recorded in noninterest revenue. For consumer loans, the valuation is performed on a portfolio basis. For wholesale loans, the valuation is performed on an individual loan basis.

Interest income on loans held-for-sale is accrued and recognized based on the contractual rate of interest.

Loan origination fees or costs and purchase price discounts or premiums are deferred in a contra loan account until the related loan is sold. The deferred fees or costs and discounts or premiums are an adjustment to the basis of the loan and therefore are included in the periodic determination of the lower of cost or fair value adjustments and/or the gain or loss recognized at the time of sale.

Because these loans are recognized at the lower of cost or fair value,

the Firm’s

allowance for loan losses and charge-off policies do not apply to these loans. However, loans held-for-sale are subject to the nonaccrual policies described above.

Loans at fair value

Loans used in a market-making strategy or risk managed on a fair value basis are measured at fair value, with changes in fair value recorded in noninterest revenue.

Interest income on these loans is accrued and recognized based on the contractual rate of interest. Changes in fair value are recognized in noninterest revenue. Loan origination fees are recognized upfront in noninterest revenue. Loan origination costs are recognized in the associated expense category as incurred.

Because these loans are recognized at fair value,

the Firm’s

allowance for loan losses and charge-off policies do not apply to these loans.

However, loans at fair value are subject to the nonaccrual policies described above.

Refer to Note


for further information on

the Firm’s

elections of fair value accounting under the fair value option. Refer to Note


and Note


for further information on loans carried at fair value and classified as trading assets.

PCI loans

PCI loans held-for-investment are initially measured at fair value. PCI loans have evidence of credit deterioration since the loan’s origination date and therefore it is probable, at acquisition, that all contractually required payments will not be collected. Because PCI loans are initially measured at fair value, which includes an estimate of future credit losses, no allowance for loan losses related to PCI loans is recorded at the acquisition date. Refer to

page 229

of this Note for information on accounting for PCI loans subsequent to their acquisition.


JPMorgan Chase & Co./2019 Form 10-K

Loan classification changes

Loans in the held-for-investment portfolio that management decides to sell are transferred to the held-for-sale portfolio at the lower of cost or fair value on the date of transfer. Credit-related losses are charged against the allowance for loan losses; non-credit related losses such as those due to changes in interest rates or foreign currency exchange rates are recognized in noninterest revenue.

In the event that management decides to retain a loan in the held-for-sale portfolio, the loan is transferred to the held-for-investment portfolio at the lower of cost or fair value on the date of transfer. These loans are subsequently assessed for impairment based on

the Firm’s allowance methodology.

Refer to Note


for a further discussion of the methodologies used in establishing

the Firm’s

allowance for loan losses.

Loan modifications

The Firm

seeks to modify certain loans in conjunction with its loss-mitigation activities. Through the modification,

JPMorgan Chase

grants one or more concessions to a borrower who is experiencing financial difficulty in order to minimize

the Firm’s

economic loss and avoid foreclosure or repossession of the collateral, and to ultimately maximize payments received by

the Firm

from the borrower. The concessions granted vary by program and by borrower-specific characteristics, and may include interest rate reductions, term extensions, payment deferrals, principal forgiveness, or the acceptance of equity or other assets in lieu of payments.

Such modifications are accounted for and reported as TDRs. A loan that has been modified in a TDR is generally considered to be impaired until it matures, is repaid, or is otherwise liquidated, regardless of whether the borrower performs under the modified terms. In certain limited cases, the effective interest rate applicable to the modified loan is at or above the current market rate at the time of the restructuring. In such circumstances, and assuming that the loan subsequently performs under its modified terms and

the Firm

expects to collect all contractual principal and interest cash flows, the loan is disclosed as impaired and as a TDR only during the year of the modification; in subsequent years, the loan is not disclosed as an impaired loan or as a TDR so long as repayment of the restructured loan under its modified terms is reasonably assured.

Loans, except for credit card loans, modified in a TDR are generally placed on nonaccrual status, although in many cases such loans were already on nonaccrual status prior to modification. These loans may be returned to performing status (the accrual of interest is resumed) if the following criteria are met: (i) the borrower has performed under the modified terms for a minimum of

six months

and/or

six

payments, and (ii)

the Firm

has an expectation that repayment of the modified loan is reasonably assured based on, for example, the borrower’s debt capacity and level of future earnings, collateral values, LTV ratios, and other current market considerations. In certain limited and well-defined circumstances in which the loan is current at the modification date, such loans are not placed on nonaccrual status at the time of modification.

Because loans modified in TDRs are considered to be impaired, these loans are measured for impairment using

the Firm’s

established asset-specific allowance methodology, which considers the expected re-default rates for the modified loans. A loan modified in a TDR generally remains subject to the asset-specific allowance methodology throughout its remaining life, regardless of whether the loan is performing and has been returned to accrual status and/or the loan has been removed from the impaired loans disclosures (i.e., loans restructured at market rates).

Refer to Note


for further discussion of the methodology used to estimate

the Firm’s

asset-specific allowance.

Foreclosed property

The Firm

acquires property from borrowers through loan restructurings, workouts, and foreclosures. Property acquired may include real property (e.g., residential real estate, land, and buildings) and commercial and personal property (e.g., automobiles, aircraft, railcars, and ships).

The Firm

recognizes foreclosed property upon receiving assets in satisfaction of a loan (e.g., by taking legal title or physical possession). For loans collateralized by real property,

the Firm

generally recognizes the asset received at foreclosure sale or upon the execution of a deed in lieu of foreclosure transaction with the borrower. Foreclosed assets are reported in other assets on the Consolidated balance sheets and initially recognized at fair value less costs to sell. Each quarter the fair value of the acquired property is reviewed and adjusted, if necessary, to the lower of cost or fair value. Subsequent adjustments to fair value are charged/credited to noninterest revenue. Operating expense, such as real estate taxes and maintenance, are charged to other expense.

Loan portfolio

The Firm’s

loan portfolio is divided into three portfolio segments, which are the same segments used by

the Firm

to determine the allowance for loan losses: Consumer, excluding credit card; Credit card; and Wholesale. Within each portfolio segment

the Firm

monitors and assesses the credit risk in the following classes of loans, based on the risk characteristics of each loan class.

(a)

Includes loans held in CCB,

scored prime mortgage and scored home equity loans held in

AWM

and scored prime mortgage loans held in

Corporate

.

(b)

Predominantly includes prime loans (including option ARMs).

(c)

Includes senior and junior lien home equity loans.

(d)

Includes certain business banking and auto dealer risk-rated loans for which the wholesale methodology is applied for determining the allowance for loan losses; these loans are managed by CCB, and therefore, for consistency in presentation, are included with the other consumer loan classes.

(e)

Predominantly includes Business Banking loans.

(f)

Includes loans held in CIB, CB, AWM and Corporate. Excludes scored prime mortgage and scored home equity loans held in AWM and scored prime mortgage loans held in Corporate. Classes are internally defined and may not align with regulatory definitions.

(g)

Includes loans to: individuals and individual entities (predominantly consists of Wealth Management clients within AWM and includes loans to personal investment companies and personal and testamentary trusts), SPEs and Private education and civic organizations. Refer to Note


for more information on SPEs.

The following tables summarize

the Firm’s

loan balances by portfolio segment.

(a)

Includes accrued interest and fees net of an allowance for the uncollectible portion of accrued interest and fee income.

(b)

Loans (other than PCI loans and those for which the fair value option has been elected) are presented net of unamortized discounts and premiums and net deferred loan fees or costs. These amounts were not material as of

The following tables provide information about the carrying value of retained loans purchased, sold and reclassified to held-for-sale during the periods indicated. Reclassifications of loans to held-for sale are non-cash transactions.

The Firm

manages its exposure to credit risk on an ongoing basis. Selling loans is one way that

the Firm

reduces its credit exposures. Loans that were reclassified to held-for-sale and sold in a subsequent period are excluded from the sales line of this table.

(a)

Purchases predominantly represent the Firm’s voluntary repurchase of certain delinquent loans from loan pools as permitted by Government National Mortgage Association (“Ginnie Mae”) guidelines. The Firm typically elects to repurchase these delinquent loans as it continues to service them and/or manage the foreclosure process in accordance with applicable requirements of Ginnie Mae, FHA, RHS, and/or VA.

Consumer, excluding credit card, loan portfolio

Consumer loans, excluding credit card loans, consist primarily of residential mortgages, home equity loans and lines of credit, auto loans and consumer and business banking loans, with a focus on serving the prime consumer credit market. The portfolio also includes home equity loans secured by junior liens, prime mortgage loans with an interest-only payment period, and certain payment-option loans that may result in negative amortization.

The following table provides information about retained consumer loans, excluding credit card, by class.

Delinquency rates are a primary credit quality indicator for consumer loans. Loans that are more than

30 days

past due provide an early warning of borrowers who may be experiencing financial difficulties and/or who may be unable or unwilling to repay the loan. As the loan continues to age, it becomes more clear whether the borrower is likely either unable or unwilling to pay. In the case of residential real estate loans, late-stage delinquencies (greater than

150 days

past due) are a strong indicator of loans that will ultimately result in a foreclosure or similar liquidation transaction. In addition to delinquency rates, other credit quality indicators for consumer loans vary based on the class of loan, as follows:

•

For residential real estate loans, including both non-PCI and PCI portfolios, the current estimated LTV ratio, or the combined LTV ratio in the case of junior lien loans, is an indicator of the potential loss severity in the event of default. Additionally, LTV or combined LTV ratios can provide insight into a borrower’s continued willingness to pay, as the delinquency rate of high-LTV loans tends to be greater than that for loans where the borrower has equity in the collateral. The geographic distribution of the loan collateral also provides insight as to the credit quality of the portfolio, as factors such as the regional economy, home price changes and specific events such as natural disasters, will affect credit quality. The borrower’s current or “refreshed” FICO score is a secondary credit quality indicator for certain loans, as FICO scores are an indication of the borrower’s credit payment history. Thus, a loan to a borrower with a low FICO score (less than


) is considered to be of higher risk than a loan to a borrower with a higher FICO score. Further, a loan to a borrower with a high LTV ratio and a low FICO score is at greater risk of default than a loan to a borrower that has both a high LTV ratio and a high FICO score.

•

For scored auto and scored business banking loans, geographic distribution is an indicator of the credit performance of the portfolio. Similar to residential real estate loans, geographic distribution provides insights into the portfolio performance based on regional economic activity and events.

•

Risk-rated business banking and auto loans are similar to wholesale loans in that the primary credit quality indicators are the internal risk ratings that are assigned to the loan and whether the loans are considered to be criticized and/or nonaccrual. Risk ratings are reviewed on a regular and ongoing basis by Credit Risk Management and are adjusted as necessary for updated information about borrowers’ ability to fulfill their obligations. Refer to

page 234

of this Note for further information about risk-rated wholesale loan credit quality indicators.

Represents the aggregate unpaid principal balance of loans divided by the estimated current property value. Current property values are estimated, at a minimum, quarterly, based on home valuation models using nationally recognized home price index valuation estimates incorporating actual data to the extent available and forecasted data where actual data is not available. These property values do not represent actual appraised loan level collateral values; as such, the resulting ratios are necessarily imprecise and should be viewed as estimates. Current estimated combined LTV for junior lien home equity loans considers all available lien positions, as well as unused lines, related to the property.

Notes to consolidated financial statements

Approximately


%

of the home equity portfolio are senior lien loans; the remaining balance are junior lien HELOANs or HELOCs. The following table provides

the Firm’s

delinquency statistics for junior lien home equity loans and lines as of

December 31, 2019

and


.

(a) These HELOCs are predominantly revolving loans for a


-year period, after which time the HELOC converts to a loan with a


-year amortization period, but also include HELOCs that allow interest-only payments beyond the revolving period.

(b) The Firm manages the risk of HELOCs during their revolving period by closing or reducing the undrawn line to the extent permitted by law when borrowers are experiencing financial difficulty.

HELOCs

beyond the revolving period and

HELOANs

have higher delinquency rates than HELOCs within the revolving period. That is primarily because the fully-amortizing payment that is generally required for those products is higher than the minimum payment options

available for HELOCs within the revolving period. The higher delinquency rates associated with amortizing HELOCs and HELOANs are factored into

the Firm’s

allowance for loan losses.

Impaired loans

The table below provides information about

the Firm’s

residential real estate impaired loans, excluding PCI loans. These loans are considered to be impaired as they have been modified in a TDR. All impaired loans are evaluated for an asset-specific allowance as described in Note


.

(a)

Represents collateral-dependent residential real estate loans that are charged off to the fair value of the underlying collateral less costs to sell. The Firm reports, in accordance with regulatory guidance, residential real estate loans that have been discharged under Chapter 7 bankruptcy and not reaffirmed by the borrower (“Chapter 7 loans”) as collateral-dependent nonaccrual TDRs, regardless of their delinquency status. At

December 31, 2019

, Chapter 7 residential real estate loans included approximately


%

of residential mortgages and approximately


%

of home equity that were

30 days

or more past due.

(b)

At

December 31, 2019

and


,

$


million

and

$

4.1

billion

, respectively, of loans modified subsequent to repurchase from Ginnie Mae in accordance with the standards of the appropriate government agency (i.e., FHA, VA, RHS) are not included in the table above. When such loans perform subsequent to modification in accordance with Ginnie Mae guidelines, they are generally sold back into Ginnie Mae loan pools. Modified loans that do not re-perform become subject to foreclosure.

(c)

Predominantly all impaired loans in the table above are in the U.S.

(d)

Represents the contractual amount of principal owed at

December 31, 2019

and


. The unpaid principal balance differs from the impaired loan balances due to various factors including charge-offs, net deferred loan fees or costs, and unamortized discounts or premiums on purchased loans.

(e)

As of

JPMorgan Chase & Co./2019 Form 10-K

The following table presents average impaired loans and the related interest income reported by

the Firm.

(a)

Generally, interest income on loans modified in TDRs is recognized on a cash basis until the borrower has made a minimum of

six

payments under the new terms, unless the loan is deemed to be collateral-dependent.

Loan modifications

Modifications of residential real estate loans, excluding PCI loans, are generally accounted for and reported as TDRs. There were no additional commitments to lend to borrowers whose residential real estate loans, excluding PCI loans, have been modified in TDRs.

The following table presents new TDRs reported by

the Firm.

Nature and extent of modifications

The Firm’s

proprietary modification programs as well as government programs, including U.S. GSEs, generally provide various concessions to financially troubled borrowers including, but not limited to, interest rate reductions, term or payment extensions and deferral of principal and/or interest payments that would otherwise have been required under the terms of the original agreement.

The following table provides information about how residential real estate loans, excluding PCI loans, were modified under

the Firm’s

loss mitigation programs described above during the periods presented. This table excludes Chapter 7 loans where the sole concession granted is the discharge of debt.

(a)

Represents concessions granted in permanent modifications as a percentage of the number of loans permanently modified. The sum of the percentages exceeds


%

because predominantly all of the modifications include more than one type of concession. Concessions offered on trial modifications are generally consistent with those granted on permanent modifications.

Financial effects of modifications and redefaults

The following table provides information about the financial effects of the various concessions granted in modifications of residential real estate loans, excluding PCI, under the loss mitigation programs described above and about redefaults of certain loans modified in TDRs for the periods presented. The following table presents only the financial effects of permanent modifications and does not include temporary concessions offered through trial modifications. This table also excludes Chapter 7 loans where the sole concession granted is the discharge of debt.

(a)

Represents loans permanently modified in TDRs that experienced a payment default in the periods presented, and for which the payment default occurred within

one year

of the modification. The dollar amounts presented represent the balance of such loans at the end of the reporting period in which such loans defaulted. For residential real estate loans modified in TDRs, payment default is deemed to occur when the loan becomes

two

contractual payments past due. In the event that a modified loan redefaults, it is probable that the loan will ultimately be liquidated through foreclosure or another similar type of liquidation transaction. Redefaults of loans modified within the last


months

may not be representative of ultimate redefault levels.

At

December 31, 2019

,

the weighted-average estimated remaining lives of residential real estate loans, excluding PCI loans, permanently modified in TDRs were


years for residential mortgage and


years for home equity. The estimated remaining lives of these loans reflect estimated prepayments, both voluntary and involuntary (i.e., foreclosures and other forced liquidations).

Purchased credit-impaired loans

PCI loans are initially recorded at fair value at acquisition. PCI loans acquired in the same fiscal quarter may be aggregated into one or more pools, provided that the loans have common risk characteristics. A pool is then accounted for as a single asset with a single composite interest rate and an aggregate expectation of cash flows. All of

the Firm’s

residential real estate PCI loans were acquired in the same fiscal quarter and aggregated into pools of loans with common risk characteristics.

On a quarterly basis,

the Firm

estimates the total cash flows (both principal and interest) expected to be collected over the remaining life of each pool. These estimates incorporate assumptions regarding default rates, loss severities, the amounts and timing of prepayments and other factors that reflect then-current market conditions. Probable decreases in expected cash flows (i.e., increased credit losses) trigger the recognition of impairment, which is then measured as the present value of the expected principal loss plus any related forgone interest cash flows, discounted at the pool’s effective interest rate. Impairments are recognized through the provision for credit losses and an increase in the allowance for loan losses. Probable and significant increases in expected cash flows (e.g., decreased credit losses, the net benefit of modifications) would first reverse any previously recorded allowance for loan losses with any remaining increases recognized prospectively as a yield adjustment over the remaining estimated lives of the underlying loans. The impacts of (i) prepayments, (ii) changes in variable interest rates, and (iii) any other changes in the timing of expected cash flows are generally recognized prospectively as adjustments to interest income.

The Firm

continues to modify certain PCI loans. The impact of these modifications is incorporated into

the Firm’s

quarterly assessment of whether a probable and significant change in expected cash flows has occurred, and the loans continue to be accounted for and reported as PCI loans. In evaluating the effect of modifications on expected cash flows,

the Firm

incorporates the effect of any forgone interest and also considers the potential for redefault.

The Firm

develops product-specific probability of default estimates, which are used to compute expected credit losses. In developing these probabilities of default,

the Firm

considers the relationship between the credit quality characteristics of the underlying loans and certain assumptions about home prices and unemployment based upon industry-wide data.

The Firm

also considers its own historical loss experience to-date based on actual redefaulted modified PCI loans.

The excess of cash flows expected to be collected over the carrying value of the underlying loans is referred to as the accretable yield. This amount is not reported on

the Firm’s

Consolidated balance sheets but is accreted into interest income at a level rate of return over the remaining estimated lives of the underlying pools of loans.

Since the timing and amounts of expected cash flows for

the Firm’s

PCI consumer loan pools are reasonably estimable, interest is being accreted and the loan pools are being reported as performing loans.

No interest would be accreted and the PCI loan pools would be reported as nonaccrual loans if the timing and/or amounts of expected cash flows on the loan pools were determined not to be reasonably estimable.

The liquidation of PCI loans, which may include sales of loans, receipt of payment in full from the borrower, or foreclosure, results in removal of the loans from the underlying PCI pool. When the amount of the liquidation proceeds (e.g., cash, real estate), if any, is less than the unpaid principal balance of the loan, the difference is first applied against the PCI pool’s nonaccretable difference for principal losses (i.e., the lifetime credit loss estimate established as a purchase accounting adjustment at the acquisition date). When the nonaccretable difference for a particular loan pool has been fully depleted, any excess of the unpaid principal balance of the loan over the liquidation proceeds is written off against the PCI pool’s allowance for loan losses. Write-offs of PCI loans also include other adjustments, primarily related to principal forgiveness modifications. Because

the Firm’s

PCI loans are accounted for at a pool level,

the Firm

does not recognize charge-offs of PCI loans when they reach specified stages of delinquency (i.e., unlike non-PCI consumer loans, these loans are not charged off based on FFIEC standards).

The PCI portfolio affects

the Firm’s

results of operations primarily through: (i) contribution to net interest margin; (ii) expense related to defaults and servicing resulting from the liquidation of the loans; and (iii) any provision for loan losses.

Credit card loan portfolio

The credit card portfolio segment includes credit card loans originated and purchased by

the Firm.

Delinquency rates are the primary credit quality indicator for credit card loans as they provide an early warning that borrowers may be experiencing difficulties

(

30 days

past due); information on those borrowers that have been delinquent for a longer period of time

(

90 days

past due) is also considered. In addition to delinquency rates, the geographic distribution of the loans provides insight as to the credit quality of the portfolio based on the regional economy.

While the borrower’s credit score is another general indicator of credit quality,

the Firm

does not view credit scores as a primary indicator of credit quality because the borrower’s credit score tends to be a lagging indicator. The distribution of such scores provides a general indicator of credit quality trends within the portfolio; however, the score does not capture all factors that would be predictive of future credit performance. Refreshed FICO score information, which is obtained at least quarterly, for a statistically significant random sample of the credit card portfolio is indicated in the following table. FICO is considered to be the industry benchmark for credit scores.

The Firm

generally originates new card accounts to prime consumer borrowers.

However, certain cardholders’ FICO scores may decrease over time, depending on the performance of the cardholder and changes in the credit score calculation.

Loan modifications

The Firm

may offer one of a number of loan modification programs to credit card borrowers who are experiencing financial difficulty. Most of the credit card loans have been modified under long-term programs for borrowers who are experiencing financial difficulties.

These modifications involve placing the customer on a fixed payment plan, generally for


months

, and typically include reducing the interest rate on the credit card.

Substantially all modifications are considered to be TDRs.

If the cardholder does not comply with the modified payment terms, then the credit card loan continues to age and will ultimately be charged-off in accordance with

the Firm’s

standard charge-off policy. In most cases,

the Firm

does not reinstate the borrower’s line of credit.

Wholesale loan portfolio

Wholesale loans include loans made to a variety of clients, ranging from large corporate and institutional clients to high-net-worth individuals.

The primary credit quality indicator for wholesale loans is the internal risk rating assigned to each loan. Risk ratings are used to identify the credit quality of loans and differentiate risk within the portfolio. Risk ratings on loans consider the

PD and the LGD.

The PD is the likelihood that a loan will default. The LGD is the estimated loss on the loan that would be realized upon the default of the borrower and takes into consideration collateral and structural support for each credit facility.

Management considers several factors to determine an appropriate internal risk rating, including the obligor’s debt capacity and financial flexibility, the level of the obligor’s earnings, the amount and sources for repayment, the level and nature of contingencies, management strength, and the industry and geography in which the obligor operates.

The Firm’s

internal risk ratings generally align with the qualitative characteristics (e.g., borrower capacity to meet financial commitments and vulnerability to changes in the economic environment) defined by S&P and Moody’s, however the quantitative characteristics (e.g., PDs and LGDs) may differ as they reflect internal historical experiences and assumptions.

The Firm

considers internal ratings equivalent to BBB-/Baa3 or higher as investment grade, and these ratings have a lower PD and/or lower LGD than non-investment grade ratings.

Noninvestment-grade ratings are further classified as noncriticized and criticized, and the criticized portion is further subdivided into performing and nonaccrual loans, representing management’s assessment of the collectibility of principal and interest. Criticized loans have a higher PD than noncriticized loans.

The Firm’s

definition of criticized aligns with the U.S. banking regulatory definition of criticized exposures, which consist of special mention, substandard and doubtful categories

.

Risk ratings are reviewed on a regular and ongoing basis by Credit Risk Management and are adjusted as necessary for updated information affecting the obligor’s ability to fulfill its obligations.

As noted above, the risk rating of a loan considers the industry in which the obligor conducts its operations. As part of the overall credit risk management framework,

the Firm

focuses on the management and diversification of its industry and client exposures, with particular attention paid to industries with actual or potential credit concern. Refer to Note


for further detail on industry concentrations.

Allowance for credit losses

JPMorgan Chase

’s

allowance for loan losses represents management’s estimate of probable credit losses inherent in the

Firm’s

retained loan portfolio, which consists of the two consumer portfolio segments (primarily scored) and the wholesale portfolio segment (risk-rated).

The allowance for loan losses includes a formula-based component, an asset-specific component, and a component related to PCI loans, as described below. Management also estimates an allowance for wholesale and certain consumer lending-related commitments using methodologies similar to those used to estimate the allowance on the underlying loans.

The Firm’s

policies used to determine its allowance for credit losses are described in the following paragraphs.

Determining the appropriateness of the allowance is complex and requires judgment by management about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Subsequent evaluations of the loan portfolio, in light of the factors then prevailing, may result in significant changes in the allowances for loan losses and lending-related commitments in future periods. At least quarterly, the allowance for credit losses is reviewed by the CRO, the

CFO

and the Controller of

the Firm. As of

December 31, 2019

, JPMorgan Chase

deemed the allowance for credit losses to be appropriate and sufficient to absorb probable credit losses inherent in the portfolio.

Formula-based component

The formula-based component is based on a statistical calculation to provide for incurred credit losses in all consumer loans and performing risk-rated loans. All loans restructured in TDRs as well as any impaired risk-rated loans have an allowance assessed as part of the asset-specific component, while PCI loans have an allowance assessed as part of the PCI component. Refer to Note


for more information on TDRs, Impaired loans and PCI loans.

Formula-based component - Consumer loans and certain lending-related commitments

The formula-based allowance for credit losses for the consumer portfolio segments is calculated by applying statistical credit loss factors (estimated PD and loss severities) to the recorded investment balances or loan-equivalent amounts of pools of loan exposures with similar risk characteristics over a loss emergence period to arrive at an estimate of incurred credit losses. Estimated loss emergence periods may vary by product and may change over time; management applies judgment in estimating loss emergence periods, using available credit information and trends. In addition, management applies judgment to the statistical loss estimates for each loan portfolio category, using delinquency trends and other risk characteristics to estimate the total incurred credit losses in the portfolio. Management uses additional statistical methods and considers actual portfolio performance, including actual losses recognized on defaulted loans and collateral valuation trends, to review the appropriateness of the primary statistical loss estimate. The economic impact of

potential modifications of residential real estate loans is not included in the statistical calculation because of the uncertainty regarding the type and results of such modifications.

The statistical calculation is then adjusted to take into consideration model imprecision, external factors and current economic events that have occurred but that are not yet reflected in the factors used to derive the statistical calculation; these adjustments are accomplished in part by analyzing the historical loss experience for each major product segment. However, it is difficult to predict whether historical loss experience is indicative of future loss levels. Management applies judgment in making this adjustment, taking into account uncertainties associated with current macroeconomic and political conditions, quality of underwriting standards, borrower behavior, and other relevant internal and external factors affecting the credit quality of the portfolio. In certain instances, the interrelationships between these factors create further uncertainties. The application of different inputs into the statistical calculation, and the assumptions used by management to adjust the statistical calculation, are subject to management judgment, and emphasizing one input or assumption over another, or considering other inputs or assumptions, could affect the estimate of the allowance for credit losses for the consumer credit portfolio.

Overall, the allowance for credit losses for consumer portfolios is sensitive to changes in the economic environment (e.g., unemployment rates), delinquency rates, the realizable value of collateral (e.g., housing prices), FICO scores, borrower behavior and other risk factors. While all of these factors are important determinants of overall allowance levels, changes in the various factors may not occur at the same time or at the same rate, or changes may be directionally inconsistent such that improvement in one factor may offset deterioration in another. In addition, changes in these factors would not necessarily be consistent across all geographies or product types. Finally, it is difficult to predict the extent to which changes in these factors would ultimately affect the frequency of losses, the severity of losses or both.

Notes to consolidated financial statements

Formula-based component - Wholesale loans and lending-related commitments

The Firm’s

methodology for determining the allowance for loan losses and the allowance for lending-related commitments involves the early identification of credits that are deteriorating. The formula-based component of the allowance for wholesale loans and lending-related commitments is calculated by applying statistical credit loss factors (estimated PD and LGD) to the recorded investment balances or loan-equivalent over a loss emergence period to arrive at an estimate of incurred credit losses in the portfolio. Estimated loss emergence periods may vary by the funded versus unfunded status of the instrument and may change over time.

The Firm

assesses the credit quality of a borrower or counterparty and assigns an internal risk rating. Risk ratings are assigned at origination or acquisition, and if necessary, adjusted for changes in credit quality over the life of the exposure. In assessing the risk rating of a particular loan or lending-related commitment, among the factors considered are the obligor’s debt capacity and financial flexibility, the level of the obligor’s earnings, the amount and sources for repayment, the level and nature of contingencies, management strength, and the industry and geography in which the obligor operates. These factors are based on an evaluation of historical and current information and involve subjective assessment and interpretation. Determining risk ratings involves significant judgment; emphasizing one factor over another or considering additional factors could affect the risk rating assigned by

the Firm.

A PD estimate is determined based on the

Firm’s

history of defaults over more than one credit cycle.

LGD estimate is a judgment-based estimate assigned to each loan or lending-related commitment. The estimate represents the amount of economic loss if the obligor were to default. The type of obligor, quality of collateral, and the seniority of

the Firm’s

lending exposure in the obligor’s capital structure affect LGD.

The Firm

applies judgment in estimating PD, LGD, loss emergence period and loan-equivalent used in calculating the allowance for credit losses.

Estimates of PD, LGD, loss emergence period and loan-equivalent used are subject to periodic refinement based on any changes to underlying external or

Firm-

specific historical data. Changes to the time period used for PD and LGD estimates could also affect the allowance for credit losses. The use of different inputs, estimates or methodologies could change the amount of the allowance for credit losses determined appropriate by

the Firm.

In addition to the statistical credit loss estimates applied to the wholesale portfolio, management applies its judgment to adjust the statistical estimates for wholesale loans and lending-related commitments, taking into consideration model imprecision, external factors and economic events that have occurred but are not yet reflected in the loss

factors. Historical experience of both LGD and PD are considered when estimating these adjustments. Factors related to concentrated and deteriorating industries also are incorporated where relevant. These estimates are based on management’s view of uncertainties that relate to current macroeconomic conditions, quality of underwriting standards and other relevant internal and external factors affecting the credit quality of the current portfolio.

Asset-specific component

The asset-specific component of the allowance relates to loans considered to be impaired, which includes loans that have been modified in TDRs as well as risk-rated loans that have been placed on nonaccrual status. To determine the asset-specific component of the allowance, larger risk-rated loans (primarily loans in the wholesale portfolio segment) are evaluated individually, while smaller loans (both risk-rated and scored) are evaluated as pools using historical loss experience for the respective class of assets.

The Firm

generally measures the asset-specific allowance as the difference between the recorded investment in the loan and the present value of the cash flows expected to be collected, discounted at the loan’s original effective interest rate. Subsequent changes in impairment are reported as an adjustment to the allowance for loan losses. In certain cases, the asset-specific allowance is determined using an observable market price, and the allowance is measured as the difference between the recorded investment in the loan and the loan’s fair value. Collateral-dependent loans are charged down to the fair value of collateral less costs to sell. For any of these impaired loans, the amount of the asset-specific allowance required to be recorded, if any, is dependent upon the recorded investment in the loan (including prior charge-offs), and either the expected cash flows or fair value of collateral. Refer to Note


for more information about charge-offs and collateral-dependent loans.

The asset-specific component of the allowance for impaired loans that have been modified in TDRs (including forgone interest, principal forgiveness, as well as other concessions) incorporates the effect of the modification on the loan’s expected cash flows, which considers the potential for redefault. For residential real estate loans modified in TDRs,

the Firm

develops product-specific probability of default estimates, which are applied at a loan level to compute expected losses. In developing these probabilities of default,

the Firm

considers the relationship between the credit quality characteristics of the underlying loans and certain assumptions about home prices and unemployment, based upon industry-wide data.

The Firm

also considers its own historical loss experience to-date based on actual redefaulted modified loans. For credit card loans modified in TDRs, expected losses incorporate projected redefaults based on

the Firm’s

historical experience by type of modification program. For wholesale loans modified in TDRs, expected losses incorporate management’s expectation of the borrower’s ability to repay under the modified terms.


JPMorgan Chase & Co./2019 Form 10-K

Estimating the timing and amounts of future cash flows is highly judgmental as these cash flow projections rely upon estimates such as loss severities, asset valuations, default rates (including redefault rates on modified loans), the amounts and timing of interest or principal payments (including any expected prepayments) or other factors that are reflective of current and expected market conditions. These estimates are, in turn, dependent on factors such as the duration of current overall economic conditions, industry-, portfolio-, or borrower-specific factors, the expected outcome of insolvency proceedings as well as, in certain circumstances, other economic factors, including the level of future home prices. All of these estimates and assumptions require significant management judgment and certain assumptions are highly subjective.

PCI loans

In connection with the acquisition of certain PCI loans, which are accounted for as described in Note


,

the allowance for loan losses for the PCI portfolio is based on quarterly estimates of the amount of principal and interest cash flows expected to be collected over the estimated remaining lives of the loans.

These cash flow projections are based on estimates regarding default rates (including redefault rates on modified loans), loss severities, the amounts and timing of prepayments and other factors that are reflective of current and expected future market conditions. These estimates are dependent on assumptions regarding the level of future home prices, and the duration of current overall economic conditions, among other factors. These estimates and assumptions require significant management judgment and certain assumptions are highly subjective.

Allowance for credit losses and related information

The table below summarizes information about the allowances for loan losses and lending-relating commitments, and includes a breakdown of loans and lending-related commitments by impairment methodology.

(a)

Write-offs of PCI loans are recorded against the allowance for loan losses when actual losses for a pool exceed estimated losses that were recorded as purchase accounting adjustments at the time of acquisition. A write-off of a PCI loan is recognized when the underlying loan is removed from a pool.

(b)

Includes risk-rated loans that have been placed on nonaccrual status and loans that have been modified in a TDR.

(c)

The asset-specific credit card allowance for loan losses is related to loans that have been modified in a TDR; such allowance is calculated based on the loans’ original contractual interest rates and does not consider any incremental penalty rates.

Variable interest entities

Refer to Note


on page


for a further description of

JPMorgan Chase’s

accounting policies regarding consolidation of VIEs.

The following table summarizes the most significant types of

Firm

-sponsored VIEs by

business segment. The Firm

considers a “sponsored” VIE to include any entity where: (1)

JPMorgan Chase

is the primary beneficiary of the structure; (2) the VIE is used by

JPMorgan Chase

to securitize

Firm

assets; (3) the VIE issues financial instruments with the

JPMorgan Chase

name; or (4) the entity is a

JPMorgan Chase

–administered asset-backed commercial paper conduit.

The Firm’s other business segments

are also involved with VIEs (both third-party and

Firm

-sponsored), but to a lesser extent, as follows:

•

Asset & Wealth Management: AWM sponsors and manages certain funds that are deemed VIEs. As asset manager of the funds, AWM earns a fee based on assets managed; the fee varies with each fund’s investment objective and is competitively priced. For fund entities that qualify as VIEs, AWM’s interests are, in certain cases, considered to be significant variable interests that result in consolidation of the financial results of these entities.

•

Commercial Banking: CB

provides financing and lending-related services to a wide spectrum of clients, including certain third-party-sponsored entities that may meet the definition of a VIE.

CB

does not control the activities of these entities and does not consolidate these entities.

CB’s

maximum loss exposure, regardless of whether the entity is a VIE, is generally limited to loans and lending-related commitments which are reported and disclosed in the same manner as any other third-party transaction.

•

Corporate

:

Corporate is involved with entities that may meet the definition of VIEs; however these entities are generally subject to specialized investment company accounting, which does not require the consolidation of investments, including VIEs. In addition, Treasury and CIO invest in securities generally issued by third parties which may meet the definition of VIEs (e.g., issuers of asset-backed securities). In general, the Firm does not have the power to direct the significant activities of these entities and therefore does not consolidate these entities. Refer to Note


for further information on the Firm’s investment securities portfolio.

In addition,

CIB

also invests in and provides financing and other services to VIEs sponsored by third parties. Refer to

page 247

of this Note

for more information on the VIEs sponsored by third parties.

Significant Firm-sponsored variable interest entities

Credit card securitizations

CCB’s Card business

may securitize originated credit card loans, primarily through the Chase Issuance Trust (the “Trust”).

The Firm’s

continuing involvement in credit card securitizations includes servicing the receivables, retaining an undivided seller’s interest in the receivables, retaining certain senior and subordinated securities and maintaining escrow accounts.

The Firm is

considered to be the primary beneficiary of these

Firm-

sponsored credit card securitization trusts based on

the Firm’s

ability to direct the activities of these VIEs through its servicing responsibilities and other duties, including making decisions as to the receivables that are transferred into those trusts and as to any related modifications and workouts. Additionally, the nature and extent of

the Firm’s

other continuing involvement with the trusts, as indicated above, obligates

the Firm

to absorb

losses and gives

the Firm

the right to receive certain benefits from these VIEs that could potentially be significant.

The underlying securitized credit card receivables and other assets of the securitization trusts are available only for payment of the beneficial interests issued by the securitization trusts; they are not available to pay

the Firm’s

other obligations or the claims of

the Firm’s

creditors.

The agreements with the credit card securitization trusts require

the Firm

to maintain a minimum undivided interest in the credit card trusts (generally

Notes to consolidated financial statements

Residential mortgage

The Firm

securitizes residential mortgage loans originated by

CCB,

as well as residential mortgage loans purchased from third parties by either

CCB or CIB. CCB

generally retains servicing for all residential mortgage loans

it

originated or purchased

,

and for certain mortgage loans purchased by

CIB.

For securitizations of loans serviced by

CCB, the Firm

has the power to direct the significant activities of the VIE because it is responsible for decisions related to loan modifications and workouts.

CCB

may also retain an interest upon securitization.

In addition,

CIB

engages in underwriting and trading activities involving securities issued by

Firm

-sponsored securitization trusts. As a result,

CIB

at times retains senior and/or subordinated interests (including residual interests and amounts required to be held pursuant to credit risk retention rules) in residential mortgage securitizations at the time of securitization, and/or reacquires positions in the secondary market in the normal course of business. In certain instances, as a result of the positions retained or reacquired by

CIB

or held by

CCB,

when considered together with the servicing arrangements entered into by

CCB, the Firm

is deemed to be the primary beneficiary of certain securitization trusts. Refer to the table on

page 246

of this Note for more information on consolidated residential mortgage securitizations.

The Firm

does not consolidate residential mortgage securitizations

(Firm

-sponsored or third-party-sponsored) when it is not the servicer (and therefore does not have the power to direct the most significant activities of the trust) or does not hold a beneficial interest in the trust that could potentially be significant to the trust.

Refer to the table on

page 246

of this Note for more information on the consolidated residential mortgage securitizations, and the table on the previous page of this Note for further information on interests held in nonconsolidated residential mortgage securitizations.

Commercial mortgages and other consumer securitizations

CIB

originates and securitizes commercial mortgage loans, and engages in underwriting and trading activities involving the securities issued by securitization trusts.

CIB

may retain unsold senior and/or subordinated interests (including amounts required to be held pursuant to credit risk retention rules) in commercial mortgage securitizations at the time of securitization but, generally,

the Firm

does not service commercial loan securitizations. For commercial mortgage securitizations the power to direct the significant activities of the VIE generally is held by the servicer or investors in a specified class of securities (“controlling class”).

The Firm

generally does not retain an interest in the controlling class in its sponsored commercial mortgage securitization transactions. Refer to the table on

page 246

of this Note for more information on the consolidated commercial mortgage securitizations,

and the table on the previous page of this Note for further information on interests held in nonconsolidated securitizations.

Re-securitizations

The Firm engages in certain re-securitization transactions in which debt securities are transferred to a VIE in exchange for new beneficial interests. These transfers occur in connection with both U.S. GSEs and government agency sponsored VIEs, which are backed by residential mortgages. The Firm’s consolidation analysis is largely dependent on the Firm’s role and interest in the re-securitization trusts.

The following table presents the principal amount of securities transferred to re-securitization VIEs.

Most re-securitizations with which the Firm is involved are client-driven transactions in which a specific client or group of clients is seeking a specific return or risk profile. For these transactions, the Firm has concluded that the decision-making power of the entity is shared between the Firm and its clients, considering the joint effort and decisions in establishing the re-securitization trust and its assets, as well as the significant economic interest the client holds in the re-securitization trust; therefore the Firm does not consolidate the re-securitization VIE.

The Firm did

no

t transfer any private label securities to re-securitization VIEs during 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively, and retained interests in any such Firm-sponsored VIEs as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 were immaterial.

Additionally, the Firm may invest in beneficial interests of third-party-sponsored re-securitizations and generally purchases these interests in the secondary market. In these circumstances, the Firm does not have the unilateral ability to direct the most significant activities of the re-securitization trust, either because it was not involved in the initial design of the trust, or the Firm is involved with an independent third-party sponsor and demonstrates shared power over the creation of the trust; therefore, the Firm does not consolidate the re-securitization VIE.


JPMorgan Chase & Co./2019 Form 10-K

The following table presents information on nonconsolidated re-securitization VIEs.

As of

and


, the Firm did not consolidate any U.S. GSE and government agency re-securitization VIEs or any Firm-sponsored private-label re-securitization VIEs.

Multi-seller conduits

Multi-seller conduit entities are separate bankruptcy remote entities that provide secured financing, collateralized by pools of receivables and other financial assets, to customers of

the Firm.

The conduits fund their financing facilities through the issuance of highly rated commercial paper. The primary source of repayment of the commercial paper is the cash flows from the pools of assets. In most instances, the assets are structured with deal-specific credit enhancements provided to the conduits by the customers (i.e., sellers) or other third parties. Deal-specific credit enhancements are generally structured to cover a multiple of historical losses expected on the pool of assets, and are typically in the form of overcollateralization provided by the seller. The deal-specific credit enhancements mitigate

the Firm’s

potential losses on its agreements with the conduits.

To ensure timely repayment of the commercial paper, and to provide the conduits with funding to provide financing to customers in the event that the conduits do not obtain funding in the commercial paper market, each asset pool financed by the conduits has a minimum 100% deal-specific liquidity facility associated with it provided by JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. also provides the multi-seller conduit vehicles with uncommitted program-wide liquidity facilities and program-wide credit enhancement in the form of standby letters of credit. The amount of program-wide credit enhancement required is based upon commercial paper issuance and approximates


%

of the outstanding balance of commercial paper.

The Firm

consolidates its

Firm

-administered multi-seller conduits, as

the Firm

has both the power to direct the significant activities of the conduits and a potentially significant economic interest in the conduits. As administrative agent and in its role in structuring transactions,

the Firm

makes decisions regarding asset types and credit quality, and manages the commercial paper funding needs of the conduits.

The Firm’s

interests that could potentially be significant to the VIEs include the fees received as administrative agent and liquidity and program-wide credit enhancement provider, as well as the potential exposure created by the liquidity and credit enhancement facilities provided to the conduits. Refer to

page 246

of this Note for further information on consolidated VIE assets and liabilities.

In the normal course of business,

JPMorgan Chase

makes markets in and invests in commercial paper issued by

the Firm

-administered multi-seller conduits.

The Firm

held

$

16.3

billion

and

$

20.1

December 31, 2019

and


,

respectively, which have been eliminated in consolidation.

The Firm’s

investments reflect

the Firm’s

funding needs and capacity and were not driven by market illiquidity.

Other than the amounts required to be held pursuant to credit risk retention rules,

the Firm

is not obligated under any agreement to purchase the commercial paper issued by

Municipal bond vehicles

Municipal bond vehicles or tender option bond (“TOB”) trusts allow institutions to finance their municipal bond investments at short-term rates. In a typical TOB transaction, the trust purchases highly rated municipal bond(s) of a single issuer and funds the purchase by issuing two types of securities: (1) puttable floating-rate certificates (“floaters”) and (2) inverse floating-rate residual interests (“residuals”). The floaters are typically purchased by money market funds or other short-term investors and may be tendered, with requisite notice, to the TOB trust. The residuals are retained by the investor seeking to finance its municipal bond investment.

TOB transactions where the residual is held by a third-party investor are typically known as customer TOB trusts, and non-customer TOB trusts are transactions where the Residual is retained by

the Firm.

Customer TOB trusts are sponsored by a third party; refer to page


of this Note for further information.

The Firm

serves as sponsor for all non-customer TOB transactions.

The Firm

may provide various services to a TOB trust, including

remarketing agent,

liquidity or tender option provider, and/or sponsor.

J.P. Morgan Securities LLC may serve as a remarketing agent on the floaters for TOB trusts. The remarketing agent is responsible for establishing the periodic variable rate on the floaters, conducting the initial placement and remarketing tendered floaters. The remarketing agent may, but is not obligated to, make markets in floaters. Floaters held by the Firm were not material during

JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. or J.P. Morgan Securities LLC

often serves as the sole liquidity or tender option provider for the TOB trusts. The liquidity provider’s obligation to

JPMorgan Chase & Co./2019 Form 10-K


Notes to consolidated financial statements

perform is conditional and is limited by certain events (“Termination Events”), which include bankruptcy or failure to pay by the municipal bond issuer or credit enhancement provider, an event of taxability on the municipal bonds or the immediate downgrade of the municipal bond to below investment grade. In addition, the liquidity provider’s exposure is typically further limited by the high credit quality of the underlying municipal bonds, the excess collateralization in the vehicle, or, in certain transactions, the reimbursement agreements with the Residual holders.

Holders of the floaters may “put,” or tender, their floaters to the TOB trust. If the remarketing agent cannot successfully remarket the floaters to another investor, the liquidity provider either provides a loan to the TOB trust for the TOB trust’s purchase of the floaters, or it directly purchases the tendered floaters.

TOB trusts are considered to be variable interest entities.

The Firm

consolidates non-customer TOB trusts because as the Residual holder,

the Firm

has the right to make decisions that significantly impact the economic performance of the municipal bond vehicle, and it has the right to receive benefits and bear losses that could potentially be significant to the municipal bond vehicle.

VIEs sponsored by third parties

The Firm

enters into transactions with VIEs structured by other parties. These include, for example, acting as a derivative counterparty, liquidity provider, investor, underwriter, placement agent, remarketing agent, trustee or custodian. These transactions are conducted at arm’s-length, and individual credit decisions are based on the analysis of the specific VIE, taking into consideration the quality of the underlying assets. Where

the Firm

does not have the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the VIE’s economic performance, or a variable interest that could potentially be significant,

the Firm

generally does not consolidate the VIE, but it records and reports these positions on its Consolidated balance sheets in the same manner it would record and report positions in respect of any other third-party transaction.

Tax credit vehicles

The Firm

holds investments in unconsolidated tax credit vehicles, which are limited partnerships and similar entities that own and operate affordable housing,

energy, and other projects.

These entities are primarily considered VIEs. A third party is typically the general partner or managing member and has control over the significant activities of the tax credit vehicles, and accordingly

the Firm

does not consolidate tax credit vehicles.

The Firm

generally invests in these partnerships as a limited partner and earns a return primarily through the receipt of tax credits allocated to the projects. The maximum loss exposure, represented by equity investments and funding commitments, was

$

19.1

Customer municipal bond vehicles (TOB trusts)

The Firm

may provide various services to customer TOB trusts, including

remarketing agent,

liquidity or tender option provider. In certain customer TOB transactions,

the Firm,

as liquidity provider, has entered into a reimbursement agreement with the Residual holder. In those transactions, upon the termination of the vehicle,

the Firm

has recourse to the third-party Residual holders for any shortfall.

The Firm

does not have any intent to protect Residual holders from potential losses on any of the underlying municipal bonds.

The Firm

does not consolidate customer TOB trusts, since

the Firm

does not have the power to make decisions that significantly impact the economic performance of the municipal bond vehicle.

Loan securitizations

The Firm

has securitized and sold a variety of loans, including residential mortgage, credit card, and commercial mortgage. The purposes of these securitization transactions were to satisfy investor demand and to generate liquidity for

the Firm.

For loan securitizations in which

the Firm

is not required to consolidate the trust,

the Firm

records the transfer of the loan receivable to the trust as a sale when all of the following accounting criteria for a sale are met: (1) the transferred financial assets are legally isolated from

the Firm’s

creditors; (2) the transferee or beneficial interest holder can pledge or exchange the transferred financial assets; and (3)

the Firm

does not maintain effective control over the transferred financial assets (e.g.,

the Firm

cannot repurchase the transferred assets before their maturity and it does not have the ability to unilaterally cause the holder to return the transferred assets).

For loan securitizations accounted for as a sale,

the Firm

recognizes a gain or loss based on the difference between the value of proceeds received (including cash, beneficial interests, or servicing assets received) and the carrying value of the assets sold. Gains and losses on securitizations are reported in noninterest revenue.

In addition to the amounts reported in the securitization activity tables above,

the Firm,

in the normal course of business, sells originated and purchased mortgage loans and certain originated excess MSRs on a nonrecourse basis, predominantly to U.S. GSEs. These loans and excess MSRs are sold primarily for the purpose of securitization by the U.S. GSEs, who provide certain guarantee provisions (e.g., credit enhancement of the loans).

The Firm

also sells loans into securitization transactions pursuant to Ginnie Mae guidelines; these loans are typically insured or guaranteed by another U.S. government agency.

The Firm

does not consolidate the securitization vehicles underlying these transactions as it is not the primary beneficiary. For a limited number of loan sales,

Goodwill and Mortgage servicing rights

Goodwill

Goodwill is recorded upon completion of a business combination as the difference between the purchase price and the fair value of the net assets acquired. Subsequent to initial recognition, goodwill is not amortized but is tested for impairment during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year, or more often if events or circumstances, such as adverse changes in the business climate, indicate there may be impairment.

The goodwill associated with each business combination is allocated to the related reporting units, which are determined based on how the Firm’s businesses are managed and how they are reviewed by the Firm’s Operating Committee.

The following table presents goodwill attributed to the business segments.

The following table presents changes in the carrying amount of goodwill.

(a)

For 2019, represents goodwill associated with the acquisition of InstaMed. This goodwill was allocated to CIB, CB and CCB. For 2017, represents CCB goodwill in connection with an acquisition.

(b)

Primarily relates to foreign currency adjustments.

Goodwill impairment testing

The Firm’s goodwill was

no

t impaired at

December 31, 2019

,


, and


.

The goodwill impairment test is performed in two steps. In the first step, the current fair value of

each reporting unit

is compared with its carrying value. If the fair value is in excess of the carrying value, then the

reporting unit’s

goodwill is considered not to be impaired. If the fair value is less than the carrying value, then a second step is performed. In the second step, the implied current fair value of the

reporting unit’s

goodwill is determined by comparing the fair value of

the reporting unit

(as determined in step one) to the fair value of the net assets of

the reporting unit,

as if

the reporting unit were

being acquired in a business combination. The resulting implied current fair value of goodwill is then compared with the carrying value of

the reporting unit’s

goodwill.

If the carrying value of the goodwill exceeds its implied current fair value, then an impairment charge is recognized for the excess. If the carrying value of goodwill is less than its implied current fair value, then no goodwill impairment is recognized.

The Firm uses the reporting units’ allocated capital plus goodwill and other intangible assets as a proxy for the carrying values of equity for the reporting units in the goodwill impairment testing. Reporting unit equity is determined on a similar basis as the allocation of capital to the LOBs which takes into consideration a variety of factors including capital levels of similarly rated peers and applicable regulatory capital requirements. Proposed LOB equity levels are incorporated into the Firm’s annual budget process, which is reviewed by the Firm’s Board of Directors. Allocated capital is further reviewed periodically and updated as needed.


JPMorgan Chase & Co./2019 Form 10-K

The primary method the Firm uses to estimate the fair value of its reporting units is the income approach. This approach projects cash flows for the forecast period and uses the perpetuity growth method to calculate terminal values. These cash flows and terminal values are then discounted using an appropriate discount rate. Projections of cash flows are based on the reporting units’ earnings forecasts which are reviewed with senior management of the Firm. The discount rate used for each reporting unit represents an estimate of the cost of equity for that reporting unit and is determined considering the Firm’s overall estimated cost of equity (estimated using the Capital Asset Pricing Model), as adjusted for the risk characteristics specific to each reporting unit (for example, for higher levels of risk or uncertainty associated with the business or management’s forecasts and assumptions). To assess the reasonableness of the discount rates used for each reporting unit management compares the discount rate to the estimated cost of equity for publicly traded institutions with similar businesses and risk characteristics. In addition, the weighted average cost of equity (aggregating the various reporting units) is compared with the Firm’s overall estimated cost of equity to ensure reasonableness.

The valuations derived from the discounted cash flow analysis are then compared with market-based trading and transaction multiples for relevant competitors. Trading and transaction comparables are used as general indicators to assess the general reasonableness of the estimated fair values, although precise conclusions generally cannot be drawn due to the differences that naturally exist between the Firm’s businesses and competitor institutions. Management also takes into consideration a comparison between the aggregate fair values of the Firm’s reporting units and JPMorgan Chase’s market capitalization. In evaluating this comparison, management considers several factors, including (i) a control premium that would exist in a market transaction, (ii) factors related to the level of execution risk that would exist at the firmwide level that do not exist at the reporting unit level and (iii) short-term market volatility and other factors that do not directly affect the value of individual reporting units.

Declines in business performance, increases in credit losses, increases in capital requirements, as well as deterioration in economic or market conditions, adverse regulatory or legislative changes or increases in the estimated market cost of equity, could cause the estimated fair values of

the Firm’s reporting units or their

associated goodwill to decline in the future, which could result in a material impairment charge to earnings in a future period related to some portion of the associated goodwill.

Mortgage servicing rights

MSRs represent the fair value of expected future cash flows for performing servicing activities for others. The fair value considers estimated future servicing fees and ancillary revenue, offset by estimated costs to service the loans, and generally declines over time as net servicing cash flows are received, effectively amortizing the MSR asset against contractual servicing and ancillary fee income. MSRs are either purchased from third parties or recognized upon sale or securitization of mortgage loans if servicing is retained.

As permitted by U.S. GAAP,

the Firm

has elected to account for its MSRs at fair value.

The Firm

treats its MSRs as a single class of servicing assets based on the availability of market inputs used to measure the fair value of its MSR asset and its treatment of MSRs as one aggregate pool for risk management purposes.

The Firm

estimates the fair value of MSRs using an option-adjusted spread (“OAS”) model, which projects MSR cash flows over multiple interest rate scenarios in conjunction with

the Firm’s

prepayment model, and then discounts these cash flows at risk-adjusted rates. The model considers portfolio characteristics, contractually specified servicing fees, prepayment assumptions, delinquency rates, costs to service, late charges and other ancillary revenue, and other economic factors.

The Firm

compares fair value estimates and assumptions to observable market data where available, and also considers recent market activity and actual portfolio experience.

JPMorgan Chase & Co./2019 Form 10-K


Notes to consolidated financial statements

The fair value of MSRs is sensitive to changes in interest rates, including their effect on prepayment speeds. MSRs typically decrease in value when interest rates decline because declining interest rates tend to increase prepayments and therefore reduce the expected life of the net servicing cash flows that comprise the MSR asset. Conversely, securities (e.g., mortgage-backed securities), principal-only certificates and certain derivatives (i.e.,

those for which

the Firm

receives fixed-rate interest payments) increase in value when interest rates decline.

JPMorgan Chase

uses combinations of derivatives and securities to manage the risk of changes in the fair value of MSRs. The intent is to offset any interest-rate related changes in the fair value of MSRs with changes in the fair value of the related risk management instruments.

The following table summarizes MSR activity for the years ended

December 31, 2019

,


and


.

(a)

Includes excess MSRs transferred to agency-sponsored trusts in exchange for stripped mortgage backed securities (“SMBS”). In each transaction, a portion of the SMBS was acquired by third parties at the transaction date; the Firm acquired the remaining balance of those SMBS as trading securities.

(b)

Represents both the impact of changes in estimated future prepayments due to changes in market interest rates, and the difference between actual and expected prepayments.

(c)

Represents changes in prepayments other than those attributable to changes in market interest rates.

(d)

Represents amounts the Firm pays as the servicer (e.g., scheduled principal and interest, taxes and insurance), which will generally be reimbursed within a short period of time after the advance from future cash flows from the trust or the underlying loans. The Firm’s credit risk associated with these servicer advances is minimal because reimbursement of the advances is typically senior to all cash payments to investors. In addition, the Firm maintains the right to stop payment to investors if the collateral is insufficient to cover the advance. However, certain of these servicer advances may not be recoverable if they were not made in accordance with applicable rules and agreements.

(e)

The decrease in projected cash flows was largely related to default servicing assumption updates.

and outlines the sensitivities of those fair values to immediate adverse changes in those assumptions, as defined below.

(a)

Includes the impact of operational risk and regulatory capital.

(b)

The prior period amount has been revised to conform with the current period presentation.

Changes in fair value based on variations in assumptions generally cannot be easily extrapolated, because the relationship of the change in the assumptions to the change in fair value are often highly interrelated and may not be linear. In this table, the effect that a change in a particular assumption may have on the fair value is calculated without changing any other assumption. In reality, changes in one factor may result in changes in another, which would either magnify or counteract the impact of the initial change.

Leases

Lease commitments

Effective January 1, 2019,

the Firm

adopted new guidance that requires lessees to recognize on the Consolidated balance sheets all leases with lease terms greater than twelve months as a lease liability with a corresponding right-of-use (“ROU”) asset. Accordingly,

the Firm

recognized operating lease liabilities and ROU assets of

$

8.2

billion

and

$

8.1

billion

,

respectively. The adoption of the new lease guidance did not have a material impact on

the Firm’s

Consolidated statements of income. The change in accounting due to the adoption of the new lease guidance did not result in a material change to the future net minimum rental payments/receivables or to the net rental expense when compared to December 31, 2018.

Firm as lessee

At December 31, 2019,

JPMorgan Chase

and its subsidiaries were obligated under a number of noncancelable leases, predominantly operating leases for premises and equipment used primarily for business purposes. These leases generally have terms of


years

or less, determined based on the contractual maturity of the lease, and include periods covered by options to extend or terminate the lease when

the Firm

is reasonably certain that it will exercise those options. None of these lease agreements impose restrictions on

the Firm’s

ability to pay dividends, engage in debt or equity financing transactions or enter into further lease agreements. Certain of these leases contain escalation clauses that will increase rental payments based on maintenance, utility and tax increases, which are non-lease components.

The Firm

elected not to separate lease and non-lease components of a contract for its real estate leases. As such, real estate lease payments represent payments on both lease and non-lease components.


JPMorgan Chase & Co./2019 Form 10-K

Operating lease liabilities and ROU assets are recognized at the lease commencement date based on the present value of the future minimum lease payments over the lease term. The future lease payments are discounted at a rate that represents

the Firm’s

collateralized borrowing rate for financing instruments of a similar term and are included in accounts payable and other liabilities. The operating lease ROU asset, included in premises and equipment, also includes any lease prepayments made, plus initial direct costs incurred, less any lease incentives received. Rental expense associated with operating leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term, and generally included in occupancy expense in the Consolidated statements of income.

.

Firm as lessor

The Firm

provides auto and equipment lease financing to its customers through lease arrangements with lease terms that may contain renewal, termination and/or purchase options. Generally,

the Firm’s

lease financings are operating leases. These assets are recognized in other assets on

the Firm’s

Consolidated balance sheets and are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the lease term to reduce the asset to its estimated residual value. Depreciation expense is included in technology, communications and equipment expense in the Consolidated statements of income.

The Firm’s

lease income is generally recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term and is included in other income in the Consolidated statements of income.

On a periodic basis,

the Firm

assesses leased assets for impairment, and if the carrying amount of the leased asset exceeds the undiscounted cash flows from the lease payments and the estimated residual value upon disposition of the leased asset, an impairment loss is recognized.

The risk of loss on auto and equipment leased assets relating to the residual value of the leased assets is monitored through projections of the asset residual values at lease origination and periodic review of residual values, and is mitigated through arrangements with certain manufacturers or lessees.

Management’s discussion and analysis

Note


–

Earnings per share

Basic earnings per share (“EPS”) is calculated using the two-class method. Under the two-class method, all earnings (distributed and undistributed) are allocated to common stock and participating securities.

JPMorgan Chase

grants RSUs under its share-based compensation programs, predominantly all of which entitle recipients to receive nonforfeitable dividends during the vesting period on a basis equivalent to dividends paid to holders of the Firm’s common stock. These unvested RSUs meet the definition of participating securities based on their respective rights to receive nonforfeitable dividends, and they are treated as a separate class of securities in computing basic EPS. Participating securities are not included as incremental shares in computing diluted EPS; refer to Note


for additional information.

Diluted EPS incorporates the potential impact of contingently issuable shares, including awards which require future service as a condition of delivery of the underlying common stock. Diluted EPS is calculated under both the two-class and treasury stock methods, and the more dilutive amount is reported. For each of the periods presented in the table below, diluted EPS calculated under the two-class method was more dilutive.

Income taxes

JPMorgan Chase and its eligible subsidiaries file a consolidated U.S. federal income tax return. JPMorgan Chase uses the asset and liability method to provide income taxes on all transactions recorded in the Consolidated Financial Statements. This method requires that income taxes reflect the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets or liabilities for book and tax purposes. Accordingly, a deferred tax asset or liability for each temporary difference is determined based on the tax rates that the Firm expects to be in effect when the underlying items of income and expense are realized. JPMorgan Chase’s expense for income taxes includes the current and deferred portions of that expense. A valuation allowance is established to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount the Firm expects to realize.

Due to the inherent complexities arising from the nature of

the Firm’s

businesses, and from conducting business and being taxed in a substantial number of jurisdictions, significant judgments and estimates are required to be made. Agreement of tax liabilities between

JPMorgan Chase

and the many tax jurisdictions in which

the Firm

files tax returns may not be finalized for several years. Thus,

the Firm’s

final tax-related assets and liabilities may ultimately be different from those currently reported.

Effective tax rate and expense

The following table presents a reconciliation of the applicable statutory U.S. federal income tax rate to the effective tax rate.

(a)

Predominantly includes earnings of U.K. subsidiaries that were deemed to be reinvested indefinitely through

December 31, 2017

.

Impact of the TCJA


The Firm’s

effective tax rate decreased in 2018 due to the TCJA, including the reduction in the U.S. federal statutory income tax rate as well as a

$


million

net

tax benefit recorded in 2018 resulting from changes in the estimates related to the remeasurement of certain deferred taxes and the deemed repatriation tax on non-U.S. earnings. The change in estimate was recorded under SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 (“SAB 118”) and the accounting under SAB 118 is complete.


The Firm’s

effective tax rate increased in 2017 driven by a

$

1.9

billion

income tax expense representing the estimated impact of the enactment of the TCJA.

The

$

1.9

billion

tax expense was predominantly driven by a deemed repatriation of

the Firm’s

unremitted non-U.S. earnings and adjustments to the value of certain tax-oriented investments partially offset by a benefit from the revaluation of

the Firm’s

net deferred tax liability.

The deemed repatriation of

the Firm’s

unremitted non-U.S. earnings is based on the post-1986 earnings and profits of each controlled foreign corporation. The calculation resulted in an estimated income tax expense of

$

3.7

billion

.

Furthermore, accounting for income taxes requires the remeasurement of certain deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the rates at which they are expected to reverse in the future.

The Firm

remeasured its deferred tax asset and liability balances in

the fourth quarter

of 2017 to the new statutory U.S. federal income tax rate of

21%

as well as any federal benefit associated with state and local deferred income taxes. The remeasurement resulted in an estimated income tax benefit of

$

2.1

billion

.

Adjustments were also recorded in 2017 to income tax expense for certain tax-oriented investments. These adjustments were

driven by

changes to affordable housing proportional amortization resulting from the reduction of the federal income tax rate under the TCJA. SAB 118 did not apply to these adjustments.

JPMorgan Chase & Co./2019 Form 10-K


The following table reflects the components of income tax expense/(benefit) included in the Consolidated statements of income.

Total income tax expense includes

$

1.1

billion

,

$


million

and

$


million

of tax benefits recorded in


,


, and


, respectively, resulting from the resolution of tax audits.

Tax effect of items recorded in stockholders’ equity

The preceding table does not reflect the tax effect of certain items that are recorded each period directly in

stockholders’

equity

. The tax effect of all items recorded directly to stockholders’ equity resulted in a decrease of

$


million

, an increase of

$


million

in


, and a decrease of

$


million

in


.

Results from Non-U.S. earnings

The following table presents the U.S. and non-U.S. components of income before income tax expense.

(a)

For purposes of this table, non-U.S. income is defined as income generated from operations located outside the U.S.

Prior to December 31, 2017, U.S. federal income taxes had not been provided on the undistributed earnings of certain non-U.S. subsidiaries, to the extent that such earnings had been reinvested abroad for an indefinite period of time.

The Firm

is no longer maintaining the indefinite reinvestment assertion on the undistributed earnings of those non-U.S. subsidiaries in light of the enactment of the TCJA. The U.S. federal and state and local income taxes associated with the undistributed and previously untaxed earnings of those non-U.S. subsidiaries was included in the deemed repatriation charge recorded as of December 31, 2017. The Firm will recognize any taxes it may incur on global intangible low tax income as income tax expense in the period in which the tax is incurred.

Affordable housing tax credits

The Firm

recognized

$

1.5

billion

,

$

1.5

billion

and

$

1.7

billion

of tax credits and other tax benefits associated with investments in affordable housing projects within income tax expense for the years

respectively. The amount of amortization of such investments reported in income tax expense was

$

1.1

,

$

1.2

and

$

at

JPMorgan Chase & Co./2019 Form 10-K

Deferred taxes

Deferred income tax expense/(benefit) results from differences between assets and liabilities measured for financial reporting purposes versus income tax return purposes. Deferred tax assets are recognized if, in management’s judgment, their realizability is determined to be more likely than not. If a deferred tax asset is determined to be unrealizable, a valuation allowance is established.

The significant components of deferred tax assets and liabilities are reflected in the following table.

JPMorgan Chase has recorded deferred tax assets of

$


million

at

December 31, 2019

, in connection with U.S. federal and non-U.S. NOL carryforwards, foreign tax credit (“FTC”) carryforwards, and state and local capital loss carryforwards. At

December 31, 2019

, total U.S. federal NOL carryforwards were

$

1.0

billion

, non-U.S. NOL carryforwards were

$


million

, FTC carryforwards were

$


million

, and state and local capital loss carryforwards were

$

1.1

billion

. If not utilized, a portion of the U.S. federal NOL carryforwards will expire between 2022 and 2036 whereas others have an unlimited carryforward period. Similarly, certain non-U.S. NOL carryforwards will expire between 2029 and 2037 whereas others have an unlimited carryforward period. The FTC carryforwards will expire in 2029 and the state and local capital loss carryforwards will expire between 2020 and 2022.

The valuation allowance at

December 31, 2019

, was due to the state and local capital loss carryforwards, FTC carryforwards, and certain non-U.S. deferred tax assets, including NOL carryforwards.

Unrecognized tax benefits

At

December 31, 2019

,


and


,

JPMorgan Chase

’s

unrecognized tax benefits, excluding related interest expense and penalties, were

$

4.0

billion

,

$

billion

,

respectively, of which

$

2.8

billion

,

$

3.8

billion

and

$

3.5

billion

,

respectively, if recognized, would reduce the annual effective tax rate. Included in the amount of unrecognized tax benefits are certain items that would not affect the effective tax rate if they were recognized in the Consolidated statements of income.

These unrecognized items include the tax effect of certain temporary differences, the portion of gross state and local unrecognized tax benefits that would be offset by the benefit from associated U.S. federal income tax deductions, and the portion of gross non-U.S. unrecognized tax benefits that would have offsets in other jurisdictions.

JPMorgan Chase

is presently under audit by a number of taxing authorities, most notably by the Internal Revenue Service as summarized in the Tax examination status table below.

As JPMorgan Chase

is presently under audit by a number of taxing authorities, it is reasonably possible that over the next 12 months the resolution of these examinations may increase or decrease the gross balance of unrecognized tax benefits by as much as

$

0.5

billion

.

Upon settlement of an audit, the change in the unrecognized tax benefit would result from payment or income statement recognition.

The following table presents a reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits.

assets and intercompany funds transfers

Restricted cash and other restricted assets

Certain of

the Firm’s

cash and other assets are restricted as to withdrawal or usage. These restrictions are imposed by various regulatory authorities based on the particular activities of

the Firm’s

subsidiaries.

The business of

JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.

is subject to examination and regulation by the

OCC.

The Bank is a member of the U.S. Federal Reserve System, and its deposits in the U.S. are insured by the

FDIC

, subject to applicable limits.

The Federal Reserve requires depository institutions to maintain cash reserves with a Federal Reserve Bank. The average required amount of reserve balances is deposited by

the Firm’s bank subsidiaries.

In addition,

the Firm

is required to maintain cash reserves at certain non-US central banks.

The Firm

is also subject to rules and regulations established by other U.S. and non U.S. regulators.

As part of its compliance with the respective regulatory requirements,

the Firm’s

broker-dealer

s (

principally

J.P. Morgan Securities LLC in the U.S and

J.P. Morgan Securities plc in the U.K.

) are

subject to certain restrictions on cash and other assets.

The following table presents the components of the Firm’s

restricted cash:

(a)

Comprises

$

45.3

billion

and

$

39.6

billion

in deposits with banks as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, and

$

1.2

billion

in cash and due from banks as of

December 31, 2019 and 2018, on the Consolidated balance sheets.

Also, as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, the Firm had the following other restricted assets:

•

Cash and securities

pledged with clearing organizations for the benefit of customers

of

$

24.7

billion and

$

20.6

billion, respectively.

•

Securities with a fair value of

$

8.8

billion and

$

9.7

billion, respectively, were also restricted in relation to customer activity.

Intercompany funds transfers

Restrictions imposed by U.S. federal law prohibit

JPMorgan Chase

& Co. (“Parent Company”)

and certain of its affiliates from borrowing from

banking subsidiaries unless the loans are secured in specified amounts. Such secured loans

provided by any banking subsidiary to the Parent Company or

to any particular affiliate, together with certain other transactions with such affiliate (collectively referred to as “covered transactions”), are generally limited to


%

of the banking subsidiary’s

total capital, as determined by the risk-based capital guidelines; the aggregate amount of covered transactions between

any banking subsidiary and all of its affiliates is limited to


%

of the banking subsidiary’s

total capital.

The Parent Company’s two principal subsidiaries are JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and JPMorgan Chase Holdings LLC, an intermediate holding company (the “IHC”). The IHC holds the stock of substantially all of JPMorgan Chase’s subsidiaries other than JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and its subsidiaries. The IHC also owns other assets and owes intercompany indebtedness to the holding company. The Parent Company is obligated to contribute to the IHC substantially all the net proceeds received from securities issuances (including issuances of senior and subordinated debt securities and of preferred and common stock).

The principal sources of income and funding for the Parent Company are dividends from JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and dividends and extensions of credit from the IHC.

In addition to dividend restrictions set forth in statutes and regulations,

the Federal Reserve, the OCC and the FDIC

have authority under the Financial Institutions Supervisory Act to prohibit or to limit the payment of dividends by the banking organizations they supervise, including

the Parent Company and its subsidiaries that are banks or bank holding companies,

if, in the banking regulator’s opinion, payment of a dividend would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice in light of the financial condition of the banking organization.

The IHC is prohibited from paying dividends or extending credit to the Parent Company if certain capital or liquidity “thresholds” are breached or if limits are otherwise imposed by the Parent Company’s management or Board of Directors.

At

January 1, 2020, the Parent Company’s banking subsidiaries

could pay, in the aggregate, approximately

$


billion

in dividends to

their respective bank holding companies

without the prior approval of

their

relevant banking regulators. The capacity to pay dividends in


will be supplemented by

the banking subsidiaries’

earnings during the year.

–

Regulatory capital

The Federal Reserve establishes capital requirements, including well-capitalized standards, for the consolidated financial holding company. The OCC establishes similar minimum capital requirements and standards for the Firm’s IDI subsidiaries, including JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.

The capital rules under Basel III establish minimum capital ratios and overall capital adequacy standards for large and internationally active U.S. bank holding companies and banks, including the Firm and its IDI subsidiaries, including JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.

Two comprehensive approaches are prescribed for calculating

RWA:

a standardized approach (“Basel III Standardized”), and an advanced approach (“Basel III Advanced”). Effective January 1, 2019, the capital adequacy of

the Firm and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.

During 2018, the required capital measures were subject to the transitional rules and as of December 31, 2018 were the same on a fully phased-in and on a transitional basis.

The three components of regulatory capital under the Basel III rules are as illustrated below:

Under the risk-based capital and leverage-based

guidelines of the Federal Reserve, JPMorgan Chase is required to maintain minimum ratios for CET1, Tier 1, Total, Tier 1 leverage and the SLR. Failure to meet these minimum requirements could cause the Federal Reserve to take action. IDI subsidiaries are also subject to these capital requirements by their respective primary regulators

Off–balance sheet lending-related

financial instruments, guarantees, and

other commitments

JPMorgan Chase

provides lending-related financial instruments (e.g., commitments and guarantees) to address the financing needs of its customers and clients. The contractual amount of these financial instruments represents the maximum possible credit risk to

the Firm

should the customer or client draw upon the commitment or

the Firm

be required to fulfill its obligation under the guarantee, and should the customer or client subsequently fail to perform according to the terms of the contract. Most of these commitments and guarantees are refinanced, extended, cancelled, or expire without being drawn or a default occurring. As a result, the total contractual amount of these instruments is not, in

the Firm’s

view, representative of its expected future credit exposure or funding requirements.

To provide for probable credit losses inherent in wholesale and certain consumer lending-commitments, an allowance for credit losses on lending-related commitments is maintained.

Refer to Note


for further information regarding the allowance for credit losses on lending-related commitments. The following table summarizes the contractual amounts and carrying values of off-balance sheet lending-related financial instruments, guarantees and other commitments at

December 31, 2019

and


.

The amounts in the table below for credit card and home equity lending-related commitments represent the total available credit for these products.

The Firm

has not experienced, and does not anticipate, that all available lines of credit for these products will be utilized at the same time.

The Firm

can reduce or cancel credit card lines of credit by providing the borrower notice or, in some cases as permitted by law, without notice.

In addition,

the Firm

typically closes credit card lines when the borrower is


days

or more past due.

The Firm

may reduce or close HELOCs when there are significant decreases in the value of the underlying property, or when there has been a demonstrable decline in the creditworthiness of the borrower.

JPMorgan Chase & Co./2019 Form 10-K


Notes to consolidated financial statements

Other unfunded commitments to extend credit

Other unfunded commitments to extend credit generally consist of commitments for working capital and general corporate purposes, extensions of credit to support commercial paper facilities and bond financings in the event that those obligations cannot be remarketed to new investors, as well as committed liquidity facilities to clearing organizations.

The Firm

also issues commitments under multipurpose facilities which could be drawn upon in several forms, including the issuance of a standby letter of credit.

Guarantees

U.S. GAAP requires that a guarantor recognize, at the inception of a guarantee, a liability in an amount equal to the fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing the guarantee. U.S. GAAP defines a guarantee as a contract that contingently requires the guarantor to pay a guaranteed party based upon: (a) changes in an underlying asset, liability or equity security of the guaranteed party; or (b) a third party’s failure to perform under a specified agreement.

The Firm

considers the following off–balance sheet arrangements to be guarantees under U.S. GAAP: standby letters of credit and other financial guarantees, securities lending indemnifications, certain indemnification agreements included within third-party contractual arrangements, certain derivative contracts and the guarantees under the sponsored member repo program.

As required by U.S. GAAP,

the Firm

initially records guarantees at the inception date fair value of the obligation assumed (e.g., the amount of consideration received or the net present value of the premium receivable). For certain

types of guarantees,

the Firm

records this fair value amount in other liabilities with an offsetting entry recorded in cash (for premiums received), or other assets (for premiums receivable). Any premium receivable recorded in other assets is reduced as cash is received under the contract, and the fair value of the liability recorded at inception is amortized into income as lending and deposit-related fees over the life of the guarantee contract. For indemnifications provided in sales agreements, a portion of the sale proceeds is allocated to the guarantee, which adjusts the gain or loss that would otherwise result from the transaction. For these indemnifications, the initial liability is amortized to income as

the Firm’s

risk is reduced (i.e., over time or when the indemnification expires). Any contingent liability that exists as a result of issuing the guarantee or indemnification is recognized when it becomes probable and reasonably estimable. The contingent portion of the liability is not recognized if the estimated amount is less than the carrying amount of the liability recognized at inception (adjusted for any amortization).

The contractual amount and carrying value of guarantees and indemnifications are included in the table on

page 273

. For additional information on the guarantees, see below.

Standby letters of credit and other financial guarantees

Standby letters of credit and other financial guarantees are conditional lending commitments issued by

the Firm

to guarantee the performance of a client or customer to a third party under certain arrangements, such as commercial paper facilities, bond financings, acquisition financings, trade and similar transactions.

The following table summarizes the contractual amount and carrying value of standby letters of credit and other financial guarantees and other letters of credit arrangements

JPMorgan Chase & Co./2019 Form 10-K

Securities lending indemnifications

Through

the Firm’s

securities lending program, counterparties’ securities, via custodial and non-custodial arrangements, may be lent to third parties. As part of this program,

the Firm

provides an indemnification in the lending agreements which protects the lender against the failure of the borrower to return the lent securities. To minimize its liability under these indemnification agreements,

the Firm

obtains cash or other highly liquid collateral with a market value exceeding


%

of the value of the securities on loan from the borrower. Collateral is marked to market daily to help assure that collateralization is adequate. Additional collateral is called from the borrower if a shortfall exists, or collateral may be released to the borrower in the event of overcollateralization. If a borrower defaults,

the Firm

would use the collateral held to purchase replacement securities in the market or to credit the lending client or counterparty with the cash equivalent thereof.

The cash collateral held by the Firm may be invested on behalf of the client in indemnified resale agreements, whereby the Firm indemnifies the client against the loss of principal invested. To minimize its liability under these agreements, the Firm obtains collateral with a market value exceeding


%

of the principal invested.

Derivatives qualifying as guarantees

The Firm

transacts in certain derivative contracts that have the characteristics of a guarantee under U.S. GAAP. These contracts include written put options that require

the Firm

to purchase assets upon exercise by the option holder at a specified price by a specified date in the future.

The Firm

may enter into written put option contracts in order to meet client needs, or for other trading purposes. The terms of written put options are typically five years or less.

Derivatives deemed to be guarantees also includes stable value contracts, commonly referred to as “stable value products”, that require

the Firm

to make a payment of the difference between the market value and the book value of a counterparty’s reference portfolio of assets in the event that market value is less than book value and certain other conditions have been met. Stable value products are transacted in order to allow investors to realize investment returns with less volatility than an unprotected portfolio. These contracts are typically longer-term or may have no stated maturity, but allow

the Firm

to elect to terminate the contract under certain conditions.

The notional value of derivatives guarantees  generally represents

the Firm’s

maximum exposure. However, exposure to certain stable value products is contractually limited to a substantially lower percentage of the notional amount.

The fair value of derivative guarantees reflects the probability, in

the Firm’s

view, of whether

the Firm

will be required to perform under the contract.

The Firm

reduces exposures to these contracts by entering into offsetting transactions, or by entering into contracts that hedge the market risk related to the derivative guarantees.

The following table summarizes the derivatives qualifying as guarantees as of

December 31, 2019

and


.

In addition to derivative contracts that meet the characteristics of a guarantee,

the Firm

is both a purchaser and seller of credit protection in the credit derivatives market. Refer to

Note 5

for a further discussion of credit derivatives.

Unsettled securities financing agreements

In the normal course of business,

the Firm

enters into resale and securities borrowed agreements. At settlement, these commitments result in

the Firm

advancing cash to and receiving securities collateral from the counterparty.

The Firm

also enters into repurchase and securities loaned agreements. At settlement, these commitments result in

the Firm

receiving cash from and providing securities collateral to the counterparty. Such agreements settle at a future date.

These agreements generally do not meet the definition of a derivative, and therefore, are not recorded on the Consolidated balance sheets until settlement date. These agreements predominantly have regular-way settlement terms. Refer to Note


for a further discussion of securities financing agreements.

Loan sales- and securitization-related indemnifications

Mortgage repurchase liability

In connection with

the Firm’s

mortgage loan sale and securitization activities with U.S. GSEs

the Firm

has made representations and warranties that the loans sold meet certain requirements, and that may require

the Firm

to repurchase mortgage loans and/or indemnify the loan purchaser if such representations and warranties are breached by

the Firm.

Further, although

the Firm’s

securitizations are predominantly nonrecourse,

the Firm

does provide recourse servicing in certain limited cases where it agrees to share credit risk with the owner of the mortgage loans. To the extent that repurchase demands that are received relate to loans that

the Firm

purchased from third parties that remain viable,

the Firm

typically will have the right to seek a recovery of related repurchase losses from the third party. Generally, the maximum amount of future payments

the Firm

would be required to make for breaches of these representations and warranties would be equal to the unpaid principal balance of such loans that are deemed to have defects that were sold to purchasers (including securitization-related SPEs) plus, in certain circumstances, accrued interest on such loans and certain expenses.

JPMorgan Chase & Co./2019 Form 10-K


Notes to consolidated financial statements

Private label securitizations

The liability related to repurchase demands associated with private label securitizations is separately evaluated by

the Firm

in establishing its litigation reserves.

Refer to Note


for additional information regarding litigation.

Loans sold with recourse

The Firm

provides servicing for mortgages and certain commercial lending products on both a recourse and nonrecourse basis. In nonrecourse servicing, the principal credit risk to

the Firm

is the cost of temporary servicing advances of funds (i.e., normal servicing advances). In recourse servicing, the servicer agrees to share credit risk with the owner of the mortgage loans, such as Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac or a private investor, insurer or guarantor. Losses on recourse servicing predominantly occur when foreclosure sales proceeds of the property underlying a defaulted loan are less than the sum of the outstanding principal balance, plus accrued interest on the loan and the cost of holding and disposing of the underlying property.

The Firm’s

securitizations are predominantly nonrecourse, thereby effectively transferring the risk of future credit losses to the purchaser of the mortgage-backed securities issued by the trust. At

December 31, 2019

and


,

the unpaid principal balance of loans sold with recourse totaled

$


million

and

$

1.0

billion

,

respectively. The carrying value of the related liability that

the Firm

has recorded in accounts payable and other liabilities on the Consolidated balance sheets, which is representative of

the Firm’s

view of the likelihood it will have to perform under its recourse obligations, was

$


million

and

$


million

at

December 31, 2019

and


,

respectively.

Other off-balance sheet arrangements

Indemnification agreements – general

In connection with issuing securities to investors outside the U.S.,

the Firm

may agree to pay additional amounts to the holders of the securities in the event that, due to a change in tax law, certain types of withholding taxes are imposed on payments on the securities. The terms of the securities may also give

the Firm

the right to redeem the securities if such additional amounts are payable.

The Firm

may also enter into indemnification clauses in connection with the licensing of software to clients (“software licensees”) or when it sells a business or assets to a third party (“third-party purchasers”), pursuant to which it indemnifies software licensees for claims of liability or damages that may occur subsequent to the licensing of the software, or third-party purchasers for losses they may incur due to actions taken by

the Firm

prior to the sale of the business or assets. It is difficult to estimate

the Firm’s

maximum exposure under these indemnification arrangements, since this would require an assessment of future changes in tax law and future claims that may be made against

the Firm

that have not yet occurred. However, based on historical experience, management expects the risk of loss to be remote.

Merchant charge-backs

Under the rules of payment networks, the Firm, in its role as a merchant acquirer, retains a contingent liability for disputed processed credit and debit card transactions that result in a charge-back to the merchant. If a dispute is resolved in the cardholder’s favor,

Merchant Services

will (through the cardholder’s issuing bank) credit or refund the amount to the cardholder and will charge back the transaction to the merchant. If

Merchant Services

is unable to collect the amount from the merchant,

Merchant Services

will bear the loss for the amount credited or refunded to the cardholder.

Merchant Services

mitigates this risk by withholding future settlements, retaining cash reserve accounts or obtaining other collateral. In addition,

Merchant Services recognizes a valuation allowance that covers the payment or performance risk to the Firm related to charge-backs.

For the years ended

December 31, 2019

,


and


, Merchant Services processed an aggregate volume of

$

1,511.5

billion

,

$

1,366.1

billion

, and

$

1,191.7

billion

, respectively, and the related losses from merchant charge-backs were not material.

Clearing Services – Client Credit Risk

The Firm

provides clearing services for clients by entering into securities purchases and sales and derivative contracts with CCPs, including ETDs such as futures and options, as well as OTC-cleared derivative contracts. As a clearing member,

the Firm

stands behind the performance of its clients, collects cash and securities collateral (margin) as well as any settlement amounts due from or to clients, and remits them to the relevant CCP or client in whole or part. There are two types of margin: variation margin is posted on a daily basis based on the value of clients’ derivative contracts and initial margin is posted at inception of a derivative contract, generally on the basis of the potential changes in the variation margin requirement for the contract.

As a clearing member,

the Firm

is exposed to the risk of nonperformance by its clients, but is not liable to clients for the performance of the CCPs. Where possible,

the Firm

seeks to mitigate its risk to the client through the collection of appropriate amounts of margin at inception and throughout the life of the transactions.

The Firm

can also cease providing clearing services if clients do not adhere to their obligations under the clearing agreement. In the event of nonperformance by a client,

the Firm

would close out the client’s positions and access available margin. The CCP would utilize any margin it holds to make itself whole, with any remaining shortfalls required to be paid by

the Firm

as a clearing member.

The Firm

reflects its exposure to nonperformance risk of the client through the recognition of margin receivables from clients and margin payables to CCPs; the clients’ underlying securities or derivative contracts are not reflected in

the Firm’s

Consolidated Financial Statements.


JPMorgan Chase & Co./2019 Form 10-K

It is difficult to estimate

the Firm’s

maximum possible exposure through its role as a clearing member, as this would require an assessment of transactions that clients may execute in the future. However, based upon historical experience, and the credit risk mitigants available to

the Firm,

management believes it is unlikely that

the Firm

will have to make any material payments under these arrangements and the risk of loss is expected to be remote.

Refer to Note


for information on the derivatives that

the Firm

executes for its own account and records in its Consolidated Financial Statements.

Exchange & Clearing House Memberships

The Firm

is a member of several securities and derivative exchanges and clearing houses, both in the U.S. and other countries, and it provides clearing services to its clients. Membership in some of these organizations requires

the Firm

to pay a pro rata share of the losses incurred by the organization as a result of the default of another member. Such obligations vary with different organizations. These obligations may be limited to the amount (or a multiple of the amount) of

the Firm’s

contribution to the guarantee fund maintained by a clearing house or exchange as part of the resources available to cover any losses in the event of a member default. Alternatively, these obligations may also include a pro rata share of the residual losses after applying the guarantee fund. Additionally, certain clearing houses require

the Firm

as a member to pay a pro rata share of losses that may result from the clearing house’s investment of guarantee fund contributions and initial margin, unrelated to and independent of the default of another member. Generally a payment would only be required should such losses exceed the resources of the clearing house or exchange that are contractually required to absorb the losses in the first instance. In certain cases, it is difficult to estimate

the Firm’s

maximum possible exposure under these membership agreements, since this would require an assessment of future claims that may be made against

the Firm

that have not yet occurred. However, based on historical experience, management expects the risk of loss to

the Firm

to be remote.

Where

the Firm’s

maximum possible exposure can be estimated, the amount is disclosed in the table on

page 273

, in the Exchange & clearing house guarantees and commitments line.

Sponsored member repo program

In 2018

the Firm

commenced the sponsored member repo program, wherein

the Firm

acts as a sponsoring member to clear eligible overnight resale and repurchase agreements through the Government Securities Division of the Fixed Income Clearing Corporation (“FICC”) on behalf of clients that become sponsored members under the FICC’s rules.

The Firm

also guarantees to the FICC the prompt and full payment and performance of its sponsored member clients’ respective obligations under the FICC’s rules.

The Firm

minimizes its liability under these overnight guarantees by

obtaining a security interest in the cash or high-quality securities collateral that the clients place with the clearing house; therefore

, the Firm

expects the risk of loss to be remote.

The Firm’s

maximum possible exposure, without taking into consideration the associated collateral, is included

in the Exchange & clearing house guarantees and commitments line on

page 273

. Refer to Note


for additional information on credit risk mitigation practices on resale agreements and the types of collateral pledged under repurchase agreements.

Guarantees of subsidiaries

In the normal course of business,

the Parent Company

may provide counterparties with guarantees of certain of the trading and other obligations of its subsidiaries

on a contract-by-contract basis, as negotiated with

the Firm’s

counterparties. The obligations of the subsidiaries are included on

the Firm’s

Consolidated balance sheets or are reflected as off-balance sheet commitments; therefore,

the Parent Company

has not recognized a separate liability for these guarantees.

The Firm

believes that the occurrence of any event that would trigger payments

by the Parent Company

under these guarantees is remote.

The Parent Company has guaranteed certain long-term debt and structured notes of its subsidiaries, including JPMorgan Chase Financial Company LLC (“JPMFC”), a


%

-owned finance subsidiary. All securities issued by JPMFC are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by the Parent Company. These guarantees, which rank on a parity with the Firm’s unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness, are not included in the table on

Litigation

Contingencies

As of December 31, 2019, the Firm and its subsidiaries and affiliates are defendants, putative defendants or respondents in numerous legal proceedings, including private, civil litigations and regulatory/government investigations. The litigations range from individual actions involving a single plaintiff to class action lawsuits with potentially millions of class members. Investigations involve both formal and informal proceedings, by both governmental agencies and self-regulatory organizations. These legal proceedings are at varying stages of adjudication, arbitration or investigation, and involve each of the Firm’s lines of business and several geographies and a wide variety of claims (including common law tort and contract claims and statutory antitrust, securities and consumer protection claims), some of which present novel legal theories.

The Firm believes the estimate of the aggregate range of reasonably possible losses, in excess of reserves established, for its legal proceedings is from

$


to approximately

$

1.3

billion

at December 31, 2019. This estimated aggregate range of reasonably possible losses was based upon information available as of that date for those proceedings in which the Firm believes that an estimate of reasonably possible loss can be made. For certain matters, the Firm does not believe that such an estimate can be made, as of that date. The Firm’s estimate of the aggregate range of reasonably possible losses involves significant judgment, given:

•

the number, variety and varying stages of the proceedings, including the fact that many are in preliminary stages,

•

the existence in many such proceedings of multiple defendants, including the Firm, whose share of liability (if any) has yet to be determined,

•

the numerous yet-unresolved issues in many of the proceedings, including issues regarding class certification and the scope of many of the claims, and

•

the attendant uncertainty of the various potential outcomes of such proceedings, including where the Firm has made assumptions concerning future rulings by the court or other adjudicator, or about the behavior or incentives of adverse parties or regulatory authorities, and those assumptions prove to be incorrect.

In addition, the outcome of a particular proceeding may be a result which the Firm did not take into account in its estimate because the Firm had deemed the likelihood of that outcome to be remote. Accordingly, the Firm’s estimate of the aggregate range of reasonably possible losses will change from time to time, and actual losses may vary significantly.

Set forth below are descriptions of the Firm’s material legal proceedings.

Federal Republic of Nigeria Litigation.

JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. operated an escrow and depository account for the Federal Government of Nigeria (“FGN”) and two major international oil companies. The account held approximately

$

1.1

billion

in connection with a dispute among the clients over rights to an oil field. Following the settlement of the dispute, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. paid out the monies in the account in 2011 and 2013 in accordance with directions received from its clients. In November 2017, the Federal Republic of Nigeria (“FRN”) commenced a claim in the English High Court for approximately

$


million

in payments made out of the accounts. The FRN, claiming to be the same entity as the FGN, alleges that the payments were instructed as part of a complex fraud not involving JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., but that JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. was or should have been on notice that the payments may be fraudulent. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. applied for summary judgment and was unsuccessful. The claim is ongoing and no trial date has been set.

Foreign Exchange Investigations and Litigation.

The Firm previously reported settlements with certain government authorities relating to its foreign exchange (“FX”) sales and trading activities and controls related to those activities. FX-related investigations and inquiries by government authorities, including competition authorities, are ongoing, and the Firm is cooperating with and working to resolve those matters. In May 2015, the Firm pleaded guilty to a single violation of federal antitrust law. In January 2017, the Firm was sentenced, with judgment entered thereafter and a term of probation ending in January 2020. The term of probation has concluded, with the Firm remaining in good standing throughout the probation period. The Department of Labor has granted the Firm a five-year exemption of disqualification that allows the Firm and its affiliates to continue to rely on the Qualified Professional Asset Manager exemption under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (“ERISA”) until January 2023. The Firm will need to reapply in due course for a further exemption to cover the remainder of the ten-year disqualification period. In addition, the Firm has paid fines totaling approximately

$


million

in connection with the settlement of FX-related investigations conducted by the European Commission and the Swiss Competition Commission which were announced in May 2019 and June 2019, respectively. Separately, in February 2017 the South Africa Competition Commission referred its FX investigation of the Firm and other banks to the South Africa Competition Tribunal, which is conducting civil proceedings concerning that matter.

JPMorgan Chase & Co./2019 Form 10-K


Notes to consolidated financial statements

In August 2018, the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York granted final approval to the Firm’s settlement of a consolidated class action brought by U.S.-based plaintiffs, which principally alleged violations of federal antitrust laws based on an alleged conspiracy to manipulate foreign exchange rates and also sought damages on behalf of persons who transacted in FX futures and options on futures. Certain members of the settlement class filed requests to the Court to be excluded from the class, and certain of them filed a complaint against the Firm and a number of other foreign exchange dealers in November 2018. A number of these actions remain pending. Further, putative class actions have been filed against the Firm and a number of other foreign exchange dealers on behalf of certain consumers who purchased foreign currencies at allegedly inflated rates and purported indirect purchasers of FX instruments; these actions also remain pending in the District Court. In addition, some FX-related individual and putative class actions based on similar alleged underlying conduct have been filed outside the U.S., including in the U.K., Israel and Australia.

roups of merchants and retail associations filed a series of class action complaints alleging that Visa and Mastercard, as well as certain banks, conspired to set the price of credit and debit card interchange fees and enacted related rules in violation of antitrust laws. In 2012, the parties initially settled the cases for a cash payment, a temporary reduction of credit card interchange, and modifications to certain credit card network rules. In 2017, after the approval of that settlement was reversed on appeal, the case was remanded to the District Court for further proceedings consistent with the appellate decision.

The original class action was divided into

two

separate actions, one seeking primarily monetary relief and the other seeking primarily injunctive relief. In September 2018, the parties to the class action seeking monetary relief finalized an agreement which amends and supersedes the prior settlement agreement. Pursuant to this settlement, the defendants collectively contributed an additional

$


million

to the approximately

$

5.3

billion

previously held in escrow from the original settlement. In December 2019, the amended agreement was approved by the District Court. Certain merchants filed notices of appeal of the District Court’s approval order. Based on the percentage of merchants that opted out of the amended class settlement,

$


million

has been returned to the defendants from the settlement

escrow in accordance with the settlement agreement. The class action seeking primarily injunctive relief continues separately.

In addition, certain merchants have filed individual actions raising similar allegations against Visa and Mastercard, as well as against the Firm and other banks, and those actions are proceeding.

LIBOR and Other Benchmark Rate Investigations and

Litigation. JPMorgan Chase has responded to inquiries from

various governmental agencies and entities around the world relating primarily to the British Bankers Association’s London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) for various currencies and the European Banking Federation’s Euro Interbank Offered Rate (“EURIBOR”). The Swiss Competition Commission’s investigation relating to EURIBOR, to which the Firm and other banks are subject, continues. In December 2016, the European Commission issued a decision against the Firm and other banks finding an infringement of European antitrust rules relating to EURIBOR. The Firm has filed an appeal of that decision with the European General Court, and that appeal is pending.

In addition, the Firm has been named as a defendant along with other banks in a series of individual and putative class actions related to benchmarks, including U.S. dollar LIBOR during the period that it was administered by the BBA and, in a separate consolidated putative class action, during the period that it was administered by ICE Benchmark Administration. These actions have been filed, or consolidated for pre-trial purposes, in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. In these actions, plaintiffs make varying allegations that in various periods, starting in 2000 or later, defendants either individually or collectively manipulated various benchmark rates by submitting rates that were artificially low or high. Plaintiffs allege that they transacted in loans, derivatives or other financial instruments whose values are affected by changes in these rates and assert a variety of claims including antitrust claims seeking treble damages. These actions are in various stages of litigation.

In actions related to U.S. dollar LIBOR during the period that it was administered by the BBA, the District Court dismissed certain claims, including antitrust claims brought by some plaintiffs whom the District Court found did not have standing to assert such claims, and permitted certain claims to proceed, including antitrust, Commodity Exchange Act, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act and common law claims. The plaintiffs whose antitrust claims were dismissed for lack of standing have filed an appeal. The District Court granted class certification of antitrust claims related to bonds and interest rate swaps sold directly by the defendants and denied class certification motions filed by other plaintiffs. The Firm’s settlements of putative class actions related to Swiss franc LIBOR, the Singapore Interbank Offered Rate and the Singapore Swap Offer Rate (“SIBOR”), the Australian Bank Bill Swap Reference Rate, and certain of the putative class actions related to U.S. dollar LIBOR remain subject to court approval. In the class actions related to SIBOR and Swiss franc LIBOR, the District Court concluded that the Court lacked subject matter jurisdiction, and plaintiffs’ appeals of those decisions are pending.

Metals and U.S. Treasuries Investigations and Litigation and Related Inquiries.

Various authorities, including the Department of Justice’s Criminal Division, are conducting investigations relating to trading practices in the metals markets and related conduct. The Firm also is responding to


JPMorgan Chase & Co./2019 Form 10-K

related requests concerning similar trading-practices issues in markets for other financial instruments, such as U.S.

Treasuries. The Firm continues to cooperate with these investigations and is currently engaged in discussions with various regulators about resolving their respective investigations. There is no assurance that such discussions will result in settlements. Several putative class action complaints have been filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York against the Firm and certain former employees, alleging a precious metals futures and options price manipulation scheme in violation of the Commodity Exchange Act. Some of the complaints also allege unjust enrichment and deceptive acts or practices under the General Business Law of the State of New York. The Court consolidated these putative class actions in February 2019. The Firm is also a defendant in a consolidated action filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York alleging monopolization of silver futures in violation of the Sherman Act.

Wendel.

Since 2012, the French criminal authorities have been investigating a series of transactions entered into by senior managers of Wendel Investissement (“Wendel”) during the period from 2004 through 2007 to restructure their shareholdings in Wendel. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., Paris branch provided financing for the transactions to a number of managers of Wendel in 2007. JPMorgan Chase has cooperated with the investigation. The investigating judges issued an

ordonnance de renvoi

in November 2016, referring JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. to the French

tribunal correctionnel

for alleged complicity in tax fraud. No date for trial has been set by the court. In January 2018, the Paris Court of Appeal issued a decision cancelling the

mise en examen

of JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. The Court of Cassation, France’s highest court, ruled in September 2018 that a

mise en examen

is a prerequisite for an

ordonnance de renvoi

and in January 2020 ordered the annulment of the

ordonnance de renvoi

referring JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. to the French

tribunal correctionnel.

In addition, a number of the managers have commenced civil proceedings against JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. The claims are separate, involve different allegations and are at various stages of proceedings.

*     *     *

In addition to the various legal proceedings discussed above, JPMorgan Chase and its subsidiaries are named as defendants or are otherwise involved in a substantial number of other legal proceedings. The Firm believes it has meritorious defenses to the claims asserted against it in its currently outstanding legal proceedings and it intends to defend itself vigorously. Additional legal proceedings may be initiated from time to time in the future.

The Firm has established reserves for several hundred of its currently outstanding legal proceedings. In accordance with the provisions of U.S. GAAP for contingencies, the Firm accrues for a litigation-related liability when it is probable that such a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. The Firm evaluates its outstanding legal proceedings each quarter to assess its litigation reserves, and makes adjustments in such reserves, upwards or downward, as appropriate, based on management’s best judgment after consultation with counsel. The Firm’s legal expense/(benefit) was

$


million

,

$


million

and

$(


) million

for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. There is no assurance that the Firm’s litigation reserves will not need to be adjusted in the future.

In view of the inherent difficulty of predicting the outcome of legal proceedings, particularly where the claimants seek very large or indeterminate damages, or where the matters present novel legal theories, involve a large number of parties or are in early stages of discovery, the Firm cannot state with confidence what will be the eventual outcomes of the currently pending matters, the timing of their ultimate resolution or the eventual losses, fines, penalties or consequences related to those matters. JPMorgan Chase believes, based upon its current knowledge and after consultation with counsel, consideration of the material legal proceedings described above and after taking into account its current litigation reserves and its estimated aggregate range of possible losses, that the other legal proceedings currently pending against it should not have a material adverse effect on the Firm’s consolidated financial condition. The Firm notes, however, that in light of the uncertainties involved in such proceedings, there is no assurance that the ultimate resolution of these matters will not significantly exceed the reserves it has currently accrued or that a matter will not have material reputational consequences. As a result, the outcome of a particular matter may be material to JPMorgan Chase’s operating results for a particular period, depending on, among other factors, the size of the loss or liability imposed and the level of JPMorgan Chase’s income for that period.

Segment results

The following table provides a summary of the Firm’s segment results as of or for the years ended December 31,


,


and


, on a managed basis.

The Firm’s definition of managed basis starts with the reported U.S. GAAP results and includes certain reclassifications to present total net revenue for the Firm (and each of the reportable business segments) on an FTE basis. Accordingly, revenue from investments that receive tax credits and tax-exempt securities is presented in the managed results on a basis comparable to taxable investments and securities. This allows management to assess the comparability of revenue from year-to-year arising from both taxable and tax-exempt sources. The corresponding income tax impact related to tax-exempt items is recorded within income tax expense/(benefit). These adjustments have no impact on net income as reported by the Firm as a whole or by the LOBs.

Business segment capital allocation

Each business segment is allocated capital by taking into consideration a variety of factors including capital levels of similarly rated peers and applicable regulatory capital requirements. ROE is measured and internal targets for expected returns are established as key measures of a business segment’s performance.

The Firm’s allocation methodology incorporates Basel III Standardized RWA, Basel III Advanced RWA, leverage, the GSIB surcharge, and a simulation of capital in a severe stress environment.

Periodically, the assumptions and methodologies used to allocate capital are assessed and as a result, the capital allocated to the LOBs may change.

(a)

In the second quarter of 2019, the Firm implemented certain presentation changes that impacted interest income and interest expense, but had no effect on net interest income. These changes were made to align the accounting treatment between the balance sheet and the related interest income or expense, primarily by offsetting interest income and expense for certain prime brokerage-related held-for-investment customer receivables and payables that are currently presented as a single margin account on the balance sheet. In addition, the Firm reclassified balances related to certain instruments and structured notes from interest-earning/bearing to noninterest-earning/bearing assets and liabilities as the associated returns are recorded in principal transactions revenue and not in net interest income. These changes were applied retrospectively and, accordingly, prior period amounts were revised to conform with the current presentation.

Changes in net interest income, volume and rate analysis

The table below presents an attribution of net interest income between volume and rate. The attribution between volume and rate is calculated using annual average balances for each category of assets and liabilities shown in the table and the corresponding annual rates (refer to

pages 288–292

for more information on average balances and rates). In this analysis, when the change cannot be isolated to either volume or rate, it has been allocated to volume. The annual rates include the impact of changes in market rates, as well as the impact of any change in composition of the various products within each category of asset or liability. This analysis is calculated separately for each category without consideration of the relationship between categories (for example, the net spread between the rates earned on assets and the rates paid on liabilities that fund those assets). As a result, changes in the granularity or groupings considered in this analysis would produce a different attribution result, and due to the complexities involved, precise allocation of changes in interest rates between volume and rates is inherently complex and judgmental.

LTV: “Loan-to-value”:

For residential real estate loans, the relationship, expressed as a percentage, between the principal amount of a loan and the appraised value of the collateral (i.e., residential real estate) securing the loan.

Origination date LTV ratio

The LTV ratio at the origination date of the loan. Origination date LTV ratios are calculated based on the actual appraised values of collateral (i.e., loan-level data) at the origination

date.

Current estimated LTV ratio

An estimate of the LTV as of a certain date. The current estimated LTV ratios are calculated using estimated collateral values derived from a nationally recognized home price index measured at the metropolitan statistical area (“MSA”) level. These MSA-level home price indices consist of actual data to the extent available and forecasted data where actual data is not available. As a result, the estimated collateral values used to calculate these ratios do not represent actual appraised loan-level collateral values; as such, the resulting LTV ratios are necessarily imprecise and should therefore be viewed as estimates.

Combined LTV ratio

The LTV ratio considering all available lien positions, as well as unused lines, related to the property. Combined LTV ratios are used for junior lien home equity products.

Managed basis:

Glossary of Terms and Acronyms

Mortgage product types:

Alt-A

Alt-A loans are generally higher in credit quality than subprime loans but have characteristics that would disqualify the borrower from a traditional prime loan. Alt-A lending characteristics may include one or more of the following: (i) limited documentation; (ii) a high CLTV ratio; (iii) loans secured by non-owner occupied properties; or (iv) a debt-to-income ratio above normal limits. A substantial proportion of the Firm’s Alt-A loans are those where a borrower does not provide complete documentation of his or her assets or the amount or source of his or her income.

Option ARMs

The option ARM real estate loan product is an adjustable-rate mortgage loan that provides the borrower with the option each month to make a fully amortizing, interest-only or minimum payment. The minimum payment on an option ARM loan is based on the interest rate charged during the introductory period. This introductory rate is usually significantly below the fully indexed rate. The fully indexed rate is calculated using an index rate plus a margin. Once the introductory period ends, the contractual interest rate charged on the loan increases to the fully indexed rate and adjusts monthly to reflect movements in the index. The minimum payment is typically insufficient to cover interest accrued in the prior month, and any unpaid interest is deferred and added to the principal balance of the loan. Option ARM loans are subject to payment recast, which converts the loan to a variable-rate fully amortizing loan upon meeting specified loan balance and anniversary date triggers.

Prime

Prime mortgage loans are made to borrowers with good credit records who meet specific underwriting requirements, including prescriptive requirements related to income and overall debt levels. New prime mortgage borrowers provide full documentation and generally have reliable payment histories.

Subprime

Subprime loans are loans that, prior to mid-2008, were offered to certain customers with one or more high risk characteristics, including but not limited to: (i) unreliable or poor payment histories; (ii) a high LTV ratio of greater than 80% (without borrower-paid mortgage insurance); (iii) a high debt-to-income ratio; (iv) an occupancy type for the loan is other than the borrower’s primary residence; or (v) a history of delinquencies or late payments on the loan.

Impact of nonaccrual loans and accruing restructured loans on interest income

The negative impact on interest income from nonaccrual loans represents the difference between the amount of interest income that would have been recorded on such nonaccrual loans according to their original contractual terms had they been performing and the amount of interest that actually was recognized on a cash basis. The negative impact on interest income from accruing restructured loans represents the difference between the amount of interest income that would have been recorded on such loans according to their original contractual terms and the amount of interest that actually was recognized under the modified terms. The following table sets forth this data for the years specified. The change in forgone interest income from


through


was primarily driven by the change in the levels of nonaccrual loans.



Cross-border outstandings

Cross-border disclosure is based on the FFIEC guidelines governing the determination of cross-border risk.

The reporting of country exposure under the FFIEC bank regulatory requirements provides information on the distribution, by country and sector, of claims on, and liabilities to, U.S. and foreign residents held by U.S. banks and bank holding companies and is used by the regulatory agencies to determine the presence of credit and related

risks, including transfer and country risk. Country location under the FFIEC bank regulatory reporting is based on where the entity or counterparty is legally established.
