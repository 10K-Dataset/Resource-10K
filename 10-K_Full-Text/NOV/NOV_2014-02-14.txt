PART I

ITEM 1.

BUSINESS

General

National Oilwell Varco, Inc. (“NOV” or the “Company”), a Delaware corporation incorporated in 1995, is a leading worldwide provider of
equipment and components used in oil and gas drilling and production operations, oilfield services, and supply chain integration services to the upstream oil and gas industry. The Company conducts operations in over 1,235 locations across six
continents.

The Company’s principal executive offices are located at 7909 Parkwood Circle Drive, Houston, Texas 77036, its telephone
number is (713) 346-7500, and its Internet website address is

http://www.nov.com

. The Company’s annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K, and all amendments thereto, are available
free of charge on its Internet website. These reports are posted on its website as soon as reasonably practicable after such reports are electronically filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). The Company’s Code of
Ethics is also posted on its website.

The Company has a long tradition of pioneering innovations which improve the cost-effectiveness,
efficiency, safety and environmental impact of oil and gas operations. The Company’s common stock is traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol “NOV”. The Company operates through three reporting segments: Rig Technology,
Petroleum Services & Supplies, and Distribution & Transmission.

On September 24, 2013, the Company announced that its Board
of Directors authorized Company management to move forward with exploration of a plan to spin-off the Company’s distribution business from the remainder of the Company, creating two stand-alone, publicly traded corporations. The Company
believes that the separation of the distribution business can be accomplished via a tax-efficient spin-off to Company shareholders.

Rig
Technology

Our Rig Technology segment designs, manufactures, sells and services complete systems for the drilling, completion, and
servicing of oil and gas wells. The segment offers a comprehensive line of highly-engineered equipment that automates complex well construction and management operations, such as offshore and onshore drilling rigs; derricks; pipe lifting, racking,
rotating and assembly systems; rig instrumentation systems; blowout preventers; coiled tubing equipment and pressure pumping units; well workover rigs; wireline winches; wireline trucks; cranes; flexible pipe for offshore production applications;
and turret mooring systems and other products for floating production, storage and offloading vessels (“FPSOs”) and other offshore vessels and terminals. Demand for Rig Technology products is primarily dependent on capital spending
plans by drilling contractors, oilfield service companies, and oil and gas companies; and secondarily on the overall level of oilfield drilling activity, which drives demand for spare parts for the segment’s large installed base of equipment.
We have made strategic acquisitions and other investments during the past several years in an effort to expand our product offering and our global manufacturing, training and service capabilities, including adding additional operations in the United
States, Canada, Norway, Denmark, the United Kingdom, Brazil, China, Belarus, India, Russia, the Netherlands, Singapore, South Korea, South Africa, and Angola.

Petroleum Services & Supplies

Our Petroleum Services & Supplies segment
provides a variety of consumable goods and services used to drill, complete, remediate and workover oil and gas wells and service drill pipe, tubing, casing, flowlines and other oilfield tubular goods. The segment manufactures, rents and sells a
variety of products and equipment used to perform drilling operations, including drill pipe, wired drill pipe, transfer pumps, valves, solids control systems, drilling motors, drilling fluids, drill bits, reamers and other downhole tools, and mud
pump consumables. Demand for these services and supplies is determined principally by the level of oilfield drilling and workover activity by drilling contractors, oilfield service companies, major and independent oil and gas companies, and national
oil companies. Oilfield tubular services include the provision of inspection and internal coating services and equipment for drill pipe, line pipe, tubing, casing and pipelines; and the design, manufacture and sale of coiled tubing pipe and advanced
fiberglass composite pipe for application in highly corrosive environments. The segment sells its tubular goods and services to oil and gas companies; drilling contractors; pipe distributors, processors and manufacturers; and pipeline operators.
This segment has benefited from several strategic acquisitions and other investments completed during the past few years, including additional operations in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Brazil, China, Kazakhstan, Mexico, Russia,
Argentina, India, Bolivia, the Netherlands, Singapore, Malaysia, Vietnam, Oman, and the United Arab Emirates.



Distribution & Transmission

Our Distribution & Transmission segment provides pipe, maintenance, repair and operating supplies (“MRO”) and spare parts to drill sites and production locations, pipeline operations,
processing plants, and industrial facilities worldwide. In addition to its comprehensive field location network, which supports land drilling operations throughout North America, the segment supports major land and offshore operations for all the
major oil and gas producing regions throughout the world. The segment employs advanced information technologies to provide complete procurement, materials management and logistics services to its customers around the globe. The segment also has a
global reach in oil and gas, waste water treatment, chemical, food and beverage, paper and pulp, mining, agriculture, and a variety of municipal markets and is a leading producer of water transmission pipe, fabricated steel products and specialized
materials and products used in infrastructure projects. Demand for the segment’s services is determined primarily by the level of drilling, servicing, and oil and gas production activities. It is also influenced by the domestic economy in
general, housing starts and government policies. This segment has benefited from several strategic acquisitions and other investments completed around the world during the past few years, including the acquisition of the Wilson distribution business
segment from Schlumberger Limited and CE Franklin Ltd. in Canada, both of which were completed in 2012, as well as additional operations in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Kazakhstan, Singapore, Russia, and Malaysia.

The following table sets forth the contribution to our total revenues of our three operating segments (in millions):

See Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for financial
information by segment and a geographical breakout of revenues and long-lived assets. We have included a glossary of oilfield terms at the end of Item 1. “Business” of this Annual Report.

Influence of Oil and Gas Activity Levels on the Company’s Business

The oil and gas industry in which the Company participates has historically experienced significant volatility. Demand for the Company’s services and products depends primarily upon the general level
of activity in the oil and gas industry worldwide, including the number of drilling rigs in operation, the number of oil and gas wells being drilled, the depth and drilling conditions of these wells, the volume of production, the number of well
completions and the level of well remediation activity. Oil and gas activity is in turn heavily influenced by, among other factors, oil and gas prices worldwide. High levels of drilling and well remediation activity generally spurs demand for the
Company’s products and services used to drill and remediate oil and gas wells. Additionally, high levels of oil and gas activity increase cash flows available for oil and gas companies, drilling contractors, oilfield service companies, and
manufacturers of oil country tubular goods (“OCTG”) to invest in capital equipment that the Company sells.

Beginning in early 2004,
increasing oil and gas prices led to steadily rising levels of drilling activity throughout the world. Concerns about the long-term availability of oil and gas supply also began to build. Consequently, the worldwide rig count increased 11% in 2006,
2% in 2007, and 7% in 2008. As a result of higher cash flows realized by many of the Company’s customers, as well as the long-term concerns about supply-demand imbalance and the need to replace aging equipment, market conditions for capital
equipment purchases improved significantly between 2006 and 2007, resulting in higher backlogs for the Company at the end of 2008 compared to the end of 2006 and 2007. However, as a result of the financial crisis and significantly lower commodity
prices, the worldwide drilling rig count declined 31% in 2009 and customers were far less willing to commit to major capital equipment purchases in 2009. As a result, our order rates were substantially lower in 2009. In 2010, as the financial crisis
eased and oil prices recovered, order rates began to improve across a broad array of rig equipment, with a particular focus on continued build out of the deepwater fleet. Each year 2011, 2012 and 2013 saw a further improvement in order rates as
commodity prices remained at levels supporting sustained capital spending by our customers. However, the global rig count decreased 3% in 2013 compared to 2012 after rising by 1.5% in 2012 compared to 2011. Backlog for the Company was approximately
$16.2 billion at December 31, 2013 compared to approximately $11.9 billion and $10.2 billion for December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively.



In 2011, 2012 and 2013, most of the Company’s revenue from Rig Technology resulted from major capital
expenditures of drilling contractors, well servicing companies, and oil companies on rig construction and refurbishment, and well servicing equipment. These capital expenditures are influenced by the amount of cash flow that contractors and service
companies generate from drilling, completion, and remediation activity; as well as by the availability of financing, the outlook for future drilling and well servicing activity, and other factors. Generally, the Company believes the demand for
capital equipment lags increases in the level of drilling activity. Most of the remainder of the Rig Technology segment’s revenue is related to the sale of spare parts and consumables, the provision of equipment-repair services, and the rental
of equipment, which the Company believes are generally determined directly by the level of drilling and well servicing activity.

The majority
of the Company’s revenue from Petroleum Services & Supplies is closely tied to drilling activity, although a portion is related to the sale of capital equipment to drilling contractors, which may somewhat lag the level of drilling
activity. Portions of the segment’s revenue that are not tied to drilling activity include (i) the sale of progressive cavity pumps and solids control equipment for use in industrial applications, and (ii) the sale of fiberglass and
composite tubing to industrial customers and shipyards, which is generally unrelated to drilling or well remediation activity but may be tied somewhat to oil and gas prices.

The Company’s revenue from Distribution & Transmission is almost entirely driven by drilling activity and oil and gas production activities, with the exception of sales of water pipelines,
concrete and pole products which is tied to infrastructure spending. Drilling and well servicing activity can fluctuate significantly in a short period of time.

The willingness of oil and gas operators to make capital investments to explore for and produce oil and natural gas will continue to be influenced by numerous factors over which the Company has no
control, including but not limited to: the ability of the members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (“OPEC”) to maintain oil price stability through voluntary production limits of oil; the level of oil production by
non-OPEC countries; supply and demand for oil and natural gas; general economic and political conditions; costs of exploration and production; the availability of new leases and concessions; access to external financing; and governmental regulations
regarding, among other things, environmental protection, climate change, taxation, price controls and product allocations. The willingness of drilling contractors and well servicing companies to make capital expenditures for the type of specialized
equipment the Company provides is also influenced by numerous factors over which the Company has no control, including: the general level of oil and gas well drilling and servicing; rig day-rates; access to external financing; outlook for future
increases in well drilling and well remediation activity; steel prices and fabrication costs; and government regulations regarding, among other things, environmental protection, taxation, and price controls.

See additional discussion on current worldwide economic environment and related oil and gas activity levels in Item 1A. Risk Factors and
Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.

Overview of Oil and Gas Well
Drilling and Servicing Processes

Oil and gas wells are usually drilled by drilling contractors using a drilling rig. A bit is attached to
the end of a drill stem, which is assembled by the drilling rig and its crew from 30-foot joints of drill pipe and specialized drilling components known as downhole tools. Using the conventional rotary drilling method, the drill stem is turned from
the rotary table of the drilling rig by torque applied to the kelly, which is screwed into the top of the drill stem. Increasingly, drilling is performed using a drilling motor, which is attached to the bottom of the drill stem and provides
rotational force directly to the bit, and a top drive, a device suspended from the derrick that turns the entire drill stem, rather than such force being supplied by the rotary table. The use of drilling motors and top drives permits the drilling
contractor to drill directionally, including horizontally. The Company sells and rents drilling motors, drill bits, downhole tools and drill pipe through its Petroleum Services & Supplies segment and sells and rents top drives through its
Rig Technology segment.

During drilling, heavy drilling fluids or “drilling muds” are pumped down the drill stem and forced out
through jets in the bit. The drilling mud returns to the surface through the space between the borehole wall and the drill stem, carrying with it the drill cuttings drilled out by the bit. The drill cuttings are removed from the mud by a solids
control system (which can include shakers, centrifuges and other specialized equipment) and disposed of in an environmentally sound manner. The solids control system permits the mud, which is often comprised of expensive chemicals, to be
continuously reused and re-circulated back into the hole.

Through its Rig Technology segment, the Company sells the large “mud
pumps” that are used to pump drilling mud through the drill stem. Through its Petroleum Services & Supplies segment, the Company sells transfer pumps and mud pump consumables; sells and rents solids control equipment; and provides
solids control, waste management and drilling fluids services. Many operators internally coat the drill stem to improve its hydraulic efficiency and protect it from corrosive fluids sometimes encountered during drilling, and inspect and assess the
integrity of the drill pipe from time to time. The Company provides drill pipe inspection and coating services, and applies “hardbanding” material to drill pipe to improve its wear characteristics. These services are provided through the
Petroleum Services & Supplies segment. Additionally, the Petroleum Services & Supplies segment manufactures and sells drill pipe.



As the hole depth increases, the kelly must be removed frequently so that additional 30-foot joints of drill
pipe can be added to the drill stem. When the bit becomes dull or the equipment at the bottom of the drill stem – including the drilling motors – otherwise requires servicing, the entire drill stem is pulled out of the hole and
disassembled by disconnecting the joints of drill pipe. These are set aside or “racked,” the old bit is replaced or service is performed, and the drill stem is reassembled and lowered back into the hole (a process called
“tripping”). During drilling and tripping operations, joints of drill pipe must be screwed together and tightened (“made up”), and loosened and unscrewed (“spun out”). The Rig Technology segment provides drilling
equipment to manipulate and maneuver the drill pipe in this manner. When the hole has reached certain depths, all of the drill pipe is pulled out of the hole and larger diameter pipe known as casing is lowered into the hole and permanently cemented
in place in order to protect against collapse and contamination of the hole. The casing is typically inspected before it is lowered into the hole, a service the Petroleum Services & Supplies segment provides. The Rig Technology segment
manufactures pressure pumping equipment that is used to cement the casing in place.

The raising and lowering of the drill stem while drilling
or tripping, and the lowering of casing into the wellbore, is accomplished with the rig’s hoisting system. A conventional hoisting system is a block and tackle mechanism that works within the drilling rig’s derrick. The lifting of this
mechanism is performed via a series of pulleys that are attached to the drawworks at the base of the derrick. The Rig Technology segment sells and installs drawworks and pipe hoisting systems. During the course of normal drilling operations, the
drill stem passes through different geological formations, which exhibit varying pressure characteristics. If this pressure is not contained, oil, gas and/or water would flow out of these formations to the surface.

The two means of containing these reservoir pressures are (i) primarily the circulation of drilling muds while drilling and (ii) secondarily
the use of blowout preventers (“BOPs”) should the mud prove inadequate in an emergency situation. The Rig Technology segment sells and services blowout preventers. Drilling muds are carefully designed to exhibit certain qualities that
optimize the drilling process. In addition to containing formation pressure, they must (i) provide power to the drilling motor, (ii) carry drilled solids to the surface, (iii) protect the drilled formations from being damaged, and
(iv) cool the drill bit. Achieving these objectives often requires a formulation specific to a given well and can involve the use of expensive chemicals as well as natural materials, such as certain types of clay. The fluid itself is often oil
or more expensive synthetic mud. Given this expense, it is highly desirable to reuse as much of the drilling mud as possible. Solids control equipment such as shale shakers, centrifuges, cuttings dryers, and mud cleaners help accomplish this
objective. The Petroleum Services & Supplies segment rents, sells, operates and services this equipment. Drilling muds are formulated based on expected drilling conditions. However, as the hole is drilled, the drill stem may encounter a
high pressure zone where the mud density is inadequate to maintain sufficient pressure. Should efforts to “weight up” the mud in order to contain such a pressure kick fail, a blowout could result, whereby reservoir fluids would flow
uncontrolled into the well. To prevent blowouts to the surface of the well, a series of high-pressure valves known as blowout preventers are positioned at the top of the well and, when activated, form tight seals that prevent the escape of fluids.
When closed, conventional BOPs prevent normal rig operations. Therefore, the BOPs are activated only if drilling mud and normal well control procedures cannot safely contain the pressure.

The operations of the rig and the condition of the drilling mud are closely monitored by various sensors, which measure operating parameters such as the weight on the rig’s hook, the incidence of
pressure kicks, the operation of the drilling mud pumps, etc. Through its Rig Technology segment, the Company sells and rents drilling rig instrumentation packages that perform these monitoring functions.

During the drilling and completion of a well, there exists an ongoing need for various consumables and spare parts. While most of these items are small,
in the aggregate they represent an important element of the process. Since it is impractical for each drilling location to have a full supply of these items, drilling contractors and well service companies tend to rely on third parties to stock and
deliver these items. The Company provides this capability through its Distribution & Transmission segment, which stocks and sells spares and consumables made by third parties, as well as spares and consumables made by the Company.

After the well has reached its total depth and the final section of casing has been set, the drilling rig is moved off of the well and the
well is prepared to begin producing oil or gas in a process known as “well completion.” Well completion usually involves installing production tubing concentrically in the casing. Due to the corrosive nature of many produced fluids,
production tubing is often inspected and coated, services offered by the Petroleum Services & Supplies segment. Sometimes operators choose to use corrosion resistant composite materials, which the Company also offers through its Petroleum
Services & Supplies segment, or corrosion-resistant alloys, or operators sometimes pump fluids into wells to inhibit corrosion.

From
time to time, a producing well may undergo workover procedures to extend its life and increase its production rate. Workover rigs are used to disassemble the wellhead, tubing and other completion components of an existing well in order to stimulate
or remediate the well. Workover rigs are similar to drilling rigs in their capabilities to handle tubing, but are usually smaller and somewhat less sophisticated. The Company offers a comprehensive range of workover rigs through its Rig Technology
segment. Tubing and sucker rods removed from a well during a well remediation operation are often inspected to determine their suitability to be reused in the well, which is a service the Petroleum Services & Supplies segment provides.



Frequently, coiled tubing units or wireline units are used to accomplish certain well remediation operations
or well completions. Coiled tubing is a recent advancement in petroleum technology consisting of a continuous length of reeled steel tubing which can be injected concentrically into the production tubing all the way to the bottom of most wells. It
permits many operations to be performed without disassembling the production tubing, and without curtailing the production of the well. Wireline winch units are devices that utilize single-strand or multi-strand wires to perform well remediation
operations, such as lowering tools and transmitting data to the surface. Through the Rig Technology segment, the Company sells and rents various types of coiled tubing equipment and wireline equipment and tools. The Company also manufactures and
sells coiled tubing pipe through its Petroleum Services & Supplies segment.

Rig Technology

The Company has a long tradition of pioneering innovations in drilling and well servicing equipment which improve the efficiency,
safety, and cost of drilling and well servicing operations. The Rig Technology segment designs, manufactures and sells a wide variety of top drives, automated pipe handling systems, motion compensation systems, rig controls, BOPs, handling tools,
drawworks, risers, rotary tables, mud pumps, cranes, drilling motors, turret mooring systems and other products for FPSOs and other offshore vessels and terminals, and other drilling equipment for both the onshore and offshore markets. Rig
Technology also manufactures entire rig packages, both drilling and workover, in addition to well servicing equipment such as coiled tubing units, pressure pumping equipment, and wireline winches. The Rig Technology segment sells directly to
drilling contractors, shipyards and other rig fabricators, well servicing companies, national oil companies, major and independent oil and gas companies, supply stores, and pipe-running service providers. Rig Technology rents and sells proprietary
drilling rig instrumentation packages and control systems which monitor various processes throughout the drilling operation, under the name MD

TM

/Totco

TM

(“Instrumentation”). Demand for its products, several of which are described below, is strongly dependent
upon capital spending plans by oil and gas companies and drilling contractors, and the level of oil and gas well drilling activity.

Land Rig Packages

. The Company designs, manufactures, assembles, upgrades, and supplies equipment sets to a variety of land drilling rigs, including those specifically designed to operate in
harsh environments such as the Arctic Circle and the desert. Our key land rig product names include the

Drake™ Rig, Ideal™ Rig

and

Rapid Rig

TM

. The Company’s recent rig packages are designed to be safer and fast moving, to utilize AC technology, and to
reduce manpower required to operate a rig.

Top Drives

. The TDS™ Top Drive Drilling System, originally introduced by the
Company in 1982, significantly alters the traditional drilling process. The TDS rotates the drill stem from its top, rather than by the rotary table, with a large electric motor affixed to rails installed in the derrick that traverses the length of
the derrick to the rig floor. Therefore, the TDS eliminates the use of the conventional rotary table for drilling. Components of the TDS also are used to connect additional joints of drill pipe to the drill stem during drilling operations, enabling
drilling with three joints of drill pipe compared to traditionally drilling with one joint of drill pipe. Additionally, the TDS facilitates horizontal and extended reach drilling.

Electric Rig Motors.

The Company has helped lead the application of AC motor technology in the oilfield industry. The Company buys motors from third parties and builds them in its own facilities
and is further developing motor technology, including the introduction of permanent magnet motor technology to the industry. These permanent magnet motors are being used in top drives, cranes, mud pumps, winches, and drawworks.

Rotary Equipment

. The alternative to using a TDS to rotate the drill stem is to use a rotary table, which rotates the pipe at the floor of
the rig. Rig Technology produces rotary tables as well as kelly bushings and master bushings for most sizes of kellys and makes of rotary tables. In 1998, the Company introduced the Rotary Support Table for use on rigs with a TDS. The Rotary Support
Table is used in concert with the TDS to completely eliminate the need for the larger conventional rotary table.

Pipe Handling
Systems

. Pipe racking systems are used to handle drill pipe, casing and tubing on a drilling rig. Vertical pipe racking systems move drill pipe and casing between the well and a storage (“racking”) area on the rig floor.
Horizontal racking systems are used to handle tubulars while stored horizontally (for example, on the pipe deck of an offshore rig) and transport tubulars up to the rig floor and into a vertical position for use in the drilling process.

Vertical pipe racking systems are used predominantly on offshore rigs and are found on almost all floating rigs. Mechanical vertical pipe racking systems
greatly reduce the manual effort involved in pipe handling. Pipe racking systems, introduced by the Company in 1985, provide a fully automated mechanism for handling and racking drill pipe during drilling and tripping operations, spinning and
torquing drill pipe, and automatic hoisting and racking of disconnected joints of drill pipe. These functions can be integrated via computer controlled sequencing, and operated by a driller in an environmentally secure cabin. An important element of
this system is the Iron Roughneck, which was originally introduced by the Company in 1976 and is an automated device that makes pipe connections on the rig floor and requires less direct involvement of rig floor personnel in potentially dangerous
operations. The Automated Roughneck is an automated microprocessor-controlled version of the Iron Roughneck.



Horizontal pipe transfer systems were introduced by the Company in 1993. They include the Pipe Deck Machine
(“PDM”), which is used to manipulate and move tubulars while stored in a horizontal position; the Pipe Transfer Conveyor (“PTC”), which transports sections of pipe to the rig floor; and a Pickup Laydown System (“PLS”),
which raises the pipe to a vertical position for transfer to a vertical racking system. These components may be employed separately, or incorporated together to form a complete horizontal racking system, known as the Pipe Transfer System
(“PTS”).

Pipe Handling Tools

. The Company’s pipe handling tools are designed to enhance the safety, efficiency and
reliability of pipe handling operations. Many of these tools have provided innovative methods of performing the designated task through mechanization of functions previously performed manually. The Rig Technology segment manufactures various tools
used to grip, hold, raise, and lower pipe, and in the making up and breaking out of drill pipe, workstrings, casing and production tubulars including spinning wrenches, manual tongs, torque wrenches and kelly spinners.

Mud Pumps.

Mud pumps are high pressure pumps located on the rig that force drilling mud down the drill pipe, through the drill bit, and up the
space between the drill pipe and the drilled formation (the “annulus”) back to the surface. These pumps, which generate pressures of up to 7,500 psi, must therefore be capable of displacing drilling fluids several thousand feet down and
back up the well bore. The conventional mud pump design, known as the triplex pump, uses three reciprocating pistons oriented horizontally. The Company has introduced the HEX™ Pump, which uses six pumping cylinders, versus the three used in the
triplex pump. Along with other design features, the greater number of cylinders reduces pulsations (or surges) and increases the output available from a given footprint. Reduced pulsation is desirable where downhole measurement equipment is being
used during the drilling process, as is often the case in directional drilling.

Hoisting Systems

. Hoisting systems are used to raise
or lower the drill stem while drilling or tripping, and to lower casing into the wellbore. The drawworks is the heart of the hoisting system. It is a large winch that spools off or takes in the drilling line, which is in turn connected to the drill
stem at the top of the derrick. The drawworks also plays an important role in keeping the weight on the drill bit at a desired level. This task is particularly challenging on offshore drilling rigs, which are subject to wave motion. To address this,
the Company has introduced the AHD™ Active Heave Drilling Drawworks. The AHD Drawworks uses computer-controlled motors to compensate for the motion experienced in offshore drilling operations.

Cranes.

The Company provides a comprehensive range of crane solutions, with purpose-built products for all segments of the oil and gas industry as
well as many other markets. The Company encompasses a broad collection of brand names with international recognition, and includes a large staff of engineers specializing in the design of cranes and related equipment. The product range extends from
small cargo-handling cranes to the world’s largest marine cranes. In all, the Company provides over twenty crane product lines that include standard model configurations as well as custom-engineered and specialty cranes.

Motion Compensation Systems

. Traditionally, motion compensation equipment is located on top of the drilling rig and serves to stabilize the
bit on the bottom of the hole, increasing drilling effectiveness of floating offshore rigs by compensating for wave and wind action. The AHD Drawworks, discussed above, was introduced to eliminate weight and improve safety, removing the compensator
from the top of the rig and integrating it into the drawworks system. In addition to the AHD Drawworks, the Company has introduced an Active Heave Compensation (“AHC”) System that goes beyond the capabilities of the AHD Drawworks to handle
the most severe weather. Additionally, the Company’s tensioning systems provide continuous axial tension to the marine riser pipe (larger diameter pipe which connects floating drilling rigs to the well on the ocean floor) and guide lines on
floating drilling rigs, tension leg platforms and jack-up drilling rigs.

Blowout Preventers (BOPs)

. BOPs are devices used to seal
the space between the drill pipe and the borehole and, if necessary, to also shear the drill pipe itself to prevent blowouts (uncontrolled flows of formation fluids and gases to the surface). The Rig Technology segment manufactures a wide array of
BOPs used in various applications from deepwater offshore vessels to land rigs. Ram and annular BOPs are back-up devices that are activated only if other techniques for controlling pressure in the wellbore are inadequate. When closed, these devices
prevent normal rig drilling operations. Ram BOPs seal the wellbore by hydraulically closing rams (thick heavy blocks of steel) against each other across the wellbore. Specially designed packers seal around specific sizes of pipe in the wellbore,
shear pipe in the wellbore or close off an open hole. Annular BOPs seal the wellbore by hydraulically closing a rubber packing unit around the drill pipe or kelly or by sealing against itself if nothing is in the hole.

In 1998, the Company introduced the NXT

TM

ram type BOP which eliminates door bolts, providing significant weight, rig-time, and space savings. Its unique
features make subsea operation more efficient through faster ram configuration changes. In 2004, the Company introduced the LXT

TM

ram type of BOP, which features many of the design elements of the NXT

TM

, but is targeted at the land market. Over the past 5 years
considerable focus has been placed on robustness and reliability in the fundamental design of the equipment with extensive testing being performed in the new R&D facility opened in 2012. In 2013, the Company acquired the T3 BOP product line
further expanding its market offering of reliable, field proven designs for land based drilling applications.



The ShearMax

TM

line of low force BOP shear rams released in 2010 add substantial tubular shearing capability to the Company’s
line of pressure control equipment, including the capability to shear large drill pipe tool joints, previously unheard of in the industry. This innovative shear blade design utilizes patented “Puncture Technology” to reduce the shearing
pressures 50% or more and in some cases as much as five times lower. The ShearMax Blind shear provides a shear-and-seal design for drill pipe, while the Casing and TJC shears address casing up to 16” OD and most tool joints up to 2” wall
thickness, respectively.

Derricks and Substructures.

Drilling activities are carried out from a drilling rig. A drilling rig
consists of one or two derricks; the substructure that supports the derrick(s); and the rig package, which consists of the various pieces of equipment discussed above. Rig Technology designs, fabricates and services derricks used in both onshore and
offshore applications, and substructures used in onshore applications. The Rig Technology segment also works with shipyards in the fabrication of substructures for offshore drilling rigs.

Instrumentation

. The Company’s Instrumentation business provides drilling rig operators real time measurement and
monitoring of critical parameters required to improve rig safety and efficiency. In 1999, the Company introduced its
RigSense

TM

Wellsite Information System, which combines
leading hardware and software technologies into an integrated drilling rig package. Access of drilling data is provided to offsite locations, enabling company personnel to monitor drilling operations from an office environment, through a secure
link. Systems are both sold and rented, and are comprised of hazardous area sensors placed throughout the rig to measure critical drilling parameters; all networked back to a central command station for review, recording and interpretation. The
Company offers unique business integration services to directly integrate information into business applications that improves accuracy and assists drilling contractors in managing their drilling business. Reports on drilling activities and
processes are now provided from the rig site as a part of the DrillSuite™ business solution to allow contractors to streamline administration by eliminating manual entry of data, promotes accurate payroll processing and invoicing, and includes
asset tracking and preventive maintenance management through its RigMS™ solution. The real time information provided also allows the Company to advance the drilling process using advanced drilling algorithms and electronic controls such as our
Wildcat™ Auto Drilling System for better execution of the well plan, enhanced rates of penetration, reduced program costs, and improved wellbore quality. Complementing the Company’s surface solutions is a portfolio of Down-Hole
Instrumentation (“DHI”) products for both straight-hole and directional markets. Key advancements in this area include the introduction of the Company’s time saving E-Totco™ Electronic Drift Recorder, which serves as an
electronic equivalent to the traditional mechanical drift tool that the Company has offered since 1929.

Coiled Tubing
Equipment

. Coiled tubing consists of flexible steel tubing manufactured in a continuous string and spooled on a reel. It can extend several thousand feet in length and is run in and out of the wellbore at a high rate of speed by a
hydraulically operated coiled tubing unit. A coiled tubing unit is typically mounted on a truck, semi-trailer or skid (steel frames on which portable equipment is mounted to facilitate handling with cranes for offshore use) and consists of a
hydraulically operated tubing reel or drum, an injector head which pushes or pulls the tubing in or out of the wellbore, and various power and control systems. Coiled tubing is typically used with sophisticated pressure control equipment which
permits the operator to perform workover operations on a live well. The Rig Technology segment manufactures and sells both coiled tubing units and the ancillary pressure control equipment used in these operations. Through its acquisition of Rolligon
in late 2006, the Company enhanced its portfolio by adding additional pressure pumping and coiled tubing equipment products.

Currently, most
coiled tubing units are used in well remediation and completion applications. The Company believes that advances in the manufacturing process of coiled tubing, tubing fatigue protection and the capability to manufacture larger diameter and increased
wall thickness coiled tubing strings have resulted in increased uses and applications for coiled tubing products. For example, some well operators are now using coiled tubing in drilling applications such as slim hole re-entries of existing wells.
The Company engineered and manufactured the first coiled tubing units built specifically for coiled tubing drilling in 1996.

Generally, the
Rig Technology segment supplies customers with the equipment and components necessary to use coiled tubing, which the customers typically purchase separately. The Rig Technology segment’s coiled tubing product line consists of coiled tubing
units, coiled tubing pressure control equipment, pressure pumping equipment, snubbing units (which are units that force tubulars into a well when pressure is contained within the wellbore), nitrogen pumping equipment and cementing, stimulation,
fracturing and blending equipment.

Wireline Equipment

. The Company’s wireline products include wireline drum units, which
consist of a spool or drum of wireline cable, mounted in a mobile vehicle or skid, which works in conjunction with a source of power (an engine mounted in the vehicle or within a separate “power pack” skid). The wireline drum unit is used
to spool wireline cable into or out of a well, in order to perform surveys inside the well, sample fluids from the bottom of the well, retrieve or replace components from inside the well, or to perform other well remediation or survey operations.
The wireline used may be “slick line”, which is conventional single-strand steel cable used to convey tools in or out of the well, or “electric line”, which contains an imbedded single-conductor or multi-conductor electrical line
which permits communication between the surface and electronic instruments attached to the end of the wireline at the bottom of the well.



Wireline units are usually used in conjunction with a variety of other pressure control equipment which
permit safe access into wells while they are flowing and under pressure at the surface. The Company engineers and manufactures a broad range of pressure control equipment for wireline operations, including wireline blowout preventers, strippers,
packers, lubricators and grease injection units. Additionally, the Company makes wireline rigging equipment such as mast trucks.

Stimulation Equipment

. The Company’s stimulation products include fracturing pumps, acid units, frac blenders, combo units, hydration,
chemical additive systems as well as services and parts. The Company acquired Enerflow Industries, Inc. (“Enerflow”) in May 2012. Enerflow operates out of facilities in Calgary, AB, Tulsa, OK and Houston, TX. Enerflow produces frac pumpers
(including truck, trailer, and skid mounted units) as well as cementing units, acidizing units, nitrogen units, and small amounts of well servicing rigs, integrated mud systems and coiled tubing equipment.

Turret Mooring Systems.

The Company acquired Advanced Production and Loading PLC (“APL”), in December 2010. APL, based in Norway,
designs and manufactures turret mooring systems and other products for FPSOs and other offshore vessels and terminals. A turret mooring system consists of a geostatic part attached to the seabed and a rotating part integrated in the hull of the
FPSO, which are connected and allow the ship to weathervane (rotate) around the turret.

Flexible Pipe Systems.

The Company acquired
NKT Flexibles I/S (“NKT”) in April 2012. NKT designs and manufactures flexible pipe products and systems for the offshore oil and gas industry, including products associated with FPSO’s and other offshore vessels, as well as subsea
production systems including flow-lines and flexible risers.

Facilities.

The Company’s Rig Technology segment conducts
manufacturing operations at major facilities in Houston, Galena Park, Sugar Land, Conroe, Cedar Park, Anderson, Fort Worth and Pampa, Texas; Duncan, Oklahoma; Orange, California; Edmonton, Canada; Aberdeen, Scotland; Kristiansand, Stavanger and
Arendal, Norway; Etten-Leur and Groot-Ammers, the Netherlands; Carquefou, France; Singapore; Shanghai, China; Dubai, UAE; and Ulsan, South Korea. For a more detailed listing of significant facilities see Item 2. “Properties”. The Rig
Technology segment maintains sales and service offices in most major oilfield markets, either directly or through agents.

Customers and
Competition.

Rig Technology sells directly to drilling contractors, rig fabricators, well servicing companies, pressure pumping companies, national oil companies, major and independent oil and gas companies, and also through distribution
companies. Demand for its products is strongly dependent upon capital spending plans by oil and gas companies and drilling contractors, and the level of oil and gas well drilling activity.

The products of the Rig Technology segment are sold in highly competitive markets and its sales and earnings can be affected by competitive actions such as price changes, new product development, or
improved availability and delivery. The segment’s primary competitors are Aker Solutions; American Electric Technologies; American Block; AXON Energy Products; Bentec (a division of Abbot Group); Bomco; Canrig (a division of Nabors Industries);
Cavins Oil Well Tools; Cameron International; Coflexip (a division of Technip); Den-Con Tool Company; Forum Energy Technologies; General Electric; Global Energy Services; Hitec Products; Honghua; Huisman; Liebherr; Parveen Industries; Pason Systems;
Omron Corporation; Rolls Royce; Siemens; Stewart & Stevenson; Soilmec and Drillmec (a part of the Trevi Group); Seatrax; Tesco Corporation; Wärtsilä and Weatherford International. Management believes that the principal competitive
factors affecting its Rig Technology segment are performance, quality, reputation, customer service, availability of spare parts and consumables, breadth of product line and price.

Petroleum Services & Supplies

The Company provides a broad range of support
equipment, spare parts, consumables and services through the Petroleum Services & Supplies segment. Petroleum Services & Supplies segment sells directly and provides a variety of tubular services, composite tubing, and coiled
tubing to oil and gas producers, national oil companies, drilling contractors, well servicing companies, and tubular processors, manufacturers and distributors. These include inspection and reclamation services for drill pipe, casing, production
tubing, sucker rods and line pipe at drilling and workover rig locations, at yards owned by its customers, at steel mills and processing facilities that manufacture tubular goods, and at facilities which it owns. The Company also provides internal
coating of tubular goods at several coating plants worldwide and through licensees in certain locations. Additionally, the Company designs, manufactures and sells high pressure fiberglass and composite tubulars for use in corrosive applications and
coiled tubing for use in well servicing applications and connections for large diameter conductor pipe.

The Company’s customers rely on
tubular inspection services to avoid failure of tubing, casing, flowlines, pipelines and drill pipe. Such tubular failures are expensive and in some cases catastrophic. The Company’s customers rely on internal coatings of tubular goods to
prolong the useful lives of tubulars and to increase the volumetric throughput of in-service tubular goods. The Company’s customers sometimes use fiberglass or composite tubulars in lieu of conventional steel tubulars, due to the
corrosion-resistant properties of fiberglass and other composite materials. Tubular inspection and coating services are used most frequently in operations in high-temperature, deep, corrosive oil and gas environments. In selecting a provider of
tubular inspection and tubular coating services, oil and gas operators consider such factors as reputation, experience, technology of products offered, reliability and price.



The Petroleum Services & Supplies segment also provides products and services that are used in the
course of drilling oil and gas wells. The NOV Downhole business sells and rents bits, drilling motors and specialized downhole tools that are incorporated into the drill stem during drilling operations, and are also used during fishing, well
intervention, re-entry, and well completion operations. The Wellsite Services business provides products and services such as drilling fluids, highly-engineered solids control equipment, waste handling and treatment, completion fluids, power
generation equipment, and other ancillary well site equipment and services. Wellsite Services is also engaged in barium sulfate (“barite”) mining operations in the State of Nevada. Barite is an inert powder material used as the primary
weighting agent in drilling fluids. Additionally, efficient separation of drill cuttings enables the re-use of often costly drilling fluids. The Pumps & Expendables business provides centrifugal, reciprocating, and progressing cavity pumps
and pump expendables (“Pumps & Expendables”) into the global oil and gas and industrial markets.

Solids Control and
Waste Management

. The Company is engaged in the provision of highly-engineered equipment, products and services which separate and manage drill cuttings produced by the drilling process (“Solids Control”). Drill cuttings are usually
contaminated with petroleum or drilling fluids, and must be disposed of in an environmentally sound manner.

Fluids Services.

The
Company acquired the Spirit group of companies in May 2009 (“Spirit”) and Ambar in January 2010. Both are engaged in the provision of drilling fluids, completion fluids and other related services. This division is also engaged in barite
mining operations. Drilling fluids are designed and used to maintain well bore stability while drilling, control downhole pressure, drill bit lubrication, and as a drill cuttings displacement medium. Completion fluids are used to clean the well bore
and stimulate production.

Portable Power.

The acquisition of Welch Sales and Service, Inc. in 2008 placed Wellsite Services in the
power generation and temperature control business. The Portable Power division provides rental equipment for use in the upstream oil and gas industry, refinery and petrochemical, construction, events, disaster relief and other industries.

Tubular Coating

. The Company develops, manufactures and applies its proprietary tubular coatings, known as
Tube-Kote

®

coatings, to new and used tubulars. Tubular coatings help prevent corrosion of tubulars by providing
a tough plastic shield to isolate steel from corrosive oilfield fluids such as CO


, H


S and
brine. Delaying or preventing corrosion extends the life of existing tubulars, reduces the frequency of well remediation and reduces expensive interruptions in production. In addition, coatings are designed to increase the fluid flow rate through
tubulars by decreasing or eliminating paraffin and scale build-up, which can reduce or block oil flow in producing wells. The smooth inner surfaces of coated tubulars often increase the fluid through-put on certain high-rate oil and gas wells by
reducing friction and turbulence. The Company’s reputation for supplying quality internal coatings is an important factor in its business, since the failure of coatings can lead to expensive production delays and premature tubular failure. In
2005, the Company created a 60%-owned joint venture in China with the Huabei Petroleum Administration Bureau, which coats Chinese produced drill pipe using the Company’s proprietary coatings. In 2007, the joint venture opened a second coating
plant in Jiangyin City, China.

In addition to the Company’s TK

TM

coatings, it also has complementary corrosion control products and
services including TK Liners, Tubo-Wrap™, and KC-IPC Connections. TK Liners are fiberglass-reinforced tubes which are inserted into steel line pipe. This safeguards the pipe against corrosion and extends the life of the pipeline. In conjunction
with the Thru-Kote

TM

connection system customers can weld
a sleeve for a continuous fiberglass lined pipeline. Tubo-Wrap is a high performance external coating that protects the pipe during installation and from corrosion once the pipeline is in place. KC-IPC Connections use a modified American Petroleum
Institute (“API”) coupling to create a “gas-tight” seal that prevents corrosion and turbulence in the critical connections of tubulars while protecting the internal plastic coating at the highly loaded contact points.

Tubular Inspection.

Newly manufactured pipe sometimes contains serious defects that are not detected at the mill. In addition, pipe can be damaged
in transit and during handling prior to use at the well site. As a result, exploration and production companies often have new tubulars inspected before they are placed in service to reduce the risk of tubular failures during drilling, completion,
or production of oil and gas wells. Used tubulars are inspected by the Company to detect service-induced flaws after the tubulars are removed from operation. Used drill pipe and used tubing inspection programs allow operators to replace defective
lengths, thereby prolonging the life of the remaining pipe and saving the customer the cost of unnecessary tubular replacements and expenses related to tubular failures.

Tubular inspection services employ all major non-destructive inspection techniques, including electromagnetic, ultrasonic, magnetic flux leakage and gamma ray. These inspection services are provided both
by mobile units which work at the wellhead as used tubing is removed from a well, and at fixed site tubular inspection locations. The Company provides an ultrasonic inspection service for detecting potential fatigue cracks in the end area of used
drill pipe, the portion of the pipe that traditionally has been the most difficult to inspect. Tubular inspection facilities also offer a wide range of related services, such as API thread inspection, ring and plug gauging, and a complete line of
reclamation services necessary to return tubulars to useful service, including tubular cleaning and straightening, hydrostatic testing and re-threading.



In addition, the Company applies hardbanding material to drill pipe, to enhance its
wear characteristics and reduce downhole casing wear as a result of the drilling process. In 2002, the Company introduced its proprietary line of hardbanding material, TCS 8000

™

. The Company also cleans, straightens, inspects and coats sucker rods at 11 facilities throughout the Western Hemisphere. Additionally, new sucker rods are inspected
before they are placed into service, to avoid premature failure, which can cause the oil well operator to have to pull and replace the sucker rod.

Machining Services.

In 2005, the Company acquired Turner Oilfield Services and expanded our product offering into thread repair, tool joint rebuilding and sub manufacturing. Since then the Company
has made strategic acquisitions of Hendershot and Mid-South and has expanded its machining services internally to develop a “one-stop-shop” concept for its drill pipe customers. Thread repair services include rotary shouldered and premium
connections. The Company is licensed to perform thread repair services for API and proprietary connections. Tool joint rebuilding is a unique process to restore worn drill pipe tool joints, drill collars and heavy weight drill pipe to the original
specifications to extend the service life of those assets. The Company manufactures downhole tools and is API licensed for this process in several locations.

In November 2009, the Company acquired South Seas Inspection (S) Pte. Ltd., (“SSI”) and certain assets of its Brazilian affiliate. SSI provides a wide array of oilfield services including
rig and derrick construction, derrick inspection and maintenance, drops surveys and load testing at the rig through the use of rope access technicians. This acquisition adds multiple new services and allows the Company to grow this business by
leveraging existing relationships and infrastructure. These operations are based out of Singapore with branch offices in Baku, Azerbaijan and Aktau, Kazkhstan as well as a representative office in Vietnam. The highly trained workforce is completely
mobile and provides these services worldwide.

Mill Systems and Sales.

The Company engineers and fabricates inspection equipment
for steel mills, which it sells and rents. The equipment is used for quality control purposes to detect defects in the pipe during the high-speed manufacturing process. Each piece of mill inspection equipment is designed to customer specifications
and is installed and serviced by the Company.

Drill Pipe Products.

As a result of its April 2008
acquisition of Grant Prideco, the Company manufactures and sells a variety of drill stem products used for the drilling of oil and gas wells. The principal products sold by Drill Pipe Products are: (i) drill pipe, (ii) drill collars and
heavyweight drill pipe and (iii) drill stem accessories including tool joints. Drill pipe is the principal tool, other than the rig, required for the drilling of an oil or gas well. Its primary purpose is to connect the above-surface drilling
rig to the drill bit. A drilling rig will typically have an inventory of 10,000 to 30,000 feet of drill pipe depending on the size and service requirements of the rig. Joints of drill pipe are connected to each other with a welded-on tool joint to
form what is commonly referred to as the drill string or drill stem.

When a drilling rig is operating, motors mounted on the
rig rotate the drill pipe and drill bit. In addition to connecting the drilling rig to the drill bit, drill pipe provides a mechanism to steer the drill bit and serves as a conduit for drilling fluids and cuttings. Drill pipe is a capital good that
can be used for the drilling of multiple wells. Once a well is completed, the drill pipe may be used again and again to drill other wells until the drill pipe becomes damaged or wears out.

In recent years, the depth and complexity of the wells customers drill, as well as the specifications and requirements of the drill
pipe they purchase, have substantially increased. A majority of the drill pipe sold is required to meet specifications exceeding minimum API standards. The Company offers a broad line of premium drilling products designed for the offshore,
international and domestic drilling markets. The Company’s premium drilling products include its proprietary lines of
XT

TM

and TurboTorque

TM

connections and large diameter drill pipe that delivers hydraulic
performance superior to standard sizes.

Drill collars are used in the drilling process to place weight on the drill bit for better control
and penetration. Drill collars are located directly above the drill bit and are manufactured from a solid steel bar to provide necessary weight.

Heavyweight drill pipe is a thick-walled seamless tubular product that is less rigid than a drill collar. Heavyweight drill pipe provides a gradual transition between the heavier drill collar and the
lighter drill pipe.

The Company also provides subs, pup joints (short and odd-sized tubular products) and other drill stem accessories. These
products all perform special functions within the drill string as part of the drilling process.



NOV IntelliServ.

NOV IntelliServ is a joint venture between the Company and
Schlumberger, Ltd. in which the Company holds a 55% interest and maintains operational control. NOV IntelliServ provides wellbore data transmission services that enable high-speed communication up and down the drill string throughout drilling and
completion operations that are undertaken during the construction of oil and gas wells. NOV IntelliServ’s core product, “The IntelliServ

TM

Broadband Network”, was commercialized in February 2006 and incorporates various proprietary mechanical and
electrical components into the Company’s premium drilling tubulars to enable data transmission rates that are currently up to 20,000 times faster than mud pulse, the current industry standard. The IntelliServ Broadband Network also permits
virtually unlimited real-time actuation of drilling tools and sensors at the bottom of the drill string, a process that conventionally requires the time consuming return of tools to the surface. NOV IntelliServ offers its products and services on a
rental basis to oil and gas operators.

Voest-Alpine Tubulars (“VAT”)

. VAT is a joint venture between the Company and
the Austrian based Voestalpine Group. The Company has a 50.01% investment in the joint venture which is located in Kindberg, Austria. VAT owns a tubular mill with an annual capacity of approximately 380,000 metric tons and is the primary
supplier of green tubes for our U.S. based production. In addition to producing green tubes, VAT produces seamless tubular products for the OCTG market and non-OCTG products used in the automotive, petrochemical, construction, mining, tunneling
and transportation industries.

VAT is accounted for under the equity-method of accounting due to the minority owner having substantive
participating rights. Under a limited partnership operating agreement the Company has no rights to unilaterally take any action with respect to its investment and the day to day operations of VAT are under the direction of a Management Board, whose
members are determined principally by the minority owner. The Management Board is responsible for planning, production, sales and general personal matters, which represent substantive participating rights that overcome the presumption that the
Company should consolidate its 50.01% investment.

Fiberglass & Composite Tubulars.

When compared to
conventional carbon steel and even corrosion-resistant alloys, resin-impregnated fiberglass and other modern plastic composites often exhibit superior resistance to corrosion. Some producers manage the corrosive fluids sometimes found in oil and gas
fields by utilizing composite or fiberglass tubing, casing and line pipe in the operations of their fields. In 1997, the Company acquired Fiber Glass Systems, a leading provider of high pressure fiberglass tubulars used in oilfield applications, to
further serve the tubular corrosion prevention needs of its customers. Fiber Glass Systems has manufactured fiberglass pipe since 1968 under the name Star

TM

, and was the first manufacturer of high-pressure fiberglass pipe to be licensed by the API in 1992. Through further
acquisitions and investments in technologies, the Company has extended its fiberglass and composite tubing offering into industrial and marine applications, in addition to its oilfield market.

In 2011, the Company acquired Ameron International Corporation (“Ameron”) which allowed it to expand its Fiberglass & Composite
Tubulars business. See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding acquisitions made by the Company in 2011. Ameron’s Fiberglass-Composite Pipe business, which is now part of the Company’s Fiber Glass Systems
business, develops, manufactures and markets filament-wound and molded fiberglass pipe and fittings. These products are used by a wide range of process industries, including industrial, petroleum, chemical processing and petrochemical industries,
and for service station piping systems, but predominantly aboard marine vessels, FPSOs and offshore oil platforms, and are marketed as an alternative to metallic piping systems which ultimately fail under corrosive operating conditions.

In 2012, the Company acquired Fiberspar Corporation (“Fiberspar”). See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information
regarding acquisitions made by the Company in 2012. Fiberspar, which is now part of the Company’s Fiber Glass Systems business, manufactures and sells fiberglass-reinforced spoolable pipe to the oil and gas industry. This fiberglass-reinforced
spoolable pipe provides a reliable, corrosion-resistant, cost-effective solution for tubulars used during the production and transportation of oil and gas. Fiberspar has manufacturing plants in Houston, TX and Johnstown, Colorado, with 17 deployment
centers (stocking locations) for its products in the U.S., Canada and Australia.

Coiled Tubing.

Coiled tubing provides a number of
significant functional advantages over the principal alternatives of conventional drill pipe and workover pipe. Coiled tubing allows faster “tripping,” since the coiled tubing can be reeled quickly on and off a drum and in and out of a
wellbore. In addition, the small size of the coiled tubing unit compared to an average workover rig or drilling rig reduces preparation time at the well site. Coiled tubing permits a variety of workover and other operations to be performed without
having to pull the existing production tubing from the well and allows ease of operation in horizontal or highly deviated wells. Thus, operations using coiled tubing can be performed much more quickly and, in many instances, at a significantly lower
cost. Finally, use of coiled tubing generally allows continuous production of the well, eliminating the need to temporarily stop the flow of hydrocarbons. As a result, the economics of a workover are improved because the well can continue to produce
hydrocarbons and thus produce revenues while the well treatments are occurring. Continuous production also reduces the risk of formation damage which can occur when the flow of fluids is stopped or isolated. Under normal operating conditions, the
coiled tubing string must be replaced every three to four months. The Company designs, manufactures, and sells coiled tubing under the Quality Tubing brand name at its mill in Houston, Texas.



NOV Downhole.

The NOV Downhole business unit combines a wide array of drilling and intervention tool
product lines with the drill bit, coring services, borehole enlargement and drilling dynamics/drilling optimization service lines previously consolidated within the ReedHycalog business unit of Grant Prideco.

The broad spectrum of bottom hole assembly (“BHA”) components offered by NOV Downhole is unique within the industry and is the result of the
Company’s strategic consolidation of several key acquisitions, including: NQL Energy Services, Inc., a leading manufacturer and provider of downhole drilling tools; Gammaloy Holdings, L.P., a manufacturer and provider of non-magnetic drill
collars and other related products; Robbins & Myers, a manufacturer and provider of power section, and the ReedHycalog, Corion, and Andergauge business units of Grant Prideco, a global leader in the design, manufacture and provision of
drill bits, variable gauge stabilizers, hydraulically and mechanically actuated under-reamers, specialty coring services and downhole vibration mitigation services.

NOV Downhole manufactures fixed cutter and roller cone drill bits and services its customer base through a technical sales and marketing network in virtually every significant oil and gas producing region
of the world. It provides fixed-cutter bit technology under various brand names including Seeker™ directional drill bits, Fusetek™ hybrid drill bits, DuraDiamond™ impregnated bits and Titan™ Ultra aimed at larger bit
applications. One of its most important fixed cutter drill bit innovations is a patented manufacturing process that has significantly enhanced the capability of polycrystalline diamond (PDC) cutters. The TReX™, Raptor™,
Duraforce™ XD and Helios™ family of cutter technologies increase abrasion resistance (wear life) and thermal abrasion resistance without sacrificing impact resistance (toughness). This technology provides a diamond surface that
maintains a sharp, low-wear cutting edge, producing drilling results that exceed conventional standards for PDC bit performance. The Company licenses its manufacturing process to most other providers of PDC bits.

The Company produces roller-cone bits for a wide variety of oil, gas and geothermal drilling applications. Roller-cone bits consist of three
rotating cones that have cutting elements, which penetrate the formation through a crushing action as the cones rotate in conjunction with the rotation of the drill pipe or drive system. This cutting mechanism is more suitable than that of
fixed cutter bits when drilling large holes, very soft shales, harder formations, or where the geology is changing. NOV Downhole manufactures roller-cone bits with milled teeth for soft formations and with tungsten carbide inserts for harder
formations. It also manufactures a unique patented line of bits using a powder-metal forging technology, sold under the brand TuffCutter™. It markets its roller-cone products and technology globally under various brand names including
RockForce™, Titan and TuffCutter.

NOV Downhole designs, manufacturers and services a wide array of downhole motors used in straight
hole, directional, slim hole, and coiled tubing drilling applications. These motors are sold or leased under the NOV Downhole brand name. The Company also maintains a wide variety of motor power sections, including its proprietary PowerPlus™
and HemiDril™ and Robbins and Myers ERT™ rotors and stators which it incorporates into its own motors as well as sells to third parties. Downhole drilling motors utilize hydraulic horsepower from the drilling fluid pumped down the drill
stem to develop torque at the bit. Motors are capable of achieving higher rotary velocities than can generally be achieved using conventional surface rotary equipment. Motors are often used in conjunction with high speed PDC bits to improve rates of
penetration.

A key growth segment interlinked with the drilling motor business is Power Sections. NOV Downhole is one of the largest Power
Section providers globally with the broadest portfolio of technology enabling drilling efficiency advances for every market segment. Our global Power Section manufacturing and supply footprint enables improved asset utilization for our customers by
shortening service deliveries times. The Power Section Product Line sells products (rotors and stators) and services (relines for stators and re-surfacing for rotors) to 3rd party customers and the NOV Downhole motor rental fleet. This is offered
for both Conventional and ERT Power Sections.

With the natural evolution of mature fields around the world, NOV Downhole is well positioned
to address the sustained growth of Intervention and Well Workovers with a comprehensive offering of industry leading Bowen™ Brand Fishing and Thru-Tubing Tools. We sell and rent Fishing and Thru-Tubing tools to perform retrieval of stuck tools,
remove debris, mill bridge plugs and other devices, cut and retrieve tubing and casing, manipulate well flow control devices and much more. Our recently launched TERRAFORCE™ combination Coiled Tubing Milling Jar is proving to be one of our most
successful product launches although that can be largely attributed to plug milling work in hydraulically fractured wells.



With the unparalleled growth we have seen in the unconventional hydrocarbons segment over the last decade,
the need for our customers to be able to work the BHA to bottom in long horizontal sections has proved to be crucial. This is why we have seen unheralded growth and phenomenal demand for NOV’s AGITATOR™ axial oscillation tool, most notably
in the North American shale plays. The AGITATOR oscillation tool gently oscillates the Bottom Hole Assembly to significantly improve weight transfer and reduce friction. This improves weight transfer and reduces stick-slip in all modes of drilling,
but especially when oriented drilling with a steerable motor. The AGITATOR oscillation tool provides BHA excitement to improve weight transfer to the bit. Extends the boundaries of extended reach and horizontal drilling with motors. The AGITATOR
tool has also been similarly successful when deployed on Coiled Tubing to enable optimum weight-on-tool perform post-fracturing milling and well cleanout work. Additionally a new application of Fishing-with-AGITATOR and associated tools is now
proliferating worldwide with very high levels of success, the attributes of the AGITATOR (i.e. low impact, high frequency,) ideally compliments the high impact low frequency of traditional fishing jars.

NOV Downhole also manufactures and sells drilling jars, shock tools, bumper subs and a range of other conventional drilling tools such as non-magnetic
drill collars. Drilling jars are placed in the drill string, where they can be used to generate a sudden, jarring motion to free the drill string should it become stuck in the wellbore during the drilling process. This jarring motion is generated
using hydraulic and/or mechanical force provided at the surface.

Through its Coring Services business line, NOV Downhole offers coring
solutions that enable the extraction of actual rock samples from a drilled well bore and allow geologists to examine the formations at the surface. One of the coring services utilized is the Company’s unique Corion Express™ system which
allows the customer to drill and core a well without tripping pipe. Corion Express utilizes wireline retrievable drilling and coring elements which allow the system to transform from a drilling assembly to a coring assembly and also to wireline
retrieve the geological core. This capability enables customers to save significant time and expense during the drilling and coring process.

NOV Downhole manufactures, sells and rents electronic tools (eTools) to provide directional and drilling dynamics data to the drilling service companies
and O&G Operators while they are drilling a well. Directional Sensors, Steering Tools, Magnetic Multi-shot Tools and Electromagnetic Measurement-While-Drilling Systems are produced by NOV Downhole. These directional eTools, provide a downhole
measurement of the azimuth (Magnetic North), well inclination and tool face measurements and store the data in memory or utilize a telemetry pathway (mud pulse, conductive wireline, electromagnetic or Intelliserv Wired Drill Pipe) to transmit the
downhole data to the surface. The drilling dynamics tools measures downhole vibration, weight, torque, pressure, temperature, bending and rotational speed and either stores the data in memory or utilizes a telemetry pathway to get the downhole data
to the surface. At the surface this data is analyzed and utilized to optimize the well trajectory and to improve the drilling rate-of-penetration by minimizing the bottom hole assembly vibration and by optimizing the drilling weight, torque and RPM.

NOV Downhole offers a wide variety of industry leading technologies to enable customers to enlarge the diameter of a drilled hole below a
restriction (typically a casing string) via its Borehole Enlargement business line. Borehole enlargement services are typically utilized in deep water drilling where customers wish to maximize the size of each successive casing string in order to
preserve a relatively large completion hole size through which to produce hydrocarbons from the reservoir. Borehole enlargement is also employed where customers wish to reduce the fluid velocity and pressure within the well-bore annulus to reduce
the risk of formation erosion or accidental fracture. Borehole Enlargement provides bi-centered drill bits, expandable reamers (marketed under the AnderReamer™ brand name) and associated equipment along with well-site service technicians who
deliver 24 hour support during hole enlargement operations.

The Integrated Solutions & Optimization group combines two initiatives
to add more value to the NOV Downhole portfolio – the ADS expertise in downhole vibration measurement analysis, and the Strategic Integrated Solution methodology for establishing a systems approach to solving client challenges. This high
performing Team uses optimization tools and personnel to establish value differentiation between NOV Downhole products and those of the competition. The focus is on the client needs and buying habits, with the intent of maximizing our participation
in the current market and being the preferred supplier in a down market. This approach can be utilized strategically within ‘conventional’ districts to grow revenue / market share, but also is a key foundation for the overall Tiered
Solutions strategy where we start to supply solutions to drilling challenges, not just tools.

The Performance Drilling and Directional

system to streamline the acquisition process from requisition to procurement to payment, by digitally managing approval routing and workflow, and by providing robust reporting functionality.

With its recent acquisitions, more than 80% of Distribution Services segment’s sales were in the United States and Canada. The remainder comes from key international markets in Latin America,
the North Sea, Middle East, Africa and the Far East. The Distribution Services business unit has now expanded into oilfields in over 20 countries. Approximately 10% of its revenue is from the resale of goods manufactured by other segments
within the Company. The balance is from the sale of goods manufactured by third parties.

Distribution Services increases revenue and enhances
customer alliances by continuously expanding product and service solutions and creating differentiated value propositions. The business unit leverages its extensive purchasing power to reduce the cost of goods. It is strategically and
selectively expanding its sourcing network into low cost countries globally.

Transmission.

The Transmission business unit
supplies products and services used in the construction of water pipelines, lining, progressing cavity pumps, grinders, filters, and screens used in industrial applications, and artificial lift equipment and solutions used for increased oil and gas
production.

Within the Transmission business unit the Infrastructure Products business manufactures concrete cylinder pipe, prestressed
concrete cylinder pipe, steel pipe and reinforced concrete pipe for water transmission, storm and industrial waste water and sewage collection. Products are marketed directly using the Company’s own personnel, typically through competitive
bidding. The Company competes with several other manufacturers and also with alternative products such as ductile iron, plastic, and clay pipe; but ordinarily these other materials do not offer the full diameter range produced by the
Company. This business unit also includes the manufacturing of polyvinyl chloride and polyethylene sheet lining for the protection of concrete pipe and cast-in-place concrete structures from the corrosive effects of sewer gases, acids and
industrial chemicals.

The Infrastructure Products group also supplies ready-mix concrete, crushed and sized basaltic aggregates, dune sand and
concrete pipe, primarily to the construction industry in Hawaii. Ample raw materials for the aggregates and concrete products are typically available locally in Hawaii, and the business has exclusive rights to quarries containing many years’
reserves. The Infrastructure Products group also manufactures and markets concrete and steel poles for highway, street and outdoor area lighting and for traffic signals across the U.S. Within its market, there are competitors for each of
the business unit’s products. Sales of poles are nationwide, but with a stronger concentration in the western and southeastern U.S. The marketing of poles is handled by the business’ own sales force and by outside sales
agents. Competition for poles is mainly based on price and quality, but with some consideration for service and delivery.

Within the
Transmission business unit, the Mono business serves its customers in various industrial and oil and gas markets by design, manufacturing and distributing key products including progressing cavity pumps, grinders, screens, filters, well-head drives,
hydraulic pumping units, rod pumps, plunger lift systems and production automation systems and engineering related systems solutions. This business is highly diversified through its presence in oil and gas and industrial markets, which include
waste water treatment, mining, chemical processing, paper and pulp, agriculture, food and beverage, among others. The Mono business supports its international market and customer base through a mixed channel to market model, which includes both
direct sales and separate distribution partnership relationships and through National Oilwell Varco’s own network of supply branches. Mono is strengthening its offering by adding new artificial lift technologies, as well as measurement and
controls competencies. The 2013 acquisition of Robbins & Myers included the addition of the Moyno™ product line to the Mono business, expanding the progressive cavity pump product line. Additionally, the acquisition expanded the
business to include industrial mixing equipment, including mixers, agitators, and heat exchangers.



As part of the Robbins & Myers acquisition, the Transmission business unit also increased its

2013 Acquisitions and Other Investments

On February 20, 2013, the Company completed its acquisition of all of the shares of Robbins & Myers (“R&M”), Inc., a
U.S.-based designer and manufacturer of products and systems for the oil and gas industry. Under the merger agreement for this transaction, R&M shareholders received $60.00 in cash for each common share for an aggregate purchase price of $2,378
million, net of cash acquired.

The Company has included the financial results of R&M in its consolidated financial statements as of the
date of acquisition with components of the R&M operations included in the Company’s Rig Technology, Petroleum Services & Supplies and Distribution & Transmission segments. The Company believes the acquisition of R&M
will advance its strategic goal of providing a broader selection of products and services to its customers.

During 2013, in addition to
Robbins & Myers, the Company made the following acquisitions:

*

Purchased the remaining portion of joint venture.

The Company paid an aggregate purchase price of $2,397 million, net of cash acquired for acquisitions in 2013.



Seasonal Nature of the Company’s Business

Historically, the level of some of the Company’s segments have followed seasonal trends to some degree. In general, the Rig Technology segment has
not experienced significant seasonal fluctuation although orders for new equipment and aftermarket spare parts may be modestly affected by holiday schedules. There can be no guarantee that seasonal effects will not influence future sales in this
segment.

In Canada, the Petroleum Services & Supplies segment has typically realized high first quarter activity levels, as
operators take advantage of the winter freeze to gain access to remote drilling and production areas. In past years, certain Canadian businesses within Petroleum Services & Supplies and Distribution & Transmission have declined
during the second quarter due to warming weather conditions which resulted in thawing, softer ground, difficulty accessing drill sites, and road bans that curtailed drilling activity (“Canadian Breakup”). However, these segments have
typically rebounded in the third and fourth quarter. Petroleum Services & Supplies activity in both the U.S. and Canada sometimes increases during the third quarter and then peaks in the fourth quarter as operators spend the remaining
drilling and/or production capital budgets for that year. Petroleum Services & Supplies revenues in the Rocky Mountain region sometimes decline in the late fourth quarter or early first quarter due to harsh winter weather. The
segment’s fiberglass and composite tubulars business in China has typically declined in the first quarter due to the impact of weather on manufacturing and installation operations, and due to business slowdowns associated with the Chinese New
Year.

The Company anticipates that the seasonal trends described above will continue. However, there can be no guarantee that spending by the
Company’s customers will continue to follow patterns seen in the past or that spending by other customers will remain the same as in prior years.

Marketing and Distribution Network

Substantially all of our Rig Technology capital
equipment and spare parts sales, and a large portion of our smaller pumps and parts sales, are made through our direct sales force and distribution service centers. Sales to foreign oil companies are often made with or through agent or
representative arrangements. Products within Petroleum Service & Supplies are rented and sold worldwide through our own sales force and through commissioned representatives. Distribution & Transmission sales are made directly
through our network of distribution service centers.

The Rig Technology segment’s customers include drilling contractors, shipyards and
other rig fabricators, well servicing companies, pressure pumpers, national oil companies, major and independent oil and gas companies, supply stores, and pipe-running service providers. Demand for its products is strongly dependent upon capital
spending plans by oil and gas companies and drilling contractors, and the level of oil and gas well drilling activity. Rig Technology purchases can represent significant capital expenditures, and are often sold as part of a rig fabrication or major
rig refurbishment package. Sometimes these packages cover multiple rigs, and often the Company bids jointly with other related product and services providers, such as rig fabrication yards and rig design firms.

The Petroleum Services & Supplies segment’s customers for tubular services include major and independent oil and gas companies, national
oil companies, oilfield equipment and product distributors and manufacturers, drilling and workover contractors, oilfield service companies, pressure pumpers, pipeline operators, pipe mills, manufacturers and processors, and other industrial
companies. Certain tubular inspection and tubular coating products and services often are incorporated as a part of a tubular package sold by tubular supply stores to end users. The Company primarily has direct operations in the international
marketplace, but operates through agents in certain markets.

The Petroleum Services & Supplies segment’s customers for drilling
services are predominantly major and independent oil and gas companies, national oil companies, drilling contractors, well servicing companies, providers of drilling fluids, and other oilfield service companies. This segment operates sales and
distribution facilities at strategic locations worldwide to service areas with high drilling activity. Strategically located service and engineering facilities provide specialty repair and maintenance services to customers. Sales of capital
equipment are sometimes made through rig fabricators, and often are bid as part of a rig fabrication package or rig refurbishment package. Sometimes these packages cover multiple rigs, and often the Company bids jointly with other related service
providers.

The Distribution & Transmission segment’s distribution services sales are made through our network of distribution
service centers. Customers for our products and services include drilling and other service contractors, exploration and production companies, supply companies and nationally owned or controlled drilling and production companies. The
Distribution & Transmission segment’s customers for transmission products and services primarily include local, state and federal agencies, developers and general contractors.

The Company’s foreign operations, which include significant operations in Canada, Europe, the Far East, the Middle East, Africa and Latin America, are subject to the risks normally associated with
conducting business in foreign countries, including foreign currency exchange risks and uncertain political and economic environments, which may limit or disrupt markets, restrict the movement of funds or result in the deprivation of contract rights
or the taking of property without fair compensation. Government-owned petroleum



companies located in some of the countries in which the Company operates have adopted policies (or are subject to governmental policies) giving preference to the purchase of goods and services
from companies that are majority-owned by local nationals. As a result of such policies, the Company relies on joint ventures, license arrangements and other business combinations with local nationals in these countries. In addition, political
considerations may disrupt the commercial relationship between the Company and such government-owned petroleum companies. Although the Company has not experienced any material problems in foreign countries arising from nationalistic policies,
political instability, economic instability or currency restrictions, there can be no assurance that such a problem will not arise in the future. See Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding geographic revenue
information.

Research and New Product Development and Intellectual Property

The Company believes that it has been a leader in the development of new technology and equipment to enhance the safety and productivity of drilling and well servicing processes and that its sales and
earnings have been dependent, in part, upon the successful introduction of new or improved products. Through its internal development programs and certain acquisitions, the Company has assembled an extensive array of technologies protected by a
substantial number of trade and service marks, patents, trade secrets, and other proprietary rights.

As of December 31, 2013, the
Company held a substantial number of United States patents and had several patent applications pending. As of this date, the Company also had foreign patents and patent applications pending relating to inventions covered by the United States
patents. Additionally, the Company maintains a substantial number of trade and service marks and maintains a number of trade secrets. Expiration dates of such patents range from 2014 to 2033. The Company does not expect significant adverse effects
as patents expire.

Although the Company believes that this intellectual property has value, competitive products with different designs have
been successfully developed and marketed by others. The Company considers the quality and timely delivery of its products, the service it provides to its customers and the technical knowledge and skills of its personnel to be as important as its
intellectual property in its ability to compete. While the Company stresses the importance of its research and development programs, the technical challenges and market uncertainties associated with the development and successful introduction of new
products are such that there can be no assurance that the Company will realize future revenues from new products.

Engineering and
Manufacturing

The manufacturing processes for the Company’s products generally consist of machining, welding and fabrication, heat
treating, assembly of manufactured and purchased components and testing. Most equipment is manufactured primarily from alloy steel. The availability and price of alloy steel castings, forgings, purchased components and bar stock is critical to the
production and timing of shipments. Primary manufacturing facilities for the Rig Technology segment are located in Houston, Galena Park, Sugar Land, Conroe, Cedar Park, Anderson, San Angelo, Fort Worth and Pampa, Texas; Duncan, Oklahoma; Orange,
California; Edmonton, Canada; Aberdeen, Scotland; Kristiansand, Stavanger and Arendal, Norway; Etten-Leur and Groot-Ammers, the Netherlands; Carquefou, France; Kalundborg and Brondby, Denmark; Singapore; Shanghai, China; Dubai, UAE; Ulsan, South
Korea; Port Elizabeth and Cape Town, South Africa; and Luanda, Angola.

The Petroleum Services & Supplies segment manufactures or
assembles the equipment and products which it rents and sells to customers, and which it uses in providing services. Downhole tools are manufactured at facilities in Houston, Texas; Manchester, England; Dubai, UAE; Macaé, Brazil and
Singapore. Drill Bits are manufactured at facilities in Conroe, Texas; Stonehouse, U.K; and Jurong, Singapore. Drill Stem technology development and drill pipe are manufactured at facilities in Navasota, Texas; Veracruz, Mexico; Jurong, Singapore;
and Baimi Town, Jiangyan and Jiangsu, China. Solids control equipment and screens are manufactured at facilities in Houston and Conroe, Texas; New Iberia, Louisiana; Aberdeen, Scotland; Trinidad; Shah Alum and Puncak Alam, Malaysia; and
Macaé, Brazil. Pumps are manufactured at facilities in Houston, Odessa and Marble Falls, Texas; McAlester and Tulsa, Oklahoma; Manchester and Newcastle, England; Melbourne, Australia; and Buenos Aires, Argentina. NOV IntelliServ manufactures
and assembles equipment in Provo, Utah. The Company manufactures tubular inspection equipment and tools at its Houston, Texas facility for resale, and renovates and repairs equipment at its manufacturing facilities in Houston, Texas; Celle, Germany;
Singapore; and Aberdeen, Scotland. Fiberglass and composite tubulars and fittings are manufactured at facilities in San Antonio, Burkburnett and Mineral Wells, Texas; Little Rock, Arkansas; Tulsa, Oklahoma; Wichita, Kansas; Geldermalsen, the
Netherlands; Betim, Brazil; Johor, Malaysia; Singapore and Harbin and Suzhou, China, while tubular coatings are manufactured in its Houston, Texas facility, or through restricted sale agreements with third party manufacturers. Certain of the
Company’s manufacturing facilities and certain of the Company’s products have various certifications, including, ISO 9001, API, APEX and ASME.



Raw Materials

The Company believes that materials and components used in its servicing and manufacturing operations and purchased for sales are generally available from multiple sources. The prices paid by the Company
for its raw materials may be affected by, among other things, energy, steel and other commodity prices; tariffs and duties on imported materials; and foreign currency exchange rates. Since 2006 the Company has experienced rising, declining and
stable prices for mild steel and standard grades in line with broader economic activity and has generally seen specialty alloy prices continued to rise, driven primarily by escalation in the price of the alloying agents. The Company has generally
been successful in its effort to mitigate the financial impact of higher raw materials costs on its operations by applying surcharges to and adjusting prices on the products it sells. Furthermore, the Company continued to expand its supply base
starting in 2006 throughout the world to address its customers’ needs. In 2012 and 2013, the Company witnessed flat to slight increases in steel pricing which was somewhat mitigated by improved sourcing and supply chain practices. The Company
anticipates flat to moderate increases in steel pricing in 2014. Higher prices and lower availability of steel and other raw materials the Company uses in its business may adversely impact future periods.

Backlog

The Company monitors its
backlog of orders within its Rig Technology segment to guide its planning. Backlog includes orders greater than $250,000 for most items and orders for wireline units in excess of $75,000, and which require more than three months to manufacture and
deliver.

Backlog measurements are made on the basis of written orders which are firm, but may be defaulted upon by the customer in some
instances. Most require reimbursement to the Company for costs incurred in such an event. There can be no assurance that the backlog amounts will ultimately be realized as revenue, or that the Company will earn a profit on backlog work. Backlog for
equipment at December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, was $16.2 billion, $11.9 billion and $10.2 billion, respectively.

Employees

At December 31, 2013, the Company had a total of 63,779 employees, of which 8,796 were temporary employees. Approximately 1,167
employees in the U.S. are subject to collective bargaining agreements. Additionally, certain of the Company’s employees in various foreign locations are subject to collective bargaining agreements. The Company believes its relationship with its
employees is good.



ITEM 1A.

RISK FACTORS

You should carefully
consider the risks described below, in addition to other information contained or incorporated by reference herein. Realization of any of the following risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and
results of operations.

We are dependent upon the level of activity in the oil and gas industry, which is volatile.

The oil and gas industry historically has experienced significant volatility. Demand for our services and products depends primarily
upon the number of oil rigs in operation, the number of oil and gas wells being drilled, the depth and drilling conditions of these wells, the volume of production, the number of well completions, capital expenditures of other oilfield service
companies and the level of workover activity. Drilling and workover activity can fluctuate significantly in a short period of time, particularly in the United States and Canada. The willingness of oil and gas operators to make capital expenditures
to explore for and produce oil and natural gas and the willingness of oilfield service companies to invest in capital equipment will continue to be influenced by numerous factors over which we have no control, including:

•

the ability of the members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, or OPEC, to maintain price stability through voluntary
production limits, the level of production by non-OPEC countries and worldwide demand for oil and gas;

•

level of production from known reserves;

•

cost of exploring for and producing oil and gas;

•

level of drilling activity and drilling rig dayrates;

•

worldwide economic activity;

•

national government political requirements;

•

development of alternate energy sources; and

•

environmental regulations.

If there is a significant reduction in demand for drilling services, in cash flows of drilling contractors, well servicing companies, or production companies or in drilling or well servicing rig
utilization rates, then demand for the products and services of the Company will decline.

Volatile oil and gas prices affect demand for
our products.

Oil and gas prices have been volatile since 1972. In general, oil prices approximated $18-$22 per barrel from 1991
through 1997, experienced a decline into the low teens in 1998 and 1999, and have generally ranged between $25-$100 per barrel since 2000. In 2008, oil prices were extremely volatile – oil prices rose to $147 per barrel in July 2008 only to
fall into the $35-$45 per barrel range in December 2008. Oil prices then recovered since 2009, and rose to $85 per barrel by the end of 2010. Oil prices remained flat in the $90-$100 per barrel range through 2012 and 2013. Domestic spot gas prices
generally ranged between $1.80-$2.60 per mmbtu of gas from 1991 through 1999 then experienced spikes into the $10 range in 2001 and 2003. Prices generally ranged between $4.50-$12.00 per mmbtu during 2005-2008. During 2009 through 2011,
spot gas prices generally stabilized, dropping into the $3.00-$4.50 per mmbtu range, but declined below $3.00 late in 2011 and throughout much of 2012 before increasing slightly above $3.00 in late 2012. During 2013, prices continued to rise and
remained steady in the $3.00-$4.50 per mmbtu range ending the year over $4.00 per mmbtu.

Expectations for future oil and gas prices cause
many shifts in the strategies and expenditure levels of oil and gas companies and drilling contractors, particularly with respect to decisions to purchase major capital equipment of the type we manufacture. Oil and gas prices, which are determined
by the marketplace, may fall below a range that is acceptable to our customers, which could reduce demand for our products.



Worldwide financial and credit crisis could have a negative effect on our operating results and
financial condition.

Events in 2008 and 2009 constrained credit markets and sparked a serious global banking crisis. The slowdown in
worldwide economic activity caused by the global recession reduced demand for energy and resulted in lower oil and natural gas prices. Any prolonged reduction in oil and natural gas prices will reduce oil and natural gas drilling activity and result
in a corresponding decline in the demand for our products and services, which could adversely impact our operating results and financial condition. Furthermore, many of our customers access the credit markets to finance their oil and natural gas
drilling activity. If the recent crisis and recession reduce the availability of credit to our customers, they may reduce their drilling and production expenditures, thereby decreasing demand for our products and services. Any such reduction in
spending by our customers could adversely impact our operating results and financial condition.

There are risks associated with certain
contracts for our drilling equipment.

As of December 31, 2013, we had a backlog of approximately $16.2 billion of drilling
equipment to be manufactured, assembled, tested and delivered by our Rig Technology segment. The following factors, in addition to others not listed, could reduce our margins on these contracts, adversely affect our position in the market or subject
us to contractual penalties:

•

our failure to adequately estimate costs for making this drilling equipment;

•

our inability to deliver equipment that meets contracted technical requirements;

•

our inability to maintain our quality standards during the design and manufacturing process;

•

our inability to secure parts made by third party vendors at reasonable costs and within required timeframes;

•

unexpected increases in the costs of raw materials; and

•

our inability to manage unexpected delays due to weather, shipyard access, labor shortages or other factors beyond our control.

The Company’s existing contracts for rig equipment generally carry significant down payment and progress billing terms
favorable to the ultimate completion of these projects and the majority do not allow customers to cancel projects for convenience. However, unfavorable market conditions or financial difficulties experienced by our customers may result in
cancellation of contracts or the delay or abandonment of projects.

Any such developments could have a material adverse effect on our
operating results and financial condition.

Competition in our industry could ultimately lead to lower revenues and earnings.

The oilfield products and services industry is highly competitive. We compete with national, regional and foreign competitors in each
of our current major product lines. Certain of these competitors may have greater financial, technical, manufacturing and marketing resources than us, and may be in a better competitive position. The following competitive actions can each affect our
revenues and earnings:

•

price changes;

•

new product and technology introductions; and

•

improvements in availability and delivery.

In addition, certain foreign jurisdictions and government-owned petroleum companies located in some of the countries in which we operate have adopted policies or regulations which may give local nationals
in these countries competitive advantages. Competition in our industry could lead to lower revenues and earnings.



We have aggressively expanded our businesses and intend to maintain an aggressive growth strategy.

We have aggressively expanded and grown our businesses during the past several years, through acquisitions and investment in internal
growth. We anticipate that we will continue to pursue an aggressive growth strategy but we cannot assure you that attractive acquisitions will be available to us at reasonable prices or at all. In addition, we cannot assure you that we will
successfully integrate the operations and assets of any acquired business with our own or that our management will be able to manage effectively the increased size of the Company or operate any new lines of business. Any inability on the part of
management to integrate and manage acquired businesses and their assumed liabilities could adversely affect our business and financial performance. In addition, we may need to incur substantial indebtedness to finance future acquisitions. We cannot
assure you that we will be able to obtain this financing on terms acceptable to us or at all. Future acquisitions may result in increased depreciation and amortization expense, increased interest expense, increased financial leverage or decreased
operating income for the Company, any of which could cause our business to suffer.

Our operating results have fluctuated during recent
years and these fluctuations may continue.

We have experienced fluctuations in quarterly operating results in the past. We cannot
assure that we will realize earnings growth or that earnings in any particular quarter will not fall short of either a prior fiscal quarter or investors’ expectations. The following factors, in addition to others not listed, may affect our
quarterly operating results in the future:

•

fluctuations in the oil and gas industry;

•

competition;

•

the ability to service the debt obligations of the Company;

•

the ability to identify strategic acquisitions at reasonable prices;

•

the ability to manage and control operating costs of the Company;

•

fluctuations in political and economic conditions in the United States and abroad; and

•

the ability to protect our intellectual property rights.

There are risks associated with our presence in international markets, including political or economic instability, currency restrictions, and trade and economic sanctions.

Approximately 65% of our revenues in 2013 were derived from operations outside the United States (based on revenue destination). Our foreign operations
include significant operations in Canada, Europe, the Middle East, Africa, Southeast Asia, Latin America and other international markets. Our revenues and operations are subject to the risks normally associated with conducting business in foreign
countries, including uncertain political and economic environments, which may limit or disrupt markets, restrict the movement of funds or result in the deprivation of contract rights or the taking of property without fair compensation.
Government-owned petroleum companies located in some of the countries in which we operate have adopted policies, or are subject to governmental policies, giving preference to the purchase of goods and services from companies that are majority-owned
by local nationals. As a result of these policies, we may rely on joint ventures, license arrangements and other business combinations with local nationals in these countries. In addition, political considerations may disrupt the commercial
relationships between us and government-owned petroleum companies.

Our operations outside the United States could also expose us to trade and
economic sanctions or other restrictions imposed by the United States or other governments or organizations. The U.S. Department of Justice (“DOJ”), the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and other federal agencies and authorities
have a broad range of civil and criminal penalties they may seek to impose against corporations and individuals for violations of trading sanctions laws, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other federal statutes. Under trading sanctions laws, the
DOJ may seek to impose modifications to business practices, including cessation of business activities in sanctioned countries, and modifications to compliance programs, which may increase compliance costs. If any of the risks described above
materialize, it could adversely impact our operating results and financial condition.

We have received federal grand jury subpoenas and
subsequent inquiries from governmental agencies requesting records related to our compliance with export trade laws and regulations. We have cooperated fully with agents from the Department of Justice, the Bureau of Industry and Security,
the Office of Foreign Assets Control, and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement in responding to the inquiries. We have also cooperated with an informal inquiry from the Securities and Exchange Commission in connection with the
inquiries previously made by the aforementioned federal agencies. We have conducted our own internal review of this matter. At the conclusion of our internal review in the fourth quarter of 2009, we identified possible areas of concern and
discussed these areas of concern with the relevant agencies. We are currently negotiating a potential resolution with the agencies involved related to these matters. We currently anticipate that any administrative fine or
penalty agreed to as part of a resolution would be within established accruals, and would not have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations. To the extent a resolution is not negotiated as anticipated,
we cannot predict the timing or effect that any resulting government actions may have on our financial position or results of operations.



The results of our operations are subject to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange
rates.

We earn revenues, pay expenses, purchase assets and incur liabilities in countries using currencies other than the U.S. dollar,
including, but not limited to, the Canadian dollar, the Euro, the British pound sterling, the Norwegian krone and the South Korean won. Approximately 65% of our 2013 revenue was derived from sales outside the United States. Because our Consolidated
Financial Statements are presented in U.S. dollars, we must translate revenues and expenses into U.S. dollars at exchange rates in effect during or at the end of each reporting period. Thus, increases or decreases in the value of the U.S. dollar
against other currencies in which our operations are conducted will affect our revenues and operating income. Because of the geographic diversity of our operations, weaknesses in some currencies might be offset by strengths in others over time. We
use derivative financial instruments to mitigate our net exposure to currency exchange fluctuations. We had forward contracts with a notional amount of $4,537 million (with a fair value of a net asset of $19 million) as of December 31, 2013, to
reduce the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements. We are also subject to risks that the counterparties to these contracts fail to meet the terms of our foreign currency contracts. We cannot assure you that fluctuations in foreign
currency exchange rates would not affect our financial results.

An impairment of goodwill or other indefinite lived intangible assets
could reduce our earnings.

The Company has approximately $9.0 billion of goodwill and $0.6 billion of other intangible assets with
indefinite lives as of December 31, 2013. Generally accepted accounting principles require the Company to test goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis or whenever events or circumstances occur
indicating that goodwill might be impaired. Events or circumstances which could indicate a potential impairment include (but are not limited to) a significant reduction in worldwide oil and gas prices or drilling; a significant reduction in
profitability or cash flow of oil and gas companies or drilling contractors; a significant reduction in worldwide well remediation activity; a significant reduction in capital investment by other oilfield service companies; or a significant increase
in worldwide inventories of oil or gas. The timing and magnitude of any goodwill impairment charge, which could be material, would depend on the timing and severity of the event or events triggering the charge and would require a high degree of
management judgment. If we were to determine that any of our remaining balance of goodwill or other indefinite lived intangible assets was impaired, we would record an immediate charge to earnings with a corresponding reduction in stockholders’
equity; resulting in an increase in balance sheet leverage as measured by debt to total capitalization.

See additional discussion on
“Goodwill and Other Indefinite – Lived Intangible Assets” in Critical Accounting Estimates of Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”

We could be adversely affected if we fail to comply with any of the numerous federal, state and local laws, regulations and policies that govern
environmental protection, zoning and other matters applicable to our businesses.

Our businesses are subject to numerous federal, state
and local laws, regulations and policies governing environmental protection, zoning and other matters. These laws and regulations have changed frequently in the past and it is reasonable to expect additional changes in the future. If existing
regulatory requirements change, we may be required to make significant unanticipated capital and operating expenditures. We cannot assure you that our operations will continue to comply with future laws and regulations. Governmental authorities may
seek to impose fines and penalties on us or to revoke or deny the issuance or renewal of operating permits for failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations. Under these circumstances, we might be required to reduce or cease operations or
conduct site remediation or other corrective action which could adversely impact our operations and financial condition.

Our businesses
expose us to potential environmental liability.

Our businesses expose us to the risk that harmful substances may escape into the
environment, which could result in:

•

personal injury or loss of life;

•

severe damage to or destruction of property; or

•

environmental damage and suspension of operations.



Our current and past activities, as well as the activities of our former divisions and subsidiaries, could
result in our facing substantial environmental, regulatory and other liabilities. These could include the costs of cleanup of contaminated sites and site closure obligations. These liabilities could also be imposed on the basis of one or more of the
following theories:

•

negligence;

•

strict liability;

•

breach of contract with customers; or

•

as a result of our contractual agreement to indemnify our customers in the normal course of business, which is normally the case.

We may not have adequate insurance for potential environmental liabilities.

While we maintain liability insurance, this insurance is subject to coverage limits. In addition, certain policies do not provide coverage for damages
resulting from environmental contamination. We face the following risks with respect to our insurance coverage:

•

we may not be able to continue to obtain insurance on commercially reasonable terms;

•

we may be faced with types of liabilities that will not be covered by our insurance;

•

our insurance carriers may not be able to meet their obligations under the policies; or

•

the dollar amount of any liabilities may exceed our policy limits.

Even a partially uninsured claim, if successful and of significant size, could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements.

The adoption of climate change legislation or regulations restricting emissions of greenhouse gases could increase our operating costs or reduce
demand for our products.

Environmental advocacy groups and regulatory agencies in the United States and other countries have been
focusing considerable attention on the emissions of carbon dioxide, methane and other greenhouse gases and their potential role in climate change. The adoption of laws and regulations to implement controls of greenhouse gases, including the
imposition of fees or taxes, could adversely impact our operations and financial condition. The U.S. Congress is currently working on legislation to control and reduce emissions of greenhouse gases in the United States, which includes establishing
cap-and-trade programs. In addition to the pending climate legislation, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has proposed regulations that would require permits for and reductions in greenhouse gas emissions for certain facilities, and may issue
final rules this year. These changes in the legal and regulatory environment could reduce oil and natural gas drilling activity and result in a corresponding decline in the demand for our products and services, which could adversely impact our
operating results and financial condition.

We had revenues of approximately 10% of total revenue from one of our customers during the
years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011.

The loss of this customer (Samsung Heavy Industries) or a significant reduction in
its purchases could adversely affect our future revenues and earnings. Samsung Heavy Industries is a shipyard acting as a general contractor for its customers, who are drillship owners and drilling contractors. This shipyard’s customers have
specified that the Company’s drilling equipment be installed on their drillships and have required the shipyard to issue contracts to the Company.

Our information systems may experience an interruption or breach in security.

We
rely heavily on information systems to conduct our business. Any failure, interruption or breach in security of our information systems could result in failures or disruptions in our customer relationship management, general ledger systems and other
systems. While we have policies and procedures designed to prevent or limit the effect of the failure, interruption or security breach of our information systems, there can be no assurance that any such failures, interruptions or security breaches
will not occur or, if they do occur, that they will be adequately addressed. The occurrence of any failures, interruptions or security breaches of the our information systems could damage our reputation, result in a loss of customer business,
subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny, or expose us to civil litigation and possible financial liability, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations.

Risks associated with the separation of our distribution business.

Our planned separation of our distribution business, under the name NOW Inc., is subject to a number of risks, including the following:

Risk of Non-Consummation.

Although we expect to distribute 100% of the shares of NOW Inc. common stock to NOV stockholders in the first half of 2014, the distribution remains subject to various
conditions, including, but not limited to: (i) the SEC having declared effective NOW Inc.’s registration statement on Form 10 and (ii) the receipt of tax opinions to the effect that the distribution, together with certain related
transactions, will qualify as tax-free for U.S. federal income tax purposes under Sections 355 and 368(a)(1)(D) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”). There can be no assurance that any or all of the conditions will
be met and that the distribution will be completed in the manner currently contemplated, or at all. In addition, the fulfillment of the conditions does not create any obligations on our part to effect the distribution, and our board of directors has
reserved the right, in its sole discretion, to abandon, modify, or change the terms of the distribution.

Risks of Not Obtaining Benefits
from the Separation.

NOV and NOW Inc. may not realize some or all of the benefits we expect from the separation in the time frame currently contemplated, or at all.

Risks Relating to Less Diversification.

If the distribution is completed, our diversification of revenue sources will diminish due to the separation of NOW Inc. from our other businesses, and it is
possible that our results of operations, cash flows, working capital and financing requirements may be subject to increased volatility as a result.

Risks Relating to Taxes.

The IRS no longer issues private letter rulings regarding whether or not a spin-off transaction qualifies for tax-free treatment under Section 355 of the Code.
Notwithstanding the tax opinions we are to receive from our legal and tax advisors that the distribution of 100% of the shares of NOW Inc. common stock will qualify as tax-free under such section of the Code, the IRS could determine on audit that
the distribution should be treated as a taxable transaction, including as a result of a significant change in stock or asset ownership after the distribution. If the distribution ultimately is determined to be taxable, we and/or our stockholders
that are subject to U.S. federal income tax could incur significant U.S. federal income tax liabilities.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

General Overview

The Company is a leading worldwide provider of highly engineered drilling
and well-servicing equipment, products and services to the exploration and production segments of the oil and gas industry. With operations in over 1,235 locations across six continents, we design, manufacture and service a comprehensive line of
drilling and well servicing equipment; sell and rent drilling motors, specialized downhole tools, and rig instrumentation; perform inspection and internal coating of oilfield tubular products; provide drill cuttings separation, management and
disposal systems and services; provide expendables and spare parts used in conjunction with our large installed base of equipment; and provide supply chain management services through our distribution network. We also manufacture coiled tubing,
manufacture high pressure fiberglass and composite tubing, and sell and rent advanced in-line inspection equipment to makers of oil country tubular goods. We have a long tradition of pioneering innovations which improve the cost-effectiveness,
efficiency, safety, and environmental impact of oil and gas operations.

Our revenues and operating results are directly related to the level
of worldwide oil and gas drilling and production activities and the profitability and cash flow of oil and gas companies and drilling contractors, which in turn are affected by current and anticipated prices of oil and gas. Oil and gas prices have
been and are likely to continue to be volatile. See “Risk Factors”. We conduct our operations through three business segments: Rig Technology, Petroleum Services & Supplies and Distribution & Transmission. See
Item 1. “Business” for a discussion of each of these business segments.

Unless indicated otherwise, results of operations data
are presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”). In an effort to provide investors with additional information regarding our results of operations, certain non-GAAP financial
measures, including operating profit excluding nonrecurring items, operating profit percentage excluding nonrecurring items and diluted earnings per share excluding nonrecurring items, are provided. See “Non-GAAP Financial Measures and
Reconciliations” in Results of Operations for an explanation of our use of non-GAAP financial measures and reconciliations to their corresponding measures calculated in accordance with GAAP.

Operating Environment Overview

Our
results are dependent on, among other things, the level of worldwide oil and gas drilling, well remediation activity, the price of crude oil and natural gas, capital spending by other oilfield service companies and drilling contractors, and the
worldwide oil and gas inventory levels. Key industry indicators for the past three years include the following:

Averages for the years indicated. See sources below.



The following table details the U.S., Canadian, and international rig activity and West Texas Intermediate
Oil prices for the past nine quarters ended December 31, 2013 on a quarterly basis:

Source: Rig count: Baker Hughes, Inc. (

www.bakerhughes.com

); West Texas Intermediate Crude Price: Department of
Energy, Energy Information Administration (

).

The average price per barrel of West Texas Intermediate Crude was $97.91
per barrel in 2013, an increase of 4% over the average price for 2012 of $94.11 per barrel. The average natural gas price was $3.72 per mmbtu, an increase of 35% compared to the 2012 average of $2.75 per mmbtu. Average rig activity
worldwide decreased 3% for the full year in 2013 compared to 2012. The average crude oil price for the fourth quarter of 2013 was $97.34 per barrel and natural gas was $3.84 per mmbtu.

At February 7, 2014, there were 2,392 rigs actively drilling in North America, compared to 2,020 rigs at December 31, 2013; an increase of 18.4% from year end 2013 levels. The price of oil increased to
$99.98 per barrel and gas increased to $4.78 per mmbtu at February 7, 2014, representing a 1.8% increase in oil prices and an 11.9% increase in gas prices from the end of 2013.



EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

During 2013 National Oilwell Varco, Inc. earned $2.3 billion in net income attributable to Company, or $5.44 per fully diluted share. Earnings per diluted share decreased 7% from prior year levels of $2.5
billion or $5.83 per fully diluted share. Excluding other costs (as defined in the “Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Reconciliations” in Results of Operations) from both years, diluted earnings per share of $5.52 in 2013 decreased 7% from
$5.91 per share in 2012.

During 2013 revenue grew 14% from 2012, to $22.9 billion, and operating profit declined 4% from 2012, to $3.4
billion. Generally, 2013 benefitted from the acquisition of Robbins & Myers as well as higher international drilling activity, which saw international rig counts (as measured by Baker Hughes) increase 5% from 2012. This enabled all three of
the Company’s reporting segments to post higher year-over-year revenues in 2012.

For its fourth quarter ended December 31, 2013,
the Company generated $658 million in net income attributable to Company, or $1.53 per fully diluted share, on $6.2 billion in revenue. Compared to the third quarter of 2013 revenue increased $485 million or 9% and net income attributable to Company
increased $22 million. Compared to the fourth quarter of 2012, revenue increased $487 million or 9%, and net income attributable to Company decreased $10 million or 1%.

The fourth quarter of 2013 included pre-tax other costs of $16 million, the third quarter of 2013 included pre-tax other costs of $10 million and a pre-tax gain of $102 million resulting from the
settlement of a legal claim, and the fourth quarter of 2012 included pre-tax other costs of $51 million, and a net $69 million tax benefit related to certain U.S. foreign tax credits in the quarter. Excluding the pre-tax gain, tax benefit and other
costs from all periods, fourth quarter 2013 earnings were $1.56 per fully diluted share, compared to $1.34 per fully diluted share in the third quarter of 2013 and $1.49 per fully diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2012.

Operating profit excluding other costs and the litigation gains was $973 million or 15.8% of sales in the fourth quarter of 2013, compared to $853
million or 14.7% of sales in the third quarter of 2013, and $954 million or 16.8% of sales in the fourth quarter of 2012.

Oil &
Gas Equipment and Services Market

Worldwide, developed economies turned down in late 2008 as looming housing-related asset write-downs at
major financial institutions paralyzed credit markets and sparked a serious global banking crisis. Major central banks responded vigorously through 2009, but a credit-driven worldwide economic recession developed nonetheless. Developed economies
struggled to recover throughout 2010 and 2011, facing additional economic weakness related to potential sovereign debt defaults in Europe. As a result, commodity prices, including oil and gas prices, have been volatile. After rising steadily for six
years to peak at around $140 per barrel (West Texas Intermediate Crude Prices) earlier in 2008, oil prices collapsed back to average $43 per barrel during the first quarter of 2009, but slowly recovered into the $100 per barrel range by mid-2011
where they held relatively steady since (although the fourth quarter of 2012 dipped to average $88 per barrel). After trading in the range of $6 to $9 an mmbtu from 2004 to 2008, North American gas prices declined to average $3.17 per mmbtu in the
third quarter of 2009. Gas prices recovered modestly, trading up above $5 six months later, but then slowly settled into the $3 to $4 per mmbtu through 2011 before turning down sharply in early 2012 to the $2 range. In the fourth quarter 2012, gas
prices recovered to average $3.40 per mmbtu; and, for the full year 2013, gas prices averaged $3.72 per mmbtu. The gas price collapse appears to be a direct result of rising gas supply out of unconventional shale reservoir development across North
America, including gas associated with liquids production from shales.

The steadily rising oil and gas prices seen between 2003 and 2008 led
to high levels of exploration and development drilling in many oil and gas basins around the globe by 2008, but activity slowed sharply in 2009 with lower oil and gas prices and tightening credit availability. Strengthening oil prices since then
have led to steadily rising oil-drilling activity over the past two years.

The count of rigs actively drilling in the U.S. as measured by
Baker Hughes (a good measure of the level of oilfield activity and spending) peaked at 2,031 rigs in September 2008, but decreased to a low of 876 in June, 2009. U.S. rig count increased steadily to 2,026 by late 2011, but began to decline with
lower gas prices to average 1,809 rigs for the fourth quarter of 2012. The average U.S. rig count declined to 1,758 rigs in the first quarter of 2013, and remained relatively flat throughout the year. Many oil and gas operators reliant on external
financing to fund their drilling programs significantly curtailed their drilling activity in 2009, but drilling recovered across North America as gas prices improved. Recently low gas prices have caused operators to trim drilling, driving the
average U.S. gas rig count down 58% from the fourth quarter of 2011, to an average of 371 in the fourth quarter of 2013. However, with high oil prices, many have redirected drilling efforts towards unconventional shale plays targeting oil, rather
than gas. For the fourth quarter of 2013, oil-directed drilling rose to almost 78% of the total domestic drilling effort, and remains near its highest levels in the U.S. since the early 1980’s.



Most international activity is driven by oil exploration and production by national oil companies, which has
historically been less susceptible to short-term commodity price swings; but, the international rig count exhibited modest declines nonetheless, falling from its September 2008 peak of 1,108 to 947 in August 2009. Recently international drilling
rebounded due to high oil prices, climbing back to average 1,321 rigs in the fourth quarter of 2013.

During 2009 the Company saw its
Petroleum Services & Supplies and its Distribution & Transmission margins affected most acutely by a drilling downturn, through both volume and price declines. Resumption of drilling activity since enabled both of these segments to
gain volume, stabilize and lift pricing, and improve margins since the fourth quarter of 2009. The Company’s Rig Technology segment was less impacted by the 2009 downturn owing to its high level of contracted backlog, which it executed well. It
posted higher revenues in 2009 than 2008 as a result. Its revenues declined in 2010 as its backlog declined, but increased 12% in 2011 as orders for new offshore rigs began to increase.

The economic decline beginning in late 2008 followed an extended period of high drilling activity which fueled strong demand for oilfield services between 2003 and 2008. Incremental drilling activity
through the upswing shifted toward harsh environments, employing increasingly sophisticated technology to find and produce reserves. Higher utilization of drilling rigs tested the capability of the world’s fleet of rigs, much of which is old
and of limited capability. Technology has advanced significantly since most of the existing rig fleet was built. The industry invested little during the late 1980’s and 1990’s on new drilling equipment, but drilling technology progressed
steadily nonetheless, as the Company and its competitors continued to invest in new and better ways of drilling. As a consequence, the safety, reliability, and efficiency of new, modern rigs surpass the performance of most of the older rigs at work
today. Drilling rigs are now being pushed to drill deeper wells, more complex wells, highly deviated wells and horizontal wells, tasks which require larger rigs with more capabilities. The drilling process effectively consumes the mechanical
components of a rig, which wear out and need periodic repair or replacement. This process was accelerated by very high rig utilization and wellbore complexity. Drilling consumes rigs; more complex and challenging drilling consumes rigs faster.

The industry responded by launching many new rig construction projects since 2005, to 1.) retool the existing fleet of jackup rigs (according
to RigLogix, nearly 62% of the existing 513 jackup rigs are greater than 25 years old); 2.) replace older mechanical and DC electric land rigs with improved AC power, electronic controls, automatic pipe handling and rapid rigup and rigdown
technology; and 3.) build out additional deepwater floating drilling rigs, including semisubmersibles and drillships, to employ recent advancements in deepwater drilling to exploit unexplored deepwater basins. We believe that the newer rigs offer
considerably higher efficiency, safety, and capability, and that many will effectively replace a portion of the existing fleet.

As a result
of these trends the Company’s Rig Technology segment grew its backlog of capital equipment orders from $0.9 billion at June 30, 2005, to $11.8 billion at September 30, 2008. However, as a result of the credit crisis and slowing
drilling activity, orders declined below amounts flowing out of backlog as revenue, causing the backlog to decline to $4.9 billion by June 30, 2010. The backlog increased steadily since, as drillers began ordering more than the Company shipped
out of backlog, and finished the fourth quarter of 2013 at a record $16.2 billion. Approximately $8.5 billion of these orders are scheduled to flow out as revenue during 2014, with the balance flowing out in 2015 and beyond. Of this backlog, 93% of
the total is for equipment destined for offshore operations, with 7% destined for land. Equipment destined for international markets totaled 94% of the backlog.

Segment Performance

The Rig Technology segment generated $11.7 billion in revenues and
$2.5 billion in operating profit or 21.5% of sales during 2013. Compared to the prior year, revenues improved 16% while operating profit dollars increased 8% year-over-year. For the fourth quarter of 2013, the segment generated $3.3 billion in
revenues and $692 million in operating profit or 20.9% of sales. Compared to the prior quarter, revenues increased $365 million or 12%, and operating profit decreased $14 million. Compared to the fourth quarter of 2012, segment revenues grew $414
million or 14%, and operating profit increased $56 million. Year-over-year operating leverage or flow-through was 14%. Margins have moved down steadily since mid-2010 due to an adverse mix shift in the segment, the addition of lower-margin
acquisitions, and incremental expenses to support several strategic growth initiatives. The mix shift arises from offshore projects contracted at high prices in 2007 and 2008, which were subsequently manufactured in low cost environments in 2009 and
2010, resulting in high margins for the group which peaked in the third quarter of 2010. As these projects have been completed and replaced with lower priced projects, margins have gradually declined. Revenue out of backlog increased 20%
sequentially and increased 14% year-over-year. Non-backlog revenue, which is predominantly aftermarket spares and services, increased 7% sequentially and increased 15% from the fourth quarter of 2012. Orders for four deepwater floating rig equipment
packages, and twenty five drilling equipment packages for jackup rigs, contributed to total order additions to backlog of $3.6 billion during the fourth quarter. Interest in offshore rig construction has remained strong as announced dayrates for
deepwater offshore rigs remain strong, rig building costs have stabilized at attractive levels, and financing appears to be available for most established drillers. The segment also benefitted from the shipment of several land rigs in the fourth
quarter; and, despite the continued decline in demand for pressure pumping equipment in North America, the segment’s well intervention and stimulation product sales increased 11% sequentially, as unexpected demand in the quarter was filled with
existing inventory.



The Petroleum Services & Supplies segment generated $7.2 billion in revenue and $1.2 billion in
operating profit, or 16.9% of sales, for the full year 2013. Compared to the prior year, revenue increased 3%, but operating profit declined $289 million, as the 8% year-over-year reduction in the U.S. drilling rig count (as measured by Baker
Hughes) led to pricing pressures and under-absorption in a number of the segment’s manufacturing and service facilities. For the fourth quarter of 2013, the segment generated $1.9 billion in revenue and $363 million in operating profit, or
18.9% of sales. Compared to the prior quarter, revenue increased $116 million or 6%, and operating profit increased $42 million, representing 36% incremental operating leverage. Sequentially, drilling and completions activities in Canada continued
to improve following the annual seasonal slow-down known as “break-up”. This increase in activity created slight incremental demand for the segment’s products and services, which generated 1% sequential growth for the segment in
Canada. In the U.S., a relatively flat rig count, combined with fewer billing days in the quarter due to holidays, led to a 3% sequential decline. Demand in the U.S. for drill pipe and downhole tools remained muted in the quarter due to a still
over-supplied U.S. land drilling and well-service market. Internationally, driven by some large year-end project shipments, revenues for the segment increased 18%. Compared to the fourth quarter of 2012, revenues increased $155 million, and
operating profit increased $23 million, as both pricing pressures and under-absorbed facilities continue to pressure margins. For the fourth quarter of 2013, approximately 51% of the segment’s sales were into North American markets, and 49% of
sales were into international markets.

The Distribution & Transmission segment generated $5.1 billion in revenue and $247 million in
operating profit or 4.8% of sales during 2013. Revenues improved 30% from 2012, primarily due to the acquisitions of Wilson during the second quarter of 2012 and CE Franklin during the third quarter of 2012. For the fourth quarter of 2013, the
segment generated $1.3 billion in revenue and $60 million in operating profit or 4.8% of sales. Revenues declined $89 million or 7% from the third quarter of 2013, and operating profit decreased $18 million. Compared to the fourth quarter of 2012,
revenues decreased $15 million or 1% and operating profit decreased $18 million. Sequentially, revenues declined 8% in the U.S., as the holidays and severe weather disruptions led to fewer billing days in the fourth quarter. Additionally, the
segment was challenged as some large project sales into international markets in the third quarter did not repeat in the fourth quarter. The fourth quarter 2013 year-over-year revenue decline is directly attributable to the decline in the U.S. rig
count over that same period. For the fourth quarter of 2013, approximately 81% of the group’s sales were into North American markets and 19% into international markets.

Outlook

Following the credit market downturn, global recession, and lower commodity prices
of 2009, we saw signs of stabilization and recovery in many of our markets in 2010 and into 2011, led by higher drilling activity in North America and slowly improving international drilling activity. Order levels for new deepwater drilling rigs
have rebounded sharply, and the Rig Technology segment continues to experience a high level of interest as dayrates for deepwater offshore rigs remain at high levels. Still, margins, which were 20.9% in the fourth quarter of 2013, may continue to be
challenged to expand beyond current levels due to lower-margin contributions from recent subsea production equipment acquisitions, a soft outlook for land drilling, workover and pressure pumping equipment markets in North America, low gas and
natural gas liquids prices, higher costs of execution due to significantly compressed project timelines, continued flow through of lower priced projects, and incremental expenses to support long-term strategic growth initiatives.

Our outlook for the Company’s Petroleum Services & Supplies segment and Distribution & Transmission segment remains closely tied
to the rig count, particularly in North America. The fourth quarter saw U.S. rig counts relatively unchanged from the prior quarter, resulting in an average U.S. rig count in the fourth quarter that was down 3% from the average U.S. rig count in the
fourth quarter of 2012. The fourth quarter saw average Canadian rig counts improve almost 9% sequentially and almost 3% year-over-year. As a result, revenues for both segments improved sequentially in Canada; however, for both the U.S. and Canada,
pricing and volumes remain under pressure as pressure pumpers, drilling contractors and oil companies continue to carefully scrutinize operating and capital expenditures. Additionally, economic weakness may pressure oil prices, which could lead to
further activity declines, particularly among North American operators which may rely on cash flows from gas production and/or external financing to fund their drilling operations. In contrast, activity generally seems to be continuing to increase
in most international markets outside North America.

The Company believes it is well positioned, and should benefit from its strong balance
sheet and capitalization, access to credit, global infrastructure, broad product and service offering, installed base of equipment, and a record level of contracted orders. In the event of a market downturn, the Company also believes that its long
history of cost-control and downsizing in response to slowing market conditions, and of executing strategic acquisitions during difficult periods will enable it to capitalize on new opportunities to effect new organic growth and acquisition
initiatives.

Still the recovery of the world economy continues to move forward with a great deal of uncertainty. If such global economic
uncertaintanties develop adversely, world oil and gas prices could be impacted which in turn could negatively impact the worldwide rig count and the Company’s future financial results.



Results of Operations

Years Ended December 31, 2013 and December 31, 2012

The following table
summarizes the Company’s revenue and operating profit by operating segment in 2013 and 2012 (in millions):

Rig Technology

Revenue from Rig Technology for the year ended December 31, 2013 was $11,716 million, an increase of $1,609 million (15.9%) compared to the year ended December 31, 2012. Deepwater offshore
demand as well as demand in international markets continues to be a driving force for the increase in revenue for Rig Technology as revenue out of backlog contributed $8,740 million in 2013. Increased sales of individual capital components, a
continued increase in activity in the Company’s aftermarket and FPSO businesses as well as the acquisition of Robbins & Myers all contributed to the increase in revenue for Rig Technology. In addition, a nonrecurring gain of $102
million was recognized in the third quarter of 2013 related to a legal settlement. North American markets continue to see a decrease in demand for land drilling equipment. This is evidenced by a decrease in rig count in North America from 2012 and
has resulted in a steady decline in sales of land rigs and pressure pumping equipment in the U.S. and Canada. The average rig count in the U.S. for the year ended 2013 decreased over 8% compared to the year ended 2012 and decreased 3% in Canada over
the same period.

Operating profit from Rig Technology was $2,522 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, an increase of $187
million (8.0%) compared to 2012. Operating profit percentage decreased to 21.5%, from 23.1% in 2012. The decrease in operating profit percentage continues to be primarily due to a shift in product mix as lower priced offshore projects replace
projects contracted at higher prices in 2007 and 2008. FPSO revenue continues to increase with operating margins that are dilutive while land rig and pressure pumping equipment revenue, with margins that are generally accretive, continues to
decline. In addition, our shipyard customers are compressing delivery schedules which have been leading to increased freight and personnel costs. Expenses associated with acquisition integration efforts, numerous strategic growth initiatives and
capacity expansions worldwide have also contributed to the decrease in operating profit percentage.

Included in operating profit are certain
other costs which include items such as transaction costs and the amortization of backlog and inventory that was stepped up during purchase accounting. Other costs included in operating profit for Rig Technology were $27 million for the year ended
December 31, 2013 and $45 million for the year ended December 31, 2012.



The Rig Technology segment monitors its capital equipment backlog to plan its business. New orders are added
to backlog only when the Company receives a firm written order for major drilling rig components or a signed contract related to a construction project. The capital equipment backlog was $16.2 billion at December 31, 2013, an increase of $4.4
billion (37.0%) from backlog of $11.9 billion at December 31, 2012. At December 31, 2013, approximately 93% of the capital equipment backlog was for offshore products and 7% was for land; and approximately 94% of the capital equipment
backlog was for international markets and 6% was for domestic markets.

Petroleum Services & Supplies

Revenue from Petroleum Services & Supplies for the year ended December 31, 2013 was $7,184 million, an increase of $217 million
(3.1%) compared to the year ended December 31, 2012. The increase is primarily due to the acquisition of Robbins & Myers during the first quarter of 2013 as well as increased activity internationally as evidenced by the 5%
increase in the international rig count in 2013 compared to 2012. These increases were offset to some extent by lower North American drilling activity. Approximately 54% of 2013 revenue for this segment was derived from North American markets and
46% from international markets.

Operating profit from Petroleum Services & Supplies was $1,212 million for the year ended
December 31, 2013 compared to $1,501 million for 2012, an decrease of $289 million (19.3%). Operating profit percentage decreased to 16.9% from 21.5% in 2012. This decrease is primarily due to the overall decline in North American
market activity which has led to pricing pressures across a number of products in the North American land market, as well as volume declines. Expenses associated with integrating recently acquired companies also contributed to the decrease in
operating profit percentages.

Included in operating profit are certain other costs which include items such as transaction costs and the
amortization of inventory that was stepped up during purchase accounting. Other costs included in operating profit for Petroleum Services & Supplies were $93 million for the year ended December 31, 2013 and $18 million for the year
ended December 31, 2012.

Distribution & Transmission

Revenue from Distribution & Transmission was $ 5,117 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, an increase of $ 1,190 million (30.3%) compared to the year ended
December 31, 2012. This increase was primarily attributable to the acquisition of Robbins & Myers during the first quarter of 2013, Wilson during the second quarter of 2012 and CE Franklin during the third quarter of 2012. The increase
related to these acquisitions was offset to some extent by lower North American drilling activity. Of the 2013 revenue for the segment, approximately 81% was derived from North American markets and 19% from international markets.

Operating profit from Distribution & Transmission was $247 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, an increase of $62 million
(33.5%) compared to $185 million for the year ended December 31, 2012. Operating profit percentage increased to 4.8%, from 4.7% in 2012. This increase is attributable to the increased activity in both Canada and International markets, and
the inclusion of other costs related to purchase accounting which is lower in 2013 as compared to 2012. Slightly offsetting the increase is the continued lower overall market activity in the U.S.

Included in operating profit are certain other costs which include items such as transaction costs and the amortization of inventory that was stepped up
during purchase accounting. Other costs included in operating profit for Distribution & Transmission were $27 million for the year ended December 31, 2013 and $68 million for the year ended December 31, 2012.

Unallocated expenses and eliminations

Unallocated expenses and eliminations in operating profit were $558 million for the year ended December 31, 2013 compared to $464 million for the
year ended December 31, 2012. This increase was primarily due to increased intercompany sales activity for all segments resulting in higher intersegment eliminations.

Interest and financial costs

Interest and financial costs were $111 million for the year
ended December 31, 2013 compared to $49 million for the year ended December 31, 2012. This increase is primarily due to an overall increase in average debt during 2013 compared 2012.



Equity Income in Unconsolidated Affiliates

Equity income in unconsolidated affiliates was $63 million for the year ended December 31, 2013 compared to $58 million for the year ended December 31, 2012. This increase was primarily due to
increased equity earnings from the Company’s 50.01% investment in Voest-Alpine Tubulars (“VAT”) located in Kindberg, Austria.

Other income (expense), net

Other
income (expense), net were expenses of $41 million for the year ended December 31, 2013 compared to expenses of $71 million for the year ended December 31, 2012. The change was primarily due to gains on the sale of certain assets during
the second quarter of 2013, offset by foreign exchange losses and increased bank charges and fees.

Provision for income taxes

The effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2013 was 30.4%, compared to 29.2% for 2012. Compared to the U.S. statutory
rate, the effective tax rate was positively impacted in the period by the effect of lower tax rates on income earned in foreign jurisdictions, that is considered to be permanently reinvested, a reduced tax rate in the UK and Norway, and the
deduction in the U.S. for manufacturing activities. The effective tax rate was negatively impacted by foreign dividends net of foreign tax credits, foreign exchange gains for tax reporting in Norway, and the recognition of increased valuation
allowances on certain deferred tax assets associated with excess foreign tax credits carried to future periods.



Years Ended December 31, 2012 and December 31, 2011

The following table summarizes the Company’s revenue and operating profit by operating segment in 2012 and 2011 (in millions):

Rig Technology

Revenue from Rig Technology for the year ended December 31, 2012 was $10,107 million, an increase of $2,319 million (29.8%) compared to the year ended December 31, 2011. Deepwater offshore
drilling worldwide and active shale plays in North America were the primary driving forces for the increase in revenue for this segment during the first half of 2012, resulting in increased rig construction as well as demand for well intervention
and stimulation equipment and aftermarket spare parts. In addition, the acquisitions of NKT and Enerflow, occurring towards the beginning of the second quarter of 2012, contributed to the increase in revenue for Rig Technology. As the segment moved
into the second half of 2012, it saw continued strong deepwater offshore demand as well as a strong demand in international markets with strong revenue growth in coiled tubing equipment, wireline equipment and land rigs sold internationally. North
American markets, however, saw a decrease in demand for land drilling as both gas and oil plays have decreased production. This is evidenced by a decrease in rig count in the U.S. during 2012 and has resulted in lower sales of land rigs and jackups
in the U.S. as the segment moved into the second half of 2012. The average rig count in the U.S. during the fourth quarter of 2012 decreased to 1,809 rigs (9%) from the first quarter 2012 average of 1,991 rigs.

Operating profit from Rig Technology was $2,335 million (which included $45 million in other costs related to acquisitions) for the year ended
December 31, 2012, an increase of $282 million (13.7%) compared to 2011. Operating profit percentage decreased to 23.1%, from 26.4% in 2011. Partially contributing to the decrease in operating profit was a decrease in the average margin of
revenue out of backlog as contracts signed during 2009 and 2010 contain less favorable margins compared to contracts won during the order ramp-up from 2005 to 2008. Also contributing to the decrease in operating profit were integration costs related
to the NKT and Enerflow acquisitions made during the second quarter of 2012 as well as considerable start-up costs associated with construction of an NOV Flexibles plant in Brazil, and the opening of a new Technical College in Korea. Coiled tubing
equipment, wireline equipment and land rigs sold later in the year were primarily driven by large international projects that were secured at lower than average margins. Finally, increased FPSO related revenues, with operating profit lower than
other parts of this segment, were dilutive to overall Rig Technology operating profit margins.

The Rig Technology segment monitors its
capital equipment backlog to plan its business. New orders are added to backlog only when the Company receives a firm written order for major drilling rig components or a signed contract related to a construction project. The capital equipment
backlog was $11.9 billion at December 31, 2012, an increase of $1.7 billion (17%) from backlog of $10.2 billion at December 31, 2011.



Petroleum Services & Supplies

Revenue from Petroleum Services & Supplies for the year ended December 31, 2012 was $6,967 million, an increase of $1,313 million (23.2%) compared to the year ended December 31,
2011. Strong shale plays in North America lead to a an increase in revenue for the Petroleum Services & Supplies segment during the first half of 2012 compared to 2011. Acquisitions made during the year such as Fiberspar Corporation
and Zap-Lok Pipeline Systems, Inc. contributed to the increase in revenue for 2012 compared to 2011. Full period results of Ameron as well as other strategic acquisitions made during 2011 in the U.S., the U.K., the Netherlands, Singapore, Malaysia
and Brazil also contributed to the increase in revenue for this segment in 2012 compared to 2011. Moving into the second half of 2012, while stronger than in 2011, compared to the first half of 2012, the segment saw a decrease in North American
activity as evidenced in the decrease in U.S. rig count throughout the year.

Operating profit from Petroleum Services & Supplies was
$1,501 million (which included $18 million in other costs related to acquisitions) for the year ended December 31, 2012 compared to $1,072 million for 2011, an increase of $429 million (40.0%). Operating profit percentage increased to
21.5% up from 19.0% in 2011. This increase is primarily due to increased volume, favorable pricing and cost reductions within most business units within the segment during the first half of 2012 compared to the same period in 2011. However, as the
segment moved into the second half of the year, due to the decrease in North American market activity, it began to experience pricing pressures across a number of products in the North American land market, coupled with a shift in product mix, which
led to lower margins. Most notably, the continued reduction of North American land activity led to pricing pressures and an overall reduction in volume for the segments downhole tools, fiberglass pipe, coiled tubing, and fluid end expendables
products. While decline in various product lines were offset partially with growth in the drill pipe, XL Systems and Tuboscope products, overall margins still continued to decline towards the end of the year.

Distribution & Transmission

Revenue from Distribution & Transmission was $3,927 million for the year ended December 31, 2012, an increase of $2,054 million
(109.7%) compared to the year ended December 31, 2011. This increase was primarily attributable to the acquisitions of Wilson during the second quarter of 2012 and CE Franklin during the third quarter of 2012.

Operating profit from Distribution & Transmission was $185 million (which included $68 million in other costs related to acquisitions) for the
year ended December 31, 2012, an increase of $50 million (37.0%) compared to $135 million for the year ended December 31, 2011. Operating profit percentage decreased to 4.7%, from 7.2% in 2011. Increased volume, greater cost
efficiencies and continued favorable pricing which related to strong demand for this segment contributed to an increase in operating profit percentages for this segment during the first half of 2012. However, the impact of businesses acquired during
2012 combined with lower market activity resulted in margins dropping slightly for the year. In addition, other costs incurred for the expense recognition associated with acquired current assets stepped up to fair value during purchase accounting
also contributed to the decrease in operating profit percentage. The majority of the stepped up value related to inventory and was fully amortized by December 31, 2012.

Unallocated expenses and eliminations

Unallocated expenses and eliminations in operating
profit were $464 million for the year ended December 31, 2012 compared to $323 million for the year ended December 31, 2011. This increase was primarily due to the increased activity along all segments which in turn resulted in higher
intersegment eliminations.

Equity Income in Unconsolidated Affiliates

Equity income in unconsolidated affiliates was $58 million for the year ended December 31, 2012 compared to $46 million for the year ended December 31, 2011. This increase was primarily due to
increased equity earnings from the Company’s 50.01% investment in Voest-Alpine Tubulars (“VAT”) located in Kindberg, Austria.

Other income (expense), net

Other
income (expense), net were expenses of $71 million for the year ended December 31, 2012 compared to $39 million for the year ended December 31, 2011. This increase was primarily due to foreign exchange losses and increased bank
charges and fees.

Provision for income taxes

The effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2012 was 29.2%, compared to 32.1% for 2011. Compared to the U.S. statutory rate, the effective tax rate was positively impacted in the period by
the effect of lower tax rates on income earned in foreign jurisdictions, that is considered to be permanently reinvested, foreign dividends net of foreign tax credits, the deduction in the U.S. for manufacturing activities and foreign exchange
losses for tax reporting in Norway. The effective tax rate was negatively impacted by the recognition of increased valuation allowances on certain deferred tax assets associated with excess foreign tax credits carried to future periods.



Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Reconciliations

In an effort to provide investors with additional information regarding our results as determined by GAAP, we disclose various non-GAAP financial measures
in our quarterly earnings press releases and other public disclosures. The primary non-GAAP financial measures we focus on are: (i) operating profit excluding nonrecurring items, (ii) operating profit percentage excluding nonrecurring
items, and (iii) diluted earnings per share excluding nonrecurring items. Each of these financial measures excludes the impact of certain nonrecurring items and therefore has not been calculated in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation of each
of these non-GAAP financial measures to its most comparable GAAP financial measure is included below.

We use these non-GAAP financial
measures internally to evaluate and manage the Company’s operations because we believe it provides useful supplemental information regarding the Company’s on-going economic performance. We have chosen to provide this information to
investors to enable them to perform more meaningful comparisons of operating results and as a means to emphasize the results of on-going operations.

The following tables set forth the reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to their most comparable GAAP financial measures (in millions, except per share data):

(1)

Included in Rig Technology revenue and operating profit for the three months ended September 30, 2013 and for the year ended December 31, 2013, is a $102
million gain resulting from a legal settlement.

(2)

Other costs primarily include items such as transaction costs and the amortization of backlog and inventory that was stepped up to fair value during purchase
accounting, items which are included in operating profit. For the three months and for the year ended December 31, 2013, other costs included in operating profit were $16 million and $147 million, respectively. For the three months and for the
year ended December, 2012, other costs included in operating profit were $51 million and $131 million, respectively. Other costs for the three months ended September 30, 2013 totaled $9 million. Certain other costs that are included in other
income(expense), net were nil and $9 million for the three months and for the year ended December 31, 2013, respectively; $9 million and $12 million for the three months and for the year ended December 31, 2012, respectively; and $1
million for the three months ended September, 2013.

(3)

Includes a net $69 million tax benefit related to certain U.S. foreign tax credits arising in the three months ended December 31, 2012. These credits resulted from
a strategic reorganization of certain foreign operations to more fully integrate recently acquired businesses.



Liquidity and Capital Resources

The Company assesses liquidity in terms of its ability to generate cash to fund operating, investing and financing activities. The Company remains in a strong financial position, with resources available
to reinvest in existing businesses, strategic acquisitions and capital expenditures to meet short- and long-term objectives. The Company believes that cash on hand, cash generated from expected results of operations and amounts available under its
revolving credit facility will be sufficient to fund operations, anticipated working capital needs and other cash requirements including capital expenditures, debt and interest payments and dividend payments for the foreseeable future.

At December 31, 2013, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of $3,436 million, and total debt of $3,150 million. At December 31, 2012,
cash and cash equivalents were $3,319 million and total debt was $3,149 million. A significant portion of the consolidated cash balances are maintained in accounts in various foreign subsidiaries and, if such amounts were transferred among
countries or repatriated to the U.S., such amounts may be subject to additional tax obligations. Of the $3,436 million of cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2013, approximately $3,102 million is held outside the U.S. If
opportunities to invest in the U.S. are greater than available cash balances, the Company may choose to borrow against its $3.5 billion revolving credit facility. In August 2013, the Company initiated a commercial paper program, supported by its
revolving credit facility.

The Company’s outstanding debt at December 31, 2013 was $3,150 million and consisted of $151 million in
6.125% Senior Notes, $500 million in 1.35% Senior Notes, $1,396 million in 2.60% Senior Notes, $1,096 million in 3.95% Senior Notes, and other debt of $7 million.

At December 31, 2013, there were $947 million in outstanding letters of credit issued, resulting in $2,553 million of funds available under the Company’s revolving credit facility.

The Company also had $3,056 million of additional outstanding letters of credit at December 31, 2013, primarily in Norway, that are under various
bilateral committed letter of credit facilities. Other letters of credit are issued as bid bonds, advance payment bonds and performance bonds.

The following table summarizes our net cash provided by operating activities, net cash used in investing activities and net cash provided by (used in)
financing activities for the periods presented (in millions):

Operating Activities

2013 vs 201

2. Net cash provided by operating activities was $3,397 million in 2013 compared to net cash provided by operating activities of $620 million in 2012. Before changes in operating assets
and liabilities, net of acquisitions, cash was provided by operations primarily through net income of $2,328 million plus non-cash charges of $422 million and $66 million in a dividend received from Voest-Alpine Tubulars, an unconsolidated
affiliate, less $63 million in equity income. Net changes in operating assets and liabilities, net of acquisitions, provided $488 million in 2013 compared to $2,536 million used in 2012. This shift was primarily the result of increased cash
collections in 2013, as prepayments and milestone invoicing outpaced costs incurred on projects. Further, greater fourth quarter 2013 equipment and product sales combined with improved inventory management led to a $396 million inventory reduction
in 2013. Cash tax payments in 2013 were also down compared to 2012.

2012 vs 2011

. Net cash provided by operating activities was $620
million in 2012 compared to net cash provided by operating activities of $2,143 million in 2011. Before changes in operating assets and liabilities, net of acquisitions, cash was provided by operations primarily through net income of $2,483 million
plus non-cash charges of $628 million and $61 million in a dividend received from Voest-Alpine Tubulars, an unconsolidated affiliate, less $58 million in equity income. Net changes in operating assets and liabilities, net of acquisitions, used
$2,536 million in 2012 compared to $164 million used in 2011. Due to an increase in market activity during 2012 compared to 2011, revenue and backlog increased which is reflected in increased accounts receivable as well as a buildup in inventory.
Increased market activity during 2012 also resulted in higher taxes paid, higher accounts payable and an increase in both costs in excess of billings and billings in excess of costs with costs incurred on major rig projects outpacing customer
progress and milestone invoicing.

Investing Activities

2013 vs 2012

. Net cash used in investing activities was $2,964 million in 2013 compared to net cash used in investing activities of $3,428 million in 2012. Net cash used in investing
activities continued to primarily be the result of acquisition activity and capital expenditures. The Company used approximately $2.5 billion for the purpose of acquiring Robbins & Myers during the first quarter of 2013. For the acquisition
of Robbins & Myers, the Company borrowed approximately $1.4 billion under the $3.5 billion revolving credit facility and used approximately $1.1 billion of cash on hand to fund the acquisition. By the end of 2013, the Company repaid all of
$1.4 billion initially borrowed under its revolving credit facility. Due to the continued growth in the Company worldwide both organically and through acquisitions, the Company used $669 million during 2013 for capital expenditures compared to $583
million for 2012.

2012 vs 2011.

Net cash used in investing activities was $3,428 million in 2012 compared to net cash used in
investing activities of $1,458 million in 2011. Net cash used in investing activities continued to primarily be the result of acquisition activity and capital expenditures both of which increased in 2012 compared to 2011. The Company used
$2,880 million for the purpose of strategic acquisitions during 2012 compared to $1,038 million in 2011. In addition, due to the continued growth in the Company worldwide, both organically and through acquisition, the Company used $583 million
during 2012 for capital expenditures compared to $483 million in 2011. During 2012, the Company used a combination of its cash on hand, borrowings from its revolving credit facility and the issuance of Senior Notes to fund its acquisitions and
capital expenditures.



Financing Activities

2013 vs 2012

. Net cash used in financing activities was $305 million in 2013 shifting from net cash provided by financing activities of $2,583 million in 2012. The change was primarily due to
a decrease in net borrowings during 2013 and the Company receiving lower proceeds from stock options exercised compared to 2012. In addition, the Company doubled its quarterly dividend beginning in the second quarter of 2013.

2012 vs 2011.

Net cash provided by financing activities was $2,583 million in 2012 compared to net cash used in financing activities of $464
million in 2011. The change related to a shift from the Company primarily repaying debt during 2011 to the Company refinancing its revolving credit facility, expanding it to $3.5 billion, and issuing three truanches of Senior Notes for a total of
$3.0 billion in Senior Notes during 2012. Funds received as a result of borrowing in 2012 were used to finance working capital and acquisitions and to make tax payments. Proceeds from stock options exercised increased to $113 million during the year
ended December 31, 2012 compared to $96 million for the year ended December 31, 2011. The Company again increased its dividend to $209 million during the year ended December 31, 2012 compared to $191 million for the year ended December 31, 2011.

Other

The effect of the
change in exchange rates on cash flows was a decrease of $11 million, an increase of $9 million and a decrease of $19 million for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively.

We believe that cash on hand, cash generated from operations and amounts available under our credit facilities and from other sources of debt will be
sufficient to fund operations, working capital needs, capital expenditure requirements, dividends and financing obligations.

We intend to
pursue additional acquisition candidates, but the timing, size or success of any acquisition effort and the related potential capital commitments cannot be predicted. We continue to expect to fund future cash acquisitions primarily with cash flow
from operations and borrowings, including the unborrowed portion of the revolving credit facility or new debt issuances, but may also issue additional equity either directly or in connection with acquisitions. There can be no assurance that
additional financing for acquisitions will be available at terms acceptable to us.

A summary of the Company’s outstanding contractual
obligations at December 31, 2013 is as follows (in millions):

As of December 31, 2013, the Company entered into two capital lease agreements each covering a period of 25 years,
totaling approximately $490 million. The first lease becomes effective in 2014 and the second in 2016.

As of December 31, 2013, the
Company had $127 million of unrecognized tax benefits. This represents the tax benefits associated with various tax positions taken, or expected to be taken, on domestic and international tax returns that have not been recognized in our financial
statements due to uncertainty regarding their resolution. Due to the uncertainty of the timing of future cash flows associated with these unrecognized tax benefits, we are unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash
settlement, if any, with the respective taxing authorities. Accordingly, unrecognized tax benefits have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above. For further information related to unrecognized tax benefits, see Note 14 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Report.



Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

In preparing the financial statements, we make assumptions, estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reported. We periodically evaluate our estimates and judgments that are most critical in nature
which are related to revenue recognition under long-term construction contracts; allowance for doubtful accounts; inventory reserves; impairments of long-lived assets (excluding goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets); goodwill and
other indefinite-lived intangible assets; purchase price allocation of acquisitions; service and product warranties and income taxes. Our estimates are based on historical experience and on our future expectations that we believe are reasonable. The
combination of these factors forms the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results are likely to differ from our current estimates and those
differences may be material.

Revenue Recognition under Long-term Construction Contracts

The Company uses the percentage-of-completion method to account for certain long-term construction contracts in the Rig Technology segment. These
long-term construction contracts include the following characteristics:

•

the contracts include custom designs for customer specific applications;

•

the structural design is unique and requires significant engineering efforts; and

•

construction projects often have progress payments.

This method requires the Company to make estimates regarding the total costs of the project, progress against the project schedule and the estimated completion date, all of which impact the amount of
revenue and gross margin the Company recognizes in each reporting period. The Company prepares detailed cost to complete estimates at the beginning of each project, taking into account all factors considered likely to affect gross margin.
Significant projects and their related costs and profit margins are updated and reviewed at least quarterly by senior management. Factors that may affect future project costs and margins include shipyard access, weather, production efficiencies,
availability and costs of labor, materials and subcomponents and other factors as mentioned in “Risk Factors.” These factors can significantly impact the accuracy of the Company’s estimates and materially impact the Company’s
future reported earnings.

Historically, the Company’s estimates have been reasonably dependable regarding the recognition of revenues
and gross profits on percentage-of-completion contracts. Based upon an analysis of percentage-of-completion contracts for all open contracts outstanding at December 31, 2012 and 2011 adjustments (representing the differences between the
estimated and actual results) to all outstanding contracts resulted in net decreases to gross profit margins of 0.69% ($58 million on $8.4 billion of outstanding contracts) and 0.78% ($78 million on $9.6 billion of outstanding
contracts) for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. While the Company believes that its estimates on outstanding contracts at and in future periods will continue to be reasonably dependable under percentage-of-completion
accounting, the factors identified in the preceding paragraph could result in significant adjustments in future periods. The Company has recorded revenue on outstanding contracts (on a contract-to-date basis) of $11 billion at December 31,
2013.

Allowance for Doubtful Accounts

The determination of the collectability of amounts due from customer accounts requires the Company to make judgments regarding future events and trends. Allowances for doubtful accounts are determined
based on a continuous process of assessing the Company’s portfolio on an individual customer basis taking into account current market conditions and trends. This process consists of a thorough review of historical collection experience, current
aging status of the customer accounts, and financial condition of the Company’s customers. Based on a review of these factors, the Company will establish or adjust allowances for specific customers. A substantial portion of the Company’s
revenues come from international oil companies, international shipyards, international oilfield service companies, and government-owned or government-controlled oil companies. Therefore, the Company has significant receivables in many foreign
jurisdictions. If worldwide oil and gas drilling activity or changes in economic conditions in foreign jurisdictions deteriorate, the creditworthiness of the Company’s customers could also deteriorate and they may be unable to pay these
receivables, and additional allowances could be required. At December 31, 2013 and 2012, allowance for bad debts totaled $132 million and $120 million, or 2.6% and 2.7% of gross accounts receivable, respectively.

Historically, the Company’s charge-offs and provisions for the allowance for doubtful accounts have been immaterial to the Company’s
consolidated financial statements. However, because of the risk factors mentioned above, changes in estimates could become material in future periods.



Inventory Reserves

Inventory is carried at the lower of cost or estimated net realizable value. The Company determines reserves for inventory based on historical usage of inventory on-hand, assumptions about future demand
and market conditions, and estimates about potential alternative uses, which are usually limited. The Company’s inventory consists of specialized spare parts, work in process, and raw materials to support ongoing manufacturing operations and
the Company’s large installed base of specialized equipment used throughout the oilfield. Customers rely on the Company to stock these specialized items to ensure that their equipment can be repaired and serviced in a timely manner. The
Company’s estimated carrying value of inventory therefore depends upon demand driven by oil and gas drilling and well remediation activity, which depends in turn upon oil and gas prices, the general outlook for economic growth worldwide,
available financing for the Company’s customers, political stability in major oil and gas producing areas, and the potential obsolescence of various types of equipment we sell, among other factors. At December 31, 2013 and 2012, inventory
reserves totaled $396 million and $338 million, or 6.6% and 5.4% of gross inventory, respectively.

While inventory reserves and accruals
have not had a material impact on the Company’s financial results for the periods covered in this report, changes in worldwide oil and gas activity, or the development of new technologies which make older drilling technologies obsolete, could
require the Company to record additional allowances to reduce the value of its inventory. Such changes in our estimates could be material under weaker market conditions or outlook.

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets (Excluding Goodwill and Other Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets)

Long-lived assets, which include property, plant and equipment and identified intangible assets, comprise a significant amount of the Company’s total assets. The Company makes judgments and estimates
in conjunction with the carrying value of these assets, including amounts to be capitalized, depreciation and amortization methods and estimated useful lives.

The carrying values of these assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recorded in the
period in which it is determined that the carrying amount is not recoverable. We estimate the fair value of these intangible and fixed assets using an income approach. This requires the Company to make long-term forecasts of its future revenues and
costs related to the assets subject to review. These forecasts require assumptions about demand for the Company’s products and services, future market conditions and technological developments. The forecasts are dependent upon assumptions
regarding oil and gas prices, the general outlook for economic growth worldwide, available financing for the Company’s customers, political stability in major oil and gas producing areas, and the potential obsolescence of various types of
equipment we sell, among other factors. The financial and credit market volatility directly impacts our fair value measurement through our income forecast as well as our weighted-average cost of capital, both key assumptions used in our calculation.
Changes to these assumptions, including, but not limited to: sustained declines in worldwide rig counts below current analysts’ forecasts, collapse of spot and futures prices for oil and gas, significant deterioration of external financing for
our customers, higher risk premiums or higher cost of equity, or any other significant adverse economic news could require a provision for impairment in a future period.

Goodwill and Other Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets

The Company has approximately $9.0
billion of goodwill and $0.6 billion of other intangible assets with indefinite lives as of December 31, 2013. Generally accepted accounting principles require the Company to test goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets for
impairment at least annually or more frequently whenever events or circumstances occur indicating that goodwill or other indefinite-lived intangible assets might be impaired. Events or circumstances which could indicate a potential impairment
include, but not limited to: further sustained declines in worldwide rig counts below current analysts’ forecasts, further collapse of spot and futures prices for oil and gas, significant additional deterioration of external financing for our
customers, higher risk premiums or higher cost of equity.

The implied fair value of goodwill is determined by deducting the fair value of a
reporting unit’s identifiable assets and liabilities from the fair value of that reporting unit as a whole. Fair value of the reporting units is determined in accordance with ASC Topic 820 “Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures”
using significant unobservable inputs, or level 3 in the fair value hierarchy. These inputs are based on internal management estimates, forecasts and judgments, using a combination of three methods: discounted cash flow, comparable companies, and
representative transactions. While the Company primarily uses the discounted cash flow method to assess fair value, the Company uses the comparable companies and representative transaction methods to validate the discounted cash flow analysis and
further support management’s expectations, where possible.

The discounted cash flow is based on management’s short-term and
long-term forecast of operating performance for each reporting unit. The two main assumptions used in measuring goodwill impairment, which bear the risk of change and could impact the Company’s goodwill impairment analysis, include the cash
flow from operations from each of the Company’s individual business units and the weighted average cost of capital. The starting point for each of the reporting unit’s cash flow from operations is the detailed annual plan or updated
forecast. The detailed planning and forecasting process takes into consideration a multitude of factors



including worldwide rig activity, inflationary forces, pricing strategies, customer analysis, operational issues, competitor analysis, capital spending requirements, working capital needs,
customer needs to replace aging equipment, increased complexity of drilling, new technology, and existing backlog among other items which impact the individual reporting unit projections. Cash flows beyond the specific operating plans were estimated
using a terminal value calculation, which incorporated historical and forecasted financial cyclical trends for each reporting unit and considered long-term earnings growth rates. The financial and credit market volatility directly impacts our fair
value measurement through our weighted average cost of capital that we use to determine our discount rate. During times of volatility, significant judgment must be applied to determine whether credit changes are a short-term or long-term trend.

The annual impairment test is performed during the fourth quarter of each year. The valuation techniques used in the annual test were
consistent with those used during previous testing. The inputs used in the annual test were updated for current market conditions and forecasts. During the review of its 2013 annual impairment test, the calculated fair values for all of the
Company’s reporting units were considered substantially in excess of the respective reporting unit’s carrying value. Also, the fair value for all of the Company’s intangible assets with indefinite lives were considered substantially
in excess of the respective asset carrying values, with one exception. This intangible asset, which represents a trade name within the Company’s Petroleum Services & Supplies segment, had a calculated fair value approximately 13% in excess
of its carrying value. Using the discounted cash flows approach, a decrease in the forecasted revenues of 20%, and/or an increase in the discount rate by 200 basis points could yield an impairment of approximately $25 million to $75 million. Based
on its analysis, the Company did not report any impairment of goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011.

Purchase Price Allocation of Acquisitions

The Company allocates the purchase price of an
acquired business to its identifiable assets and liabilities based on estimated fair values. The excess of the purchase price over the amount allocated to the assets and liabilities, if any, is recorded as goodwill. The Company uses all available
information to estimate fair values including quoted market prices, the carrying value of acquired assets, and widely accepted valuation techniques such as discounted cash flows. The Company engages third-party appraisal firms to assist in fair
value determination of inventories, identifiable intangible assets, and any other significant assets or liabilities when appropriate. The judgments made in determining the estimated fair value assigned to each class of assets acquired and
liabilities assumed, as well as asset lives, could materially impact the Company’s results of operations.

Service and Product
Warranties

The Company provides service and warranty policies on certain of its products. The Company accrues liabilities under service
and warranty policies based upon specific claims and a review of historical warranty and service claim experience in accordance with ASC Topic 450 “Contingencies” (“ASC Topic 450”). Adjustments are made to accruals as claim data
and historical experience change. In addition, the Company incurs discretionary costs to service its products in connection with product performance issues and recognizes them when they are incurred. At December 31, 2013 and 2012, service and
product warranties totaled $228 million and $194 million, respectively.

Income Taxes

The Company is a U.S. registered company and is subject to income taxes in the U.S. The Company operates through various subsidiaries in a number of
countries throughout the world. Income taxes have been provided based upon the tax laws and rates of the countries in which the Company operates and income is earned.

The Company’s annual tax provision is based on taxable income, statutory rates and tax planning opportunities available in the various jurisdictions in which it operates. The determination and
evaluation of the annual tax provision and tax positions involves the interpretation of the tax laws in the various jurisdictions in which the Company operates. It requires significant judgment and the use of estimates and assumptions regarding
significant future events such as the amount, timing and character of income, deductions and tax credits. Changes in tax laws, regulations, and treaties, foreign currency exchange restrictions or the Company’s level of operations or
profitability in each jurisdiction could impact the tax liability in any given year. The Company also operates in many jurisdictions where the tax laws relating to the pricing of transactions between related parties are open to interpretation, which
could potentially result in aggressive tax authorities asserting additional tax liabilities with no offsetting tax recovery in other countries.

The Company maintains liabilities for uncertain tax positions in jurisdictions of operation. The annual tax provision includes the impact of income tax
provisions and benefits for changes to liabilities that the Company considers appropriate, as well as related interest. Uncertain tax positions primarily include potential challenges to intercompany pricing and certain operating expenses that may
not be deductible in foreign jurisdictions. These exposures are resolved primarily through the settlement of audits within these tax jurisdictions or by judicial means. The Company is subject to audits by federal, state and foreign jurisdictions
which may result in proposed assessments. The Company believes that an appropriate liability has been established for uncertain tax positions under the guidance in ASC Topic 740 “Income Taxes” (“ASC Topic 740”). However, actual
results may differ materially from these estimates. The Company reviews these liabilities quarterly and to the extent audits or other events result in an adjustment to the liability accrued for a prior year, the effect will be recognized in the
period of the event.



The Company currently has recorded valuation allowances that the Company intends to maintain until it is
more likely than not the deferred tax assets will be realized. Income tax expense recorded in the future will be reduced to the extent of decreases in the Company’s valuation allowances. The realization of remaining deferred tax assets is
primarily dependent on future taxable income. Any reduction in future taxable income including but not limited to any future restructuring activities may require that the Company record an additional valuation allowance against deferred tax assets.
An increase in the valuation allowance would result in additional income tax expense in such period and could have a significant impact on future earnings.

The Company has not provided for deferred taxes on the unremitted earnings of certain subsidiaries that are permanently reinvested. Should the Company make a distribution from the unremitted earnings of
these subsidiaries, the Company may be required to record additional taxes. Unremitted earnings of these subsidiaries were $6,045 million and $4,620 million at December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. The Company makes a determination each
period whether to permanently reinvest these earnings. If, as a result of these reassessments, the Company distributes these earnings in the future, additional tax liabilities would result, offset by any available foreign tax credits.

Recently Issued Accounting Standards

In
February 2013, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standard Update No. 2013-02, “Reporting of Amounts Reclassified out of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income” (ASU No. 2013-02), which
is an update for Accounting Standards Codification Topic No. 220 “Comprehensive Income”. The update improves the reporting of reclassifications out of accumulated other comprehensive income. The guidance was effective for the
Company’s interim and annual reporting periods beginning January 1, 2013, and applied prospectively. There was no significant impact to the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements from the adopted provisions of ASU
No. 2013-02.

In March 2013, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2013-05, “Parent’s Accounting for the
Cumulative Translation Adjustment upon Derecognition of Certain Subsidiaries or Groups of Assets within a Foreign Entity or of an Investment in a Foreign Entity (a consensus of the FASB Emerging Issues Task Force).” (ASU No. 2013-05),
which amends Accounting Standards Codification Topic No. 830, “Foreign Currency Matters,” and Accounting Standards Codification Topic No. 810, “Consolidation,” to address diversity in practice related to the release of
cumulative translation adjustments (“CTA”) into earnings upon the occurrence of certain derecognition events. ASU No. 2013-05 precludes the release of CTA for derecognition events that occur within a foreign entity, unless such events
represent a complete or substantially complete liquidation of the foreign entity; however, derecognition events related to investments in a foreign entity result in the release of all CTA related to the derecognized foreign entity, even when a
noncontrolling financial interest is retained. ASU No. 2013-05 also amends Accounting Standards Codification Topic No. 805, “Business Combinations,” for transactions that result in a company obtaining control of a business in a
step acquisition by increasing an investment in a foreign entity from one accounted for under the equity method to one accounted for as a consolidated investment. ASU No. 2013-05 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15,
2013, and applied prospectively. Early adoption is permitted as of the beginning of the entity’s fiscal year. The Company is currently assessing the impact ASU No. 2013-05 will have on its financial statements, but does not expect a
significant impact from adoption of the pronouncement.

Forward–Looking Statements

Some of the information in this document contains, or has incorporated by reference, forward-looking statements. Statements that are not historical facts,
including statements about our beliefs and expectations, are forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements typically are identified by use of terms such as “may,” “will,” “expect,” “anticipate,”
“estimate,” and similar words, although some forward-looking statements are expressed differently. All statements herein regarding expected merger synergies are forward looking statements. You should be aware that our actual results could
differ materially from results anticipated in the forward-looking statements due to a number of factors, including but not limited to changes in oil and gas prices, customer demand for our products and worldwide economic activity. You should also
consider carefully the statements under “Risk Factors” which address additional factors that could cause our actual results to differ from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. Given these uncertainties, current or prospective
investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on any such forward-looking statements. We undertake no obligation to update any such factors or forward-looking statements to reflect future events or developments.



ITEM 7A.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

We are exposed to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. Additional information concerning each of these matters follows:

Foreign Currency Exchange Rates

We have extensive operations in foreign countries. The net
assets and liabilities of these operations are exposed to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, although such fluctuations generally do not affect income since their functional currency is typically the local currency. These operations also
have net assets and liabilities not denominated in the functional currency, which exposes us to changes in foreign currency exchange rates that impact income. During the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, the Company reported foreign
currency losses of $26 million, $21 million and $10 million, respectively. Gains and losses are primarily due to exchange rate fluctuations related to monetary asset balances denominated in currencies other than the functional currency and
adjustments to our hedged positions as a result of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Strengthening of currencies against the U.S. dollar may create losses in future periods to the extent we maintain net assets and liabilities not
denominated in the functional currency of the countries using the local currency as their functional currency.

Some of our revenues in
foreign countries are denominated in U.S. dollars, and therefore, changes in foreign currency exchange rates impact our earnings to the extent that costs associated with those U.S. dollar revenues are denominated in the local currency. Similarly
some of our revenues are denominated in foreign currencies, but have associated U.S. dollar costs, which also give rise to foreign currency exchange rate exposure. In order to mitigate that risk, we may utilize foreign currency forward contracts to
better match the currency of our revenues and associated costs. We do not use foreign currency forward contracts for trading or speculative purposes.

The following table details the Company’s foreign currency exchange risk grouped by functional currency and their expected maturity periods as of December 31, 2013 (in millions except for
rates):





The Company had other financial market risk sensitive instruments denominated in foreign currencies for transactional
exposures totaling $875 million and translation exposures totaling $561 million as of December 31, 2013, excluding trade receivables and payables, which approximate fair value. These market risk sensitive instruments consisted of cash balances
and overdraft facilities. The Company estimates that a hypothetical 10% movement of all applicable foreign currency exchange rates on the transactional exposures financial market risk sensitive instruments could affect net income by $57 million and
the translational exposures financial market risk sensitive instruments could affect the future fair value by $56 million.

The counterparties
to forward contracts are major financial institutions. The credit ratings and concentration of risk of these financial institutions are monitored on a continuing basis. In the event that the counterparties fail to meet the terms of a foreign
currency contract, our exposure is limited to the foreign currency rate differential.

Historically, the Venezuelan government has devalued
the country’s currency. During the first quarter of 2013, the Venezuelan government again officially devalued the Venezuelan bolivar against the U.S. dollar. As a result, the Company incurred approximately $12 million in devaluation charges in
the first quarter of 2013. The Company’s net investment in Venezuela was $39 million at December 31, 2013.

Interest Rate Risk

At December 31, 2013, our long term borrowings consisted of $151 million in 6.125% Senior Notes, $500 million in 1.35% Senior Notes,
$1,400 million in 2.60% Senior Notes and $1,100 million in 3.95% Senior Notes. We occasionally have borrowings under our credit facility, and a portion of these borrowings could be denominated in multiple currencies which could expose us to market
risk with exchange rate movements. These instruments carry interest at a pre-agreed upon percentage point spread from either LIBOR, NIBOR or EURIBOR, or at the prime interest rate. Under our credit facility, we may, at our option, fix the interest
rate for certain borrowings based on a spread over LIBOR, NIBOR or EURIBOR for 30 days to six months.

MANAGEMENT’S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

National Oilwell Varco, Inc.’s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting.
National Oilwell Varco, Inc.’s internal control system was designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles.

Internal control over financial reporting cannot provide absolute assurance of achieving financial reporting
objectives because of its inherent limitations. Internal control over financial reporting is a process that involves human diligence and compliance and is subject to lapses in judgment and breakdowns resulting from human failures. Internal control
over financial reporting also can be circumvented by collusion or improper management override. Because of such limitations, there is a risk that material misstatements may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by internal control over
financial reporting. However, these inherent limitations are known features of the financial reporting process. Therefore, it is possible to design into the process safeguards to reduce, though not eliminate, this risk.

On February 20, 2013, the Company acquired Robbins & Myers. For purposes of determining the effectiveness of the Company’s internal
control over financial reporting, as disclosed in this report, management has excluded the internal controls of Robbins & Myers from its evaluation. The acquired business represented approximately 8% of our consolidated total assets at
December 31, 2013, and 3% of consolidated revenues and 4% of our consolidated operating profit for the year ended December 31, 2013.

Management has used the 1992 framework set forth in the report entitled “Internal Control—Integrated Framework” published by the Committee
of Sponsoring Organizations (“COSO”) of the Treadway Commission to evaluate the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Management has concluded that the Company’s internal control over financial
reporting was effective as of December 31, 2013.

The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of
December 31, 2013, has been audited by Ernst & Young LLP, the independent registered public accounting firm which also has audited the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

The Board of Directors and Shareholders

National Oilwell Varco, Inc.

We have audited
National Oilwell Varco, Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2013, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
Treadway Commission (1992 framework) (the COSO criteria). National Oilwell Varco, Inc’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal
control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on
our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal
control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered
necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over
financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the
assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of
the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control
over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

As indicated in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control
Over Financial Reporting, management’s assessment of and conclusion on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting did not include the internal controls of Robbins & Myers, which is included in the 2013 consolidated
financial statements of the Company and constituted approximately 8% of consolidated total assets at December 31, 2013, and 3% of consolidated revenues and 4% of consolidated operating profit for the year ended December 31, 2013. Our audit
of internal control over financial reporting of the Company also did not include the evaluation of internal control over financial reporting of Robbins & Myers.

In our opinion, National Oilwell Varco, Inc. maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2013, based on the COSO criteria.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets
as of December 31, 2013 and 2012, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, stockholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2013 of National Oilwell
Varco, Inc. and our report dated February 14, 2014 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and Shareholders

National Oilwell Varco, Inc.

We have audited
the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of National Oilwell Varco, Inc. as of December 31, 2013 and 2012, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, stockholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the
three years in the period ended December 31, 2013. Our audits also included the financial statement schedule listed in the index at item 15(2). These financial statements and schedule are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and schedule based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance
with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement.
An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as
evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our
opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of National Oilwell Varco, Inc. as of December 31, 2013 and 2012, and the consolidated results of its operations
and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2013, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also, in our opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when considered in relation
to the basic financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly in all material respects the information set forth therein.

We also have
audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), National Oilwell Varco, Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2013, based on criteria established in
Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (1992 framework) and our report dated February 14, 2014, expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

NATIONAL OILWELL VARCO, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1. Organization and Basis of Presentation

Nature of Business

We
design, construct, manufacture and sell comprehensive systems, components, and products used in oil and gas drilling and production, provide oilfield services and supplies, and distribute products and provide supply chain integration services to the
upstream oil and gas industry. Our revenues and operating results are directly related to the level of worldwide oil and gas drilling and production activities and the profitability and cash flow of oil and gas companies, drilling contractors and
oilfield service companies, which in turn are affected by current and anticipated prices of oil and gas. Oil and gas prices have been, and are likely to continue to be, volatile.

Basis of Consolidation

The accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements include the
accounts of National Oilwell Varco, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries. All significant intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation. Investments that are not wholly-owned, but where we exercise control, are fully
consolidated with the equity held by minority owners and their portion of net income (loss) reflected as noncontrolling interests in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. Investments in unconsolidated affiliates, over which we
exercise significant influence, but not control, are accounted for by the equity method.

2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Fair Value of Financial Instruments

The carrying amounts of financial instruments including cash and cash equivalents, receivables, and payables approximated fair value because of the relatively short maturity of these instruments. Cash
equivalents include only those investments having a maturity date of three months or less at the time of purchase.

Derivative Financial
Instruments

Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 815, “Derivatives and Hedging” (“ASC Topic 815”)
requires companies to recognize all derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheet at fair value. The accounting for changes in the fair value (i.e., gains or losses) of a derivative instrument depends on
whether it has been designated and qualifies as part of a hedging relationship and further, on the type of hedging relationship. For those derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as hedging instruments, a company must designate the
hedging instrument, based upon the exposure being hedged, as a fair value hedge, cash flow hedge, or a hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation.

The Company records all derivative financial instruments at their fair value in its Consolidated Balance Sheet. Except for certain non-designated hedges, all derivative financial instruments that the
Company holds are designated as cash flow hedges and are highly effective in offsetting movements in the underlying risks. Such arrangements typically have terms between two and 24 months, but may have longer terms depending on the underlying cash
flows being hedged, typically related to the projects in our backlog.

Inventories

Inventories consist of raw materials, work-in-process and oilfield and industrial finished products, manufactured equipment and spare parts. Inventories
are stated at the lower of cost or market using the first-in, first-out or average cost methods. Allowances for excess and obsolete inventories are determined based on our historical usage of inventory on-hand as well as our future expectations
related to our installed base and the development of new products. The allowance, which totaled $396 million and $338 million at December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively, is the amount necessary to reduce the cost of the inventory to its
net realizable value.



Property, Plant and Equipment

Property, plant and equipment are recorded at cost. Expenditures for major improvements that extend the lives of property and equipment are capitalized while minor replacements, maintenance and repairs
are charged to operations as incurred. Disposals are removed at cost less accumulated depreciation with any resulting gain or loss reflected in operations. Depreciation is provided using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of
individual items. Depreciation expense was $392 million, $323 million and $279 million for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. The estimated useful lives of the major classes of property, plant and
equipment are included in Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements.

Long-lived Assets

We record impairment losses on long-lived assets used in operations when events and circumstances indicate that the assets are impaired and the
undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than the carrying amount of those assets. The carrying value of assets used in operations that are not recoverable is reduced to fair value if lower than carrying value. In
determining the fair market value of the assets, we consider market trends and recent transactions involving sales of similar assets, or when not available, discounted cash flow analysis. There have been no impairments of long-lived assets for the
years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011.

Intangible Assets

The Company has approximately $9.0 billion of goodwill and $5.1 billion of identified intangible assets at December 31, 2013. Generally accepted accounting principles require the Company to test
goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment at least annually or more frequently whenever events or circumstances occur indicating that such assets might be impaired.

Goodwill is identified by segment as follows (in millions):



Identified intangible assets with determinable lives consist primarily of customer relationships,
trademarks, trade names, patents, and technical drawings acquired in acquisitions, and are being amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of 2-30 years. Amortization expense of identified intangibles is expected to be
approximately $360 million in each of the next five years. Included in intangible assets are approximately $643 million of indefinite-lived trade names.

The net book values of identified intangible assets are identified by segment as follows (in millions):

Identified intangible assets by major classification consist of the following (in millions):

The Company performed its annual impairment analysis for its goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets during the
fourth quarter of 2013, 2012 and 2011 each resulting in no impairment. The valuation techniques used in the annual test were consistent with those used during previous testing. The inputs used in the annual test were updated for current market
conditions and forecasts.



Foreign Currency

The functional currency for most of our foreign operations is the local currency. The cumulative effects of translating the balance sheet accounts from the functional currency into the U.S. dollar at
current exchange rates are included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). Revenues and expenses are translated at average exchange rates in effect during the period. Certain other foreign operations, including our operations in Norway,
use the U.S. dollar as the functional currency. Accordingly, financial statements of these foreign subsidiaries are remeasured to U.S. dollars for consolidation purposes using current rates of exchange for monetary assets and liabilities and
historical rates of exchange for nonmonetary assets and related elements of expense. Revenue and expense elements are remeasured at rates that approximate the rates in effect on the transaction dates. For all operations, gains or losses from
remeasuring foreign currency transactions into the functional currency are included in income. Net foreign currency transaction losses were $26 million, $21 million and $10 million for the years ending December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011,
respectively, and are included in other income (expense) in the accompanying statement of operations.

Historically, the Venezuelan
government has devalued the country’s currency. During the first quarter of 2013, the Venezuelan government again officially devalued the Venezuelan bolivar against the U.S. dollar. As a result, the Company incurred approximately $12 million in
devaluation charges in the first quarter of 2013. The Company’s net investment in Venezuela was $39 million at December 31, 2013.

Revenue Recognition

The Company’s
products and services are sold based upon purchase orders or contracts with the customer that include fixed or determinable prices and that do not generally include right of return or other similar provisions or other significant post delivery
obligations. Except for certain construction contracts and drill pipe sales described below, the Company records revenue at the time its manufacturing process is complete, the customer has been provided with all proper inspection and other required
documentation, title and risk of loss has passed to the customer, collectability is reasonably assured and the product has been delivered. Customer advances or deposits are deferred and recognized as revenue when the Company has completed all of its
performance obligations related to the sale. The Company also recognizes revenue as services are performed. The amounts billed for shipping and handling cost are included in revenue and related costs are included in cost of sales.

Revenue Recognition under Long-term Construction Contracts

The Company uses the percentage-of-completion method to account for certain long-term construction contracts in the Rig Technology segment. These long-term construction contracts include the following
characteristics:

•

the contracts include custom designs for customer specific applications;

•

the structural design is unique and requires significant engineering efforts; and

•

construction projects often have progress payments.

This method requires the Company to make estimates regarding the total costs of the project, progress against the project schedule and the estimated completion date, all of which impact the amount of
revenue and gross margin the Company recognizes in each reporting period. The Company prepares detailed cost estimates at the beginning of each project. Significant projects and their related costs and profit margins are updated and reviewed at
least quarterly by senior management. Factors that may affect future project costs and margins include shipyard access, weather, production efficiencies, availability and costs of labor, materials and subcomponents and other factors. These factors
can impact the accuracy of the Company’s estimates and materially impact the Company’s current and future reported earnings.

The
asset, “Costs in excess of billings,” represents revenues recognized in excess of amounts billed. The liability, “Billings in excess of costs,” represents billings in excess of revenues recognized.

Drill Pipe Sales

For drill pipe sales,
if requested in writing by the customer, delivery may be satisfied through delivery to the Company’s customer storage location or to a third-party storage facility. For sales transactions where title and risk of loss have transferred to the
customer but the supporting documentation does not meet the criteria for revenue recognition prior to the products being in the physical possession of the customer, the recognition of the revenues and related inventory costs from these transactions
are deferred until the customer takes physical possession.



Service and Product Warranties

The Company provides service and warranty policies on certain of its products. The Company accrues liabilities under service and warranty policies based upon specific claims and a review of historical
warranty and service claim experience in accordance with ASC Topic 450 “Contingencies” (“ASC Topic 450”). Adjustments are made to accruals as claim data and historical experience change. In addition, the Company incurs
discretionary costs to service its products in connection with product performance issues and accrues for them when they are encountered. The Company monitors the actual cost of performing these discretionary services and adjusts the accrual based
on the most current information available.

The changes in the carrying amount of service and product warranties are as follows (in millions):

Income Taxes

The liability method is used to account for income taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between the financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities
and are measured using the enacted tax rates that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse. Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to amounts which are more likely than not to be
realized.

Concentration of Credit Risk

We grant credit to our customers, which operate primarily in the oil and gas industry. Concentrations of credit risk are limited because we have a large number of geographically diverse customers, thus
spreading trade credit risk. We control credit risk through credit evaluations, credit limits and monitoring procedures. We perform periodic credit evaluations of our customers’ financial condition and generally do not require collateral, but
may require letters of credit for certain international sales. Credit losses are provided for in the financial statements. Allowances for doubtful accounts are determined based on a continuous process of assessing the Company’s portfolio on an
individual customer basis taking into account current market conditions and trends. This process consists of a thorough review of historical collection experience, current aging status of the customer accounts, and financial condition of the
Company’s customers. Based on a review of these factors, the Company will establish or adjust allowances for specific customers. Accounts receivable are net of allowances for doubtful accounts of approximately $132 million and $120 million at
December 31, 2013 and 2012.

Stock-Based Compensation

Compensation expense for the Company’s stock-based compensation plans is measured using the fair value method required by ASC Topic 718 “Compensation – Stock Compensation” (“ASC
Topic 718”). Under this guidance the fair value of stock option grants and restricted stock is amortized to expense using the straight-line method over the shorter of the vesting period or the remaining employee service period.

The Company provides compensation benefits to employees and non-employee directors under share-based payment arrangements, including various employee
stock option plans.

Total compensation cost that has been charged against income for all share-based compensation arrangements was
$92 million, $80 million and $73 million for 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. The total income tax benefit recognized in the income statement for all share-based compensation arrangements was $28 million, $24 million and $17
million for 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively.



Environmental Liabilities

When environmental assessments or remediations are probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated, remediation liabilities are recorded on an undiscounted basis and are adjusted as further information
develops or circumstances change.

Use of Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported and
contingent amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Such estimates include but are not limited to, estimated losses on accounts
receivable, estimated costs and related margins of projects accounted for under percentage-of-completion, estimated realizable value on excess and obsolete inventory, contingencies, estimated liabilities for litigation exposures and liquidated
damages, estimated warranty costs, estimates related to pension accounting, estimates related to the fair value of reporting units for purposes of assessing goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment and estimates related
to deferred tax assets and liabilities, including valuation allowances on deferred tax assets. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Contingencies

The Company accrues for costs relating to litigation claims and other
contingent matters, including liquidated damage liabilities, when such liabilities become probable and reasonably estimable. In circumstances where the most likely outcome of a contingency can be reasonably estimated, we accrue a liability for that
amount. Where the most likely outcome cannot be estimated, a range of potential losses is established and if no one amount in that range is more likely than others, the low end of the range is accrued. Such estimates may be based on advice from
third parties or on management’s judgment, as appropriate. Revisions to contingent liabilities are reflected in income in the period in which different facts or information become known or circumstances change that affect the Company’s
previous judgments with respect to the likelihood or amount of loss. Amounts paid upon the ultimate resolution of contingent liabilities may be materially different from previous estimates and could require adjustments to the estimated reserves to
be recognized in the period such new information becomes known.

Net Income Attributable to Company Per Share

The following table sets forth the computation of weighted average basic and diluted shares outstanding (in millions, except per share data):

ASC Topic 260, “Earnings Per Share” (“ASC Topic 260”) requires companies with unvested participating
securities to utilize a two-class method for the computation of net income attributable to Company per share. The two-class method requires a portion of net income attributable to Company to be allocated to participating securities, which are
unvested awards of share-based payments with non-forfeitable rights to receive dividends or dividend equivalents, if declared. Net income attributable to Company allocated to these participating securities was immaterial for the years ended
December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011 and therefore not excluded from net income attributable to Company per share calculation.

The Company
had stock options outstanding that were anti-dilutive totaling 7 million, 5 million, and 3 million at December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively.



Recently Issued Accounting Standards

In February 2013, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standard Update No. 2013-02, “Reporting of Amounts Reclassified out of Accumulated Other
Comprehensive Income” (ASU No. 2013-02), which is an update for Accounting Standards Codification Topic No. 220 “Comprehensive Income”. The update improves the reporting of reclassifications out of accumulated other
comprehensive income. The guidance was effective for the Company’s interim and annual reporting periods beginning January 1, 2013, and applied prospectively. There was no significant impact to the Company’s Consolidated Financial
Statements from the adopted provisions of ASU No. 2013-02.

In March 2013, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2013-05,
“Parent’s Accounting for the Cumulative Translation Adjustment upon Derecognition of Certain Subsidiaries or Groups of Assets within a Foreign Entity or of an Investment in a Foreign Entity (a consensus of the FASB Emerging Issues Task
Force).” (ASU No. 2013-05), which amends Accounting Standards Codification Topic No. 830, “Foreign Currency Matters,” and Accounting Standards Codification Topic No. 810, “Consolidation,” to address diversity in practice
related to the release of cumulative translation adjustments (“CTA”) into earnings upon the occurrence of certain derecognition events. ASU No. 2013-05 precludes the release of CTA for derecognition events that occur within a foreign
entity, unless such events represent a complete or substantially complete liquidation of the foreign entity; however, derecognition events related to investments in a foreign entity result in the release of all CTA related to the derecognized
foreign entity, even when a noncontrolling financial interest is retained. ASU No. 2013-05 also amends Accounting Standards Codification Topic No. 805, “Business Combinations,” for transactions that result in a company obtaining control of
a business in a step acquisition by increasing an investment in a foreign entity from one accounted for under the equity method to one accounted for as a consolidated investment. ASU No. 2013-05 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December
15, 2013, and applied prospectively. Early adoption is permitted as of the beginning of the entity’s fiscal year. The Company is currently assessing the impact ASU No. 2013-05 will have on its financial statements, but does not expect a
significant impact from adoption of the pronouncement.



3. Derivative Financial Instruments

The Company is exposed to certain risks relating to its ongoing business operations. The primary risk managed by using derivative
instruments is foreign currency exchange rate risk. Forward contracts against various foreign currencies are entered into to manage the foreign currency exchange rate risk on forecasted revenues and expenses denominated in currencies other than the
functional currency of the operating unit (cash flow hedge). Other forward exchange contracts against various foreign currencies are entered into to manage the foreign currency exchange rate risk associated with certain firm commitments denominated
in currencies other than the functional currency of the operating unit (fair value hedge). In addition, the Company will enter into non-designated forward contracts against various foreign currencies to manage the foreign currency exchange rate risk
on recognized nonfunctional currency monetary accounts (non-designated hedge).

At December 31, 2013, the Company has determined that the
fair value of its derivative financial instruments representing assets of $59 million and liabilities of $40 million (primarily currency related derivatives) are determined using level 2 inputs (inputs other than quoted prices in active markets for
identical assets and liabilities that are observable either directly or indirectly for substantially the full term of the asset or liability) in the fair value hierarchy as the fair value is based on publicly available foreign exchange and interest
rates at each financial reporting date. At December 31, 2013, the net fair value of the Company’s foreign currency forward contracts totaled a net asset of $19 million.

At December 31, 2013, the Company’s financial instruments do not contain any credit-risk-related or other contingent features that could cause accelerated payments when the Company’s
financial instruments are in net liability positions. We do not use derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes.

Cash Flow Hedging Strategy

To protect
against the volatility of forecasted foreign currency cash flows resulting from forecasted revenues and expenses, the Company has instituted a cash flow hedging program. The Company hedges portions of its forecasted revenues and expenses denominated
in nonfunctional currencies with forward contracts. When the U.S. dollar strengthens against the foreign currencies, the decrease in present value of future foreign currency revenues and expenses is offset by gains in the fair value of the forward
contracts designated as hedges. Conversely, when the U.S. dollar weakens, the increase in the present value of future foreign currency cash flows is offset by losses in the fair value of the forward contracts.

For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as a cash flow hedge (i.e., hedging the exposure to variability in expected future cash flows
that is subject to a particular currency risk), the effective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative instrument is reported as a component of Other Comprehensive Income and reclassified into earnings in the same line item associated with the
forecasted transaction and in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings (e.g., in “revenues” when the hedged transactions are cash flows associated with forecasted revenues). The remaining gain or loss
on the derivative instrument in excess of the cumulative change in the present value of future cash flows of the hedged item, if any (i.e., the ineffective portion), or hedge components excluded from the assessment of effectiveness, is recognized in
the Consolidated Statements of Income during the current period.



At December 31, 2013 and 2012, the Company had the following outstanding foreign currency forward
contracts that were entered into to hedge nonfunctional currency cash flows from forecasted revenues and expenses (in millions):

Non-designated Hedging Strategy

The Company enters into forward exchange contracts to hedge certain nonfunctional currency monetary accounts. The purpose of the Company’s foreign currency hedging activities is to protect the
Company from risk that the eventual U.S. dollar equivalent cash flows from the nonfunctional currency monetary accounts will be adversely affected by changes in the exchange rates.

For derivative instruments that are non-designated, the gain or loss on the derivative instrument subject to the hedged risk (i.e., nonfunctional currency monetary accounts) is recognized in other income
(expense), net in current earnings.

The Company had the following outstanding foreign currency forward contracts that hedge the fair value of
nonfunctional currency monetary accounts (in millions):



The Company has the following fair values of its derivative instruments and their balance sheet
classifications (in millions):

December 31, 2013 and 2012, and $12 million and $8 million related to the amount excluded from the assessment of the hedge effectiveness for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively.



4. Acquisitions and Investments


On
February 20, 2013, the Company completed its acquisition of all of the shares of Robbins & Myers, Inc. (“R&M”), a U.S.-based designer and manufacturer of products and systems for the oil and gas industry. Under the merger
agreement for this transaction, R&M shareholders received $60.00 in cash for each common share for an aggregate purchase price of $2,378 million, net of cash acquired. In addition to R&M, the Company completed five acquisitions and other
investments for an aggregate purchase price of $19 million, net of cash acquired.

The Company has included the financial results of R&M
in its consolidated financial statements as of the date of acquisition with components of the R&M operations included in the Company’s Rig Technology, Petroleum Services & Supplies and Distribution & Transmission segments.
The Company believes the acquisition of R&M will advance its strategic goal of providing a broader selection of products and services to its customers.

The following table displays the total preliminary purchase price allocation for the R&M acquisition. The table summarizes the fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the date of
acquisition (in millions):

The Company has allocated $894 million to identifiable intangible assets (19 year weighted-average life). The intangible
assets are amortizable and are comprised of: $635 million of customer relationships (18 year weighted-average life), $170 million of patents (20 year weighted-average life), $86 million of trademarks (20 year weighted-average life), and $3
million of other intangible assets (1 year weighted-average life). The amount allocated to goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired. Goodwill specifically includes the expected
synergies and other benefits that the Company believes will result from combining its operations with those of businesses acquired and other intangible assets that do not qualify for separate recognition, such as assembled workforce in place at the
date of acquisition. Goodwill resulting from the R&M acquisition is not deductible for tax purposes. Pro forma information is not included because the results of the acquired operations would not have materially impacted the Company’s
consolidated operating results.




In the year ended December 31, 2012, the Company completed 17 acquisitions for an aggregate purchase price of $2,880 million, net of cash acquired. These acquisitions included:

•

All the shares of NKT Flexibles I/S (“NKT”), a Denmark-based designer and manufacturer of flexible pipe products and systems for the offshore
oil and gas industry, acquired on April 4, 2012. The Company reported the NKT results within its Rig Technology segment from the date of acquisition.

•

All the shares of Enerflow Industries Inc. (U.S.) and certain assets of Enerflow Industries Inc. (Canada) (“Enerflow”), a Canada-based
fabricator and manufacturer of pressure pumping, blending, and cementing equipment for use primarily in Canada and the U.S., acquired on May 16, 2012. The Company reported the Enerflow results within its Rig Technology segment from the date of
acquisition.

•

All the shares of Wilson Distribution Holdings (“Wilson”), a U.S.-based distributor of pipe, valves and fittings as well as mill, tool and
safety products and services, acquired on May 31, 2012. The Company reported the Wilson results within its Distribution & Transmission segment from the date of acquisition.

•

All the shares of CE Franklin Ltd. (“CE Franklin”), a Canada-based distributor of pipe, valves, flanges, fittings, production equipment,
tubular products and other general oilfield supplies to oil and gas producers in Canada as well as to the oil sands, refining, heavy oil, petrochemical, forestry and mining industries, acquired on July 19, 2012. The Company reported the CE
Franklin results within its Distribution & Transmission segment from the date of acquisition.

The following table displays the total purchase price allocation for the 2012 acquisitions and summarizes the fair values of the assets acquired and
liabilities assumed at the date of acquisition (in millions):

The Company allocated $981 million to intangible assets (18 year weighted-average life). The intangible assets are
amortizable and are comprised of: $473 million of customer relationships (20 year weighted-average life), $159 million of trademarks (16 year weighted-average life), and $348 million of other intangible assets (17 year weighted-average life).
Goodwill specifically includes the expected synergies and other benefits that the Company believes will result from combining its operations with those of businesses acquired and other intangible assets that do not qualify for separate recognition,
such as assembled workforce in place at the date of each acquisition. The $1,000 million allocated to goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired. Goodwill resulting from the NKT and CE
Franklin acquisitions and a portion of the Enerflow acquisition is not deductible for tax purposes. Pro forma information is not included because the results of the acquired operations would not have materially impacted the Company’s
consolidated operating results.




The Company completed nine acquisitions for an aggregate purchase price of $1,038 million, net of cash acquired. These acquisitions included:

•

The shares of Ameron International Corporation (“Ameron”), a U.S.-based manufacturer of highly engineered products and materials for the
chemical, industrial, energy, transportation and infrastructure markets.

•

The shares of Conner Steel Products Holding Company, a U.S.-based manufacturer of storage and handling equipment for the oilfield services industry.

The following table displays the total purchase price allocation for the 2011 acquisitions and summarizes the fair values
of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the date of acquisition (in millions):

The Company allocated $273 million to intangible assets (16 year weighted-average life), comprised of: $119 million of
customer relationships (14 year weighted-average life), $39 million of trademarks (35 year weighted-average life), and $115 million of other intangible assets (12 year weighted-average life).

Each of the acquisitions was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting and, accordingly, the results of operations of each business are
included in the consolidated results of operations from the date of acquisition. A summary of the acquisitions follows (in millions):



5. Inventories, net

Inventories consist of (in millions):

6. Property, Plant and Equipment

Property, plant and equipment consist of (in millions):

7. Accrued Liabilities

8. Costs and Estimated Earnings on Uncompleted Contracts

Costs and estimated earnings on uncompleted contracts consist of (in millions):



9. Debt

Debt consists of (in millions):

Principal payments of debt for years subsequent to 2013 are as follows (in millions):

The Company has a $3.5 billion, five-year unsecured revolving credit facility which expires September 28, 2018,
following a one year extension executed in September 2013. In August 2013, the Company initiated a commercial paper program. Borrowings under the commercial paper program are classified as long-term as the program is supported by the $3.5 billion,
five-year revolving credit facility. At December 31, 2013, there were no commercial paper borrowings however, there were $947 million in outstanding letters of credit issued under the credit facility, resulting in $2,553 million of funds
available under this revolving credit facility. Interest under this multicurrency facility is based upon LIBOR, NIBOR or EURIBOR plus 0.875% subject to a ratings-based grid, or the prime rate. The credit facility contains a financial covenant
regarding maximum debt to capitalization and the Company was in compliance at December 31, 2013.

The Company also had $3,056 million of
additional outstanding letters of credit at December 31, 2013, primarily in Norway, that are under various bilateral committed letter of credit facilities. Other letters of credit are issued as bid bonds, advanced payment bonds and performance
bonds.

The fair value of the Company’s Senior Notes are estimated using Level 2 inputs in the fair value hierarchy and is based on
quoted prices for those or similar instruments. At December 31, 2013 and 2012, the fair value of the Company’s unsecured Senior Notes approximated $2,896 million and $3,190 million, respectively. At December 31, 2013 and 2012,
the carrying value of the Company’s unsecured Senior Notes was $3,143 million and $3,142 million, respectively.



10. Employee Benefit Plans

We have benefit plans covering substantially all of our employees. Defined-contribution benefit plans cover most of the U.S. and
Canadian employees, and benefits are based on years of service, a percentage of current earnings and matching of employee contributions. Employees in our Norwegian operations can elect to participate in a defined-contribution plan in lieu of a local
defined benefit plan. For the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, expenses for defined-contribution plans were $96 million, $82 million, and $54 million, respectively, and all funding is current.

Certain retired or terminated employees of predecessor or acquired companies participate in a defined benefit plan in the United States. None of the
participants in this plan are eligible to accrue benefits. In addition, 1,353 U.S. retirees and spouses participate in defined benefit health care plans of predecessor or acquired companies that provide postretirement medical and life insurance
benefits. Active employees are ineligible to participate in any of these defined benefit plans. Our subsidiaries in the United Kingdom and Norway also have defined benefit pension plans covering virtually all of their employees.

As a result of the Robbins & Myers acquisition in February of 2013, the Company acquired four qualified, defined benefit, noncontributory
pension plans for certain U.S. employees, an unfunded defined benefit pension plan for eligible employees in Germany, as well as two defined benefit, one contributory, pension plans in the U.K. The U.S. pension plans are closed to all new
participants and there are no further benefit accruals under these plans. In addition, 230 U.S. employees covered by a collective bargaining agreement participate in a health care plan that provides postretirement medical benefits (which also covers
approximately 400 retirees and dependents). The arrangements in Germany and the U.K. are all closed to new entrants, but benefits continue to accrue for current participants.

As a result of the Ameron acquisition in October of 2011, the Company acquired a qualified, defined benefit, noncontributory pension plan for certain U.S. employees as well as the obligation to provide
defined retirement benefits to eligible employees in the Netherlands. The U.S. plan at December 31, 2011 was closed to new participants not covered by a collective bargaining agreement and ceased all benefit accruals under the plan with respect
to employees that are not covered by a collective bargaining agreement. In addition, 232 U.S. employees covered by a collective bargaining agreement participate in defined benefit health care plans that provide postretirement medical benefits.

Net periodic benefit cost for our defined benefit plans aggregated $10 million, $10 million and $14 million for the years ended
December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively.

The change in benefit obligation, plan assets and the funded status of the defined
benefit pension plans in the United States, United Kingdom, Norway, Germany and the Netherlands and defined postretirement plans in the United States, using a measurement date of December 31, 2013 and December 31, 2012, is as follows (in
millions):

Liabilities associated with the funded status of the defined benefit pension plans are included in the balances of
accrued liabilities and other liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheet.



Defined Benefit Pension Plans

Assumed long-term rates of return on plan assets, discount rates and rates of compensation increases vary for the different plans according to the local economic conditions. The assumption rates used for
benefit obligations are as follows:

The assumption rates used for net periodic benefit costs are as follows:

In determining the overall expected long-term rate of return for plan assets, the Company takes into consideration the
historical experience as well as future expectations of the asset mix involved. As different investments yield different returns, each asset category is reviewed individually and then weighted for significance in relation to the total portfolio.

The majority of our plans have projected benefit obligations in excess of plan assets.

The Company expects to pay future benefit amounts on its defined benefit plans of $47 million for each of the next five years and aggregate payments of
$479 million.



Plan Assets

The Company and its investment advisers collaboratively reviewed market opportunities using historic and statistical data, as well as the actuarial valuation reports for the plans, to ensure that the
levels of acceptable return and risk are well-defined and monitored. Currently, the Company’s management believes that there are no significant concentrations of risk associated with plan assets. Our pension investment strategy worldwide
prohibits a direct investment in our own stock.

The following table sets forth by level, within the fair value hierarchy, the Plan’s
assets carried at fair value (in millions):

Level 3 inputs are unobservable (i.e., supported by little or no market activity). Level 3 inputs include
management’s own assumption about the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability (including assumptions about risk).

The following table sets forth a summary of changes in the fair value of the Plan’s Level 3 assets (in millions):



11. Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)

The components of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) are as follows (in millions):

The components of amounts reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) are as follows (in millions):

The Company’s reporting currency is the U.S. dollar. A majority of the Company’s international entities in
which there is a substantial investment have the local currency as their functional currency. As a result, currency translation adjustments resulting from the process of translating the entities’ financial statements into the reporting currency
are reported in other comprehensive income or loss in accordance with ASC Topic 830 “Foreign Currency Matters” (“ASC Topic 830”). For the year ended December 31, 2013 a majority of these local currencies weakened against the
U.S. dollar resulting in a net other comprehensive loss of $90 million upon the translation from local currencies to the U.S. dollar. Due to the sale of a foreign subsidiary during the second quarter of 2013, $25 million of currency translation
gains were reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) into other income (expense), net in the Consolidated Statements of Income. For the year ended December 31, 2012 a majority of these local currencies strengthened against
the U.S. dollar resulting in a net other comprehensive income of $64 million upon the translation from local currencies to the U.S. dollar while for the year ended December 31, 201l a majority of these local currencies weakened against the U.S.
dollar resulting in a net other comprehensive loss of $65 million.

The effect of changes in the fair values of derivatives designated as cash
flow hedges are accumulated in other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax, until the underlying transactions to which they are designed to hedge are realized. The movement in other comprehensive income (loss) from period to period will be the
result of the combination of changes in fair value for open derivatives and the outflow of other comprehensive income (loss) related to cumulative changes in the fair value of derivatives that have settled in the current or prior periods. The
accumulated effect was other comprehensive loss of $37 million (net of tax of $18 million) for the year ended December 31, 2013, other comprehensive income of $99 million (net of tax of $39 million) for the year ended December 31, 2012 and
other comprehensive loss of $63 million (net of tax of $25 million) for the year ended December 31, 2011.



12. Commitments and Contingencies

We have received federal grand jury subpoenas and subsequent inquiries from governmental agencies requesting records related to our
compliance with export trade laws and regulations. We have cooperated fully with agents from the U.S. Department of Justice (“DOJ”), the Department of Commerce Bureau of Industry and Security (“BIS”), the United States Department
of Treasury, Office of Foreign Assets Control (“OFAC”), and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement in responding to the inquiries. We have also cooperated with an informal inquiry from the Securities and Exchange Commission in connection
with the inquiries previously made by the aforementioned federal agencies. We have conducted our own internal review of this matter. At the conclusion of our internal review in the fourth quarter of 2009, we identified possible areas of concern and
discussed these areas of concern with the relevant agencies. We are currently negotiating a potential resolution with the agencies involved related to these matters. We currently anticipate that any administrative fine or penalty agreed to as part
of a resolution would be within established accruals, and would not have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations. To the extent a resolution is not negotiated, we cannot predict the timing or effect that any resulting
government actions may have on our financial position or results of operations.

In 2011, the Company acquired Ameron International
Corporation (“Ameron”). On or about November 21, 2008, OFAC sent a Requirement to Furnish Information to Ameron. Ameron retained counsel and conducted an internal investigation. In 2009, Ameron, through its counsel, responded to OFAC.
On or about January 21, 2011, OFAC issued an administrative subpoena to Ameron. OFAC and Ameron entered into Tolling Agreements. All of the conduct under review occurred before acquisition of Ameron by the Company. During the third quarter of
2013, the Company settled such matter with OFAC by paying an administrative fine in an amount that was not material to the Company.

On
February 20, 2013, the Company acquired Robbins & Myers, Inc. (“R&M”). R&M was subject to an ongoing investigation by the DOJ and the BIS regarding potential export controls violations arising from certain shipments
by R&M’s Belgian subsidiary to one customer in Iran, Sudan and Syria in 2005 and 2006. R&M has cooperated with the investigation and is currently negotiating a joint settlement with the DOJ and BIS. We currently anticipate that any
administrative fine or criminal penalty agreed to as part of a resolution would be within established accruals, and would not have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations. To the extent a resolution is not negotiated, we
cannot predict the timing or effect that any resulting government actions may have on our financial position or results of operations.

A gain
of $102 million was recognized in the third quarter of 2013 related to a legal settlement. The gain was included in revenue of the Company’s Rig Technology segment.

In addition, we are involved in various other claims, regulatory agency audits and pending or threatened legal actions involving a variety of matters. As of December 31, 2013, the Company recorded an
immaterial amount for contingent liabilities representing all contingencies believed to be probable. The Company has also assessed the potential for additional losses above the amounts accrued as well as potential losses for matters that are not
probable but are reasonably possible. The total potential loss on these matters cannot be determined; however, in our opinion, any ultimate liability, to the extent not otherwise provided for and except for the specific cases referred to above, will
not materially affect our financial position, cash flow or results of operations. As it relates to the specific cases referred to above we currently anticipate that any administrative fine or penalty agreed to as part of a resolution would be within
established accruals, and would not have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations. To the extent a resolution is not negotiated as anticipated, we cannot predict the timing or effect that any resulting government actions
may have on our financial position, cash flow or results of operations. These estimated liabilities are based on the Company’s assessment of the nature of these matters, their progress toward resolution, the advice of legal counsel and outside
experts as well as management’s intention and experience.

Our business is affected both directly and indirectly by governmental laws and
regulations relating to the oilfield service industry in general, as well as by environmental and safety regulations that specifically apply to our business. Although we have not incurred material costs in connection with our compliance with such
laws, there can be no assurance that other developments, such as new environmental laws, regulations and enforcement policies hereunder may not result in additional, presently unquantifiable, costs or liabilities to us.



The Company leases certain facilities and equipment under operating leases that expire at various dates
through 2066. These leases generally contain renewal options and require the lessee to pay maintenance, insurance, taxes and other operating expenses in addition to the minimum annual rentals. Rental expense related to operating leases approximated
$406 million, $331 million, and $256 million in 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively.

Future minimum lease commitments under
noncancellable operating leases with initial or remaining terms of one year or more at December 31, 2013, are payable as follows (in millions):

13. Common Stock

National Oilwell Varco has authorized 1 billion shares of $.01 par value common stock. The Company also has authorized
10 million shares of $.01 par value preferred stock, none of which is issued or outstanding.

Cash dividends aggregated $389 million and
$209 million for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. The declaration and payment of future dividends is at the discretion of the Company’s Board of Directors and will be dependent upon the Company’s results of
operations, financial condition, capital requirements and other factors deemed relevant by the Company’s Board of Directors.

Stock
Options

Under the terms of National Oilwell Varco’s Long-Term Incentive Plan, as amended during the second quarter of 2013,
39.5 million shares of common stock are authorized for the grant of options to officers, key employees, non-employee directors and other persons. Options granted under our stock option plan generally vest over a three-year period starting one
year from the date of grant and expire ten years from the date of grant. The purchase price of options granted may not be less than the closing market price of National Oilwell Varco common stock on the date of grant. At December 31, 2013,
approximately 14.5 million shares were available for future grants.

We also have inactive stock option plans that were acquired in
connection with the acquisitions of Varco International, Inc. in 2005 and Grant Prideco in 2008. We converted the outstanding stock options under these plans to options to acquire our common stock and no further options are being issued under these
plans. Stock option information summarized below includes amounts for the National Oilwell Varco Long-Term Incentive Plan and stock plans of acquired companies. Options outstanding at December 31, 2013 under the stock option plans have exercise
prices between $9.14 and $84.58 per share, and expire at various dates from January 28, 2014 to February 10, 2023.

The following
summarizes options activity:



The following summarizes information about stock options outstanding at December 31, 2013:

The weighted-average fair value of options granted during 2013, 2012 and 2011, was approximately $24.11, $30.01 and
$29.52 per share, respectively, as determined using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The total intrinsic value of options exercised during 2013 and 2012, was $64 million and $120 million, respectively.

The determination of fair value of share-based payment awards on the date of grant using an option-pricing model is affected by our stock price as well
as assumptions regarding a number of highly complex and subjective variables. These variables include, but are not limited to, the expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards, and actual and projected employee stock option exercise
activity. The use of the Black Scholes model requires the use of extensive actual employee exercise activity data and the use of a number of complex assumptions including expected volatility, risk-free interest rate, expected dividends and expected
term.

The Company used the actual volatility for traded options for the past 10 years prior to option date as the expected
volatility assumption required in the Black Scholes model.

The risk-free interest rate assumption is based upon observed interest rates
appropriate for the term of our employee stock options. The dividend yield assumption is based on the history and expectation of dividend payouts. The estimated expected term is based on actual employee exercise activity for the past ten years.

As stock-based compensation expense recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Income in 2013 is based on awards ultimately expected to
vest, it has been reduced for estimated forfeitures. ASC Topic 718 requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. Forfeitures were
estimated based on historical experience.

The following summary presents information regarding outstanding options at December 31, 2013
and changes during 2013 with regard to options under all stock option plans:



At December 31, 2013, total unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested stock options was $74
million. This cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of two years. The total fair value of stock options vested in 2013, 2012 and 2011 was approximately $64 million, $55 million and $54 million, respectively. Cash
received from option exercises for 2013, 2012 and 2011 was $58 million, $113 million and $96 million, respectively. The actual tax benefit realized for the tax deductions from option exercises totaled $39 million, $42 million and
$43 million for 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. Cash used to settle equity instruments granted under all share-based payment arrangements for 2013, 2012 and 2011 was not material for any period.

Restricted Shares

The Company issues
restricted stock awards and restricted stock units to officers and key employees in addition to stock options. During the year ended December 31, 2013, the Company granted 540,194 shares of restricted stock and restricted stock units with a
fair value of $69.33 per share and 16,702 shares of restricted stock with a fair value of $69.17 per share. In addition, the Company granted performance share awards to senior management employees with potential payouts varying from zero to 368,860
shares. The restricted stock and restricted stock units were granted February 15, 2013 and vest on the third anniversary of the date of grant, except for a special grant of 16,352 restricted stock units which vest on the second anniversary of
the date of grant (subject to the satisfaction of a performance condition). On May 22, 2013, the 16,702 restricted stock awards, with a fair value of $69.17 per share, were granted to the non-employee members of the board of directors. These
restricted stock awards vest in equal thirds over three years on the anniversary of the grant date. The performance share awards were granted on March 22, 2013 and can be earned based on performance against established goals over a three-year
performance period. The performance share awards are divided into two equal, independent parts that are subject to two separate performance metrics: 50% with a TSR (total shareholder return) goal (the “TSR Award”) and 50% with an internal
ROC (return on capital) goal (the “ROC Award”). During the first quarter of 2013, the Company concluded that the performance conditions relating to the performance-based restricted stock awards granted on February 16, 2010 were not
met. As a result, the Company reversed $8 million in previously recognized stock-based compensation expense related to performance-based restricted stock awards that did not vest.

The following summary presents information regarding outstanding restricted shares:

The weighted-average grant day fair value of restricted stock awards and restricted stock units granted during the years
ended 2013, 2012 and 2011 was $69.07, $83.79 and $79.53 per share, respectively. There were 340,218; 406,844 and 496,642 restricted stock awards that vested during 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. At December 31, 2013, there was approximately
$54 million of unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested restricted stock awards and restricted stock units, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of two years.



14. Income Taxes

The domestic and foreign components of income before income taxes were as follows (in millions):

The components of the provision for income taxes consisted of (in millions):

The difference between the effective tax rate reflected in the provision for income taxes and the U.S. federal statutory
rate was as follows (in millions):



Significant components of our deferred tax assets and liabilities were as follows (in millions):

The balance of unrecognized tax benefits at December 31, 2013 and 2012 was $127 million and $128 million,
respectively. Included in the change in the balance of unrecognized tax benefits for the period ended December 31, 2013 is a $1 million reduction in the balance of unrecognized tax benefits resulted from the lapse of applicable statutes of
limitations in foreign jurisdictions. Of the net decrease of $1 million in the balance of unrecognized tax benefits, the entire $1 million was recorded as a decrease of income tax expense in the current year and is reflected in the “other”
category in the income tax rate schedule above. These unrecognized tax benefits are included in the balance of other liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2013. If the $127 million of unrecognized tax benefits accrued at
December 31, 2013 are ultimately realized, $54 million would be recorded as a reduction of income tax expense.

A reconciliation of the
beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows (in millions):

The Company does not anticipate that the total unrecognized tax benefits will significantly change due to the settlement
of audits or the expiration of statutes of limitation within 12 months of this reporting date.



To the extent penalties and interest would be assessed on any underpayment of income tax, such accrued
amounts have been classified as a component of income tax expense in the financial statements consistent with the Company’s policy. During the year ended December 31, 2013, the Company recorded as an increase of income tax expense a $0.4
million net increase of accrued interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions. At December 31, 2013, the Company has accrued approximately $8 million of interest and penalties relating to unrecognized tax benefits. These interest
and penalties are included in the balance of other liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2013.

The Company is
subject to taxation in the United States, various states and foreign jurisdictions. The Company has significant operations in the United States, Norway, Canada, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, France and Denmark. Tax years that remain subject
to examination by major tax jurisdictions vary by legal entity, but are generally open in the U.S. for the tax years ending after 2007 and outside the U.S. for the tax years ending after 2006.

In the United States, the Company has $20 million of net operating loss carryforwards as of December 31, 2013, of which $4 million will expire in
2025, $13 million will expire in 2026, $1 million will expire in 2027, $1 million will expire in 2029 and $1 million will expire in 2030. The potential benefit of $7 million has been reduced by a $7 million valuation allowance. Future income
tax payments will be reduced in the event the Company ultimately realizes the benefit of these net operating losses. If the Company ultimately realizes the benefit of these net operating loss carryforwards, the valuation allowance of $7 million
would reduce future income tax expense.

Outside the United States, the Company has $170 million of net operating loss carryforwards as of
December 31, 2013, of which $1 million will expire in 2014, $9 million will expire in 2015, $7 million will expire in 2016, $4 million will expire in 2017, $14 million will expire in 2018, $12 million will expire in 2020, $21 million
will expire in 2021, $20 million will expire in 2022, $1 million will expire in 2023 and $81 million will carry forward indefinitely. The potential benefit of $44 million has been reduced by a $22 million valuation allowance. Future income tax
payments will be reduced in the event the Company ultimately realizes the benefit of these net operating losses. If the Company ultimately realizes the benefit of these net operating loss carryforwards, the valuation allowance of $22 million would
reduce future income tax expense.

Also in the United States, the Company has $300 million of excess foreign tax credits as of
December 31, 2013, of which $73 million will expire in 2018, $71 million will expire in 2020, $142 million will expire in 2022, and $14 million will expire in 2023. These credits have been allotted a valuation allowance of $101 million and
would be realized as a reduction of future income tax payments. In addition, there is a reserve for uncertain tax positions of $73 million against a portion of these credits.

During 2013, the Company recorded $371 million in net deferred tax liabilities with a corresponding increase in goodwill related to the 2013 acquisition of Robbins & Myers Inc.

Undistributed earnings of certain of the Company’s foreign subsidiaries amounted to $6,045 million and $4,620 million at December 31, 2013
and 2012, respectively. Those earnings are considered to be permanently reinvested and no provision for U.S. federal and state income taxes has been made. Distribution of these earnings in the form of dividends or otherwise could result in U.S.
federal taxes (subject to an adjustment for foreign tax credits) and withholding taxes payable in various foreign countries. Determination of the amount of unrecognized deferred U.S. income tax liability is not practical; however, unrecognized
foreign tax credit carryforwards would be available to reduce some portion of the U.S. liability.

Because of the number of tax jurisdictions
in which the Company operates, its effective tax rate can fluctuate as operations and the local country tax rates fluctuate. The Company is also subject to audits by federal, state and foreign jurisdictions which may result in proposed assessments.
The Company’s future tax provision will reflect any favorable or unfavorable adjustments to its estimated tax liabilities when resolved. The Company is unable to predict the outcome of these matters. However, the Company believes that none of
these matters will have a material adverse effect on the results of operations or financial condition of the Company.



15. Business Segments and Geographic Areas

The Company’s operations consist of three reportable segments: Rig Technology, Petroleum Services & Supplies and
Distribution & Transmission. Within the three reporting segments, the Company has aggregated two business units under Rig Technology, nine business units under Petroleum Services & Supplies and two under Distribution &
Transmission for a total of 13 business units, one of which was added during 2011 as a result of the Company’s acquisition of Ameron. Prior to the Company’s acquisition of Ameron in October 2011, the Company’s Distribution &
Transmission segment was called Distribution Services with one business unit. Distribution Services was expanded as a result of certain business operations of the Ameron acquisition adding an additional business unit to the segment called
Transmission and changing the name of the segment to Distribution & Transmission. The Company has aggregated each of its business units in one of the three reporting segments based on the guidelines of ASC Topic 280, “Segment
Reporting” (“ASC Topic 280”).

Rig Technology:

The Rig Technology segment designs, manufactures, sells and services
complete systems for the drilling, completion, and servicing of oil and gas wells. The segment offers a comprehensive line of highly-engineered equipment that automates complex well construction and management operations, such as offshore and
onshore drilling rigs; derricks; pipe lifting, racking, rotating and assembly systems; rig instrumentation systems; coiled tubing equipment and pressure pumping units; well workover rigs; wireline winches; wireline trucks; cranes; flexible pipe for
offshore production applications; and turret mooring systems and other products for floating production, storage and offloading vessels and other offshore vessels and terminals.

Petroleum Services & Supplies:

The Petroleum Services & Supplies segment provides a variety of consumable goods and services used to drill, complete, remediate and workover oil
and gas wells and service drill pipe, tubing, casing, flowlines and other oilfield tubular goods. The segment manufactures, rents and sells a variety of products and equipment used to perform drilling operations, including drill pipe, wired drill
pipe, transfer pumps, solids control systems, drilling motors, drilling fluids, drill bits, reamers and other downhole tools, and mud pump consumables. Oilfield tubular services include the provision of inspection and internal coating services and
equipment for drill pipe, line pipe, tubing, casing and pipelines; and the design, manufacture and sale of coiled tubing pipe and advanced fiberglass composite pipe for application in highly corrosive environments.

17. Proposed Spin-off

On September 24, 2013, the Company announced that its Board of Directors authorized Company management to move forward with
exploration of a plan to spin-off the Company’s distribution business from the remainder of the Company, creating two stand-alone, publicly traded corporations. The Company believes that the separation of the distribution business can be
accomplished via a tax-efficient spin-off to Company shareholders.

The spin-off is expected to be completed in the first half of 2014 and is
subject to market conditions, customary regulatory approvals, the execution of separation and intercompany agreements and final board approval. The separation of the distribution business from the rest of the Company does not require shareholder
approval.
