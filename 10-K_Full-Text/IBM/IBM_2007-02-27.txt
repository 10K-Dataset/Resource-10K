PART I

Item 1. Business:

International Business Machines Corporation (IBM or the company) was incorporated in the State of New York on June 16, 1911, as the
Computing-Tabulating-Recording Co. (C-T-R), a consolidation of the Computing Scale Co. of America, the Tabulating Machine Co. and The International Time Recording Co. of New
York. Since that time, IBM has focused on the intersection of business insight and technological invention, and its operations and aims have been international in nature. This was signaled over
80 years ago, in 1924, when C-T-R changed its name to International Business Machines Corporation. And it continues today: IBM is a globally integrated innovation
company, serving the needs of enterprises and institutions worldwide. To help clients achieve growth, effectiveness, efficiency and the realization of greater value through innovation, IBM draws upon
the world's leading systems, software and services capabilities.

Description of Business

IBM is a globally integrated innovation company, serving the needs of enterprises and institutions worldwide. The company seeks to be a partner in its clients'
success by enabling their own capacity to innovate, so that they may differentiate themselves for competitive advantage in a globalized economy. IBM views enterprise innovation not only in terms of
products and services, but across all dimensions of a business: its business processes, business model, management systems, culture and role in society. To help clients achieve growth, effectiveness,
efficiency and the realization of greater value through innovation, IBM draws upon the world's leading systems, software and services capabilities.

IBM's Strategy

The company has divested low growth commoditizing product lines and acquired higher value opportunities to leverage IBM's infrastructure.

In
IBM's view, the future of business is being shaped by the forces of global integration and innovation. They are foundational and intimately related to one another. A globally
integrated enterprise is a new institutional form that shapes its strategy, management and operations globally, based on economics, expertise and open business environments. It is optimized for
innovation in a worldwide economy and society that are increasingly integrated and specialized. IBM's strategic moves over the past several years—from divestitures and acquisitions, to
areas of focus for innovation, to the transformation of its core lines of business—have been shaped by this vision.


IBM's
strategic priorities to pursue this vision include:

•

Offering
enterprises in the global economy innovative, high-value solutions based on IBM's ability to integrate technology and business model innovation to deliver
measurable results for IBM and its clients;

•

Leading
in the delivery of business value by providing business and information technology consulting and implementation services; building, running and maintaining
cross-industry and industry-specific business process services; leveraging leadership technology and engineering services; and accelerating increased business value through Service Oriented
Architectures (SOA) and Information on Demand;

•

Leading
in the delivery of advanced infrastructure through enterprise SOA and infrastructure software and services; increased share leadership in servers; driving to
leadership in storage; and leading the transition to standardized services offerings; and

•

Making
IBM the premier Globally Integrated Enterprise

—

lowering costs and increasing effectiveness by integrating
the company's decision-making at the point of client contact ("lowering IBM's center of gravity"); moving work to where it can best be performed; focusing IBM's resources to create the greatest value;
and excelling in business collaboration.

IBM's Capabilities

To execute its strategy, IBM's business comprises three principal business segments:

•

Systems
and Financing

•

Software

•

Services

Business Segments

Organizationally, the company's major operations comprise a Global Technology Services segment; a Global Business Services segment; a Systems and Technology Group
segment; a Software segment; and a Global Financing segment.

GLOBAL SERVICES

is a critical component of the company's strategy of providing insight and solutions to clients. While solutions often
include industry-leading IBM software and hardware, other suppliers' products are also used if a client solution requires it. Contracts for IBM services—commonly referred to as
"signings"—can range from less than one year to over ten years. Within Global Services there are two reportable segments: Global Technology Services and Global Business Services.

Global Technology Services (GTS)

segment primarily reflects infrastructure services, delivering value through the company's global scale,
standardization and automation. It includes outsourcing services, Integrated Technology Services and Maintenance.

Global Business Services (GBS)

segment primarily reflects professional services, delivering business value and innovation to clients
through solutions which leverage industry and business process expertise. It includes consulting, systems integration and Application Management Services.

SYSTEMS AND TECHNOLOGY GROUP

provides IBM's clients with business solutions requiring advanced computing power and storage capabilities.
Approximately 55 percent of the Systems and Technology Group's server and storage sales transactions are through business partners; approximately 45 percent are direct to
end-user clients, more than half of which are through the Web at ibm.com. In addition, the group provides leading semiconductor technology and products, packaging solutions and engineering
technology services to clients and for IBM's own advanced technology needs. While not reported as external revenue, hardware is also deployed to support services solutions.


SOFTWARE

consists primarily of middleware and operating systems software. Middleware software enables clients to integrate systems,
processes and applications across a standard software platform. IBM Middleware is designed to open standards which allows the efficient integration of disparate client applications that may have been
built internally, or provided by package software vendors or system integrators. Operating systems are the software engines that run computers. In addition, Software includes Product Lifecycle
Management software which primarily serves the Industrial sector. Approximately 25 percent of software transactions are sold through business partners. Also, 50 percent of external
Software revenue relates to one-time charge (OTC) arrangements, whereby the client pays one up-front payment for a perpetual license. The remaining annuity-based revenue
consists of both maintenance revenue sold with OTC arrangements, as well as revenue from software sold on a recurring license charge arrangement. Typically, arrangements for the sale of OTC software
include one year of maintenance. The client can also purchase ongoing maintenance after the first year, which includes product upgrades and technical support. While not reported as external revenue,
software is also deployed to support services solutions.

GLOBAL FINANCING

is described on pages 49 through 53 in IBM's 2006 Annual Report to Stockholders.

IBM Worldwide Organizations

The following three company-wide organizations play key roles in IBM's delivery of value to its clients:

•

Sales &
Distribution Organization and related sales channels

•

Research,
Development and Intellectual Property

•

Integrated
Supply Chain

SALES & DISTRIBUTION ORGANIZATION

With a comprehensive knowledge of IBM's business and infrastructure solutions, as well as the products, technologies and services IBM and its business partners
offer, the company's global client teams gain a deep understanding of each client's organizational, infrastructure and industry-specific needs to determine the best approach for addressing their
critical business and IT challenges. These professionals work in integrated teams with IBM consultants and technology representatives, combining their deep skills and expertise to deliver
high-value solutions that address clients' pain points and innovational aspirations.

To
facilitate its access to clients and local markets and to improve productivity, the Sales and Distribution organization utilizes geographic organizations in the Americas,
Europe/Middle East/Africa (EMEA) and Asia Pacific geographies. This structure enables resources and decision making to be closer to the clients.

The
majority of IBM's revenue, excluding the company's original equipment manufacturer (OEM) technology business, occurs in industries that are broadly grouped into six sectors:

•

Financial
Services: Banking, Financial Markets, Insurance

•

Public:
Education, Government, Healthcare, Life Sciences

•

Industrial:
Aerospace and Defense, Automotive, Chemical and Petroleum, Electronics

•

Distribution:
Consumer Products, Retail, Travel and Transportation

•

Communications:
Telecommunications, Media and Entertainment, Energy and Utilities

•

Small
and Medium Business: Mainly companies with less than 1,000 employees


Internal Routes-to-Market

Services consultants

focused on selling end-to-end solutions for large, complex business
challenges.

Hardware and software brand specialists

selling IBM products as parts of discrete technology decisions and as part of broader client
solutions.

ibm.com

provides fast, easy access to IBM's product and business expertise via the Web and telephone. In addition, ibm.com identifies
business opportunities for all of IBM's routes to market and provides online and telephone sales of standard hardware, software, services and financing for all size companies.

Business Partners Routes-to-Market

Global/major independent software vendors (ISVs).

ISVs deliver business process or industry-specific applications
and, in doing so, often influence the sale of IBM hardware, middleware and services.

Global/major systems integrators (SIs).

SIs identify business problems and design solutions when IBM Global Services is not the preferred
systems integrator; they also sell computing infrastructures from IBM and its competitors.

Regional ISVs and SIs.

SIs identify the business problems, and ISVs deliver business process or industry-specific applications to
medium-sized and large businesses requiring IBM computing infrastructure offerings.

Solutions providers, resellers and distributors.

Resellers sell IBM platforms and value-added services as part of a discrete technology
platform decision to clients wanting third-party assistance.

RESEARCH, DEVELOPMENT AND INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY

IBM's research and development (R&D) operations differentiate IBM from its competitors. IBM annually spends approximately $6 billion for R&D, focusing its
investments in high-growth, high-value opportunities. In 2006, the company's investment in R&D was approximately 15 percent of its combined hardware and software
revenue. As a result of innovations in these and other areas, IBM was once again awarded more U.S. patents in 2006 than any other company. This marks the 14th year in a row that IBM achieved this
distinction.

In
addition to producing world-class hardware and software products, IBM innovations are a major differentiator in providing solutions for the company's clients through its growing
services activities. The company's investments in R&D also result in intellectual property (IP) income of approximately $1 billion annually. Some of IBM's technological breakthroughs are used
exclusively in IBM products, while others are licensed and may be used in either/both IBM products and/or the products of the licensee.

In
addition to these IP income sources, the company also generates value from its patent portfolio through cross-licensing arrangements and IP licensed in divestiture transactions. The
value of these transactions is not readily apparent in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings, because income on cross-licensing arrangements is recorded only to the extent that cash is received. The
value received for IP involving the sale of a business is included in the overall gain or loss from the divestiture, not in the separately presented IP income amounts on the Consolidated Statement of
Earnings.

INTEGRATED SUPPLY CHAIN

Just as IBM works to transform its clients' supply chains for greater efficiency and responsiveness to global market conditions, the company continues to derive
business value from its own globally integrated supply chain, reinvented as a strategic advantage for the company to create value for clients and shareholders. IBM leverages its supply chain expertise
for clients through its supply-chain business


transformation
outsourcing service to optimize and help run clients' end-to-end supply chain processes, from procurement to logistics.

IBM
spends approximately $36 billion annually through its supply chain, procuring materials and services around the world. The company's supply, manufacturing and logistics and
customer fulfillment operations are integrated in one operating unit that has reduced inventories, improved response to marketplace opportunities and external risks and converted fixed to variable
costs. Simplifying and streamlining internal processes has improved operations and sales force productivity and processes and these actions have improved client satisfaction when working with the
company. Since some of the cost savings this unit generates are passed along to clients, they will not always result in a visible gross margin improvement in the company's Consolidated Statement of
Earnings. IBM is continuing to apply the supply-chain principles of product manufacturing and delivery to service delivery across its solutions and services lines of business.

In
addition to its own manufacturing operations, the company uses a number of contract manufacturing (CM) companies around the world to manufacture IBM-designed products. The
use of CM companies is intended to generate cost efficiencies and reduce time-to-market for certain IBM products.

Key Business Drivers

The following are some of the key drivers of the company's business.

ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT AND CORPORATE SPENDING BUDGETS

If overall demand for systems, software and services changes, whether due to general economic conditions or a shift in corporate buying patterns, sales
performance could be impacted. IBM's diverse set of products and offerings is designed to provide more consistent results in both strong and weak economic environments. The company accomplishes this
by not only having a mix of offerings with long-term cash and income streams, as well as cyclical transaction-based sales, but also by continually developing competitive products and solutions and
effectively managing a skilled resource base. IBM continues to transform itself to take advantage of shifting demand trends, focusing on client- or industry-specific solutions, business performance
and open standards.

INTERNAL BUSINESS TRANSFORMATION AND GLOBAL INTEGRATION INITIATIVES

IBM continues to drive greater productivity, flexibility and cost savings by transforming and globally integrating its own business processes and functions. In
2006, the company continued the global integration of its internal support functions—such as Legal, Finance, Human Resources, Information Technology and Real Estate Site
Operations—which had been previously replicated for many of the individual countries where IBM operates. In addition to eliminating redundancies and overhead structures to drive
productivity, this integration has improved IBM's capacity to innovate by providing greater clarity of key priorities around shared goals and objectives and led to a sharper focus for the company on
learning, development and knowledge sharing. The company will continue to focus on global integration initiatives to improve productivity in its integrated supply chain, service delivery and internal
support functions.

INNOVATION INITIATIVES

IBM invests to improve its ability to help its clients innovate. Investment may occur in the research and development of new products and services, as well as in
the establishment of new collaborative and co-creation relationships with developers, other companies and other institutions. Examples include IBM's leadership position in the design and
fabrication of game processors; the design of smaller, faster and energy-efficient semiconductor devices; and the design of "grid" computing networks that allow computers to share processing power.


Through
the Global Innovation Outlook (GIO), IBM has opened up its technical and business forecasting processes to include external leaders from business, academia, the public sector,
nongovernmental organizations and other influential constituents of the world community. The GIO takes a deep look at some of the most pressing issues facing the world and works toward providing
solutions to those needs. In 2006, IBM also announced that it will invest $100 million over the next two years to pursue ten new businesses generated by InnovationJam, an on-line
brainstorming session which brought together more than 150,000 people from 104 countries, including IBM employees, family members, universities, business partners and clients from 67 companies. Over
two 72-hour sessions, participants posted more than 46,000 ideas as they explored IBM's most advanced research technologies and considered their application to real-world
problems and emerging business opportunities.

OPEN STANDARDS

The broad adoption of open standards is essential to the computing model for an on demand business and is a significant driver of collaborative innovation across
all industries. Without interoperability among all manner of computing platforms, the integration of any client's internal systems, applications and processes remains a monumental and expensive task.
The broad-based acceptance of open standards—rather than closed, proprietary architectures—also allows the computing infrastructure to more easily absorb (and thus benefit
from) new technical innovations. IBM's support of open standards is evidenced by the enabling of its products to support open standards such as Linux, and the development of Rational software
development tools, which can be used to develop and upgrade other companies' software products.

INVESTING IN GROWTH OPPORTUNITIES

The company is continuing to refocus its business on the higher value segments of enterprise computing—providing technology and transformation
services to clients' businesses. Consistent with that focus, the company continues to significantly invest in growth opportunities as a way to drive revenue growth and market share gains. Areas of
investment include strategic acquisitions, primarily in software and services, focused client- and industry-specific solutions, maintaining technology leadership and emerging growth countries such as
China, Russia, India and Brazil.

Forward-looking and Cautionary Statements

Certain statements contained in this Form 10-K may constitute "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform
Act of 1995 ("Reform Act"). The company may also make forward-looking statements in other reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, in materials delivered to stockholders and in press
releases. In addition, the company's
representatives may from time to time make oral forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements provide current expectations of future events based on certain assumptions and include any
statement that does not directly relate to any historical or current fact. Words such as "anticipates," "believes," "expects," "estimates," "intends," "plans," "projects," and similar expressions, may
identify such forward-looking statements. The company assumes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements. In accordance with the Reform Act, set forth under Item 1A. "Risk
Factors" on pages 10 to 14 are cautionary statements that accompany those forward-looking statements. Readers should carefully review such cautionary statements as they identify certain
important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements and from historical trends. Those cautionary statements are not exclusive and are in
addition to other factors discussed elsewhere in this Form 10-K, in the company's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission or in materials incorporated therein by reference.

Item 1A. Risk Factors:

Economic Environment and Corporate IT Spending Budgets:

If overall demand for systems, software and services changes, whether
due to general economic conditions or a shift in corporate buying patterns, sales performance could be impacted. IBM's diverse set of products and offerings is designed to provide more consistent
results in both strong and weak economic environments. The company accomplishes this by not only having a mix of offerings with long-term cash and income streams, as well as cyclical
transaction-based sales, but also by continually developing competitive products and solutions and effectively managing a skilled resource base. IBM continues to transform itself to take advantage of
shifting demand trends, focusing on client or industry-specific solutions, business performance and open standards.

Internal Business Transformation and Global Integration Initiatives:

IBM continues to drive greater productivity, flexibility
and cost savings by transforming and globally integrating its own business processes and functions. In addition to eliminating redundancies and overhead structures to drive productivity, this
integration has improved IBM's capacity to innovate by providing greater clarity of key priorities around shared goals and objectives and leads to a sharper focus for the company on learning,
development and knowledge sharing. As IBM continues to drive higher levels of automation and integration into its business, IBM's dependency on internal IT systems also increases.

Innovation Initiatives:

IBM invests to improve its ability to help its clients innovate. Investment may occur in the research
and development of new products and services, as well as in the establishment of new collaborative and co-creation relationships with developers, other companies and other institutions. To
deliver value that helps clients differentiate themselves for competitive advantage, IBM has been moving away from commoditized categories of the IT industry and into areas in which it can
differentiate itself through innovation and by leveraging its investments in R&D. In the highly competitive IT industry, with large diversified competitors as well as smaller and nimble single
technology competitors, IBM's ability to continue its cutting-edge innovation is critical to maintaining and increasing market share. IBM is managing this risk by more closely linking its
R&D organization to industry-specific and client-specific needs.

Open Standards:

The broad adoption of open standards is essential to the computing model for on demand business and is a
significant driver of collaborative innovation across all industries. Without interoperability among all manner of computing platforms, the integration of any client's internal systems, applications
and processes remains a monumental and expensive task. The broad-based acceptance of open standards—rather than closed, proprietary architectures—also allows the computing
infrastructure to more easily absorb (and thus benefit from) new technical innovations. IBM is committed to fostering open standards because they are vital to the On Demand Operating Environment, and
because their acceptance will expand growth opportunities across the entire business services and IT industry. There are a number of competitors in
the IT industry with significant resources and investments who are committed to closed and proprietary platforms as a way to lock customers into a particular architecture. This competition will result
in increased pricing pressure and/or IP claims and proceedings.

Investing in Growth Opportunities:

The company is continuing to refocus its business on the higher value segments of
enterprise computing—providing technology and transformation services to clients' businesses. Consistent with that focus, the company continues to significantly invest in growth
opportunities, as a way to drive revenue growth and market share gains. IBM continues to invest in emerging growth countries such as China, Russia, India and Brazil. The developing nature of these
countries presents political, social and economic risks to IBM's business, including the potential for inadequate infrastructure and labor disruptions.

Protection of Intellectual Property:

While the company's various proprietary intellectual property rights are important to
its success, IBM believes its business as a whole is not materially dependent on


any
particular patent or license, or any particular group of patents or licenses. IBM owns or is licensed under a number of patents, which vary in duration, relating to its products. Licenses under
patents owned by IBM have been and are being granted to others under reasonable terms and conditions. These protections may not prevent competitors from independently developing products and services
similar to or duplicative to the company's nor can there be any assurance that these protections will adequately deter misappropriation or improper use of the company's technology. Also, there can be
no assurances that IBM will be able to obtain from third parties the licenses it needs in the future.

Seasonality of Revenues and Purchases:

IBM's revenues are affected by such factors as the introduction of new products and
services, the length of the sales cycles and the seasonality of technology purchases. As a result, the company's results are difficult to predict. These factors historically have resulted in lower
revenue in the first quarter than in the immediately preceding fourth quarter. In addition, the high volume of products ordered at the end of each quarter, especially at the end of the fourth quarter,
may affect IBM's ability to successfully ship all orders before the end of the quarter.

Local Legal, Economic and Health Conditions:

The company operates in more than 160 countries worldwide and derived more than
half of its revenues from sales outside the United States. Changes in the laws or policies of the countries in which the company operates could affect the company's business in that country and the
company's results of operations. The company's results of operations also could be affected by economic and political changes in those countries and by macroeconomic changes, including recessions and
inflation. In addition, any widespread outbreak of an illness or other health issue, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), avian influenza (bird flu) or any other pandemic, or local or
global health issues, could adversely affect the company's operations, its ability to source and deliver products and services to its customers and customer demand.

Insurance:

The company maintains third party insurance coverage against various liability risks and risks of property loss.
While we believe these arrangements are an effective way to insure against liability and property damage risks, the potential liabilities associated with those risks or other events could exceed the
coverage provided by such arrangements.

Environmental Matters:

The company is subject to various federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations concerning
the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise related to environmental protection, including the U.S. Superfund law. The company could incur substantial costs, including cleanup costs,
fines and civil or criminal sanctions, as well as third-party claims for property damage or personal injury, if it were to violate or become liable under environmental laws and regulations. Compliance
with environmental laws and regulations is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the company's capital expenditures, results of operations and competitive position.

Tax Matters:

The company is subject to income taxes in both the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. IBM's
provision for income taxes and cash tax liability in the future could be adversely affected by numerous factors including, but not limited to, income before taxes being lower than anticipated in
countries with lower statutory tax rates and higher than anticipated in countries with higher statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, and changes in tax
laws, regulations, accounting principles or interpretations thereof, which could adversely impact the company's results of operations and financial condition in future periods. In addition, IBM is
subject to the continuous examination of its income tax returns by the Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities. The company regularly assesses the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting
from these examinations to determine the adequacy of its provision for income taxes. There can be no assurance that the outcomes from these continuous examinations will not have an adverse effect on
the company's provision for income taxes and cash tax liability.


Internal Controls:

Effective internal controls are necessary for the company to provide reasonable assurance with respect to
its financial reports and to effectively prevent fraud. If the company cannot provide reasonable assurance with respect to its financial reports and effectively prevent fraud, the company's operating
results could be affected. Pursuant to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, the company is required to furnish a report by management on internal control over financial reporting, including management's
assessment of the effectiveness of such control. Internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements because of its inherent limitations, including the possibility of
human error, the circumvention or overriding of controls, or fraud. Therefore, even effective internal controls can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to the preparation and fair
presentation of financial statements. In addition, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the
control may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. If the company fails to maintain the adequacy of its
internal controls, including any failure to implement required new or improved controls, or if the company experiences difficulties in their implementation, the company's business and operating
results could be harmed, the company could fail to meet its financial reporting obligations, and there could be a material adverse effect on the company's stock price.

Use of Estimates:

In connection with the application of GAAP and the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements,
the company uses certain estimates and assumptions, which are based on historical experience and management's knowledge of current events and actions that the company may undertake in the future. The
company's most critical accounting estimates are described in the Management Discussion on pages 45 to 47 of IBM's 2006 Annual Report to Stockholders. In addition, as discussed in note O,
"Contingencies and Commitments" on pages 89 to 92 of IBM's 2006 Annual Report to Stockholders, the company makes certain estimates under the provisions of SFAS No. 5 "Accounting for
Contingencies", including decisions related to legal proceedings and reserves. While management believes that these estimates and assumptions are reasonable under the circumstances, by definition they
involve the use of judgment and the exercise of discretion, and therefore, actual results may differ.

Competitive Conditions:

The company operates in businesses that are subject to intense competitive pressures. The company's
businesses face a significant number of competitors, ranging from Fortune 50 companies to an increasing number of relatively small, rapidly growing and highly specialized organizations. The company
believes that its combination of technology, performance, quality, reliability, price and the breadth of products and service offerings are important competitive factors. Intense competitive pressures
could affect prices or demand for the company's products and services, resulting in reduced profit margins and/or loss of market opportunity. Unlike many of its competitors, the company has a broad
set of capabilities and businesses and must allocate resources across these businesses while competing with companies that specialize in one or more of these product lines. As a result, the company
may not fund or invest in certain of its businesses to the same degree that its competitors do, and these competitors may have greater financial, technical and marketing resources available to them
than the businesses against which they compete.

Volatility of Stock Price:

The company's stock price is affected by a number of factors, including quarterly variations in
financial results, the competitive landscape, general economic and market conditions and estimates and projections by the investment community. As a result, like other technology companies, the
company's stock price is subject to significant volatility.

Dependence on and Compensation of Key Personnel:

Much of the future success of the company depends on the continued service,
availability and integrity of skilled personnel, including technical, marketing and staff resources. Experienced personnel in the information technology industry are in high demand and competition for
their talents is intense. There can be no assurance that IBM will be


able
to successfully retain and attract the key personnel it needs. In addition, companies in the information technology and services industry whose employees accept positions with IBM may claim that
IBM has interfered with noncompete obligations of their former employees, engaged in unfair hiring practices or that the employment of these persons by IBM would involve the disclosure or use of trade
secrets. Any such claims could limit or prevent IBM from hiring employees or cause it to incur liability for damages or substantial costs in defending the company or its employees against these
claims, whether or not they have merit. Further, many of IBM's key personnel receive a total compensation package that includes equity awards. New regulations, volatility in the stock market and other
factors could diminish the company's use, and the value, of the company's equity awards, putting the company at a competitive disadvantage or forcing the company to use more cash compensation.

Relationships with Critical Suppliers:

IBM's business employs a wide variety of components, supplies, services and raw
materials from a substantial number of suppliers around the world. Certain of the company's businesses rely on single or a limited number of suppliers, although the company makes every effort to
assure that alternative sources are available if the need arises. The failure of the company's suppliers to deliver components, supplies, services and raw materials in sufficient quantities and in a
timely manner could adversely affect the company's business.

Currency and Customer Financing Risks:

The company derives a significant percentage of its non-U.S. revenues from
its affiliates operating in local currency environments and those results are affected by changes in the relative values of non-U.S. currencies and the U.S. dollar. Further, inherent in
the company's customer financing business are risks related to the concentration of credit risk, the creditworthiness of the client, interest rate and currency fluctuations on the associated debt,
liabilities and the determination of residual values, and the financing of other than traditional IT assets. The company employs a number of strategies to manage these risks, including the use of
derivative financial instruments. Derivatives involve the risk of non-performance by the counterparty. In addition, there can be no assurance that the company's efforts to manage these
risks will be successful.

Customer Credit Risk on Trade Receivables:

The company's diversified client base includes a large number of worldwide
enterprises, from small and medium businesses to the world's largest organizations, companies and governments. Most of the company's sales are on an open credit basis and the company performs ongoing
credit evaluations of its clients' financial conditions. The company maintains reserves that it believes are adequate to cover exposure for any uncollectible trade receivables and regularly reviews
such reserves by considering factors such as write-off history, aging analysis and any specific, known troubled accounts. Customer credit risk is mitigated due to the large number of
clients constituting the company's worldwide client base and their dispersion across many different industries and geographies. If the company becomes aware of additional information related to the
credit worthiness of a major customer, or, if future actual default rates on trade receivables in general differ from those currently anticipated, the company may have to adjust its reserves, which
could affect the company's consolidated net income in the period the adjustments are made.

Distribution Channels:

The company offers its products directly and through a variety of third party distributors and
resellers. Changes in the financial or business condition of these distributors and resellers could subject the company to losses and affect its ability to bring its products to market.

Acquisitions and Alliances:

The company has made and expects to continue to make acquisitions or enter into alliances from
time to time. Acquisitions and alliances present significant challenges and risks relating to the integration of the business into the company, and there can be no assurances that the company will
manage acquisitions and alliances successfully. The related risks include the company failing to achieve strategic objectives and anticipated revenue improvements and cost savings, as well as the
failure to retain key personnel of the acquired business and the assumption of liabilities related to litigation or other legal proceedings involving the acquired business.


Risk Factors Related to IBM Securities:

The company issues debt securities in the worldwide capital markets from time to
time, with a variety of different maturities and in different currencies. The value of our debt securities fluctuates based on many factors, including changes in interest rates, the methods employed
for calculating principal and interest, the maturity of the securities, the aggregate principal amount of securities outstanding, the redemption features for the securities, the level, direction and
volatility of interest rates, changes in exchange rates, exchange controls, governmental and stock exchange regulations and other factors over which the company has little or no control. The company's
ability to pay interest and repay the principal for its debt securities is dependent upon its ability to manage its business operations, as well as the other risks described under Item 1A. entitled
"Risk Factors". There can be no assurance that the company will be able to manage any of these risks successfully.

The
company also issues its common stock from time to time in connection with various compensation plans, contributions to its pension plan and certain acquisitions. The market price of
IBM common stock is subject to significant volatility, due to factors described under Item 1A. entitled "Risk Factors", including the section entitled "Volatility of Stock Price", as well as economic
and geopolitical
conditions generally, trading volumes, speculation by the press or investment community about our financial condition, and other factors, many of which are beyond the company's control. Since the
market price of IBM's common stock fluctuates significantly, stockholders may not be able to sell our stock at attractive prices.

In
addition, changes by any rating agency to the company's outlook or credit ratings can negatively impact the value and liquidity of both our debt and equity securities. The company
does not make a market in either its debt or equity securities and cannot provide any assurances with respect to the liquidity or value of such securities.

Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments:

Not applicable.

Item 2. Properties:

At December 31, 2006, IBM's manufacturing and development facilities in the United States had aggregate floor space of 20 million square feet, of
which 16 million was owned and 4 million was leased. Of these amounts, 2 million square feet was vacant and 1 million square feet was being leased to
non-IBM businesses. Similar facilities in 8 other countries totaled 6 million square feet, of which 3 million was owned and 3 million was leased. Of
these amounts, 1 million square feet was being leased to non-IBM businesses.

Although
improved production techniques, productivity gains and infrastructure reduction actions have resulted in reduced manufacturing floor space, continuous maintenance and upgrading
of facilities is essential to maintain technological leadership, improve productivity and meet customer demand.

("DCEAP")—see "General Information—2006 Director Compensation Narrative" in IBM's definitive Proxy Statement to be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission and

57,918 shares of IBM common stock under the DCEAP through 2006, and 705,196 shares remain available for issuance thereunder.

The
material features of each equity compensation plan under which equity securities are authorized for issuance that was adopted without stockholder approval are described below:

2001 LONG-TERM PERFORMANCE PLAN

The 2001 Long-Term Performance Plan (the "2001 Plan") is used to fund awards for employees other than senior executives of the Company. Awards for
senior executives of the company will continue to be funded from the stockholder-approved 1999 Long-Term Performance Plan (the "1999 Plan"). Otherwise, the provisions of the 2001 Plan are
identical to the 1999 Plan, including the type of


awards
that may be granted under the plan (stock options, restricted stock and unit awards and long-term performance incentive awards).

The
2001 Plan is administered by the Executive Compensation and Management Resources Committee of the Board of Directors, and that committee may delegate to officers of the Company
certain of its duties, powers and authority. Payment of awards may be made in the form of cash, stock or combinations thereof and may be deferred with committee approval. Awards are not transferable
or assignable except (i) by law, will or the laws of descent and distribution, (ii) as a result of the disability of the recipient, or (iii) with the approval of the committee.

If
the employment of a participant terminates, other than as a result of the death or disability of a participant, all unexercised, deferred and unpaid Awards shall be canceled
immediately, unless the Award Agreement provides otherwise. In the event of the death of a participant or in the event a participant is deemed by the company to be disabled and eligible for benefits
under the terms of the IBM Long-Term Disability Plan (or any successor plan or similar plan of another employer), the participant's estate, beneficiaries or representative, as the case may
be, shall have the rights and duties of the participant under the applicable Award Agreement. In addition, unless the Award Agreement specifies otherwise, the committee may cancel, rescind, suspend,
withhold or otherwise limit or restrict any unexpired, unpaid, or deferred Awards at any time if the participant is not in compliance with all applicable provisions of the Award Agreement and the
Plan. In addition, Awards are cancelled if the participant engages in any conduct or act determined to be injurious, detrimental or prejudicial to any interest of the company.

PWCC ACQUISITION LONG-TERM PERFORMANCE PLAN

The IBM PWCC Acquisition Long-Term Performance Plan (the "PWCC Plan") was adopted by the Board of Directors in connection with the Company's
acquisition of PricewaterhouseCoopers Consulting ("PwCC") from PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, as announced on October 1, 2002. The PWCC Plan has been and will continue to be used solely to fund
awards for employees of PwCC who have come over to the company as a result of the acquisition. Awards for
senior executives of the company will not be funded from the PWCC Plan. The terms and conditions of the PWCC Plan are substantively identical to the terms and conditions of the 2001 Plan, described
above.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To
the Board of Directors of

International Business Machines Corporation:

We
have audited the statement of revenues and expenses of the Business Consulting Services Reporting Unit (the "Reporting Unit") (a reporting unit as defined in Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 142), of International Business Machines Corporation (the "Company") for the year ended December 31, 2004 (the "statement") (not separately presented herein).
The statement is the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the statement based on our audit.

We
conducted our audit in accordance with auditing standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit
to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the statement is free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the
statement. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the statement. We believe
that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

The
statement was prepared for the purpose of complying with the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (for use by the Company in connection with its various
filings with the Commission). Certain corporate expenses, that are not the responsibility of the Reporting Unit, and which have not been allocated, have been excluded from the statement. Accordingly,
the statement is not intended to be a complete presentation of the results of operations of the Reporting Unit.

In
our opinion, the statement referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the revenues and expenses of the Reporting Unit for the year ended December 31, 2004, in
conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
