PART I

Item 1. Business:

International Business Machines Corporation (IBM or the company) was incorporated in the State of New York on June 16, 1911, as the
Computing-Tabulating-Recording Co. (C-T-R), a consolidation of the Computing Scale Co. of America, the Tabulating Machine Co. and The International Time Recording Co. of New York. Since that time, IBM
has focused on the intersection of business insight and technological innovation, and its operations and aims have been international in nature. This was signaled over 90 years ago, in 1924, when
C-T-R changed its name to International Business Machines Corporation. And it continues today—the company creates value for clients through integrated solutions and products that leverage
data, information technology, deep expertise in industries and business processes, and a broad ecosystem of partners and alliances. IBM solutions typically create value by enabling new capabilities
for clients that transform their businesses and help them engage with their customers and employees in new ways. These solutions draw from an industry-leading portfolio of consulting and IT
implementation services, cloud and cognitive offerings, and enterprise systems and software; all bolstered by one of the world's leading research organizations.

Strategy

The IBM strategy starts with its clients.

As
a uniquely integrated technology and services company, IBM helps clients change the way the world works by building smarter businesses.

IBM's
clients include many of the world's most successful enterprises. These clients are at an inflection point, facing tremendous new opportunity and incredible competition. Digital
technologies are unlocking unparalleled insight from previously inaccessible data. Work processes are being reimagined for speed and vastly smarter decision-making.

To
win in these disruptive times requires that businesses learn—learn by extracting insights from their data and by applying those insights to how work is done. Smarter
businesses do this faster and more effectively supported by IBM's combination of

Innovative Technology

,

Industry Expertise

and

Trust
and Security

.

The
company's capabilities include:

Cloud

Cloud is enabling the emergence of platforms through standardization, agility and innovation in both IT and business processes. Enterprise cloud
is very different from consumer cloud: enterprises must bridge together mission-critical assets from on-premise systems with private cloud and public cloud. Hybrid cloud technology provides that
bridge. All three must coexist and interoperate as a single platform.

The
IBM Cloud is uniquely:

•

Built for all applications: Applications require data. That data is in on-premise systems, in private clouds and in the public cloud. The IBM
Cloud enables one data platform that, regardless of data's location, can run all applications. IBM's hybrid cloud capabilities make this single platform operate seamlessly.

•

Artificial intelligence (AI)-ready: The IBM Cloud is built from the ground up to handle the demanding data and computational requirements
of AI.

•

Secure to the Core: IBM has a long history of helping clients keep data and transactions secure. Security is even more important in an
increasingly connected world, and IBM has extended this unparalleled level of security to the cloud. For example, IBM's cybersecurity offerings act as a business immune system, with AI technology at
its core, delivered from the IBM Cloud. These


systems
help to defend and respond to cyber-attacks across an organization's data, applications, mobile and endpoint devices.

The
IBM Cloud is delivered with leading edge technology, including:

•

Modern infrastructure: IBM's systems, including servers, storage and operating system software, have been refreshed and redesigned for cloud
and enterprise AI workloads. IBM's new z14 is the world's first system to offer pervasive encryption of data without requiring changes to applications, and with no performance degradation. With IBM's
systems, clients can build an IT infrastructure that is optimized for the scalability, reliability and growth that businesses need in today's data-driven
world.

•

Future infrastructure: The Q Network on the IBM Cloud enables clients around the world to explore quantum computing capabilities. IBM is the
leader in quantum computing. Clients are signing on to explore how to overcome foreseen constraints in traditional computing models.

AI and Data

Artificial intelligence can help clients extract insight and make intelligent decisions from data. Like cloud, enterprise AI is very different
from consumer AI. Enterprise applications deal with more complex use cases that benefit from expert knowledge, such as in healthcare or in the identification of business risk. Enterprise AI
applications are trained by expert data, through data sets of all sizes and with more specialization than those in the general-knowledge consumer world. IBM AI—through the Watson
platform:

•

Learns more from less data: The ability to extract deep insights from both large and small data sets is essential for enterprise applications.
Watson excels at this and can produce more insights with less data than other AI systems. That means clients can get started more quickly and begin to gain experience deploying AI in the enterprise.

•

Protects clients' insights: While Watson builds on cumulative experience and knowledge, IBM recognizes that data and insights are clients' most
important assets and a true competitive advantage. Watson is built to safeguard this type of information.

•

Reimagines your workflows: Watson has been built for—and trained in—areas requiring deep expertise. Watson brings AI to
professionals so that work can be done more efficiently, and even more importantly, can improve as the systems learn from the data.

Solutions

Creating smarter businesses requires reimagining a company's core processes—for example, in healthcare, managing risk or optimizing
a supply chain. In addition to building solutions based on IBM's experience, IBM is also creating a series of AI solutions—cognitive solutions—that embed artificial
intelligence and data to change how work is done. Examples include:

•

Global Industry Platforms: provides cognitive, analytics, security and cloud technology in comprehensive industry-specific platforms to remove
much of the cost and complexity of delivering core business functions. For example: Banking, wealth management, and insurance are some of the areas poised for dramatic change by using cognitive and AI
solutions from IBM Watson Financial Services. Watson Health provides technology and expertise to empower leaders, advocates and influencers in health to accelerate discovery, make essential
connections and gain confidence on their path to solving the world's biggest health challenges.

•

Blockchain Solutions: IBM is working with clients and developers across multiple industries to use blockchain to transform how business is done
in areas such as banking and financial services and supply chain. For example, blockchain technology can be used to digitize global trade


processes,
providing a more efficient and secure method of moving goods across borders and trading zones.

•

Watson IoT: includes both a cloud-based platform and industry solutions infused with AI, helping organizations mine intelligence from billions
of connected devices.

Enterprise Services

Through Global Business Services and Global Technology Services, IBM has helped the world's most successful enterprises transition from era to
era. Using proven methods, IBM Services bring globally delivered outcomes using proven methods by focusing on:

•

Digital Reinvention for growth: a unique framework for business transformation focused on growth opportunities.

•

End-to-end Services integration: Global Technology Services brings the ability to connect previously disconnected parts of an organization. By
embedding Watson into these mission critical services, new levels of quality, resiliency and automation are achieved.

•

Pragmatic journey to Cloud and AI: Global Business Services brings its deep experience when guiding clients through the journey to cloud and
AI. Clients gain from the thorough understanding of technology and the best ways to utilize it.

As
clients reinvent their businesses to be smarter, they need all of this to work together. This is what they expect from IBM, what they need from IBM and what sets IBM apart.

*                *                *        
        *

Responsible
stewardship is an enduring principle that underscores all IBM endeavors. While IBM is constantly ushering in new technology it does so
by:

•

Leading in data responsibility, ethics and transparency;

•

Preparing workforces of the world;

•

Continuing the company's century-long commitment to diversity and inclusion, and

•

Remaining grounded in a set of enduring IBM Values:

•

Dedication to every client's success

•

Innovation that matters—for our company and for the world

•

Trust and personal responsibility in all relationships

IBM
has built a reputation and track record of trust with its clients for more than a century. IBM safeguards a client's privacy, data and insights. For example, IBM was one of the first
companies to appoint a Chief Privacy Officer, to develop and publish a genetics privacy policy, to be certified under the APEC Cross Borders Privacy Rules system and to sign the EU Data Protection
Code of Conduct for Cloud Service Providers.

*                *                *        
        *

This
is an era where being faster, more productive and lower cost is important but frankly not enough. To win, a business must be smarter: Being smarter means having deeper expertise,
extracting better insights from data and being capable of rapidly changing the way in which one does work.

This
is core to the strategy of IBM's clients and is at the heart of the IBM strategy.

Business Model

The company's business model is built to support two principal goals: helping enterprise clients to move from one era to the next by bringing
together innovative technology and industry expertise, and providing long-term value to shareholders. The business model has been developed over time through


strategic
investments in capabilities and technologies that have long-term growth and profitability prospects based on the value they deliver to clients.

The
company's global capabilities include services, software, systems, fundamental research and related financing. The broad mix of businesses and capabilities are combined to provide
integrated solutions and platforms to the company's clients.

The
business model is dynamic, adapting to the continuously changing industry and economic environment, including the company's transformation into cloud and as-a-Service delivery
models. The company continues to strengthen its position through strategic organic investments and acquisitions in higher-value areas, broadening its industry expertise and integrating AI into more of
what the company offers. In addition, the company is transforming into a more agile enterprise to drive innovation and
speed, as well as helping to drive productivity, which supports investments for participation in markets with significant long-term opportunity.

This
business model, supported by the company's financial model, has enabled the company to deliver strong earnings, cash flows and returns to shareholders over the long term.

Commercial
Financing: short-term working capital financing to suppliers, distributors and resellers of IBM and OEM products and services. This includes internal activity where Global
Financing factors a selected portion of the company's accounts receivable primarily for cash management purposes, at arm's-length rates.


Remanufacturing
and Remarketing: assets include used equipment returned from lease transactions, or used and surplus equipment acquired internally or externally. These assets may be
refurbished or upgraded and sold or leased to new or existing clients both externally or internally. Externally remarketed equipment revenue represents sales or leases to clients and resellers.
Internally remarketed equipment revenue primarily represents used equipment that is sold internally to Systems and Technology Services & Cloud Platforms. Systems may also sell the equipment
that it purchases from Global Financing to external clients.

IBM Worldwide Organizations

The following worldwide organizations play key roles in IBM's delivery of value to its clients:

•

Global Markets

•

Research, Development and Intellectual Property

Global Markets

IBM has a global presence, operating in more than 175 countries with a broad-based geographic distribution of revenue. The company's Global
Markets organization manages IBM's global footprint, working closely with dedicated country-based operating units to serve clients locally. These country teams have client relationship managers who
lead integrated teams of consultants, solution specialists and delivery professionals to enable clients' growth and innovation.

By
complementing local expertise with global experience and digital capabilities, IBM builds deep and broad-based client relationships. This local management focus fosters speed in
supporting clients, addressing new markets and making investments in emerging opportunities. The Global Markets organization serves clients with expertise in their industry as well as through the
products and services that IBM and partners supply. IBM is also expanding its reach to new and existing clients through digital marketplaces, digital sales and local Business Partner resources.

Research, Development and Intellectual Property

IBM's research and development (R&D) operations differentiate the company from its competitors. IBM annually invests 7 to 8 percent of
total revenue for R&D, focusing on high-growth, high-value opportunities. IBM Research works with clients and the company's business units through global labs on near-term and mid-term innovations. It
delivers many new technologies to IBM's portfolio every year and helps clients address their most difficult challenges. IBM Research scientists are conducting pioneering work in artificial
intelligence, quantum computing, blockchain, security, cloud, nanotechnology, silicon and post-silicon computing architectures and more—applying these technologies across industries
including healthcare, IoT, education and financial services.

In
2017, for the 25th consecutive year, IBM was awarded more U.S. patents than any other company. IBM's 9,043 patents awarded in 2017 represent a diverse range of inventions in
artificial intelligence, cloud, cybersecurity and other strategic growth areas for the company.

The
company continues to actively seek IP protection for its innovations, while increasing emphasis on other initiatives designed to leverage its IP leadership. Some of IBM's
technological breakthroughs are used exclusively in IBM products, while others are licensed and may be used in IBM products and/or the products of the licensee. As part of its business model, the
company licenses certain of its intellectual property, which is high-value technology, but may be in more mature markets. The licensee drives the future development of the IP and ultimately expands
the customer base. This would generate IP income for the company both upon licensing, and with any ongoing royalty arrangements between it and the licensee. While the company's various proprietary IP
rights are important to its success, IBM believes its business as a whole is not materially dependent on any particular patent or license, or any particular group of patents or licenses. IBM owns or
is licensed under a number of patents, which vary in duration, relating to its products.

company gains advantage and differentiation through investments in higher value capabilities—from semiconductor through software stack innovation—that
increase efficiency, lower cost and improve performance. The company's research and development capabilities and intellectual property patent portfolio contribute significantly to this segment's
leadership across areas as diverse as high performance computing, virtualization technologies, software optimization, power management, security, multi-operating system capabilities and open
technologies like interconnect standards to be leveraged by broad ecosystems.


Global Financing:

Global Financing provides client financing, commercial financing and participates in the remarketing of used equipment. Global Financing's
access to capital and its ability to manage increased exposures generates a competitive advantage for the company. The key competitive factors include interest rates charged, IT product experience,
client service, contract flexibility, ease of doing business, global capabilities and residual values. In client and commercial financing, Global Financing competes with three types of companies in
providing financial services to IT customers: other captive financing entities of IT companies such as Cisco and HPE, non-captive financing entities and banks or
financial institutions. In remarketing, the company competes with local and regional brokers plus original manufacturers in the fragmented worldwide used IT equipment market.

Forward-looking and Cautionary Statements

Certain statements contained in this Form 10-K may constitute "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the Private Securities
Litigation Reform Act of 1995 ("Reform Act"). Forward-looking statements are based on the company's current assumptions regarding future business and financial performance. These statements by their
nature address matters that are uncertain to different degrees. The company may also make forward-looking statements in other reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, in materials
delivered to stockholders and in press releases. In addition, the company's representatives may from time to time make oral forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements provide current
expectations of future events based on certain assumptions and include any statement that does not directly relate to any historical or current fact. Words such as "anticipates," "believes,"
"expects," "estimates," "intends," "plans," "projects," and similar expressions, may identify such forward-looking statements. Any forward-looking statement in this Form 10-K speaks only as of
the date on which it is made. The company assumes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements. In accordance with the Reform Act, set forth under Item 1A. "Risk Factors" on
pages 11 to 17 are cautionary statements that accompany those forward-looking statements. Readers should carefully review such cautionary statements as they identify certain important factors
that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements and from historical trends. Those cautionary statements are not exclusive and are in addition to other
factors discussed elsewhere in this Form 10-K, in the company's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission or in materials incorporated therein by reference.

Member
of the Board of Directors.

All
executive officers are elected by the Board of Directors annually as provided in the By-laws. Each executive officer named above, with the exception of Kenneth M. Keverian, has been
an executive of IBM or its subsidiaries during the past five years.

Mr.
Keverian was a Senior Partner at the Boston Consulting Group, a global management consulting firm, until joining IBM in 2014. He was with Boston Consulting Group for 26 years and he
focused on serving technology companies in the computing and communications sectors.

Item 1A. Risk Factors:

Downturn in Economic Environment and Client Spending Budgets could impact the Company's
Business:

If overall demand for IBM's products and solutions decreases, whether due to general economic conditions or a shift in client buying patterns, the company's revenue
and profit could be impacted.

The Company may not meet its Growth and Productivity Objectives under its Internal Business Transformation and Global Integration
Initiatives:

On an ongoing basis, IBM seeks to drive greater agility, productivity, flexibility and cost savings by transforming and globally integrating its own business
processes, functions and technologies to remain competitive and to enable scaling of resources and offerings in both emerging and more established markets. These various initiatives may not yield
their intended gains in speed, quality, productivity and enablement of rapid scaling, which may impact the company's competitiveness and its ability to meet its growth and productivity objectives.

Failure of Innovation Initiatives could impact the Long-Term Success of the Company:

IBM has been moving away from certain segments of the
IT industry and into areas in which it can differentiate itself through innovation, by leveraging its investments in R&D and attracting a successful developer ecosystem. If IBM is unable to continue
its cutting-edge innovation in a highly competitive and rapidly evolving environment or is unable to commercialize such innovations, expand and scale them with sufficient speed and versatility, the
company could fail in its ongoing efforts to maintain and increase its market share and its profit margins.

Damage to IBM's Reputation Could Impact the Company's Business:

IBM has one of the strongest brand names in the world, and its brand and
overall reputation could be negatively impacted by many factors, including if the company does not continue to be recognized for its industry-leading technology and solutions and as a cognitive
leader. IBM's reputation is potentially susceptible to damage by events such as significant disputes with clients, product defects, internal control deficiencies, delivery failures,
cybersecurity incidents, government investigations or legal proceedings or actions of current or former clients, directors, employees, competitors, vendors, alliance partners or joint venture
partners. If the


company's
brand image is tarnished by negative perceptions, its ability to attract and retain customers could be impacted.

Risks from Investing in Growth Opportunities could impact the Company's Business:

The company continues to invest significantly in its
strategic imperatives to drive revenue growth and market share gains. Client adoption rates and viable economic models are less certain in the high-value, highly competitive, and rapidly-growing
segments, and new delivery models may unfavorably impact demand and profitability for our other products or services. In addition, as the company expands to capture emerging growth opportunities, it
needs to rapidly secure the appropriate mix of trained, skilled and experienced employees, and develop ecosystems and collaborative partnerships. In emerging growth countries, the developing nature
presents potential political, social, legal and economic risks from evolving governmental policy, inadequate infrastructure, creditworthiness of customers and business partners, labor disruption and
corruption, which could impact the company's ability to meet its growth objectives and to deliver to its clients around the world.

IBM's Intellectual Property Portfolio may not prevent Competitive Offerings, and IBM may not be able to Obtain Necessary Licenses:

The
company's patents and other intellectual property may not prevent competitors from independently developing products and services similar to or duplicative to the company's, nor can there be any
assurance that the resources invested by the company to protect its intellectual property will be sufficient or that the company's intellectual property portfolio will adequately deter
misappropriation or improper use of the company's technology. In addition, the company may be the target of aggressive and opportunistic enforcement of patents by third parties, including
non-practicing entities. Also, there can be no assurances that IBM will be able to obtain from third parties the licenses it needs in the future. The company's ability to protect its intellectual
property could also be impacted by changes to existing laws, legal principles and regulations governing intellectual property, including the ownership and protection of patents.

Cybersecurity and Privacy Considerations could impact the Company's Business:

In the current environment there are numerous and evolving
risks to cybersecurity and privacy, including criminal hackers, hacktivists, state-sponsored intrusions, industrial espionage, employee malfeasance, and human or technological error. Computer hackers
and others routinely attempt to breach the security of technology products, services and systems, and to fraudulently induce employees, customers, and other third parties to disclose information or
unwittingly provide access to systems or data. The risk of such attacks to the company includes attempted breaches not only of our own products, services and systems, but also those of customers,
contractors, business partners, vendors and other third parties. The company's products, services and systems may be used in critical company, customer or third-party operations, or involve the
storage, processing and transmission of sensitive data, including valuable
intellectual property, other proprietary or confidential data, regulated data, and personal information of employees, customers and others. Successful breaches, employee malfeasance, or human or
technological error could result in, for example, unauthorized access to, disclosure, modification, misuse, loss, or destruction of company, customer, or other third party data or systems; theft of
sensitive, regulated, or confidential data including personal information and intellectual property; the loss of access to critical data or systems through ransomware, destructive attacks or other
means; and business delays, service or system disruptions or denials of service. In the event of such actions, the company, its customers and other third parties could be exposed to potential
liability, litigation, and regulatory or other government action, as well as the loss of existing or potential customers, damage to brand and reputation, and other financial loss. In addition, the
cost and operational consequences of responding to breaches and implementing remediation measures could be significant. The company also experiences and responds to cybersecurity threats. To date,
there has not been a cybersecurity attack that has had a material adverse effect on the company, though there is no assurance that there will not be a material adverse effect in the future. As the
company's business and the cybersecurity landscape evolve, the company may also find it necessary to make significant further investments to protect data and infrastructure. In the company's industry,
security vulnerabilities are increasingly discovered and


publicized
across a broad range of hardware and software products, elevating the risk of attacks and the potential cost of response and remediation for the company and its customers. In addition, the
fast-paced, evolving, pervasive, and sophisticated nature of certain cyber threats and vulnerabilities, as well as the scale and complexity of the business and infrastructure, make it possible that
certain threats or vulnerabilities will be undetected or unmitigated in time to prevent an attack on the company and its customers. Cybersecurity risk to the company and its customers will also depend
on factors such as actions, practices and investments of customers, contractors, business partners, vendors and other third parties. Cyber attacks or other catastrophic events resulting in disruptions
to or failures in power, information technology, communication systems or other critical infrastructure could result in interruptions or delays to company, customer, or other third party operations or
services, financial loss, injury to persons or property, potential liability, and damage to brand and reputation. Although the company takes significant steps to mitigate cybersecurity risk across a
range of functions, such measures can never eliminate the risk entirely or provide absolute security.

As
a global enterprise, the regulatory environment with regard to cybersecurity, privacy and data protection issues is increasingly complex and may have impacts on the company's
business, including increased risk, costs, and expanded compliance obligations. As the company's business focus on data grows, the potential impact of these vulnerabilities and regulations on the
company's business, risks, and reputation may grow accordingly. The General Data Protection Regulation that will come into force in the European Union in May 2018 will continue to cause the company to
incur additional compliance costs.

The Company's Financial Results for Particular Periods are Difficult to Predict:

IBM's revenues are affected by such factors as the
introduction of new products and services, our ability to compete effectively in increasingly competitive marketplaces, the length of the sales cycles and the seasonality of
technology purchases. Moreover, the company's strategic imperatives involve new products, new customers, new and evolving competitors, and new markets, all of which contribute to the difficulty of
predicting the company's financial results. The company's financial results may also be impacted by the structure of products and services contracts and the nature of its customers' businesses; for
example, certain of the company's services contracts with commercial customers in regulated industries are subject to periodic review by regulators with respect to controls and processes. As a result
of the above-mentioned factors, the company's financial results are difficult to predict. Historically, the company has had lower revenue in the first quarter than in the immediately preceding fourth
quarter. In addition, the high volume of products typically ordered at the end of each quarter, especially at the end of the fourth quarter, make financial results for a given period difficult to
predict.

Due to the Company's Global Presence, its Business and Operations could be impacted by Local Legal, Economic, Political and Health
Conditions:

The company is a globally integrated entity, operating in over 175 countries worldwide and deriving more than sixty percent of its revenues from sales outside the
United States. Changes in the laws or policies of the countries in which the company operates, or inadequate enforcement of laws or policies, could affect the company's business and the company's
overall results of operations. The company's results of operations also could be affected by economic and political changes in those countries and by macroeconomic changes, including recessions,
inflation, currency fluctuations between the U.S. dollar and non-U.S. currencies and adverse changes in trade relationships amongst those countries. Further, as the company expands its customer base
and the scope of its offerings, both within the U.S. and globally, it may be impacted by additional regulatory or other risks, including compliance with U.S. and foreign data privacy requirements,
labor relations laws, laws relating to anti-corruption, anti-competition regulations, import and trade restrictions and export requirements. In addition, any widespread outbreak of an illness,
pandemic or other local or global health issue or uncertain political climates, international hostilities, natural disasters, or any terrorist activities, could adversely affect customer demand and
the company's operations and its ability to source and deliver products and services to its customers.


The Company could incur Substantial Costs for Environmental Matters:

The company is subject to various federal, state, local and foreign
laws and regulations concerning the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise related to environmental protection, including the U.S. Superfund law. The company could incur substantial
costs, including cleanup costs, fines and civil or criminal sanctions, as well as third-party claims for property damage or personal injury, if it were to violate or become liable under environmental
laws and regulations. Compliance with environmental laws and regulations is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the company's financial position, results of operations and competitive
position.

Tax Matters could impact the Company's Results of Operations and Financial Condition:

The company is subject to income taxes in both the
United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. IBM's provision for income taxes and cash tax liability in the future could be adversely affected by numerous factors including, but not limited to,
income before taxes being lower than anticipated in countries with lower
statutory tax rates and higher than anticipated in countries with higher statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, and changes in tax laws, regulations,
accounting principles or interpretations thereof, which could adversely impact the company's results of operations and financial condition in future periods. The Organization for Economic Cooperation
and Development (OECD) is issuing guidelines that are different, in some respects, than long-standing international tax principles. As countries unilaterally amend their tax laws to adopt certain
parts of the OECD guidelines, this may increase tax uncertainty and may adversely impact the company's income taxes. Local country, state, provincial or municipal taxation may also be subject to
review and potential override by regional, federal, national or similar forms of government. In addition, IBM is subject to the continuous examination of its income tax returns by the United States
Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities around the world. The company regularly assesses the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of
its provision for income taxes. There can be no assurance that the outcomes from these examinations will not have an adverse effect on the company's provision for income taxes and cash tax liability.

The Company's Results of Operations and Financial Condition could be negatively impacted by its U.S. and non-U.S. Pension Plans:

Adverse
financial market conditions and volatility in the credit markets may have an unfavorable impact on the value of the company's pension trust assets and its future estimated pension liabilities. As a
result, the company's financial results in any period could be negatively impacted. In addition, in a period of an extended financial market downturn, the company could be required to provide
incremental pension plan funding with resulting liquidity risk which could negatively impact the company's financial flexibility. Further, the company's results could be negatively impacted by
premiums for mandatory pension insolvency insurance coverage outside the United States. Premium increases could be significant due to the level of insolvencies of unrelated companies in the country at
issue. IBM's 2017 Annual Report to Stockholders includes information about potential impacts from pension funding and the use of certain assumptions regarding pension matters.

Ineffective Internal Controls could impact the Company's Business and Operating Results:

The company's internal control over financial
reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements because of its inherent limitations, including the possibility of human error, the circumvention or overriding of controls, or fraud. Even effective
internal controls can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements. If the company fails to maintain the adequacy of its internal
controls, including any failure to implement required new or improved controls, or if the company experiences difficulties in their implementation, the company's business and operating results could
be harmed and the company could fail to meet its financial reporting obligations.

The Company's Use of Accounting Estimates involves Judgment and could impact the Company's Financial Results:

The application of generally
accepted accounting principles requires the company to make estimates and assumptions about certain items and future events that directly affect its reported


financial
condition. The company's most critical accounting estimates are described in the Management Discussion in IBM's 2017 Annual Report to Stockholders, under "Critical Accounting Estimates." In
addition, as discussed in note M, "Contingencies and Commitments," in IBM's 2017 Annual Report to Stockholders, the company makes certain estimates including decisions related to legal
proceedings and reserves. These estimates and assumptions involve the use of judgment. As a result, actual financial results may differ.

The Company Depends on Skilled Employees and could be impacted by the loss of Critical Skills:

Much of the future success of the company
depends on the continued service, availability and integrity of skilled employees, including technical, marketing and staff resources. Skilled and experienced personnel in the areas where the company
competes are in high demand, and competition for their talents is intense. Changing demographics and labor work force trends may result in a loss of or insufficient knowledge and skills. In addition,
as global opportunities and industry demand shifts, realignment, training and scaling of skilled resources may not be sufficiently rapid or successful. Further, many of IBM's key employees receive a
total compensation package that includes equity awards. Any new regulations, volatility in the stock market and other factors could diminish the company's use, and the value, of the company's equity
awards, putting the company at a competitive disadvantage or forcing the company to use more cash compensation.

The Company's Business could be impacted by its Relationships with Critical Suppliers:

IBM's business employs a wide variety of
components, supplies, services and raw materials from a substantial number of suppliers around the world. Certain of the company's businesses rely on a single or a limited number of suppliers, and
with the completion of GLOBALFOUNDRIES' acquisition of IBM's global commercial semiconductor business in 2015, it became IBM's exclusive server processor technology provider for certain
semiconductors. Changes in the business condition (financial or otherwise) of these suppliers could subject the company to losses and affect its ability to bring products to market. Further, the
failure of the company's suppliers to deliver components, supplies, services and raw materials in sufficient quantities, in a timely manner, and in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations
could adversely affect the company's business. In addition, any defective components, supplies or materials, or inadequate services received from suppliers could reduce the reliability of the
company's products and services and harm the company's reputation.

Product Quality Issues could impact the Company's Business and Operating Results:

The company has rigorous quality control standards and
processes intended to prevent, detect and correct errors, malfunctions and other defects in its products and services. If errors, malfunctions, defects or disruptions in service are experienced by
customers or in the company's operations there could be negative consequences that could impact customers' business operations and harm the company's business's operating results.

The Company could be impacted by its Business with Government Clients:

The company's customers include numerous governmental entities
within and outside the U.S., including the U.S. Federal
Government and state and local entities. Some of the company's agreements with these customers may be subject to periodic funding approval. Funding reductions or delays could adversely impact public
sector demand for our products and services. Also, some agreements may contain provisions allowing the customer to terminate without cause and providing for higher liability limits for certain losses.
In addition, the company could be suspended or debarred as a governmental contractor and could incur civil and criminal fines and penalties, which could negatively impact the company's results of
operations and financial results.

The Company is exposed to Currency and Financing Risks that could impact its Revenue and Business:

The company derives a significant
percentage of its revenues and costs from its affiliates operating in local currency environments, and those results are affected by changes in the relative values of non-U.S. currencies and the U.S.
dollar. Further, inherent in the company's financing business are risks related to the concentration of credit, client creditworthiness, interest rate and currency fluctuations on


the
associated debt and liabilities, the determination of residual values and the financing of other than traditional IT assets. The company employs a number of strategies to manage these risks,
including the use of derivative financial instruments, which involve the risk of non-performance by the counterparty. In addition, there can be no assurance that the company's efforts to manage its
currency and financing risks will be successful.

The Company's Financial Performance could be impacted by Changes in Market Liquidity Conditions and by Customer Credit Risk on
Receivables:

The company's financial performance is exposed to a wide variety of industry sector dynamics worldwide. The company's earnings and cash flows, as well as its
access to funding, could be negatively impacted by changes in market liquidity conditions. IBM's 2017 Annual Report to Stockholders includes information about the company's liquidity position. The
company's client base includes many worldwide enterprises, from small and medium businesses to the world's largest organizations and governments, with a significant portion of the company's revenue
coming from global clients across many sectors. Most of the company's sales are on an open credit basis, and the company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its clients' financial conditions. If
the company becomes aware of information related to the creditworthiness of a major customer, or, if future actual default rates on receivables in general differ from those currently anticipated, the
company may have to adjust its allowance for credit losses, which could affect the company's consolidated net income in the period the adjustments are made.

The Company's Reliance on Third Party Distribution Channels and Ecosystems could impact its Business:

The company offers its products
directly and through a variety of third party distributors, resellers and ecosystem partners. Changes in the business condition (financial or otherwise) of these distributors, resellers and ecosystem
partners could subject the company to losses and affect its ability to bring its products to market. As the company moves into new areas, distributors, resellers and ecosystem partners may be unable
to keep up with changes in technology and offerings, and the company may be
unable to recruit and enable appropriate partners to achieve growth objectives. In addition, the failure of third party distributors, resellers and ecosystem partners to comply with all applicable
laws and regulations may prevent the company from working with them and could subject the company to losses and affect its ability to bring products to market.

Risks to the Company from Acquisitions, Alliances and Dispositions include Integration Challenges, Failure to Achieve Objectives, and the Assumption of
Liabilities:

The company has made and expects to continue to make acquisitions, alliances and dispositions. Acquisitions and alliances present significant challenges and risks
relating to the integration of the business into the company, and there can be no assurances that the company will manage acquisitions and alliances successfully or that strategic acquisition
opportunities will be available to the company on acceptable terms or at all. The related risks include the company failing to achieve strategic objectives and anticipated revenue improvements and
cost savings, as well as the failure to retain key personnel of the acquired business and the assumption of liabilities related to litigation or other legal proceedings involving the acquired
business. From time to time, the company disposes or attempts to dispose of assets that are no longer central to its strategic objectives. Any such disposition or attempted disposition is subject to
risks, including risks related to the terms and timing of such disposition, risks related to obtaining necessary governmental or regulatory approvals and risks related to retained liabilities not
subject to the company's control.

The Company is Subject to Legal Proceedings Risks:

As a company with a substantial employee population and with clients in more than 175
countries, IBM is involved, either as plaintiff or defendant, in a variety of ongoing claims, demands, suits, investigations, tax matters and proceedings that arise from time to time in the ordinary
course of its business. The risks associated with such legal proceedings are described in more detail in note M, "Contingencies and Commitments," in IBM's 2017 Annual Report to Stockholders.
The company believes it has adopted appropriate risk management and compliance programs. Legal and compliance risks, however, will continue to exist and additional legal


proceedings
and other contingencies, the outcome of which cannot be predicted with certainty, may arise from time to time.

Risk Factors Related to IBM Securities:

The company and its subsidiaries issue debt securities in the worldwide capital markets from time
to time, with a variety of different maturities and in different currencies. The value of the company's debt securities fluctuates based on many factors, including the methods employed for calculating
principal and interest, the maturity of the securities, the aggregate principal amount of securities outstanding, the redemption features for the securities, the level, direction and volatility of
interest rates, changes in exchange rates, exchange controls, governmental and stock exchange regulations and other factors over which the company has little or no control. The company's ability to
pay interest and repay the principal for its debt securities is dependent upon its ability to manage its business operations, as well as the other risks described under this Item 1A.
entitled "Risk Factors." There can be no assurance that the company will be able to manage any of these risks successfully.

The
company also issues its common stock from time to time in connection with various compensation plans, contributions to its pension plan and certain acquisitions. The market price of
IBM common stock is subject to significant volatility, due to other factors described under this Item 1A. entitled "Risk Factors," as well as economic and geopolitical conditions generally,
trading volumes, speculation by the press or investment community about the company's financial condition, and other factors, many of which are beyond the company's control. Since the market price of
IBM's common stock fluctuates significantly, stockholders may not be able to sell the company's stock at attractive prices.

In
addition, changes by any rating agency to the company's outlook or credit ratings can negatively impact the value and liquidity of both the company's debt and equity securities. The
company does not make a market in either its debt or equity securities and cannot provide any assurances with respect to the liquidity or value of such securities.

Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments:

Not applicable.

Item 2. Properties:

The company's corporate headquarters are located at an owned site in Armonk, New York. As of December 31, 2017, in aggregate, the company
owns or leases facilities for current use consisting of approximately 78 million square feet worldwide.

At
December 31, 2017, IBM's manufacturing and development facilities in the United States had aggregate floor space of 9 million square feet, of which 7 million was
owned and 2 million was leased. Similar facilities in 15 other countries totaled 6 million square feet, of which 3 million was owned and 3 million was leased. The company's
facilities are utilized for current operations of all its segments.

Although
improved production techniques, productivity gains, divestitures and infrastructure reduction actions have resulted in reduced manufacturing floor space, continuous maintenance
and upgrading of facilities is essential to maintain technological leadership, improve productivity and meet customer demand.

The
material features of each equity compensation plan under which equity securities are authorized for issuance that was adopted without stockholder approval are described below:

2001 Long-Term Performance Plan

The 2001 Long-Term Performance Plan (the "2001 Plan") has been used to fund awards for employees other than senior executives of
the Company. Awards for senior executives of the Company have been and will continue to be funded from the stockholder-approved 1999 Long-Term Performance Plan (the "1999 Plan"); the 1999 Plan is also
used to fund awards for employees other than senior executives, Otherwise, the provisions of the 2001 Plan are identical to the 1999 Plan, including the type of awards that may be granted under the
plan (stock options, restricted stock and unit awards and long-term performance incentive awards).


The
2001 Plan is administered by the Executive Compensation and Management Resources Committee of the Board of Directors (the "Committee"), and that Committee may delegate to officers of
the company certain of its duties, powers and authority. Payment of awards may be made in the form of cash, stock or combinations thereof and may be deferred with Committee approval. Awards are not
transferable or assignable except (i) by law, will or the laws of descent and distribution, (ii) as a result of the disability of the recipient, or (iii) with the approval of the
Committee.

If
the employment of a participant terminates, other than as a result of the death or disability of a participant, all unexercised, deferred and unpaid awards shall be canceled
immediately, unless the award agreement provides otherwise. In the event of the death of a participant or in the event a participant is deemed by the company to be disabled and eligible for benefits
under the terms of the IBM Long-Term Disability Plan (or any successor plan or similar plan of another employer), the participant's estate, beneficiaries or representative, as the case may be, shall
have the rights and duties of the participant under the applicable award agreement. In addition, unless the award agreement specifies otherwise, the Committee may cancel, rescind, suspend, withhold or
otherwise limit or restrict any unexpired, unpaid, or
deferred award at any time if the participant is not in compliance with all applicable provisions of the awards agreement and the 2001 Plan. In addition, awards may be cancelled if the participant
engages in any conduct or act determined to be injurious, detrimental or prejudicial to any interest of the company.

PWCC Acquisition Long-Term Performance Plan

The IBM PWCC Acquisition Long-Term Performance Plan (the "PWCC Plan") was adopted by the Board of Directors in connection with
the company's acquisition of PricewaterhouseCoopers Consulting ("PwCC") from PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, as announced on October 1, 2002. The PWCC Plan has been and will continue to be
used solely to fund awards for employees of PwCC who have become employed by the company as a result of the acquisition. Awards for senior executives of the company will not be funded from the PWCC
Plan. The terms and conditions of the PWCC Plan are substantively identical to the terms and conditions of the 2001 Plan, described above.

IBM Deferred Compensation and Equity Award Plan

The IBM Deferred Compensation and Equity Award Plan (the "DCEAP") was adopted in 1993 and amended and restated effective
January 1, 2014. Under the Amended and Restated DCEAP, non-management directors receive Promised Fee Shares in connection with deferred annual retainer payments. Each Promised Fee Share is
equal in value to one share of the company's common stock. Upon a director's retirement or other completion of service as a director, amounts deferred into Promised Fee Shares are payable in either
cash and/or shares of the company's stock either as lump sum or installments pursuant to the director's distribution election. For additional information about the DCEAP, see "2017 Director
Compensation Narrative" in IBM's definitive Proxy Statement to be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission and delivered to stockholders in connection with the Annual Meeting of Stockholders
to be held April 24, 2018.
