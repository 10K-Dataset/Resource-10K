PART I

Item 1. Business:

International Business Machines Corporation (IBM) was incorporated in the State of New York on June 16, 1911, as the Computing-Tabulating-Recording Co.
(C-T-R), a consolidation of the Computing Scale Co. of America, the Tabulating Machine Co., and The International Time Recording Co. of New York. Since that time, IBM has focused on the intersection
of business insight and technological invention, and its operations and aims have been international in nature. This was signaled over 80 years ago, in 1924, when C-T-R changed its name to
International Business Machines Corporation. And it continues today: IBM is the largest information technology company in the world, the world's largest business and technology services company, the
world's largest consulting services organization, the world's largest information technology research organization, and the world's largest financier of information technology.

Description of Business

IBM is an innovation company, serving the needs of enterprises and institutions worldwide. IBM seeks to deliver clients success by enabling their own capacity to
innovate, so that they may differentiate their organizations to create unique competitive advantage.

To
help its clients achieve growth, productivity, efficiency, and the realization of greater value through innovation, IBM draws upon the world's leading systems, software and services
capabilities to turn enterprises of all sizes, in every major industry, into on demand businesses. An on demand business is an enterprise that is integrated end-to-end, and,
with its business
ecosystems of partners, suppliers and clients, is able to manage that extended network dynamically to address new opportunities, respond to changes in demand or threats to its business, enhance
flexibility, speed execution and ultimately achieve profitable growth.

In
IBM's view, being on demand is the most comprehensive way to enable a company to innovate—and thus differentiate itself—consistently over time. IBM views
enterprise innovation not only in terms of products and services, but across all dimensions of a business: its business processes, business model, management systems, culture and role in society.

IBM's Strategy

IBM's strategy is to pursue an innovation agenda with its clients, partners and in other relationships, and to continue refining its portfolio to achieve higher
value. Through its understanding of where technology, client requirements and global business are headed, the company continually makes strategic decisions to maintain its leadership of this rapidly
changing business by focusing on high-value innovation-based solutions and services while consistently generating high returns on invested capital for its shareholders. The company
utilizes its entire portfolio—hardware, software, services, technology and research to maintain its leadership. With those broad capabilities to enable enterprise innovation, the expertise
and diversity of its global workforce and its large network of suppliers and business partners, IBM considers itself well-positioned to capitalize on the opportunities represented by the
needs of its clients and current trends in economics and society. IBM believes these trends will have major effects on business, government, education, healthcare, transportation and most other fields
of endeavor. These developments include, in part: the globalization of capabilities, skills, and markets; the increasingly interconnected nature of companies, industries and even economies; the
growing influence of open standards and open source software; the rise in collaborative models of creation and development; the maturation and availability of semiconductor and wireless chip
technology; the use of service-oriented architectures and Web services in software development; the


growing
number of service providers for a wider range of traditional and emerging business processes and functions; and the advances made by IBM and others in increasing computational speed, capacity
and access.

To
capitalize on the opportunities presented by these and other developments, and to avoid commoditization of its portfolio, IBM regularly reviews its businesses and invests in those
that represent strategic growth opportunities, reallocating resources as needed; it acquires businesses that contribute strategically to its portfolio; it exits or divests itself of businesses that no
longer support its strategy for innovation and higher value; and it seeks to improve productivity and drive efficiencies by integrating its global operations.

IBM's
strategic priorities for 2006 include:

•

Capitalizing
on technological, business and social trends and the need of enterprises to innovate in addressing those trends;

•

Maintaining
market-share leadership in systems, middleware software and services, as a platform to drive growth;

•

Focusing
investment and resources on emerging growth areas, including Business Performance Transformation Services and emerging countries;

•

Continuing
the global integration of IBM, driving productivity gains and higher value in service delivery;

•

Furthering
IBM's leadership in innovation initiatives, including advanced semiconductor design and development, collaborative intellectual capital, business process
expertise and integration, and advanced systems for supercomputing capability—including mainframes and "grid" networks;

•

Acquiring
businesses that contribute strategically to its portfolio, and exiting businesses that no longer support its strategy for innovation and higher value.

Business Segments

Organizationally, the company's major operations comprise a Global Services segment; a Systems and Technology Group; a Software segment; a Global Financing
segment; and an Enterprise Investments segment.

GLOBAL
SERVICES is a critical component of the company's strategy of providing insight and solutions to clients. While solutions often include industry-leading IBM software and hardware,
other suppliers' products are also used if a client solution requires it. Contracts for IBM services—commonly referred to as "signings"—can range from less than one year to ten
years. Businesses generating short-term signings include ITS and the commercial content of Consulting and Systems Integration (C&SI). Long-term businesses include SO, BTO, and
the federal content of C&SI.

SYSTEMS
AND TECHNOLOGY GROUP provides IBM's clients with business solutions requiring advanced computing power and storage capabilities. Approximately 60 percent of the Systems and
Technology Group's server and storage sales transactions are through business partners; approximately 40 percent are direct to end-user clients, more than half of which are through
the Web at ibm.com. In addition, the group provides leading semiconductor technology and products, packaging solutions and engineering technology services to clients and for IBM's own advanced
technology needs. While appropriately not reported as external revenue, hardware is also deployed to support services solutions.


SOFTWARE
consists primarily of middleware and operating systems software. Middleware software enables clients to integrate systems, processes and applications across their enterprises.
Middleware is designed to be the underlying support for applications provided by ISVs, who build industry- or process-specific applications according to open industry standards. Operating systems are
the engines that run computers. Approximately 45 percent of external Software revenue relates to one-time charge (OTC) arrangements, whereby the client pays one up-front
payment for a perpetual license. The remaining annuity-based revenue consists of both maintenance revenue sold with OTC arrangements, as well as revenue from software sold on a monthly license charge
(MLC) arrangement. Typically, arrangements for the sale of OTC software include one year of maintenance. The client can also purchase ongoing maintenance after the first year, which includes product
upgrades and technical support.

GLOBAL
FINANCING is described on pages 43 through 47 of IBM's 2005 Annual Report to Stockholders.

ENTERPRISE
INVESTMENTS develops and provides industry-specific IT solutions supporting the Hardware, Software and Global Services segments of the company. Primary product lines include
product life cycle management software and document processing technologies. Product life cycle management software primarily serves the Industrial sector and helps clients manage the development and
manufacturing of their products. Document processor products service the Financial Services sector and include products that enable electronic banking.

IBM Worldwide Organizations

The following three company-wide organizations play key roles in IBM's delivery of value to its clients:

•

Sales &
Distribution Organization and related sales channels

•

Research,
Development and Intellectual Property

•

Integrated
Supply Chain

SALES & DISTRIBUTION ORGANIZATION

With a comprehensive knowledge of IBM's business and infrastructure solutions, as well as the products, technologies and services IBM and its Business Partners
offer, the company's global client teams gain a deep understanding of each client's organizational, infrastructure and industry-specific needs to determine the best approach for addressing their
critical business and IT challenges. These professionals work in integrated teams with IBM consultants and technology representatives, combining their deep skills and expertise to deliver
high-value solutions that address clients' pain points and innovational aspirations.

The
majority of IBM's business, excluding the company's original equipment manufacturer (OEM) technology business, occurs in industries that are broadly grouped into six sectors. The
company's
go-to-market strategies and sales and distribution activities are organized around these sectors:

•

Financial
Services: Banking, Financial Markets, Insurance

•

Public:
Education, Government, Healthcare and Life Sciences

•

Industrial:
Aerospace and Defense, Automotive, Chemical and Petroleum, Electronics

•

Distribution:
Consumer Products, Retail, Travel, Transportation

•

Communications:

•

Small
and Medium Business: Mainly companies with less than 1,000 employees


Internal Routes-to-Market

Services

consultants focused on selling end-to-end solutions for large, complex business
challenges.

Hardware and software brand specialists

selling IBM products as parts of discrete technology decisions, and focusing on
mid-sized clients interested in purchasing "turnkey" solutions, such as those in the IBM Express Portfolio.

ibm.com

provides fast, easy access to IBM's product and business expertise via the Web and telephone. Identifies business opportunities
for all of IBM's routes to market and provides online and telephone sales of standard hardware, software, services and financing for all size companies.

Business Partners Routes-to-Market

Global/major independent software vendors.

ISVs deliver business process or industry-specific applications and, in doing so,
often influence the sale of IBM hardware, middleware and services.

Global/major systems integrators (SIS).

SIS identify business problems and design solutions when IBM Global services is not
the preferred systems integrator; they also sell computing infrastructures from IBM and its competitors.

Regional ISVs and SIS.

SIS identify the business problems, and ISVs deliver business process or industry-specific
applications to medium-sized and large businesses requiring IBM computing infrastructure offerings.

Solutions providers, resellers and distributors.

Resellers sell IBM platforms and value-added services as part of a discrete
technology platform decision to clients wanting third-party assistance.

RESEARCH, DEVELOPMENT AND INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY

IBM's research and development (R&D) operations differentiate IBM from its competitors. IBM annually spends approximately $5–$6 billion for
R&D, including capitalized software costs, focusing its investments in high-growth opportunities. As a result of innovations in these and other areas, IBM was once again awarded more U.S.
patents in 2005 than any other company. This marks the 13th year in a row that IBM achieved this distinction.

In
addition to producing world-class hardware and software products, IBM innovations are a major differentiator in providing solutions for the company's clients through its growing
services activities. The company's investments in R&D also result in intellectual property (IP) income. Some of IBM's
technological breakthroughs are used exclusively in IBM products, while others are used by the company's licensees for their products when that new technology is not strategic to IBM's business goals.
A third group is both used internally and licensed externally.

In
addition to these IP income sources, the company also generates value from its patent portfolio through cross-licensing arrangements and IP licensed in divestiture transactions. The
value of these other two sources is not readily apparent in the financial results and Consolidated Statement of Earnings, because income on cross-licensing arrangements is recorded only to the extent
that cash is received. The value received by IBM for IP involving the sale of a business is included in the overall gain or loss from the divestiture, not in the separately displayed IP income amounts
in financial results and Consolidated Statement of Earnings.


INTEGRATED SUPPLY CHAIN

Just as IBM works to transform its clients' supply chains for greater efficiency and responsiveness to market conditions, the company continues to see business
value as it establishes its globally integrated supply chain as an on demand business, transforming this function into a strategic advantage for the company and, ultimately, improved delivery and
outcomes for its clients. Leveraging this experience, in June 2005, IBM launched its supply-chain business transformation outsourcing service to optimize and help run clients'
end-to-end supply chain processes, from procurement to logistics.

IBM
spends approximately $38 billion annually through its supply chain, procuring materials and services around the world. The company's supply, manufacturing and logistics and
customer fulfillment operations are integrated in one operating unit that has reduced inventories, improved response to marketplace opportunities and external risks and converted fixed to variable
costs. Simplifying and streamlining internal processes has improved operations and sales force productivity and processes and thereby the experiences of the company's clients when working with IBM.
Because some of the cost savings this unit generates are passed along to clients, they will not always result in a visible gross margin improvement in the company's Consolidated Statement of Earnings.
While these efforts are largely concerned with product manufacturing and delivery, IBM is also applying supply-chain principles to service delivery across its solutions and services lines of business.

In
addition to its own manufacturing operations, the company uses a number of contract manufacturing (CM) companies around the world to manufacture IBM-designed products. The
use of CM companies is intended to generate cost efficiencies and reduce time-to-market for certain IBM products. Some of the company's relationships with CM companies are
exclusive. The company has key relationships with Sanmina-SCI for the manufacture of some Intel-based products and with Solectron for a significant portion of the manufacturing operations
of Global Asset Recovery Services—an operation of Global Financing that restores end-of-lease personal computers and other IT equipment for resale.

Forward-looking and Cautionary Statements

Certain statements contained in this Annual Report may constitute "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act
of 1995 ("Reform Act"). The company may also make forward-looking statements in other reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, in materials delivered to stockholders and in press
releases. In addition, the company's representatives may from time to time make oral forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements provide current expectations of future events based on
certain assumptions and include any statement that does not directly relate to any historical or current fact. Words such as "anticipates," "believes," "expects," "estimates," "intends," "plans,"
"projects," and similar expressions, may identify such forward-looking statements. The company assumes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements. In accordance with the Reform
Act, set forth under Item 1A "Risk Factors" on pages 8 to 13 are cautionary statements that accompany those forward-looking statements. Readers should carefully review such cautionary
statements as they identify certain important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements and from historical trends. Those cautionary
statements are not exclusive and are in addition to other factors discussed elsewhere in this Annual Report, in the company's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission or in materials
incorporated therein by reference.

Item 1A. Risk Factors:

Economic Environment and Corporate IT Spending Budgets:

If overall demand for systems, software and services changes, whether
due to general economic conditions or a shift in corporate buying patterns, sales performance could be impacted. IBM's diverse portfolio of products and offerings is designed to gain market share in
strong and weak economic climates. The company accomplishes this by not only having a mix of offerings with long-term cash and income streams as well as cyclical transaction-based sales,
but also by continually developing competitive products and solutions and effectively managing a skilled resource base. IBM continues to transform itself to take advantage of shifting demand trends,
focusing on client or industry-specific solutions, business performance and open standards.

Internal Business Transformation and Global Integration Initiatives:

IBM continues to drive greater productivity, flexibility
and cost savings by transforming and globally integrating its own business processes and functions. In 2005, the company realigned its operations and organizational structure in Europe to give sales
and delivery teams greater authority, accountability and flexibility to make decisions and to execute more effectively on behalf of our clients. Additionally, in 2005, many of the company's corporate
functions—such as Legal, Finance, Human Resources, Information Technology, and Real Estate Site Operations—which had been previously replicated for many of the individual
countries where IBM operates were integrated so that they could be managed and their resources optimized on a global scale. In addition to eliminating redundancies and overhead structures to drive
productivity, this integration improves IBM's capacity to innovate by providing greater clarity of key priorities around shared goals and objectives and leads to a sharper focus for the company on
learning, development and knowledge sharing.

Innovation Initiatives:

IBM invests to improve its ability to help its clients innovate. Investment may occur in the research
and development of new products and services, as well as in the establishment of new collaborative and co-creation relationships with developers, other companies, and other institutions.
To deliver value that helps clients differentiate themselves for competitive advantage, IBM has been moving away from commoditized categories of the IT industry and into areas in which it can
differentiate itself through innovation and by leveraging its investments in R&D. Examples include IBM's leadership position in the design and fabrication of ASICs; the design of smaller, faster and
energy-efficient semiconductor devices; the design of "grid" computing networks that allow computers to share processing power; the transformation and integration of business processes; and the
company's efforts to advance open technology standards and to engage with governments, academia, think tanks and nongovernmental organizations on emerging trends in technology, society and culture. In
the highly competitive IT industry, with large diversified competitors as well as smaller and nimble single-technology competitors, IBM's ability to continue its cutting-edge innovation is
critical to maintaining and increasing market share. IBM is managing this risk by more closely linking its R&D organization to industry-specific and client-specific needs, as discussed in Description
of Business—IBM Worldwide Organizations.


Open Standards:

The broad adoption of open standards is essential to the computing model for on demand business and is a
significant driver of collaborative innovation across all industries. Without interoperability among all manner of computing platforms, the integration of any client's internal systems, applications
and processes remains a monumental and expensive task. The broad-based acceptance of open standards—rather than closed, proprietary architectures—also allows the computing
infrastructure to more easily absorb (and thus benefit from) new technical innovations. IBM is committed to fostering open standards because they are vital to the On Demand Operating Environment, and
because their acceptance will expand growth opportunities across the entire business services and IT industry. There are a number of competitors in the IT industry with significant resources and
investments who are committed to closed and proprietary platforms as a way to lock customers into a particular architecture. This competition will result in increased pricing pressure and/or IP claims
and proceedings. IBM's support of open standards is evidenced by the enabling of its products to support open standards such as Linux, and the development of Rational software development tools, which
can be used to develop and upgrade any other company's software products.

Investing in Growth Opportunities:

The company is continuing to refocus its business on the higher value segments of
enterprise computing—providing technology and transformation services to clients' businesses. Consistent with that focus, the company continues to significantly invest in growth
opportunities, as a way to drive revenue growth and market share gain. Areas of investment include strategic acquisitions, primarily in software and services, focused client and industry-specific
solutions, Business Performance Transformation Services, key technologies and emerging growth countries such as China, Russia, India and Brazil.

Protection of Intellectual Property:

While the company's various proprietary intellectual property rights are important to
its success, IBM believes its business as a whole is not materially dependent on any
particular patent or license, or any particular group of patents or licenses. IBM owns or is licensed under a number of patents, which vary in duration, relating to its products. Licenses under
patents owned by IBM have been and are being granted to others under reasonable terms and conditions. These protections may not prevent competitors from independently developing products and services
similar to or duplicative to the company's nor can there be any assurance that these protections will adequately deter misappropriation or improper use of the company's technology. Also, there can be
no assurances that IBM will be able to obtain from third parties the licenses it needs in the future.

Seasonality of Revenues:

IBM's revenues are affected by such factors as the introduction of new products, the length of the
sales cycles and the seasonality of technology purchases. As a result, the company's results are difficult to predict. These factors historically have resulted in lower revenue in the first quarter
than in the immediately preceding fourth quarter.

Local Legal, Economic and Health Conditions:

The company operates in more than 160 countries worldwide and derives more than
half of its revenues from sales outside the United States. Changes in the laws or policies of the countries in which the company operates could affect the company's business in that country and the
company's results of operations. The company's results of operations also could be affected by economic and political changes in those countries and by macroeconomic changes, including recessions and
inflation. In addition, any widespread outbreak of an illness or other health issue, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), avian influenza (bird flu) or any other pandemic, or local or
global health issues, could adversely affect the company's operations, its ability to source and deliver products and services to its customers, and customer demand.

Insurance:

The company maintains third party insurance coverage against various liability risks and risks of property loss.
While we believe these arrangements are an effective way to insure against liability and property damage risks, the potential liabilities associated with those risks or other events could exceed the
coverage provided by such arrangements.


Environmental Matters:

The company is subject to various federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations concerning
the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise related to environmental protection, including the U.S. Superfund law. The company could incur substantial costs, including cleanup costs,
fines and civil or criminal sanctions, as well as third-party claims for property damage or personal injury, if it were to violate or become liable under environmental laws and regulations. Compliance
with environmental laws and regulations is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the company's capital expenditures, earnings and competitive position.

Tax Matters:

The company is subject to income taxes in both the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. IBM's
provision for income taxes and cash tax liability in the future could be adversely affected by numerous factors including, but not limited to, income before taxes being lower than anticipated in
countries with lower statutory tax rates and higher than anticipated in countries with higher statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, and changes in tax
laws, regulations, accounting principles or interpretations thereof, which could adversely impact the company's results of operations and financial condition in future periods. In addition, IBM is
subject to the continuous examination of its income tax returns by the Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities. The company regularly assesses the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting
from these examinations to determine the adequacy of its provision for income taxes. There can be no assurance that the outcomes from these continuous examinations will not have an adverse effect on
the company's provision for income taxes and cash tax liability.

Internal Controls:

Effective internal controls are necessary for the company to provide reasonable assurance with respect to
its financial reports and to effectively prevent fraud. If the company cannot provide reasonable assurance with respect to its financial reports and effectively prevent fraud, the company's brand and
operating results could be harmed. Pursuant to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, the company is required to furnish a report by management on internal control over financial reporting, including
management's assessment of the effectiveness of such control. Internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements because of its inherent limitations, including the
possibility of human error, the circumvention or overriding of controls, or fraud. Therefore, even effective internal controls can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to the preparation and
fair presentation of financial statements. In addition, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the
control may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. If the company fails to maintain the adequacy of its
internal controls, including any failure to implement required new or improved controls, or if the company experiences difficulties in their implementation, the company's business and operating
results could be harmed, the company could fail to meet its reporting obligations, and there could be a material adverse effect on the company's stock price.

Use of Estimates:

In connection with the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements, the company uses certain
estimates and assumptions, which are based on historical experience and management's knowledge of current events and actions that the company may undertake in the future. The company's most critical
accounting estimates are described in the Management Discussion on pages 40 to 42 of IBM's 2005 Annual Report to Stockholders. In addition, as discussed in note O, "Contingencies and
Commitments" on pages 76 to 79 of IBM's 2005 Annual Report to Stockholders, the company makes certain estimates under SFAS No. 5 "Accounting for Contingencies", including decisions
related to legal proceedings and reserves. While management believes that these estimates and assumptions are reasonable under the circumstances, by definition they involve the use of judgment and the
exercise of discretion, and therefore actual results may differ.

Competitive Conditions:

The company operates in businesses that are subject to intense competitive pressures. The company's
businesses face a significant number of competitors, ranging from


Fortune
50 companies to an increasing number of relatively small, rapidly growing and highly specialized organizations. The company believes that its combination of technology, performance, quality,
reliability, price and the breadth of products and service offerings are important competitive factors.

Intense
competitive pressures could affect prices or demand for the company's products and services, resulting in reduced profit margins and/or loss of market opportunity. Unlike many of
its competitors, the company has a broad portfolio of businesses and must allocate resources across these businesses while competing with companies that specialize in one or more of these product
lines. As a result, the company may not fund or invest in certain of its businesses to the same degree that its competitors do, and these competitors may have greater financial, technical and
marketing resources available to them than the businesses against which they compete.

Volatility of Stock Price:

The company's stock price is affected by a number of factors, including quarterly variations in
financial results, the competitive landscape, general economic and market conditions and estimates and projections by the investment community. As a result, like other technology companies, the
company's stock price is subject to significant volatility.

Dependence on and Compensation of Key Personnel:

Much of the future success of the company depends on the continued service
and availability of skilled personnel, including technical, marketing and staff positions. Experienced personnel in the information technology industry are in high demand and competition for their
talents is intense. There can be no assurance that IBM will be able to successfully retain and attract the key personnel it needs. In addition, companies in the information technology and services
industry whose employees accept positions with IBM may claim that IBM has interfered with noncompete obligations of their former employees, engaged in unfair hiring practices or that the employment of
these persons by IBM would involve the disclosure or use of trade secrets. Any such claims could limit or prevent IBM from hiring employees or cause it to incur liability for damages or substantial
costs in defending the company or its employees against these claims, whether or not they
have merit. Further, many of IBM's key personnel receive a total compensation package that includes equity awards. New regulations, volatility in the stock market and other factors could diminish the
company's use, and the value, of the company's equity awards, putting the company at a competitive disadvantage or forcing the company to use more cash compensation.

Relationships with Critical Suppliers:

IBM's business employs a wide variety of components, supplies, services and raw
materials from a substantial number of suppliers around the world. Certain of the company's businesses rely on single or limited number of suppliers, although the company makes every effort to assure
that alternative sources are available if the need arises. The failure of the company's suppliers to deliver components, supplies, services and raw materials in sufficient quantities and in a timely
manner could adversely affect the company's business.

Currency and Customer Financing Risks:

The company derives a significant percentage of its non-U.S. revenues from
its affiliates operating in local currency environments and its results are affected by changes in the relative values of non-U.S. currencies and the U.S. dollar. Further, inherent in the
company's customer financing business are risks related to the concentration of credit risk and the creditworthiness of the client, interest rate and currency fluctuations on the associated debt and
liabilities and the determination of residual values. The company employs a number of strategies to manage these risks, including the use of derivative financial instruments. Derivatives involve the
risk of non-performance by the counterparty. In addition, there can be no assurance that the company's efforts to manage these risks will be successful.

Customer Credit Risk on Trade Receivables:

The company's diversified client base includes a large number of worldwide
enterprises, from small and medium businesses to the world's largest organizations, companies and governments. Most of the company's sales are on an open credit basis


and
the company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its clients' financial conditions. The company maintains reserves that it believes are adequate to cover exposure for any uncollectible trade
receivables and regularly reviews such reserves by considering factors such as write-off history, aging analysis and any specific, known troubled accounts. Customer credit risk is
mitigated due to the large number of clients constituting the company's worldwide client base and their dispersion across many different industries and geographies. If the company becomes aware of
additional information related to the credit worthiness of a major customer, or if future actual default rates on trade receivables in general differ from those currently anticipated, the company may
have to adjust its reserves, which could affect the company's consolidated net income in the period the adjustments are made.

Distribution Channels:

The company offers its products directly and through a variety of third party distributors and
resellers. Changes in the financial or business condition of these distributors and resellers could subject the company to losses and affect its ability to bring its products to market.

Acquisitions and Alliances:

The company has made and expects to continue to make acquisitions or enter into alliances from
time to time. Acquisitions and alliances present significant challenges and risks relating to the integration of the business into the company, and there can be no assurances that the company will
manage acquisitions and alliances successfully. The related risks include the company failing to achieve strategic objectives and anticipated revenue improvements and cost savings, as well as the
failure to retain key personnel of the acquired business and the assumption of liabilities related to litigation or other legal proceedings involving the acquired business.

Risk Factors Related to IBM Securities:

The company issues debt securities in the worldwide capital markets from time to
time, with a variety of different maturities and in different currencies. The value of our debt securities fluctuates based on many factors, including changes in interest rates, the methods employed
for calculating principal and interest, the maturity of the securities, the aggregate principal amount of securities outstanding, the redemption features for the securities, the level, direction and
volatility of interest rates, changes in exchange rates, exchange controls, governmental and stock exchange regulations, and other factors over which the company has little or no control. The
company's ability to pay interest and repay the principal for its debt securities is dependent upon its ability to manage its business operations, as well as the other risks described under
Item 1A entitled "Risk Factors". There can be no assurance that the company will be able to manage any of these risks successfully.

The
company also issues its common stock from time to time in connection with various compensation plans, contributions to its pension plan and certain acquisitions. The market price of
IBM common stock is subject to significant volatility, due to factors described under Item 1A entitled "Risk Factors", including the section entitled "Volatility of Stock Price", as well as
economic and geopolitical conditions generally, trading volumes, speculation by the press or investment community about our financial condition, and other factors, many of which are beyond the
company's control. Since the market price of IBM's common stock fluctuates significantly, stockholders may not be able to sell our stock at attractive prices.

In
addition, changes by any rating agency to the company's outlook or credit ratings can negatively impact the value and liquidity of both our debt and equity securities. The company
does not make a market in either its debt or equity securities, and cannot provide any assurances with respect to the liquidity or value of such securities.

Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments:

Not applicable.


Item 2. Properties:

At December 31, 2005, IBM's manufacturing and development facilities in the United States had aggregate floor space of 22 million square feet, of
which 17 million was owned and 5 million was leased. Of these amounts, 3 million square feet was vacant and 1 million square feet was being leased to
non-IBM businesses. Similar facilities in 8 other countries totaled 9 million square feet, of which 3 million was owned and 6 million was leased. Of
these amounts, 1 million square feet was vacant and 1 million square feet was being leased to non-IBM businesses.

Although
improved production techniques, productivity gains and infrastructure reduction actions have resulted in reduced manufacturing floor space, continuous upgrading of facilities is
essential to maintain technological leadership, improve productivity, and meet customer demand.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

ON FINANCIAL STATEMENT SCHEDULE

To
the Stockholders and Board of Directors of

International Business Machines Corporation:

Our
audits of the consolidated financial statements, of management's assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting and of the effectiveness of internal
control over financial reporting referred to in our report dated February 28, 2006 appearing in the 2005 Annual Report to Shareholders of International Business Machines Corporation (which

listed in Item 15(a)(2) of this Form 10-K. In our opinion, this Financial Statement Schedule presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein when read

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

TO
THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF

INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS MACHINES CORPORATION:

We
have audited the statements of assets and liabilities of the Business Consulting Services Reporting Unit (the "Reporting Unit") (a reporting unit as defined in Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 142), of International Business Machines Corporation (the "Company") as of December 31, 2004 and the related statements of revenues and expenses (collectively,
the "statements") for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003 (not separately presented herein). These statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to
express an opinion on these statements based on our audits.

We
conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the
statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

The
statements were prepared for the purpose of complying with the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (for use by the Company in connection with its various
filings with the Commission). Certain corporate assets, liabilities and corporate expenses, that are not the responsibility of the Reporting Unit, and which have not been allocated, have been excluded
from the statements. Accordingly, these statements are not intended to be a complete presentation of the financial position or results of operations of the Reporting Unit.

In
our opinion, the statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the assets and liabilities of the Reporting Unit as of December 31, 2004 and its
revenues and expenses for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
