PART I

Item 1. Business:

International Business Machines Corporation (IBM or the company) was incorporated in the State of New York on June 16, 1911, as the
Computing-Tabulating-Recording Co. (C-T-R), a consolidation of the Computing Scale Co. of America, the Tabulating Machine Co. and The International Time Recording Co. of New
York. Since that time, IBM has focused on the intersection of business insight and technological invention, and its operations and aims have been international in nature. This was signaled over
80 years ago, in 1924, when C-T-R changed its name to International Business Machines Corporation. And it continues today: IBM is a globally integrated innovation
company, serving the needs of enterprises and institutions worldwide. To help clients achieve growth, effectiveness, efficiency and the realization of greater value through innovation, IBM draws upon
the world's leading systems, software and services capabilities.

Description of Business

IBM is a globally integrated enterprise that targets the intersection of technology and effective business. The company seeks to be a partner in its clients'
success by enabling their own capacity for distinctive innovation. To help clients achieve growth, effectiveness, efficiency and the realization of greater value through innovation, IBM draws upon the
world's leading systems, software and services capabilities.

IBM'S STRATEGY

In IBM's view, today's networked economy has created a global business landscape and a mandate for business change. Integrated global economies have opened
markets of new opportunity and new sources of skills. The Internet has enabled communication and collaboration across the world and brought with it a new computing model premised on continuous global
connection. In that landscape, companies can distribute work and technology anywhere in the world.

Given
these opportunities, IBM is working with its clients to develop new business designs and technical architectures that allow their businesses the flexibility required to compete in
this new landscape. The business is also adjusting its footprint towards emerging geographies, tapping their double-digit growth, providing the technology infrastructure they need, and taking
advantage of the talent pools they provide to better service the company's clients.

IBM's
strategy addresses this new era and delivers value to its clients through three strategic priorities:

Focus on Open Technologies and High-Value Solutions

The PC era has ended, representing a fundamental shift in the technology requirements of the company's clients. IBM is well positioned to provide its enterprise
clients the open technologies and high-value solutions they will need to compete.

•

IBM is leveraging its leadership position in the convergence of software and services, in SOA, in virtualization, in high-performance
chips, in open and modular IT—continuing its shift from commoditizing segments to higher value segments with better profit opportunity.

•

The company continues to be a leading force in open source solutions to enable its clients to achieve higher levels of interoperability, cost
efficiency and quality.


Deliver Integration and Innovation to Clients

Changes in the market have caused IBM's clients to seek flexibility and innovation in everything from technical architecture to their business model. In response,
IBM is focused on delivering integration and innovation to its clients—offering them technologies and services that support real value creation.

•

IBM has a long heritage of transforming the business operations of large enterprises and has earned the trust to be their innovation partner and
global integrator.

•

The company has a deep set of global assets and capabilities it is applying to improve services profitability, both for its clients and for
itself.

Become the Premier Globally Integrated Enterprise

As global networks and technology capabilities change business economics, legacy business designs can quickly become non-competitive. IBM believes a
globally integrated enterprise, designed for this new landscape can compete effectively and will benefit from the opportunities offered.

•

To reshape its business for the global economy, IBM has replaced vertical hierarchies with horizontally integrated teams.

•

Across the business, the company has made significant investments in emerging markets, taking core processes and functions that were once managed
regionally and shifting them to a globally integrated model.

Looking
forward, IBM is confident it understands the economic shift of globalization, the evolution of the new computing model and the powerful role of innovation in this new landscape.
Its unique
capabilities are well adapted to help the company's clients innovate and compete effectively in the new landscape.

BUSINESS SEGMENTS AND CAPABILITIES

The company's major operations comprise a Global Technology Services segment; a Global Business Services segment; a Systems and Technology segment; a Software
segment; and a Global Financing segment.


Global Services

is a critical component of the company's strategy of providing IT infrastructure and business insight and solutions to clients. While
solutions often include industry-leading IBM software and hardware, other suppliers' products are also used if a client solution requires it. Contracts for IBM services—commonly referred
to as "signings"—can range from less than one year to over ten years. Within Global Services there are two reportable segments: Global Technology Services and Global Business Services.

Global Technology Services (GTS)

segment primarily reflects IT infrastructure services and business process services, delivering value through the
company's global scale, standardization and automation.

GTS Capabilities

as well as custom and legacy applications. Delivering value through the company's global resource capabilities, industry knowledge, and the standardization and automation of application development.

Systems and Technology

segment provides IBM's clients with business solutions requiring advanced computing power and storage capabilities. Approximately
55 percent of the Systems and Technology's server and storage sales transactions are through the company's business partners; approximately 45 percent are direct to end-user
clients, more than 40 percent of which are through the
Internet at ibm.com. In addition, Systems and Technology provides leading semiconductor technology and products, packaging solutions and engineering technology services to clients and for IBM's own
advanced technology needs. While not reported as external revenue, systems hardware is also deployed to support services solutions.


Systems and Technology Capabilities

Servers.

IBM systems, which are typically connected to a network and provide the required infrastructure for business. These
systems use both IBM and non-IBM operating systems and all IBM servers can also run Linux, a key open source operating system. (System z, System i, System p,
System x and BladeCenter).

Storage.

Information infrastructure products and solutions, which address critical client requirements for information
retention and archiving, availability and virtualization, and security and compliance. The portfolio consists of a broad range of disk and tape storage systems and software.

Software

consists primarily of middleware and operating systems software. Middleware software enables clients to integrate systems, processes and
applications across a standard software platform. IBM middleware is designed to open standards which allows the efficient integration of disparate client applications that may have been built
internally, or provided by package software vendors or system integrators. Operating systems are the software engines that run computers. In addition, Software
includes Product Lifecycle Management software which primarily serves the Industrial sector. Approximately two-thirds of external software segment revenue is annuity-based, coming from
recurring license charges and on-going subscription and support from one-time charge (OTC) arrangements. The remaining one-third of external revenue relates to OTC
arrangements, in which the client pays one up-front payment for a perpetual license. Typically, arrangements for the sale of OTC software include one year of maintenance. The client can
also purchase ongoing maintenance after the first year, which includes product upgrades and technical support. While not reported as external revenue, software is also deployed to support services
solutions.

existing clients.

IBM WORLDWIDE ORGANIZATIONS

The following worldwide organizations play key roles in IBM's delivery of value to its clients:

•

Sales and Distribution Organization

•

Research, Development and Intellectual Property

•

Integrated Operations

Sales and Distribution Organization

The company's Sales and Distribution organization manages a strong global footprint, with dedicated country based operating units focused on delivering client
value. Within these units, client relationship professionals work with integrated teams of consultants, product specialists and delivery fulfillment teams to improve clients' business performance.
These teams deliver value by understanding the client's business and needs, and then bring together capabilities from across IBM and an extensive network of Business Partners to develop and implement
solutions for clients.

By
combining global expertise with local experience, IBM's geographic structure enables dedicated management focus for local clients, speed in addressing new market opportunities and
timely investments in emerging opportunities. The geographic units align industry skilled resources to serve clients' agendas. IBM extends capabilities to mid-market client segments by leveraging
industry skills with marketing, ibm.com and local Business Partner resources.

The
majority of IBM's revenue, excluding the company's original equipment manufacturer (OEM) technology business, occurs in industries that are broadly grouped into six sectors:

•

Financial Services: Banking, Financial Markets, Insurance

•

Public: Education, Government, Healthcare, Life Sciences

•

Industrial: Aerospace and Defense, Automotive, Chemical and Petroleum, Electronics

•

Distribution: Consumer Products, Retail, Travel and Transportation

•

Communications: Telecommunications, Media and Entertainment, Energy and Utilities

•

Small and Medium Business: Mainly companies with less than 1,000 employees


Research, Development and Intellectual Property

IBM's research and development (R&D) operations differentiate the company from its competitors. IBM annually spends approximately $6 billion for R&D,
focusing its investments in high-growth, high-value opportunities. In 2007, the company's investment in R&D was approximately 15 percent of its combined hardware and
software revenue. As a result of innovations in these and other areas, IBM was once again awarded more U.S. patents in 2007 than any other company. This marks the 15th year in a row that IBM achieved
this distinction.

In
addition to producing world-class hardware and software products, IBM innovations are a major differentiator in providing solutions for the company's clients through its growing
services activities. The company's investments in R&D also result in intellectual property (IP) income of approximately $1 billion annually. Some of IBM's technological breakthroughs are used
exclusively in IBM products, while others are licensed and may be used in either/both IBM products and/or the products of the licensee.

INTEGRATED OPERATIONS

IBM's ability to deliver differentiating innovation to its clients is being greatly enhanced by the company's global integration which is simultaneously giving
the company better economics and deeper capabilities, while eliminating redundancies that were built up over fifty years as a growing multinational enterprise. The company operates in 170 countries,
with approximately 69 percent of its employees outside the U.S. As a globally integrated enterprise, the company organizes work based on the right costs, the right skills and the right business
environment, integrating deeply with its partners, suppliers and clients. Being global is about gaining access to talent and skills and then scaling them globally to develop new, distinctive
capabilities. The company's integrated operations enable IBM to be the most efficient, responsive and globally integrated enterprise—able to instantly leverage its expertise and
capabilities—anywhere, at any time. Although bound by a common mission and principles, Integrated Operations is comprised of three distinct units, each with very specific objectives
closely aligned with the IBM businesses they support.

Integrated Supply Chain

Just as IBM works to transform its clients' supply chains for greater efficiency and responsiveness to global market conditions, the company continues to derive
business value from its own globally integrated supply chain, reinvented as a strategic advantage for the company to create value for clients and shareholders. IBM leverages its supply-chain expertise
for clients through its supply-chain business transformation outsourcing service to optimize and help operate clients' end-to-end supply-chain processes, from procurement to
logistics.

IBM
spends approximately $38 billion annually through its supply chain, procuring materials and services around the world. The company's supply, manufacturing and logistics and
customer fulfillment operations are integrated in one operating unit that has reduced inventories, improved response to marketplace opportunities and external risks and converted fixed to variable
costs. Simplifying and streamlining internal processes has improved operations, sales force productivity and processes, and these actions have improved client satisfaction.

Integrated Technology Delivery

Integrated Technology Delivery (ITD) brings together all of the company's worldwide service delivery capabilities for Strategic Outsourcing with strong local and
regional management teams supported by a set of global competencies. ITD leverages the company's global scale and advanced technology to deliver standardized solutions that are automated, repeatable
and globally integrated.


Through
the company's global position, clients gain cost advantages, access to industry-leading skills and access to IBM's scale and overall flexibility. ITD manages the world's largest
privately-owned IT infrastructure with employees in over 30 countries supporting over 400 data centers.

Integrated Managed Business Process Delivery

Integrated Managed Business Process Delivery (IMBPD) provides highly efficient, world class delivery capabilities in IBM's business process delivery operations,
which include Business Transformation Outsourcing, Business Process Outsourcing, Business Process Services and Application on Demand. IMBPD has employees and delivery centers in over 40 countries
worldwide.

KEY BUSINESS DRIVERS

The following are some of the key drivers of the company's business.

Economic Environment and Corporate Spending Budgets

Global demand for systems, software and services is a key driver of the company's business and financial performance. IBM's diverse set of products and offerings
is designed to provide more consistent results in both strong and weak economic environments. The company accomplishes this by not only having a mix of offerings with long-term cash and
income streams, as well as cyclical transaction-based sales, but also by continually developing competitive products and solutions and effectively managing a skilled resource base. IBM continues to
transform itself to take advantage of shifting demand trends, focusing on client- or industry-specific solutions, business performance and open standards.

Internal Business Transformation and Global Integration Initiatives

IBM is committed to its transformation to a globally integrated enterprise. The company continues to drive greater productivity, flexibility and cost savings by
transforming and globally integrating its own business processes and functions. In addition to eliminating redundancies and overhead structures to drive productivity, this integration has improved
IBM's capacity to innovate by providing greater clarity of key priorities around shared goals and objectives and led to a sharper focus for the company on learning, development and knowledge sharing.

Innovation Initiatives

IBM invests to improve its ability to help its clients innovate. Investment may occur in the research and development of new products and services, as well as in
the establishment of new collaborative and co-creation relationships with developers, other companies and other institutions. Examples include IBM's leadership positions in the design of
smaller, faster and energy-efficient semiconductor devices; systems virtualization, Green Data Centers and the design of "grid" computing networks that allow computers to share processing power.

Open Standards

The broad adoption of open standards is essential to the computing model for an on demand business and is a significant driver of collaborative innovation across
all industries. Without interoperability among all manner of computing platforms, the integration of any client's internal systems, applications and processes remains a monumental and expensive task.
The broad-based acceptance of open standards—rather than closed, proprietary architectures—also allows the computing infrastructure to more easily absorb (and thus benefit
from) new technical innovations. IBM's support of open standards is evidenced by the enabling of its products to support open standards such as Linux,


and
the development of Rational software development tools, which can be used to develop and upgrade other companies' software products.

Investing in Growth Opportunities

The company is continuing to refocus its business on the higher value segments of enterprise computing—providing technology and transformation
services to clients' businesses. Consistent with that focus, the company continues to significantly invest in growth opportunities as a way to drive revenue growth and market share gains. Areas of
investment include strategic acquisitions, primarily in software and services, focused client- and industry-specific solutions, maintaining technology leadership and emerging growth countries
worldwide.

Forward-looking and Cautionary Statements

Certain statements contained in this Form 10-K may constitute "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform
Act of 1995 ("Reform Act"). The company may also make forward-looking statements in other reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, in materials delivered to stockholders and in press
releases. In addition, the company's representatives may from time to time make oral forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements provide current expectations of future events based on

corporations, individuals and boards of directors, as well as extensive experience in corporate derivative litigation, federal and state enforcement actions and commercial litigation.


Item 1A. Risk Factors:

Economic Environment and Corporate IT Spending Budgets:

If overall demand for systems, software and services changes, whether
due to general economic conditions or a shift in corporate buying patterns, sales performance could be impacted. IBM's diverse set of products and offerings is designed to provide more consistent
results in both strong and weak economic environments. The company addresses this by not only having a mix of offerings with long-term cash and income streams, as well as cyclical
transaction-based sales, but also by continually developing competitive products and solutions and effectively managing a skilled resource base. IBM continues to transform itself to take advantage of
shifting demand trends, focusing on client or industry-specific solutions, business performance and open standards.

Internal Business Transformation and Global Integration Initiatives:

IBM continues to drive greater productivity, flexibility
and cost savings by transforming and globally integrating its own business processes and functions. In addition to eliminating redundancies and overhead structures to drive productivity, this
integration has improved IBM's capacity to innovate by providing greater clarity of key priorities around shared goals and objectives and leads to a sharper focus for the company on learning,
development and knowledge sharing. As IBM continues to drive higher levels of automation and integration into its business, IBM's dependency on internal IT systems also increases.

Innovation Initiatives:

IBM invests to improve its ability to help its clients innovate. Investment may occur in the research
and development of new products and services, as well as in the establishment of new collaborative and co-creation relationships with developers, other companies and other institutions. To
deliver value that helps clients differentiate themselves for competitive advantage, IBM has been moving away from commoditized categories of the IT industry and into areas in which it can
differentiate itself through innovation and by leveraging its investments in R&D. In the highly competitive IT industry, with large diversified competitors as well as smaller and nimble single
technology competitors, IBM's ability to continue its cutting-edge innovation is critical to maintaining and increasing market share. IBM is managing this risk by more closely linking its
R&D organization to industry-specific and client-specific needs. In addition, IBM has one of the strongest brand names in the world, and its brand and overall reputation depends in part on its ability
to continue to stand for industry-leading technology and solutions that provide business advantages.

Open Standards:

The broad adoption of open standards is essential to the computing model for on demand business and is a
significant driver of collaborative innovation across all industries. Without interoperability among all manner of computing platforms, the integration of any client's internal systems, applications
and processes remains a monumental and expensive task. The broad-based acceptance of open standards—rather than closed, proprietary architectures—also allows the computing
infrastructure to more easily absorb (and thus benefit from) new technical innovations. IBM is committed to fostering open standards because they are vital to the On Demand Operating Environment, and
because their acceptance will expand growth opportunities across the entire business services and IT industry. There are a number of competitors in the IT industry with significant resources and
investments who are committed to closed and proprietary platforms as a way to lock customers into a particular architecture. This competition may result in increased pricing pressure and/or IP claims
and proceedings.

Investing in Growth Opportunities:

The company is continuing to refocus its business on the higher-value segments of
enterprise computing—providing technology and transformation services to clients' businesses. Consistent with that focus, the company continues to significantly invest in growth
opportunities, as a way to drive revenue growth and market share gains. IBM continues to invest in dozens of emerging growth countries including Brazil, Russia, India and China. The developing nature
of emerging growth countries presents political, social and economic risks to IBM's business, including


risks
from inadequate infrastructure and labor disruptions in these countries, which could impact the company's ability to deliver to its clients around the world.

Protection of Intellectual Property:

While the company's various proprietary intellectual property rights are important to
its success, IBM believes its business as a whole is not materially dependent on any particular patent or license, or any particular group of patents or licenses. IBM owns or is licensed under a
number of patents, which vary in duration, relating to its products. Licenses under patents owned by IBM have been and are being granted to others under reasonable terms and conditions. These
protections may not prevent competitors from independently developing products and services similar to or duplicative to the company's nor can there be any assurance that these protections will
adequately deter misappropriation or improper use of the company's technology. Also, there can be no assurances that IBM will be able to obtain from third parties the licenses it needs in the future.

Data Protection:

The company's products and services, as well as its internal systems and processes, involve the storage and
transmission of proprietary information and sensitive or confidential data, including personal information of employees, customers and others. Breaches of the company's security measures could expose
the company, its customers or the individuals affected to a risk of loss or misuse of this information, resulting in litigation and potential liability for the company, as well as the loss of existing
or potential customers and damage to the company's brand and reputation. In addition, the cost and operational consequences of implementing further data protection measures could be significant.

Seasonality of Revenues and Purchases:

IBM's revenues are affected by such factors as the introduction of new products and
services, the length of the sales cycles and the seasonality of technology purchases. As a result, the company's results are difficult to predict. These factors historically have resulted in lower
revenue in the first quarter than in the immediately preceding fourth quarter. In addition, the high volume of products ordered at the end of each quarter, especially at the end of the fourth quarter,
may affect IBM's ability to successfully ship all orders before the end of the quarter.

Local Legal, Economic and Health Conditions:

The company is a globally integrated entity, operating in 170 countries
worldwide and deriving more than sixty percent of its revenues from sales outside the United States. Changes in the laws or policies of the countries in which the company operates could affect the
company's business in that country and the company's overall results of operations. The company's results of operations also could be affected by economic and political changes in those countries and
by macroeconomic changes, including recessions, inflation and currency fluctuations
between the U.S. dollar and local currency. In addition, any widespread outbreak of an illness or other health issue, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), avian influenza (bird
flu) or any other pandemic, or local or global health issues, could adversely affect the company's operations and its ability to source and deliver products and services to its customers and customer
demand.

Insurance:

The company maintains third party insurance coverage against various liability risks and risks of property loss.
While we believe these arrangements are an effective way to insure against liability and property damage risks, the potential liabilities associated with those risks or other events could exceed the
coverage provided by such arrangements.

Environmental Matters:

The company is subject to various federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations concerning
the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise related to environmental protection, including the U.S. Superfund law. The company could incur substantial costs, including cleanup costs,
fines and civil or criminal sanctions, as well as third-party claims for property damage or personal injury, if it were to violate or become liable under environmental laws and


regulations.
Compliance with environmental laws and regulations is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the company's financial position, results of operations and competitive position.

Tax Matters:

The company is subject to income taxes in both the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. IBM's
provision for income taxes and cash tax liability in the future could be adversely affected by numerous factors including, but not limited to, income before taxes being lower than anticipated in
countries with lower statutory tax rates and higher than anticipated in countries with higher statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, and changes in tax
laws, regulations, accounting principles or interpretations thereof, which could adversely impact the company's results of operations and financial condition in future periods. In addition, IBM is
subject to the continuous examination of its income tax returns by the Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities. The company regularly assesses the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting
from these examinations to determine the adequacy of its provision for income taxes. There can be no assurance that the outcomes from these continuous examinations will not have an adverse effect on
the company's provision for income taxes and cash tax liability.

Internal Controls:

Effective internal controls are necessary for the company to provide reasonable assurance with respect to
its financial reports and to effectively prevent fraud. If the company cannot provide reasonable assurance with respect to its financial reports and effectively prevent fraud, the company's operating
results could be affected. Pursuant to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, the company is required to furnish a report by management on internal control over financial reporting, including management's
assessment of the effectiveness of such control. Internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements because of its inherent limitations, including the possibility of
human error, the circumvention or overriding of controls, or fraud. Therefore, even effective internal controls can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to the preparation and fair
presentation of financial statements. In addition, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the
control may
become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. If the company fails to maintain the adequacy of its internal
controls, including any failure to implement required new or improved controls, or if the company experiences difficulties in their implementation, the company's business and operating results could
be harmed, the company could fail to meet its financial reporting obligations, and there could be a material adverse effect on the company's stock price.

Use of Estimates:

In connection with the application of generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and the preparation
of the Consolidated Financial Statements, the company uses certain estimates and assumptions, which are based on historical experience and management's knowledge of current events and actions that the
company may undertake in the future. The company's most critical accounting estimates are described in the Management Discussion on pages 47 to 49 of IBM's 2007 Annual Report to Stockholders.
In addition, as discussed in note N, "Contingencies and Commitments" on pages 94 through 96 of IBM's 2007 Annual Report to Stockholders, the company makes certain estimates under the
provisions of SFAS No. 5, "Accounting for Contingencies", including decisions related to legal proceedings and reserves. While management believes that these estimates and assumptions are
reasonable under the circumstances, by definition they involve the use of judgment and the exercise of discretion, and therefore, actual results may differ.

Competitive Conditions:

The company operates in businesses that are subject to intense competitive pressures. The company's
businesses face a significant number of competitors, ranging from some of the world's largest global enterprises to an increasing number of relatively small, rapidly growing and highly specialized
organizations. The company believes that its combination of technology, performance, quality, reliability, price and the breadth of products and service offerings are important competitive factors.
Intense competitive pressures could affect prices or demand for the company's products and services, resulting in reduced profit margins and/or loss of market opportunity. Unlike


many
of its competitors, the company has a broad set of capabilities and businesses and must allocate resources across these businesses while competing with companies that specialize in one or more of
these product lines. As a result, the company may not fund or invest in certain of its businesses to the same degree that its competitors do, and these competitors may have greater financial,
technical and marketing resources available to them than the businesses against which they compete.

Volatility of Stock Price:

The company's stock price is affected by a number of factors, including quarterly variations in
financial results, the competitive landscape, general economic and market conditions and estimates and projections by the investment community. As a result, like other technology companies, the
company's stock price is subject to significant volatility.

Dependence on Key Personnel and Reliance on Critical Skills:

Much of the future success of the company depends on the
continued service, availability and integrity of skilled personnel, including technical, marketing and staff resources. Experienced personnel in the information technology industry are in high demand
and competition for their talents is intense. Changing demographics and labor work force trends may result in a loss of knowledge and skills as experienced workers retire. In addition,
companies in the information technology and services industry whose employees accept positions with IBM may claim that IBM has interfered with noncompete obligations of their former employees, engaged
in unfair hiring practices or that the employment of these persons by IBM would involve the disclosure or use of trade secrets. Any such claims could limit or prevent IBM from hiring employees or
cause it to incur liability for damages or substantial costs in defending the company or its employees against these claims, whether or not they have merit. Further, many of IBM's key personnel
receive a total compensation package that includes equity awards. New regulations, volatility in the stock market and other factors could diminish the company's use, and the value, of the company's
equity awards, putting the company at a competitive disadvantage or forcing the company to use more cash compensation.

Relationships with Critical Suppliers:

IBM's business employs a wide variety of components, supplies, services and raw
materials from a substantial number of suppliers around the world. Certain of the company's businesses rely on single or a limited number of suppliers, although the company makes every effort to
assure that alternative sources are available if the need arises. The failure of the company's suppliers to deliver components, supplies, services and raw materials in sufficient quantities and in a
timely manner could adversely affect the company's business. In addition, any defective components, supplies or materials, or inadequate services, received from suppliers could reduce the reliability
of the company's products and services and harm the company's reputation.

Currency and Customer Financing Risks:

The company derives a significant percentage of its revenues from its affiliates
operating in local currency environments and those results are affected by changes in the relative values of non-U.S. currencies and the U.S. dollar. Further, inherent in the company's
customer financing business are risks related to the concentration of credit, client creditworthiness, interest rate and currency fluctuations on the associated debt and liabilities, the determination
of residual values, and the financing of other than traditional IT assets. The company employs a number of strategies to manage these risks, including the use of derivative financial instruments.
Derivatives involve the risk of non-performance by the counterparty. In addition, there can be no assurance that the company's efforts to manage its currency and customer financing risks
will be successful.

Customer Credit Risk on Receivables:

The company's client base includes many worldwide enterprises, from small and medium
businesses to the world's largest organizations and governments, with a significant portion of the company's revenue coming from global clients in the company's Financial Services, Public, and Small
and Medium business sectors. The company's financial performance is exposed to a wide variety of industry sector dynamics worldwide. Most of the company's sales are on an open credit basis and the
company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its clients'


financial
conditions. The company maintains reserves that it believes are adequate to cover exposure for any uncollectible receivables and regularly reviews such reserves by considering factors such
as write-off history, aging analysis and any specific, known troubled accounts. If the company becomes aware of additional information related to the credit worthiness of a major customer,
or, if future actual default rates on receivables in general differ from those currently anticipated, the company may have to adjust its reserves, which could affect the company's consolidated net
income in the period the adjustments are made.

Distribution Channels:

The company offers its products directly and through a variety of third party distributors and
resellers. Changes in the financial or business condition of these distributors and resellers could subject the company to losses and affect its ability to bring its products to market.

Acquisitions and Alliances:

The company has made and expects to continue to make acquisitions or enter into alliances from
time to time. Acquisitions and alliances present significant challenges and risks relating to the integration of the business into the company, and there can be no assurances that the company will
manage acquisitions and alliances successfully. The related risks include the company failing to achieve strategic objectives and anticipated revenue improvements and cost savings, as well as the
failure to retain key personnel of the acquired business and the assumption of liabilities related to litigation or other legal proceedings involving the acquired business.

Risk Factors Related to IBM Securities:

The company and its subsidiaries issues debt securities in the worldwide capital
markets from time to time, with a variety of different maturities and in different currencies. The value of the company's debt securities fluctuates based on many factors, including, the methods
employed for calculating principal and interest, the maturity of the securities, the aggregate principal amount of securities outstanding, the redemption features for the securities, the level,
direction and volatility of interest rates, changes in exchange rates, exchange controls, governmental and stock exchange regulations and other factors over which the company has little or no control.
The company's ability to pay interest and repay the principal for its debt securities is dependent upon its ability to manage its business operations, as well as the other risks described under this
Item 1A. entitled "Risk Factors". There can be no assurance that the company will be able to manage any of these risks successfully.

The
company also issues its common stock from time to time in connection with various compensation plans, contributions to its pension plan and certain acquisitions. The market price of
IBM common stock is subject to significant volatility, due to factors described under Item 1A. entitled "Risk Factors", including the section entitled "Volatility of Stock Price", as well as
economic and geopolitical conditions generally, trading volumes, speculation by the press or investment community about the company's financial condition, and other factors, many of which are beyond
the company's control. Since the market price of IBM's common stock fluctuates significantly, stockholders may not be able to sell the company's stock at attractive prices.

In
addition, changes by any rating agency to the company's outlook or credit ratings can negatively impact the value and liquidity of both the company's debt and equity securities. The
company does not make a market in either its debt or equity securities and cannot provide any assurances with respect to the liquidity or value of such securities.


Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments:

Not applicable.

Item 2. Properties:

At December 31, 2007, IBM's manufacturing and development facilities in the United States had aggregate floor space of 20 million square feet, of
which 16 million was owned and 4 million was leased. Of these amounts, 2 million square feet was vacant and 1 million square feet was being leased to non-IBM
businesses. Similar facilities in 8 other countries totaled 6 million square feet, of which 2 million was owned and 4 million was leased. Of these amounts, 1 million
square feet was being leased to non-IBM businesses.

Although
improved production techniques, productivity gains and infrastructure reduction actions have resulted in reduced manufacturing floor space, continuous maintenance and upgrading
of facilities is essential to maintain technological leadership, improve productivity and meet customer demand.

On
April 24, 2007, the Board of Directors authorized $15.0 billion in funds for use in the company's common stock repurchase program; the company stated that it may repurchase
shares on the open market or in private transactions, including structured or accelerated transactions, depending on market conditions. See note M "Stockholders' Equity Activity" on
pages 92 through 93 of IBM's 2007 Annual Report for additional information regarding the accelerated share repurchase agreements executed in the second quarter of 2007. The common stock
repurchase program does not have an expiration date. As discussed in note M "Stockholders' Equity Activity" on pages 92 through 93 of IBM's 2007 Annual Report, the company does not
expect the accelerated share repurchase agreements settlement periods to conclude until March 2008. On December 3, 2007, the company announced that it plans to repurchase up to
$1 billion of its outstanding common stock in open market transactions by the end of February 2008. This table does not include shares tendered to satisfy the exercise price in connection with
cashless exercises of employee stock options or shares tendered to satisfy tax withholding obligations in connection with employee equity awards.

(2)

The
remaining authorization may be used for the settlement of the accelerated share repurchase agreements or additional common stock repurchases. As discussed in note M
"Stockholders' Equity Activity" on pages 92 through 93 of IBM's 2007 Annual Report, the company elected to make a cash payment for the first and second settlements under the accelerated share
repurchase agreements in September and December 2007, resulting in a reduction of $151.8 million and $253.1 million, respectively, to the remaining authorization.

2001 LONG

—

TERM PERFORMANCE PLAN

The 2001 Long-Term Performance Plan (the "2001 Plan") is used to fund awards for employees other than senior executives of the company. Awards for
senior executives of the company will continue to be funded from the stockholder-approved 1999 Long-Term Performance Plan (the "1999 Plan"). Otherwise, the provisions of the 2001 Plan are
identical to the 1999 Plan, including the type of awards that may be granted under the plan (stock options, restricted stock unit awards and long-term performance incentive awards).

The
2001 Plan is administered by the Executive Compensation and Management Resources Committee of the Board of Directors, and that Committee may delegate to officers of the company
certain of its duties, powers and authority. Payment of awards may be made in the form of cash, stock or combinations thereof and may be deferred with Committee approval. Awards are not transferable
or assignable except (i) by law, will or the laws of descent and distribution, (ii) as a result of the disability of the recipient, or (iii) with the approval of the Committee.

If
the employment of a participant terminates, other than as a result of the death or disability of the participant, all unexercised, deferred and unpaid Awards shall be canceled
immediately, unless the Award Agreement provides otherwise. In the event of the death of a participant or in the event a participant is deemed by the company to be disabled and eligible for benefits
under the terms of the IBM Long-Term Disability Plan (or any successor plan or similar plan of another employer), the participant's estate, beneficiaries or representative, as the case may
be, shall have the rights and duties of the participant under the applicable Award Agreement. In addition, unless the Award Agreement specifies otherwise, the Committee may cancel, rescind, suspend,
withhold or otherwise limit or restrict any unexpired, unpaid, or deferred Awards at any time if the participant is not in compliance with all applicable provisions of the Award Agreement and the
Plan. In addition,
Awards are cancelled if the participant engages in any conduct or act determined to be injurious, detrimental or prejudicial to any interest of the company.

PWCC ACQUISITION LONG

—

TERM PERFORMANCE PLAN

The IBM PWCC Acquisition Long-Term Performance Plan (the "PWCC Plan") was adopted by the Board of Directors in connection with the company's
acquisition of PricewaterhouseCoopers Consulting ("PwCC") from PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, as announced on October 1, 2002. The PWCC Plan has been and will continue to be used solely to
fund awards for employees of PwCC who have come over to the company as a result of the acquisition. Awards for senior executives of the company will not be funded from the PWCC Plan. The terms and
conditions of the PWCC Plan are substantively identical to the terms and conditions of the 2001 Plan, described above.

IBM DEFERRED COMPENSATION AND EQUITY AWARD PLAN

The IBM Deferred Compensation and Equity Award Plan (the "DCEAP") was adopted in 1993. Under the DCEAP, non-management directors receive Promised Fee
Shares in connection with deferred annual retainer payments. Each Promised Fee Share is equal in value to one share of the company's common stock. Upon a director's retirement or other completion of
service as a director, all amounts deferred into Promised Fee Shares are payable in either cash and/or shares of the company's stock at the director's election. (For additional information about the
DCEAP, see 2007 Director Compensation Narrative in IBM's definitive Proxy Statement to be filed with the Securities and


Exchange
Commission and delivered to stockholders in connection with the Annual Meeting of Stockholders to be held April 29, 2008).
