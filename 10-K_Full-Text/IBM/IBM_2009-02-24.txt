PART I

Item 1. Business:

International Business Machines Corporation (IBM or the company) was incorporated in the State of New York on June 16, 1911, as
the Computing-Tabulating-Recording Co. (C-T-R), a consolidation of the Computing Scale Co. of America, the Tabulating Machine Co. and The International Time Recording Co. of
New York. Since that time, IBM has focused on the intersection of business insight and technological invention, and its operations and aims have been international in nature. This was signaled over 80
years ago, in 1924, when C-T-R changed its name to International Business Machines Corporation. And it continues today: The company creates business value for clients and solves business problems
through integrated solutions that leverage information technology and deep knowledge of business processes. IBM solutions typically create value by reducing a client's operational costs or by enabling
new capabilities that generate revenue. These solutions draw from an industry leading portfolio of consulting, delivery and implementation services, enterprise software, systems and financing.

STRATEGY

In IBM's view, today's networked economy has created a global business landscape and a mandate for business change. It also opens the
opportunity to upgrade the efficiency and effectiveness of the global infrastructure through embedded information technology—what IBM calls a "smarter planet." Smart airports, smart
highways, smart supply chains are all possible. IBM is working with clients and governments around the world to explore these opportunities and implement new ideas.

Integrated
global economies have opened markets of new opportunity and new sources of skills. The Internet has enabled communication and collaboration across the world and brought with
it a new computing model premised on continuous global connection. In that landscape, companies can distribute work and technology anywhere in the world. IBM continues to adjust its footprint toward
emerging geographies, tapping their higher growth, providing the technology infrastructure they need and taking advantage of the talent pools they provide to better service the company's clients.

At
the same time, the current economic crisis increases the pressure on both businesses and governments around the world to adapt. The needs for additional transparency, security and
efficiencies are clear.

Given
these opportunities and economic challenges, IBM is working with its clients to develop new business designs and technical architectures that allow their businesses the flexibility
required to compete in this new landscape. IBM's strategy addresses this new era and delivers value to its clients through three strategic priorities:

Focus on Open Technologies and High-Value Solutions

A new computing model has emerged, replacing the PC-based, client/server approach. This new model is networked, modular, open and
represents a fundamental shift in the technology requirements of the company's clients. IBM is well positioned to provide its enterprise clients the open technologies and high-value
solutions they will need to compete.

•

IBM is leveraging its leadership position in the convergence of software and services, in service oriented architecture
(SOA), in virtualization, business intelligence and analytics, in open and modular information technology (IT)—continuing its shift from commoditizing segments to higher value segments
with better profit opportunity.

•

The company continues to be a leading force in open source solutions to enable its clients to achieve higher levels of
interoperability, cost efficiency and quality.


Deliver Integration and Innovation to Clients

Changes in the market have caused IBM's clients to seek flexibility and innovation in everything from technical architecture to their
business model. In response, IBM is focused on delivering integration and innovation to its clients—offering them technologies and services that support real value creation.

•

IBM has a long heritage of transforming the business operations of large enterprises and has earned the trust to be their
innovation partner and global integrator.

•

The company has an extensive set of global assets and capabilities it is applying to improve services profitability, both
for its clients and for itself.

Become the Premier Globally Integrated Enterprise

As global networks and technology capabilities change business economics, legacy business designs can quickly become noncompetitive.
IBM believes a globally-integrated enterprise, designed for this new landscape, can compete effectively and will benefit from the opportunities offered.

•

To reshape its business for the global economy, IBM has replaced vertical hierarchies with horizontally integrated teams.

•

Across the business, the company has made significant investments in emerging markets, taking core processes and functions
that were once managed regionally and shifting them to a globally integrated model.

Looking
forward, IBM is confident it understands the economic shift of globalization, the evolution of the new computing model and the powerful role of innovation in this new landscape.
Its unique capabilities are well adapted to help the company's clients innovate and compete effectively in this new environment.

BUSINESS MODEL

The company's business model is built to support two principal goals: helping clients succeed in delivering business value by becoming
more innovative, efficient and competitive through the use of business insight and IT solutions; and, providing long-term value to shareholders. The business model has been developed over
time through strategic investments in capabilities and technologies that have the best long-term growth and profitability prospects based on the value they deliver to clients.

The
company's global capabilities include services, software, hardware, fundamental research and related financing. The broad mix of businesses and capabilities are combined to provide
business insight and solutions for the company's clients.

The
business model is flexible, adapting to the continuously changing market and economic environment. The company has divested commoditizing businesses like personal computers and hard
disk drives, and strengthened its position through strategic investments and acquisitions in higher value segments like business intelligence and analytics, virtualization and green solutions. In
addition, the company has transformed itself into a globally integrated enterprise which has improved overall productivity and is driving investment and participation in the world's fastest growing
markets. As a result, the company is a higher performing enterprise today than it was several years ago.

The
business model, supported by the company's long-term financial model, has enabled the company to deliver consistently strong earnings, cash flows and returns on invested
capital in changing economic environments.

BUSINESS SEGMENTS AND CAPABILITIES

The company's major operations are comprised of: a Global Technology Services segment; a Global Business Services segment; a Software
segment; a Systems and Technology segment; and a Global Financing segment.


Global Services

is a critical component of the company's strategy of providing IT infrastructure and business insight and solutions to clients. While
solutions often include industry-leading IBM software and hardware, other suppliers' products are also used if a client solution requires it. Within Global Services there are two reportable segments:
Global Technology Services and Global Business Services.

Global Technology Services (GTS)

primarily provides IT infrastructure services and business process services, delivering business value through the
company's global scale, standardization and automation.

GTS Capabilities

Strategic Outsourcing Services.

Comprehensive IT services integrated with business insight working with clients to reduce costs and
improve productivity through the outsourcing of processes and operations.

Integrated Technology Services.

Services offerings that help clients access, manage and support their technology infrastructures, through
a combination of skilled resources, software and IBM's knowledge of business processes. The portfolio includes Service Product Lines which complement hardware from Systems and Technology and software
offerings from the Software business.

Business Transformation Outsourcing.

A range of offerings from standardized processing platforms and Business Process Outsourcing through
transformational offerings that deliver improved business results to clients through the strategic change and/or operation of the client's business processes, applications and infrastructure.

Maintenance.

clients' IT infrastructure.

Global Business Services (GBS)

primarily provides professional services and application outsourcing services, delivering business value and innovation
to clients through solutions which leverage industry-and business-process expertise.

GBS Capabilities

Consulting and Systems Integration.

Delivery of value to clients through consulting services for client relationship management, financial
management, human-capital management, business strategy and change, and supply-chain management.

Application Management Services.

Application development, management, maintenance and support services for packaged software, as well as
custom and legacy applications. Value is delivered through the company's global resource capabilities, industry knowledge and the standardization and automation of application development.

Software

consists primarily of middleware and operating systems software. Middleware software enables clients to integrate systems, processes and
applications across a standard software platform. IBM middleware is designed to open standards which allows the efficient integration of disparate client applications that may have been built
internally, or provided by packaged software vendors or system integrators. Operating systems are the software engines that run computers. Approximately two-thirds of external software
segment revenue is annuity-based, coming from recurring license charges and ongoing subscription and support from one-time charge (OTC) arrangements. The remaining one-third of
external revenue relates to OTC arrangements, in which the client pays one up-front payment for a perpetual license. Typically, arrangements for the sale of OTC software include one year
of maintenance. The client can also purchase ongoing maintenance after the first year, which includes product upgrades and technical support.


Software Capabilities

WebSphere Software.

Management of a wide variety of business processes using open standards to interconnect applications, data and
operating systems. Provides the foundation for Web-enabled applications and is a key product set in deploying a SOA.

Information Management Software.

IBM WORLDWIDE ORGANIZATIONS

The following worldwide organizations play key roles in IBM's delivery of value to its clients:

•

Sales and Distribution


•

Research, Development and Intellectual Property

•

Integrated Supply Chain

•

Integrated Technology Delivery

•

Business Process Delivery

Sales and Distribution

IBM has a significant global presence, operating in over 170 countries, with an increasingly broad-based geographic distribution of
revenue. The company's Sales and Distribution organization manages a strong global footprint, with dedicated country based operating units focused on delivering client value. Within these units,
client relationship professionals work with integrated teams of consultants, product specialists and delivery fulfillment teams to improve clients'
business performance. These teams deliver value by understanding the clients' business and needs, and then bring together capabilities from across IBM and an extensive network of Business Partners to
develop and implement solutions.

By
combining global expertise with local experience, IBM's geographic structure enables dedicated management focus for local clients, speed in addressing new market opportunities and
timely investments in emerging opportunities. The geographic units align industry-skilled resources to serve clients' agendas. IBM extends capabilities to mid-market client segments by
leveraging industry skills with marketing, ibm.com and local Business Partner resources.

In
2008, the company implemented a new growth markets organization to increase its focus on the emerging markets of Brazil, Russia, India and China and the additional opportunities
around the world that have market growth rates greater than the global average—countries within Southeast Asia, Eastern Europe, the Middle East and Latin America. The company's major
markets include the United States, Canada, the U.K., France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Denmark, Sweden, Switzerland, Austria, Belgium, Finland, Greece, Ireland, the Netherlands, Portugal, Cyprus, Norway,
Israel, Spain, the Bahamas and the Caribbean region.

The
majority of IBM's revenue, excluding the company's original equipment manufacturer (OEM) technology business, occurs in industries that are broadly grouped into six
sectors:

•

Financial Services: Banking, Financial Markets, Insurance

•

Public: Education, Government, Healthcare, Life Sciences

•

Industrial: Aerospace and Defense, Automotive, Chemical and Petroleum, Electronics

•

Distribution: Consumer Products, Retail, Travel and Transportation

•

Communications: Telecommunications, Media and Entertainment, Energy and Utilities

•

Small and Medium Business: Mainly companies with less than 1,000 employees

Research, Development and Intellectual Property

IBM's research and development (R&D) operations differentiate the company from its competitors. IBM annually spends approximately
$6 billion for R&D, focusing its investments on high-growth, high-value opportunities. As a result of innovations in these and other areas, IBM was once again awarded
more U.S. patents in 2008 than any other company, the first company to achieve over 4,000 patents in a year. The company will continue to actively seek intellectual property protection for its
innovations, while increasing emphasis on other initiatives designed to leverage its intellectual property leadership and promote innovation.


In
addition to producing world-class hardware and software products, IBM innovations are also a major differentiator in providing solutions for the company's clients through its services
businesses. The company's investments in R&D also result in intellectual property (IP) income of approximately $1 billion annually. Some of IBM's technological breakthroughs are used
exclusively in IBM products, while others are licensed and may be used in either/both IBM products and/or the products of the licensee. While the company's various proprietary intellectual property
rights are important to its success, IBM believes its business as a whole is not materially dependent on any particular patent or license, or any particular group of patents or licenses. IBM owns or
is licensed under a number of patents, which vary in duration, relating to its products. Licenses under patents owned by IBM have been and are being granted to others under reasonable terms and
conditions.

Integrated Supply Chain

Consistent with the company's work with clients to transform their supply chains for greater efficiency and responsiveness to global
market conditions, the company continues to derive business value from its own globally integrated supply chain, which provides a strategic advantage for the company to create value for clients. IBM
leverages its supply chain expertise for clients through its supply-chain business transformation outsourcing service to optimize and help operate clients' end-to-end
supply-chain processes, from procurement to logistics.

IBM
spends approximately $38 billion annually through its supply chain, procuring materials and services globally. The supply, manufacturing and logistics and customer fulfillment
operations are integrated in one operating unit that has optimized inventories over time, improved response to marketplace opportunities and external risks and converted fixed costs to variable costs.
Simplifying and streamlining internal processes has improved operations, sales force productivity and processes, and these actions have improved client satisfaction.

Integrated Technology Delivery

Integrated Technology Delivery (ITD) combines all of the worldwide service delivery capabilities for Strategic Outsourcing with strong
local and regional management teams supported by a set of global competencies. ITD leverages the company's global scale and advanced technology to deliver standardized solutions that are automated,
repeatable and globally integrated. Clients gain cost advantages, access to industry-leading skills and IBM's scale and overall flexibility. ITD manages the world's largest privately-owned IT
infrastructure with employees in over 40 countries supporting over 450 data centers.

Business Process Delivery

Business Process Delivery (BPD) provides highly efficient, world-class delivery capabilities in IBM's business process delivery
operations, which include Business Transformation Outsourcing, Business Process Outsourcing and Business Process Services. BPD has employees and delivery centers in over 40 countries worldwide.

COMPETITION

The company is a globally-integrated enterprise, doing business in over 170 countries. The company participates in the highly
competitive information technology (IT) industry, where its competitors vary by industry segment, and range from large multinational enterprises to smaller, more narrowly focused entities. Overall,
across its business segments, the company recognizes hundreds of competitors worldwide.

The
markets for each of the company's business segments is characterized by aggressive competition among all types of competitors. Across its business, the company's principal methods of


competition
are: technology innovation; performance; price; quality; brand; its broad range of capabilities, products and services; client relationships; the ability to deliver business value to
clients; and, service and support. In order to maintain leadership in the IT industry, a corporation must continue to invest, innovate and integrate. Over the past several years, the company has been
executing a strategy to transform its business, including shifting to higher value market segments and offerings and increasing its capabilities through internal investments and strategic
acquisitions. Overall, the company is the leader or among the leaders in each of its business segments.

A
summary of the competitive environment for each business segment is included below:

Global Services:

The company's services segments, GTS and GBS, operate in a highly competitive and continually evolving global market. GTS competes in
strategic outsourcing, business transformation outsourcing, integrated technology services and IT support services. GBS competes in consulting, system integration and application management services.
The principal competitive factors in these business segments include: technical skills and capabilities, innovative service and product offerings, the ability to add value and the
time-to-value, price, client relationships, quality of sales and delivery, reliability, security and the availability of resources. The company's competitive advantages in the
services business include its global reach and scale, best-of-breed process and industry skills, extensive technology expertise and infrastructure management, an ability to
deliver integrated solutions that can address clients' needs in any environment and a strong set of relationships with clients and strategic business partners worldwide. GTS competes with a variety of
competitors worldwide across its principal market segments: the global, broad based competitors are Hewlett-Packard Company (HP), Accenture and Computer
Sciences Corporation. Indian service providers, including Satyam Computer Services Ltd. and Wipro Technologies (Wipro), are moving to offer managed infrastructure services, targeting similar customer
segments to GTS. The principal competitors for GBS are Accenture, Infosys Consulting and Wipro.

Software:

The enterprise management software market is highly competitive and the key competitive factors in this segment include: functionality,
ease of use, scalability, compliance with open standards and total cost of ownership. The company's leadership in these areas provides it with competitive advantages. The company's software business
includes middleware, operating systems and related software provided to all industry segments worldwide. The middleware portfolio is the broadest in the industry and it also covers both mainframe and
distributed computing environments. The depth and breadth of the company's software offerings, coupled with its global sales and technical support infrastructure differentiate the company's software
business from its competitors. In addition, the company's research and development capabilities and intellectual property patent portfolio contribute to this segment's leadership. The company's
principal competitors in this segment include Oracle Corporation, Microsoft Corporation, EMC and CA, Inc. In addition, the company competes with smaller, niche competitors in specific
geographic or product markets worldwide.

Systems and Technology:

The enterprise server and storage market is highly competitive and is characterized by ongoing technology innovation, with competition
focused on value, function and reliability, and new entrants leveraging technology to compete against traditional offerings. The company's principal competitors include HP, Dell, Inc. (Dell),
Sun Microsystems and EMC Corporation. The company's leadership in virtualization, power management, security, multi-operating system capabilities and the ability of its systems platforms to leverage
the entire system, from the company's custom semiconductors through the software stack to increase efficiency and lower cost, provide the company with competitive


advantages
in this segment. In addition, the company's research and development capabilities and intellectual property patent portfolio contribute significantly to this segment's leadership.

Global Financing:

The company's Global Financing business provides client financing, commercial financing and participates in the remarketing of used
equipment. In 2008, the global financial credit crisis impacted both the client and commercial financing markets. The supply of credit diminished and financial institutions faced increases in loan
losses, higher borrowing costs and liquidity challenges. Global Financing's access to capital and its ability to manage increased exposures provide a competitive advantage for the company. The key
competitive factors include price, client service, contract flexibility, ease of doing business and residual values. In client and commercial financing, Global Financing competes with three types of
companies: other captive financing companies such as HP and Dell, non-captive companies such as General Electric Company and CIT Group, Inc. and banks or financial institutions. In
the remarketing segment, the company competes with local and regional brokers plus original manufacturers the fragmented worldwide used IT equipment market.

Item 1A. Risk Factors:

Downturn in Economic Environment and Corporate IT Spending Budgets could impact the Company's Business:

If overall demand for systems,
software and services decreases, whether due to general economic conditions or a shift in corporate buying patterns, the company's revenue and profit could be impacted.

The Company may not meet its Growth and Productivity Objectives under its Internal Business Transformation and Global Integration
Initiatives:

On an ongoing basis, IBM seeks to drive greater productivity, flexibility and cost savings by transforming and globally integrating its own business processes and
functions to remain competitive and to enable scaling of resources in both emerging and
more established geographical markets. These efforts may not yield their intended gains in overall efficiency and enablement of rapid scaling, which may impact the company's ability to meet its growth
and productivity objectives.

Failure of Innovation Initiatives could impact the Long-Term Success of the Company:

IBM has been moving away from
commoditized categories of the IT industry and into areas in which it can differentiate itself through innovation and by leveraging its investments in R&D. If IBM is unable to continue its
cutting-edge innovation in the highly competitive IT industry, the company could fail in its ongoing efforts to maintain and increase its market share and its profit margins. In addition,
IBM has one of the strongest brand names in the world, and its brand and overall reputation could be negatively impacted by many factors, including if the company does not continue to be recognized
for its industry-leading technology and solutions. If the company's brand image is tarnished by negative perceptions, our ability to attract and retain customers could be impacted.

Risks from Investing in Growth Opportunities could impact the Company's Business:

The company continues to invest significantly in growth
opportunities, including higher-value segments of enterprise computing and dozens of emerging countries, including Brazil, Russia, India and China, to drive revenue growth and market share gains.
Client adoption rates and viable economic models are uncertain in the high-value and rapidly-growing segments. In addition, as the company expands to capture emerging growth opportunities,
it needs to rapidly secure the appropriate mix of trained, skilled and experienced personnel. In emerging growth countries, the developing nature presents potential political, social and economic
risks from inadequate infrastructure, creditworthiness of customers and business partners, labor disruption and corruption, which could impact the company's ability to meet its growth objectives and
to deliver to its clients around the world.

IBM's Intellectual Property Portfolio may not prevent Competitive Offerings, and IBM may not be able to Obtain Necessary Licenses:

The
company's patents and other intellectual property may not prevent competitors from independently developing products and services similar to or duplicative to the company's, nor can there be any
assurance that the resources invested by the company to protect its intellectual property will be sufficient or that the company's intellectual property portfolio will adequately deter
misappropriation or improper use of the company's technology. In addition, the company may be the target of aggressive and opportunistic enforcement of patents by third parties, including
non-practicing entities. Also, there can be no assurances that IBM will be able to obtain from third parties the licenses it needs in the future.

Breaches of Data Protection could impact the Company's Business:

The company's products and services, as well as its internal systems and
processes, involve the storage and transmission of proprietary information and sensitive or confidential data, including personal information of employees, customers and others. Breaches in security
could expose the company, its customers or the individuals affected to a risk of loss or misuse of this information, resulting in litigation and potential liability for the company, as well as the
loss of existing or potential customers and damage to the company's brand and reputation. In addition, the cost and operational consequences of implementing further data protection measures could be
significant.


The Company's Revenues for Particular Periods are Difficult to Predict:

IBM's revenues are affected by such factors as the introduction of
new products and services, the length of the sales cycles, the structure of products and services contracts and the seasonality of technology purchases. As a result, the company's results are
difficult to predict. These factors historically have resulted in lower revenue in the first quarter than in the immediately preceding fourth quarter. In addition, the high volume of products ordered
at the end of each quarter, especially at the end of the fourth quarter, may affect IBM's ability to successfully ship all orders before the end of the quarter.

Due to the Company's Global Presence, its Business and Operations could be impacted by Local Legal, Economic, Political and Health
Conditions:

The company is a globally integrated entity, operating in over 170 countries worldwide and deriving more than sixty percent of its revenues from sales outside the
United States. Changes in the laws or policies of the countries in which the company operates, or inadequate enforcement of such laws or policies, could affect the company's business in that country
and the company's overall results of operations. The company's results of operations also could be affected by economic and political changes in those countries and by macroeconomic changes, including
recessions, inflation and currency fluctuations between the U.S. dollar and local currency. In addition, any widespread outbreak of an illness, pandemic or other local or global health issue, or any
terrorist activities, could adversely affect customer demand and the company's operations and its ability to source and deliver products and services to its customers.

The Company could incur Substantial Costs for Environmental Matters:

The company is subject to various federal, state, local and foreign
laws and regulations concerning the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise related to environmental protection, including the U.S. Superfund law. The company could incur substantial
costs, including cleanup costs, fines and civil or criminal sanctions, as well as third-party claims for property damage or personal injury, if it were to violate or become liable under environmental
laws and regulations. Compliance with environmental laws and regulations is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the company's financial position, results of operations and competitive
position.

Tax Matters could impact the Company's Results of Operations and Financial Condition:

The company is subject to income taxes in both the
United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. IBM's provision for income taxes and cash tax liability in the future could be adversely affected by numerous factors including, but not limited to,
income before taxes being lower than anticipated in countries with lower statutory tax rates and higher than anticipated in countries with higher statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of
deferred tax assets and liabilities, and changes in tax laws, regulations, accounting principles or interpretations thereof, which could adversely impact the company's results of operations and
financial condition in future periods. In addition, IBM is subject to the continuous examination of its income tax returns by the Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities. The company
regularly assesses the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of its provision for income taxes. There can be no assurance that the outcomes from
these continuous examinations will not have an adverse effect on the company's provision for income taxes and cash tax liability.

The Company's Results of Operations and Financial Condition could be negatively impacted by its U.S. and non-U.S. Pension
Plans:

Adverse equity market conditions and volatility in the credit markets may have an unfavorable impact on the value of the company's pension trust assets and its future
estimated pension liabilities. As a result, the company's financial results in any period could be negatively impacted. In addition, in a period of an extended financial market downturn, the company
could be required to provide incremental pension plan funding with resulting liquidity risk which could negatively impact the company's financial flexibility. IBM's 2008 Annual Report to Stockholders
includes information about potential impacts from pension funding and the use of certain assumptions regarding pension matters.


Ineffective Internal Controls could impact the Company's Business and Operating Results:

The company's internal control over financial
reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements because of its inherent limitations, including the possibility of human error, the circumvention or overriding of controls, or fraud. Even effective
internal controls can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements. If the company fails to maintain the adequacy of its internal
controls, including any failure to implement required new or improved controls, or if the company experiences difficulties in their implementation, the company's business and operating results could
be harmed and the company could fail to meet its financial reporting obligations.

The Company's Use of Accounting Estimates involves Judgment and could impact the Company's Financial Results:

The company's most critical
accounting estimates are described in the Management Discussion in IBM's 2008 Annual Report to Stockholders, under "Critical Accounting Estimates." In addition, as discussed in note O,
"Contingencies and Commitments" in IBM's 2008 Annual Report to Stockholders, the company makes certain estimates under the provisions of SFAS No. 5, "Accounting for Contingencies," including
decisions related to legal proceedings and reserves. Because by definition these estimates and assumptions involve the use of judgment, actual financial results may differ.

Competitive Conditions:

The company operates in businesses that are subject to intense competitive pressures (see discussion about
competition in Item 1. Business above).

The Company Depends on Skilled Personnel and could be impacted by the loss of Critical Skills:

Much of the future success of the company
depends on the continued service, availability and integrity of skilled personnel, including technical, marketing and staff resources. Experienced personnel in the information
technology industry are in high demand, and competition for their talents is intense. Changing demographics and labor work force trends may result in a loss of knowledge and skills as experienced
workers retire. Further, many of IBM's key personnel receive a total compensation package that includes equity awards. New regulations, volatility in the stock market and other factors could diminish
the company's use, and the value, of the company's equity awards, putting the company at a competitive disadvantage or forcing the company to use more cash compensation.

The Company's Business could be impacted by its Relationships with Critical Suppliers:

IBM's business employs a wide variety of
components, supplies, services and raw materials from a substantial number of suppliers around the world. Certain of the company's businesses rely on single or a limited number of suppliers. Changes
in the financial or business condition of these suppliers could subject the company to losses and affect its ability to bring products to market. Further, the failure of the company's suppliers to
deliver components, supplies, services and raw materials in sufficient quantities and in a timely manner could adversely affect the company's business. In addition, any defective components, supplies
or materials, or inadequate services, received from suppliers could reduce the reliability of the company's products and services and harm the company's reputation.

The Company is exposed to Currency and Customer Financing Risks that could impact its Revenue and Business:

The company derives a
significant percentage of its revenues from its affiliates operating in local currency environments, and those results are affected by changes in the relative values of non-U.S. currencies
and the U.S. dollar. Further, inherent in the company's customer financing business are risks related to the concentration of credit, client creditworthiness, interest rate and currency fluctuations
on the associated debt and liabilities, the determination of residual values and the financing of other than traditional IT assets. The company employs a number of strategies to manage these risks,
including the use of derivative financial instruments; derivatives involve the risk of non-performance by the counterparty. In addition, there can be no assurance that the company's
efforts to manage its currency and customer financing risks will be successful.

The Company's Financial Performance could be impacted by Changes in Market Liquidity Conditions and by Customer Credit Risk on
Receivables:

The company's financial performance is exposed to a wide


variety
of industry sector dynamics worldwide. The company's earnings and cash flows, as well as its access to funding, could be negatively impacted by changes in market liquidity conditions. IBM's
2008 Annual Report to Stockholders includes information about the company's liquidity position. The company's client base includes many worldwide enterprises, from small and medium businesses to the
world's largest organizations and governments, with a significant portion of the company's revenue coming from global clients across many sectors. Most of the company's sales are on an open credit
basis and the company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its clients' financial conditions. If the company becomes aware of information related to the credit worthiness of a major customer, or, if
future actual default rates on receivables in general differ from those currently anticipated, the company may have to adjust its reserves for uncollectible receivables, which could affect the
company's consolidated net income in the period the adjustments are made.

The Company's Reliance on Third Party Distribution Channels could impact its Business:

The company offers its products directly and
through a variety of third party distributors and resellers. Changes in the financial or business condition of these distributors and resellers could subject the company to losses and affect its
ability to bring its products to market.

Risks to the Company from Acquisitions and Alliances include Integration Challenges, Failure to Achieve Objectives, and the Assumption of
Liabilities:

The company has made and expects to continue to make acquisitions or enter into alliances from time to time. Acquisitions and alliances present significant
challenges and risks relating to the integration of the business into the company, and there can be no assurances that the company will manage acquisitions and alliances successfully. The related
risks include the company failing to achieve strategic objectives and anticipated revenue improvements and cost savings, as well as the failure to retain key personnel of the acquired business and the
assumption of liabilities related to litigation or other legal proceedings involving the acquired business.

Risk Factors Related to IBM Securities:

The company and its subsidiaries issue debt securities in the worldwide capital markets from time
to time, with a variety of different maturities and in different currencies. The value of the company's debt securities fluctuates based on many factors, including the methods employed for calculating
principal and interest, the maturity of the securities, the aggregate principal amount of securities outstanding, the redemption features for the securities, the level, direction and volatility of
interest rates, changes in exchange rates, exchange controls, governmental and stock exchange regulations and other factors over which the company has little or no control. The company's ability to
pay interest and repay the principal for its debt securities is dependent upon its ability to manage its business operations, as well as the other risks described under this Item 1A. entitled
"Risk Factors." There can be no assurance that the company will be able to manage any of these risks successfully.

The
company also issues its common stock from time to time in connection with various compensation plans, contributions to its pension plan and certain acquisitions. The market price of
IBM common stock is subject to significant volatility, due to other factors described under this Item 1A. entitled "Risk Factors," as well as economic and geopolitical conditions generally,
trading volumes, speculation by the press or investment community about the company's financial condition, and other factors, many of which are beyond the company's control. Since the market price of
IBM's common stock fluctuates significantly, stockholders may not be able to sell the company's stock at attractive prices.

In
addition, changes by any rating agency to the company's outlook or credit ratings can negatively impact the value and liquidity of both the company's debt and equity securities. The
company does not make a market in either its debt or equity securities and cannot provide any assurances with respect to the liquidity or value of such securities.


Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments:

Not applicable.

Item 2. Properties:

At December 31, 2008, IBM's manufacturing and development facilities in the United States had aggregate floor space of
19 million square feet, of which 15 million was owned and 4 million was leased. Of these amounts, 2 million square feet was vacant and 1 million square feet was
being leased to non-IBM businesses. Similar facilities in 8 other countries totaled 6 million square feet, of which 2 million was owned and 4 million was
leased. Of these amounts, 1 million square feet was being leased to non-IBM businesses.

Although
improved production techniques, productivity gains and infrastructure reduction actions have resulted in reduced manufacturing floor space, continuous maintenance and upgrading
of facilities is essential to maintain technological leadership, improve productivity and meet customer demand.
