History
and Development of the Company

Willis Group Holdings is the ultimate
holding company for the Group. We trace our history to 1828 and are one of the
largest insurance brokers in the world.

Willis Group Holdings was incorporated in
Bermuda on February 8, 2001 as an exempted company under the Companies
Act, for the sole purpose of redomiciling the ultimate parent company of the
Willis Group (comprised of TA I Limited (“TA I”) and subsidiaries) from
the United Kingdom to Bermuda. On incorporation Willis Group Holdings was
wholly-owned by Profit Sharing (Overseas), Limited Partnership, an
affiliate of Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. L.P. (“KKR”), and one of
the existing shareholders of TA I.

Effective May 8, 2001, Willis Group
Holdings exchanged its Shares for all the issued and outstanding ordinary
shares of TA I and exchanged one of its non-voting management common
shares for each outstanding non-voting management ordinary share of TA I
which converted into voting shares on consummation of the Willis Group Holdings’
initial public offering. In addition, all management ordinary stock options of
TA I were rolled over into identical stock options of Willis Group Holdings. As
a consequence TA I became a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company.

Willis Group Holdings completed an initial
public offering of approximately 16% of its Shares in June 2001. Following
a series of five secondary public offerings between November 2001 and November 2005,
KKR ceased to be a shareholder in the Company.

For administrative convenience, we utilize
the offices of a subsidiary company as our principal executive offices. The
address is:

Willis Group Holdings Limited

c/o Willis Group Limited

England

Tel: +44 207 488 8111

For several years, we have focussed on our
core retail and specialist broking operations and part of this overall strategy
includes divesting non-core business interests. In recent years, we have made a
number of acquisitions around the world and have increased our ownership in
several of our associates which were not wholly-owned where doing so
strengthened our retail network and our specialty businesses.

In 2006 we
acquired Link Forsikringsmegling AS, a Norwegian insurance broker, Nicon
Försäkringsmäklarna AB, a Swedish insurance broker; the reinsurance
consultants and intermediaries division of Glenrand MIB Limited of South
Africa; International Insurance Brokers, Inc. and Eyl & Gordon Insurance
Brokers, Inc., both US insurance brokers and MGT Corredores de Seguros SA,
a Chilean insurance broker. We also acquired a further 5% of Gras Savoye &
Cie, our French Associate, increasing our holding to 38%.

General

We provide a broad range of insurance
brokerage, reinsurance and risk management consulting services to our worldwide
clients. We have significant market positions in the United States, in the
United Kingdom and, directly and through our associates, in many other
countries. We are a recognized leader in providing specialized risk management
advisory and other services on a global basis to clients in various industries
including the aerospace, marine, construction and energy industries.

In our capacity as an advisor and insurance
broker, we act as an intermediary between our clients and insurance carriers by
advising our clients on their risk management requirements, helping clients
determine the best means of managing risk, and negotiating and placing
insurance risk with insurance carriers through our global distribution network.

We assist clients in the assessment of
their risks, advise on the best ways of transferring suitable risk to the
global insurance and reinsurance markets and then execute the transactions at
the most appropriate available price, terms and conditions for our clients. Our
global distribution network enables us to place the risk in the most
appropriate insurance or reinsurance market worldwide. We also offer clients a
broad range of services to help them to identify and control their risks. These
services range from strategic risk consulting (including providing actuarial
analyses), to a variety of due diligence services to the provision of practical
on-site risk control services (such as health and safety or property loss
control consulting). We also assist clients in planning how to manage incidents
or crises when they occur. These services include contingency planning,
security audits and product tampering plans. We are not an insurance company
and therefore we do not underwrite insurance risks for our own account.

We and our
associates serve a diverse base of clients located in approximately 190
countries. These clients include major multinational and middle-market
companies in a variety of industries, as well as public institutions and individual
clients. Many of our client relationships span decades. With approximately
16,000 employees around the world and a network of about 300 offices in some
100 countries, in each case including our associates, we believe we are
one of only a few insurance brokers in the world possessing the global
operating presence, broad product expertise and extensive distribution network
necessary to meet effectively the global risk management needs of many of our
clients.

Business
Strategy

Our strategic
objectives are to continue to grow revenues, cash flow and earnings and to
enhance our position as one of the largest global providers of risk management
services. We will build on our areas of


strength
and eliminate areas in which we do not see the opportunities for strong
profitable growth. The key elements of this strategy are to capitalize on a
strong global franchise, emphasize our value-added services, focus on
cross-selling our services, increase operating efficiencies, implement
global best practices and create a single company culture. We also pursue
strategic acquisitions and investments to strengthen our global franchise.

Shaping
Our Future

Shaping Our Future, our
strategy introduced in 2006, aims to deliver strong revenue and profit growth
over the next several years. Our vision is that Willis will deliver breakout
growth and performance through achieving leadership in our core businesses and
delivering the best value to our clients through our distribution network. We
are focused on businesses where our unique expertise allows us to deliver
superior advice, products and services. We expect to increase the strength in
our structure and framework which will enable Willis to drive forward. The
execution of our strategy will focus on driving revenue growth, creating the
optimal platform, becoming the employer of choice and meeting our financial
goals for 2010.

We expect to drive revenue growth by creating the most appropriate fee
and commission structure, enhancing our sales process and fully implementing
our Client Advocacy program. We expect to create the optimal platform by
enhancing our service model, processes and technology. We are becoming the
employer of choice by creating a clear path of career development for our
people and a reward and recognition framework that recognizes team work. We
anticipate that we will attain our financial goals by further controlling our
expenses, focusing on client profitability and enhancing our capital
structure.  Specifically, by 2010 we
expect salaries and benefits as a percentage of revenues to be less than 54

percent,
adjusted operating margin (operating margin excluding net gains and losses on
disposals and other one

-

time items) to be 28

percent or better and to have industry
leading organic revenue growth.

Our
Business

Insurance and
reinsurance is a global business, and its participants are affected by global
trends in capacity and pricing. Accordingly, we operate as one global business
which ensures all clients’ interests are handled efficiently and
comprehensively, whatever their initial point of contact. We organize our
business into three main areas: Global, North America and International. For
information regarding revenues by geographic locations, see Note 18 of the
Consolidated Financial Statements contained herein.

Global

Our Global business provides specialist
brokerage and consulting services to clients worldwide for the risks arising
from specific industrial and commercial activities. In these operations, we
have extensive specialized experience handling diverse lines of coverage,
including complex insurance programs, and acting as an intermediary between
retail brokers and insurers. We increasingly provide consulting services on
risk management with the objective of assisting clients to reduce the overall
cost of risk. Our Global business serves clients in around 190 countries, primarily
from United Kingdom offices, although we also serve clients from offices in the
United States, Continental Europe and Asia.

The Global business is divided into Global
Specialties, Willis Reinsurance and, throughout 2006, Willis UK and Ireland.

Global Specialties has strong global
positions in aerospace, marine, energy, construction and several niche
businesses. In aerospace we are highly experienced in the provision of
insurance and reinsurance brokerage and risk management services to aerospace
clients, including aircraft manufacturers, air cargo handlers and shippers,
airport managers and other general aviation companies. Advisory services
provided by aerospace include claims recovery, contract and leasing risk
management, safety services and market


information.
Aerospace’s clients are spread throughout the world and include approximately
350 airlines and in excess of 30% of the top 30 Insured Airports by passenger
movement of the world’s leading insured non-American airports. Aerospace is
also prominent in supplying the space industry through providing insurance and
risk management services to approximately 35 companies. Other clients include
those introduced from other intermediaries as well as insurers seeking
reinsurance.

Our energy practice provides insurance
brokerage services including property damage, offshore construction, liability
and control of well and pollution insurance to the energy industry.

We provide marine insurance and reinsurance
brokerage services, including hull, cargo and general marine liabilities.
Marine’s clients include ship owners, ship builders, logistics operators, port
authorities, traders and shippers, other insurance intermediaries and insurance
companies. Marine insurance brokerage is our oldest line of business dating
back to our establishment in 1828. Other services of marine include claims
collection and recoveries.

The construction practice provides risk
management advice and brokerage services for a wide range of UK and
international construction activities. Our expertise has encompassed the
Channel Tunnel Rail Link and the construction of LNG Production Facilities in
Equatorial New Guinea.

Our Financial and Executive Risks area specializes
in broking directors’ and officers’ insurance as well as professional indemnity
insurance for corporations and professional firms. It incorporates our
political risk unit, as well as structured finance and credit teams. It also
places structured crime and specialist liability insurance for clients across
the broad spectrum of financial institutions as well as specializing in
strategic risk assessment and transactional risk transfer solutions.

We have three niche business areas: Fine
Art, Jewelry and Specie; Special Contingency Risks and Hughes-Gibb.

The Fine Art, Jewelry and Specie unit
provides specialist risk management and insurance services to fine art, diamond
and jewelry businesses and operators of armored cars. Coverage is also obtained
for vault and bullion risks. The Special Contingency Risks unit specializes in
producing packages to protect corporations, groups and individuals against
special contingencies such as kidnap and ransom, extortion, detention and
political repatriation. The Hughes-Gibb unit principally services the insurance
and reinsurance needs of the horse racing and horse breeding industry as well
as the aquaculture industry.

During 2006, Global Markets North America
and Global Markets International became part of Willis North America and Willis
International, respectively, to further align within those business areas our
policy of focusing our global resources to provide a seamless service for our
clients.

We are one of the world’s largest
intermediaries for reinsurance and have a significant market share in many of
the major markets, particularly marine and aviation. In the reinsurance area,
we provide clients, both insurance and reinsurance companies, with a complete
range of transactional capabilities as well as analytical and advisory services
such as hazard modeling, financial and balance sheet analysis and reinsurance
optimization studies. We also have a consulting unit, which markets its
capabilities in actuarial and hazard modeling, as well as knowledge of the
financial implications of catastrophe losses.

Our reinsurance capabilities were enhanced
in 2006 with the acquisition of the reinsurance consultants and intermediaries
division of Glenrand MIB Limited of South Africa through our subsidiary Willis
Re (Proprietary) Limited.

Willis UK and Ireland develops and delivers
professional insurance and risk management services to corporate clients and
individuals through 25 offices in the United Kingdom and Ireland. Each office
services its own clients accessing the Group’s global resources as appropriate
to suit the client’s requirements.


Within this unit
there is Corporate Risk Solutions which arranges tailored solutions for major
companies, including several constituents of the UK FTSE 100 and the Willis
Commercial Network which is a partnership between Willis and around 74
independent brokers throughout the UK. The Network brokers access the global
resources of Willis to provide better products and policy terms for their
clients’ benefit. We also provide captive management services in Guernsey, Isle
of Man, Dublin, and Gibraltar.

North
America

Our North America business provides risk
management, insurance brokerage, related risk services, and employee benefits
brokerage and consulting to a wide array of industry and client segments in the
United States and Canada. Organized into six regions including Canada, with 60
retail offices, Willis North America locally delivers the Company’s global and
national resources and specialist expertise through this retail distribution
network.

In addition to being organized
geographically and by specialty, our North America business focuses on four
client segments: global, large national/middle-market, small commercial,
and private client, with service, marketing and sales platform support for each
segment. Further, our North America Marketing Practice provides clients with
efficient access to worldwide insurance capital.

The single largest industry practice group
in North America is Construction which specializes in providing risk
management, insurance brokerage, and surety bonding services to the
construction industry. Willis Construction provides these services to around 25%
of the

Engineering News Record

Top 400
contractors (a listing of the largest 400 North American contractors based
on revenue).  In addition, this practice
group has expertise in owner controlled insurance programs for large projects
and insurance for national homebuilders. This specialty has strong synergy with
two other major National American practice groups:  Real Estate and Environmental.

Other industry practice groups include
Healthcare, serving the professional liability and other insurance and risk
management needs of private and not-for-profit health systems, hospitals and
physicians groups; Financial Institutions, serving the needs of large banks,
insurers and other financial services firms; Mergers & Acquisitions,
providing due diligence, risk management and insurance brokerage services to
private equity and merchant banking firms and their portfolio companies; and
the Japan Practice, which caters to the specialist needs of U.S. and Canadian
subsidiaries and divisions of Japanese companies.

Willis Employee Benefits, fully integrated
into the North America platform, is our largest product-based practice group
and provides health, welfare and human resources consulting and brokerage
services to all of our commercial client segments. This practice group’s value
lies in helping clients control employee benefit plan costs, reducing the
amount of time human resources professionals spend administering their
companies’ benefit plans and educating and training employees on benefit plan
issues.

Another industry-leading North America
practice group is Willis Executive Risks, a national team of technical
professionals who specialize in meeting the directors & officers,
employment practices, and fiduciary liability insurance risk management, and
claims advocacy needs of public and private corporations and organizations. This
practice group also has expertise in professional liability, especially internet
risks.

The Captive, Actuarial, and Pooling
Solutions (CAPS) practice has a national team of actuaries, certified public
accountants, financial analysts and pooled insurance program experts who help
large clients develop, implement and manage alternative risks financing
vehicles.

Finally, Willis
Programs, based in New Hampshire with operations in Michigan and Florida, is a
managing general agent/managing general underwriter and a leader in providing
national insurance programs to niche industries including ski and other luxury
resorts, auto dealers, and metal recyclers.


International

Effective January 1, 2007 our Willis
UK & Ireland and International business units combined to create a new
International business that will encompass all our retail operations outside
North America, encompassing operations in 73 countries and almost 6,000
employees.

Through 2006, our International unit
consisted of our network of subsidiaries and associates other than those in
North America, the United Kingdom and Republic of Ireland. The operation was
located in 71 countries worldwide, including 22 countries in Europe, 12 in the
Asia/Pacific region and 37 elsewhere in the world. The services provided were
focused according to the characteristics of each market and were not identical
in every office, but generally included direct risk management and insurance
brokerage, specialist and reinsurance brokerage and employee benefits
consulting.

Our Global Markets International unit based
in the UK works closely with the International networks to further develop
access to global markets, and provide structuring and placing skills in the
relevant areas of property and casualty liability.

We believe the combined total revenues of
our International subsidiaries and associates provide an indication of the
spread and capability of our International network. In 2006, combined total
revenues of our International subsidiaries and our associates were $1,009 million
compared to $935 million in 2005. Our consolidated total revenues for 2006
only include the revenues of our International subsidiaries of $569 million
and do not include the revenues of our associates of $440 million.

In 2006 we acquired Link Forsikringsmegling
AS, a Norwegian insurance broker, Nicon Försäkringsmäklarna AB, a Swedish
insurance broker, and increased our interest in France’s leading insurance
broker Gras Savoye & Cie from 33% to 38%.

Customers

Our clients
operate on a global and local scale in a multitude of businesses and industries
throughout the world and generally range in size from major multinational
corporations to middle-market companies. Further, many of our client
relationships span decades, for instance our relationship with The Tokio Marine
and Fire Insurance Company, Limited dates back over 100 years. No one
client accounted for more than 10% of revenues for fiscal year 2006.
Additionally, we place insurance with over 5,000 insurance carriers, none of
which individually accounted for more than 10% of the total premiums we placed
on behalf of our clients in 2006.

Competition

We face competition in all fields in which
we operate based on global capability, product breadth, innovation, quality of
service and price. According to the Directory of Agents and Brokers published
by Business Insurance in July 2006, the 130 largest commercial insurance
brokers globally reported brokerage revenues totaling $32 billion in 2005,
of which Marsh & McLennan Companies Inc. had approximately 31% and
Aon Corporation, had approximately 20%.

We compete with
Marsh & McLennan and Aon as well as with numerous specialist, regional
and local firms. Although Marsh & McLennan and Aon, along with us,
have agreed to implement certain business reforms, many specialist, regional
and local firms have not agreed to those business reforms. These firms are
continuing to accept contingent compensation and are not disclosing the
compensation received in connection with providing policy placement services to
the customer. If we are unable to compete effectively against those competitors
we may lose market share. Insurance companies also compete with brokers by
directly soliciting insureds without the assistance of an independent broker or
agent. Competition for business is intense in all our business lines and in
every insurance market. Competition on premium rates has also exacerbated the
pressures caused by a continuing reduction in demand in some classes of
business. For example, insurers are currently retaining a greater proportion of
their risk portfolios than previously. Industrial and commercial companies are
increasingly relying upon captive insurance companies, self-insurance pools,
risk retention groups, mutual insurance companies and other mechanisms for
funding their risks, rather than buying insurance. Additional competitive
pressures arise from the entry of new market participants, such as banks,
accounting firms and insurance carriers themselves, offering risk management or
transfer services.

Regulation

Our business activities are subject to
legal requirements and governmental and quasi-governmental regulatory
supervision in virtually all countries in which we operate. While these
requirements may vary from location to location they are generally designed to
protect our clients by establishing minimum standards of conduct and practice,
particularly regarding the provision of advice and product information as well
as financial criteria.

The European Union Insurance Mediation
Directive introduced rules for implementation by January 2005 to
enable insurance and reinsurance intermediaries to operate and provide services
within each member state of the EU on a basis consistent with the EU single
market and customer protection aims. Each EU member state is required to ensure
that the insurance and reinsurance intermediaries resident in their country are
registered with a statutory body in that country and that each intermediary
meets professional requirements in relation to their competence, good repute,
professional indemnity cover and financial capacity. In the United Kingdom the
statutory body is the Financial Services Authority.


The Financial Services Authority has
prescribed the methods by which our insurance and reinsurance operations are to
conduct business, and they generally conduct their regulatory functions through
the establishment of net worth and other financial criteria. They also require
the submission of reports and have investigative and disciplinary powers.
Monitoring visits are carried out to assess our compliance with regulatory
requirements.

Further, our clients have the right to file
complaints with our regulators about our services, and the regulators may
conduct an investigation or require us to conduct an investigation into these
complaints. Our failure, or that of our employees, to satisfy the regulators
that we are in compliance with their requirements or the legal requirements
governing our activities, can result in disciplinary action, fines,
reputational damage and financial harm.

Our activities in connection with insurance
brokerage services within the United States are subject to regulation and
supervision by state authorities. Although the scope of regulation and form of
supervision may vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, insurance laws in the
United States are often complex and generally grant broad discretion to supervisory
authorities in adopting regulations and supervising regulated activities. That
supervision generally includes the licensing of insurance brokers and agents
and the regulation of the handling and investment of client funds held in a
fiduciary capacity. Our continuing ability to provide insurance brokerage in
the jurisdictions in which we currently operate is dependent upon our
compliance with the rules and regulations promulgated from time to time by
the regulatory authorities in each of these jurisdictions.

All companies
carrying on similar activities in a given jurisdiction are subject to regulations
which are not dissimilar to the requirements for our operations in the United
Kingdom and United States. We do not consider that these regulatory
requirements adversely affect our competitive position.

Employees

As of December 31,
2006 we had approximately 13,000 employees worldwide of whom approximately
3,600 were employed in the United Kingdom and 3,750 in the United States, with
the balance being employed across the rest of the world. In addition, our
associates had approximately 3,000 employees, all of whom were located outside
the United Kingdom and the United States.

Item 1A—Risk
Factors

Risks
Relating to our Business and the Insurance Industry

This section describes the material risks
affecting the Group’s business. These risks could materially affect the Group’s
business, its revenues, operating income, net income, net assets and liquidity
and capital resources and, accordingly should be read in conjunction with any
forward-looking statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Premiums and Commissions—We do not control
the premiums on which our commissions are based, and volatility or declines in
premiums may seriously undermine our profitability.

We derive most of our revenues from
commissions and fees for brokerage and consulting services. We do not determine
insurance premiums on which our commissions are generally based. Premiums are
cyclical in nature and may vary widely based on market conditions. From the
late 1980s through late 2000, insurance premium rates generally declined as a
result of a number of factors, including the expanded underwriting capacity of
insurance carriers; consolidation of both insurance intermediaries and
insurance carriers; and increased competition among insurance carriers. During
2004, we saw a rapid transition from a “hard” market, with premium rates stable
or increasing, to a “soft” market, with premium rates falling in most markets.
These rate declines were most pronounced in the property and casualty market,
with rates


falling between
10% and 30% by year end. Rates have continued to decline in most sectors
through 2005 and 2006, with the exception of catastrophe-exposed markets.

In addition, as traditional risk-bearing
insurance carriers continue to outsource the production of premium revenue to
non-affiliated agents or brokers such as ourselves, those insurance carriers
may seek to reduce further their expenses by reducing the commission rates
payable to those insurance agents or brokers. The reduction of these commission
rates, along with general volatility and/or declines in premiums, may
significantly undermine our profitability.

Regulation—We are subject to insurance
industry regulation worldwide. If we fail to comply with regulatory
requirements, we may not be able to conduct our business.

Many of our activities are subject to
regulatory supervision in virtually all the countries in which we are based or
our activities are undertaken. Failure to comply with some of these regulations
could lead to disciplinary action, including requiring clients to be
compensated for loss, the imposition of penalties and the revocation of our
authorization to operate. In addition, changes in legislation or regulations
and actions by regulators, including changes in administration and enforcement
policies, could from time to time require operational improvements or
modifications at various locations which could result in higher costs or hinder
our ability to operate our business.

Regulation—We are subject to a number of
investigations and legal proceedings concerning contingent compensation, other
industry practices and certain conduct, which, if determined unfavorably to us,
could adversely affect our financial results.

We have been subject to investigations by
the departments of insurance or attorneys general of over 20 states, Canada and
Australia concerning, among other things, arrangements pursuant to which
insurers compensated insurance brokers for distribution and other services
provided to insurers known as contingent compensation, bid rigging, tying and
other possible violations of law, including violations of fiduciary duty,
securities laws and antitrust laws.

In April 2005, we resolved the New
York investigation by entering into an Assurance of Discontinuance, or NY AOD,
with the New York Attorney General and the New York Superintendent of
Insurance, pursuant to which we have paid $50 million to eligible
customers. We also agreed to continue, and further implement, certain business
reforms. These reforms include an agreement not to accept contingent
compensation and an undertaking to disclose to customers any compensation we
will receive in connection with providing policy placement services to the
customer. We also resolved a similar investigation by the Minnesota Attorney
General by entering into an Assurance of Discontinuance pursuant to which we
paid $1 million to Minnesota customers and implemented the business
reforms described in the NY AOD. While we are fully cooperating with the other
investigations, including subpoenas and requests for information, we cannot
predict at this time how or when those investigations will be resolved.

Since August 2004, various plaintiffs
have filed purported class actions, in New York, Illinois, California, New
Jersey and Florida, under a variety of legal theories, including state tort,
contract, fiduciary duty and statutory theories, and federal antitrust and RICO
theories. Other than a federal suit in Illinois that was voluntarily dismissed
by the plaintiff in May 2005, all of the federal actions have been
consolidated into two actions in federal court in New Jersey. One of the
consolidated actions addresses employee benefits insurance, while the other
consolidated action addresses all other lines of insurance. In addition to the
two federal actions, we were also named as a defendant in purported class
actions in state courts in Florida and Massachusetts. In June 2006 the
plaintiff in the Massachusetts state action voluntarily dismissed its complaint
with prejudice. Both consolidated federal actions and the remaining state
action name various insurance carriers and insurance brokerage firms, including
us, as defendants. The allegations relate to the practices and conduct that has
been the subject of the investigations described


above,
including allegations that the brokers are breaching their duties to their
clients by entering into contingent compensation agreements with insufficient
disclosure to clients as well as allegations of bid rigging, tying and the
improper use of affiliated wholesalers. The complaints also allege the
existence of a conspiracy among the insurance carriers and brokers, and the
federal court complaints allege violations of the federal RICO statute. We
intend to vigorously defend ourselves against these claims. The outcomes of
these lawsuits, however, including any losses or other payments that may occur
as a result, cannot be predicted at this time.

The ultimate outcome of all matters
referred to above cannot be ascertained and liabilities in indeterminate
amounts may be imposed on us. It is thus possible that future results of
operations or cash flows for any particular quarterly or annual period could be
materially affected by an unfavorable resolution of these matters. In addition,
even if we do not experience significant monetary costs, there may be adverse
publicity associated with these matters that will result in reputational harm
to the insurance brokerage industry in general or to us in particular that may
adversely affect our business.

Claims, Lawsuits and Other Proceedings—Our
business, results of operations, financial condition or liquidity may be
materially adversely affected by errors and omissions and the outcome of
certain actual and potential claims, lawsuits and proceedings.

We are subject to various actual and
potential claims, lawsuits and other proceedings relating principally to alleged
errors and omissions in connection with the placement of insurance and
reinsurance in the ordinary course of business. Because we often assist our
clients with matters, including the placement of insurance coverage and the
handling of related claims, involving substantial amounts of money, errors and
omissions claims against us may arise which allege our potential liability for
all or part of the amounts in question. Claimants can seek large damage awards
and these claims can involve potentially significant defense costs. Such
claims, lawsuits and other proceedings could, for example, include allegations
of damages for our employees or sub-agents improperly failing to place coverage
or notify claims on behalf of clients, to provide insurance carriers with
complete and accurate information relating to the risks being insured or to
appropriately apply funds that we hold for our

clients on a fiduciary basis.

Errors and omissions claims,
lawsuits and other proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business are
covered in part by professional indemnity or other appropriate insurance. The
terms of this insurance vary by policy year and self-insured risks have
increased significantly over recent years. In respect of self-insured risks, w

e have established provisions against these items
which we believe to be adequate in the light of current information and legal
advice, and we adjust such provisions from time to time according to
developments.

While most of the errors and omissions
claims made against us have, subject to our self-insured deductibles, been
covered by our professional indemnity insurance, our business, results of
operations, financial condition and liquidity may be adversely affected if in
the future our insurance coverage proves to be inadequate or unavailable or
there is an increase in liabilities for which we self-insure. Our ability to
obtain professional indemnity insurance in the amounts and with the deductibles
we desire in the future may be adversely impacted by general developments in the
market for such insurance or our own claims experience. In addition, claims,
lawsuits and other proceedings may harm our reputation or divert management
resources away from operating our business.

The principal actual or potential claims,
lawsuits and proceedings to which we are currently subject, including but not
limited to errors and omissions claims, are (1) claims relating to
services provided by one of our UK subsidiaries, Willis Faber (Underwriting
Management) Limited, to another subsidiary, Sovereign Marine & General
Insurance Company Limited (in Scheme of Arrangement) (“Sovereign’’), that was
engaged in insurance underwriting prior to 1991 as well as certain third-party
insurance companies; (2) claims with respect to our placement of property
and casualty insurance for a number of entities which were directly impacted by
the September 11, 2001 destruction of New York’s World Trade


Center complex;
(3) the regulatory and other proceedings relating to contingent
compensation arrangements referred to above; (4) potential claims arising
out of various legal proceedings between reinsurers, reinsureds and their
reinsurance brokers relating to personal accident excess of loss reinsurance
placements for the years 1993 to 1998; and (5) potential damages arising
out of a federal district court action, commenced in 2001, on behalf of a class
of approximately 200 present and former female officer and officer equivalent
employees for alleged discrimination against them on the basis of their gender.

Put and Call Arrangements—We have entered
into significant put and call arrangements which may require us to pay
substantial amounts to purchase shares in one of our associates. Those payments
would reduce our liquidity and short-term cash flow.

In connection with many of our investments
in our associates, we retain rights to increase our ownership percentages over
time and, in some cases, the existing owners also have a right to put their
shares to us. The put arrangement in place for shares of our associate, Gras
Savoye, may require us to pay substantial amounts to purchase those shares,
which could decrease our liquidity and short-term cash flow.

The rights under the put arrangement may be
exercised through 2011. If fully exercised, we would be required to buy shares
of Gras Savoye, other than those held by its management, possibly increasing
our ownership interest from 38% to 90%. Management shareholders of Gras Savoye,
representing approximately 10% of the outstanding shares, do not have general
put rights before 2011, but have certain put rights on their death, disability
or retirement. Payments in connection with management put rights would not have
exceeded $64 million if those rights had been fully exercised at December 31,
2006.

From 2007 onwards the incremental 52% of
Gras Savoye may be put to us at a price determined by a contractual formula
based on earnings and revenue, which at December 31, 2006 would have
amounted to approximately $337 million. The shareholders may put their
shares individually at any time during the put period and the amounts we may
have to pay in connection with the put arrangements may significantly exceed
this estimate.

Competition—Competition in our industry is
intense, and if we are unable to compete effectively, we may lose market share
and our business may be materially adversely affected.

We face competition in all fields in which
we operate, based on global capability, product breadth, innovation, quality of
service and price. We compete with Marsh & McLennan and Aon, the two
other providers of global risk management services, as well as with numerous
specialist, regional and local firms. Although Marsh & McLennan and
Aon, along with us, have agreed to implement certain business reforms, many
specialist, regional and local firms have not agreed to these business reforms.
These firms are continuing to accept contingent compensation and are not
disclosing the compensation received in connection with providing policy
placement services to the customer. If we are unable to compete effectively
against these competitors, we will suffer lower revenue, reduced operating
margins and loss of market share.

Competition for business is intense in all
our business lines and in every insurance market, and the other two providers
of global risk management services have substantially greater market share than
we do. Competition on premium rates has also

exacerbated
the pressures caused by a continuing reduction in demand in some classes of
business. For example, insureds have been retaining a greater proportion of
their risk portfolios than previously. Industrial and commercial companies have
been

increasingly relying upon their own subsidiary insurance companies,
known as captive insurance companies, self-insurance pools, risk retention
groups, mutual insurance companies and other mechanisms for funding their
risks, rather than buying insurance. Additional competitive pressures arise
from the entry of new market participants, such as banks, accounting firms and
insurance carriers themselves, offering risk management or transfer services.


Dependence on Key Personnel—The loss of our
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer or a number of our senior management or a
significant number of our brokers could significantly impede our financial
plans, growth, marketing and other objectives.

The loss of our Chairman and Chief
Executive Officer or a number of our senior management or a significant number
of our brokers could significantly impede our financial plans, growth,
marketing and other objectives. Our success depends to a substantial extent not
only on the ability and experience of our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer,
Joseph J. Plumeri and a number of our senior management; but also on the
individual brokers and teams that service our clients and maintain client
relationships. The insurance and reinsurance brokerage industry has in the past
experienced intense competition for the services of leading individual brokers
and brokerage teams, and we have lost key individuals and teams to competitors
in the past. We believe that our future success will depend in part on our
ability to attract and retain additional highly skilled and qualified personnel
and to expand, train and manage our employee base. We may not continue to be
successful in doing so, because the competition for qualified personnel in our
industry is intense.

International Operations—Our significant
non-US operations, particularly those in the United Kingdom, expose us to
exchange rate fluctuations and various risks that could impact our business.

A significant portion of our operations is
conducted outside the United States. Accordingly, we are subject to legal,
economic and market risks associated with operating in foreign countries,
including devaluations and fluctuations in currency exchange rates; imposition
of limitations on conversion of foreign currencies into pounds sterling or
dollars or remittance of dividends and other payments by foreign subsidiaries;
hyperinflation in certain foreign countries; imposition or increase of
investment and other restrictions by foreign governments; and the requirement
of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws.

We report our operating results and financial condition in US dollars.
Our US operations earn revenue and incur expenses primarily in dollars. In the
United Kingdom, however, we earn revenue in a number of different currencies,
but expenses are almost entirely incurred in pounds sterling. Outside the
United States and the United Kingdom, we predominantly generate revenue and
expenses in the local currency. The table gives an approximate analysis of
revenues and expenses by currency in 2006.

Because of devaluations and fluctuations in
currency exchange rates or the imposition of limitations on conversion of
foreign currencies into dollars, we are subject to currency translation
exposure on the profits of our operations, in addition to economic exposure.
Furthermore, the mismatch between pounds sterling revenues and expenses creates
an exchange exposure. As the pound sterling strengthens, the US dollars
required to be translated into pounds sterling to cover the net sterling
expenses increase, which then causes our results to be negatively impacted.
Given these facts, the strength of the pounds sterling relative to the US
dollar has in the past had a material negative impact on our reported results.
This risk could have a material adverse effect on our business financial
condition, cash flow and results of operations in the future.

Generally, our policy
is to convert into pounds sterling all revenues arising in currencies other
than US dollars together with sufficient US dollar revenues to fund the
remaining pounds sterling expenses. Outside the United Kingdom, only those cash
flows necessary to fund mismatches between revenues and expenses are converted
into local currency. Amounts remitted to the United Kingdom are usually converted
into pounds sterling and the currency exposures managed by entering into
forward exchange


contracts.
Generally, it is our policy to hedge at least 25% of the next 12 months’
exposure in significant currencies. We do not hedge exposures beyond three
years.

Item 1B—Unresolved
Staff Comments

The Company had
no unresolved comments from the SEC’s staff that were issued more than 180 days
prior to the December 31, 2006 fiscal year end.

Item 2—Properties

We own and
lease a number of properties for use as offices throughout the world and
believe that our properties are generally suitable and adequate for the
purposes for which they are used. The principal properties are located in the
United Kingdom and the United States. Our principal executive office at Ten Trinity
Square, London is a landmark building which we sold in 2006 to developers. We
will lease back this facility until we move into our new UK headquarters in
2008. In November 2004 we entered into an Agreement for Lease with
long-time client British Land plc relating to our new UK headquarters in
London. Construction commenced in April 2005 and Willis occupancy is
targeted for early 2008.

Item 3—Legal
Proceedings

General.

We are subject to various actual and
potential claims, lawsuits and other proceedings relating principally to
alleged errors and omissions in connection with the placement of insurance and
reinsurance in the ordinary course of business. Similar to other corporations,
we are also subject to a variety of other claims, including those relating to
our employment practices. Some of those claims, lawsuits and other proceedings
seek damages in amounts which could, if assessed, be significant.

Errors and omissions claims, lawsuits and
other proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business are covered in
part by professional indemnity or other appropriate insurance. The terms of
this insurance vary by policy year and self-insured risks have increased
significantly over recent years. In respect of self-insured risks, we have
established provisions which are believed to be adequate in the light of
current information and legal advice, and we adjust such provisions from time
to time according to developments. On the basis of current information, we do
not expect that the actual claims, lawsuits and other proceedings to which we
are subject, or potential claims, lawsuits and other proceedings relating to
matters of which we are aware will ultimately have a material adverse effect on
our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. Nonetheless, given
the large or indeterminate amounts sought in certain of these actions, and the
inherent unpredictability of litigation, it is possible that an adverse outcome
in certain matters could, from time to time, have a material adverse effect on
our results of operations or cash flows in particular quarterly or annual
periods.

The most
significant actual or potential claims, lawsuits and other proceedings, of
which we are currently aware are:

Sovereign/WFUM.

Sovereign, a wholly owned subsidiary of
ours, operated as an insurance company in the United Kingdom and from 1972
Sovereign’s underwriting activities were managed by another wholly owned
subsidiary of ours, Willis Faber (Underwriting Management) Limited, or WFUM.
WFUM also provided underwriting agency and other services to third-party
insurance companies, which we refer to as the stamp companies, some of which
are long-standing clients of ours. As part of its services as agent, WFUM
underwrote insurance and reinsurance business on behalf of Sovereign and the
stamp companies and arranged reinsurance on their behalf. In 1991, Sovereign
and the stamp companies ceased underwriting new business. Sovereign entered
provisional liquidation in 1997.

On January 5, 2000, a scheme of
arrangement proposed by Sovereign to its creditors became effective. The stated
purpose of the scheme of arrangement is to resolve Sovereign’s liabilities and
provide that


Sovereign’s
business is run off in as orderly a manner as possible. The scheme
administrators have announced payments to creditors at a payment percentage of
40% payable out of Sovereign’s assets. Sovereign’s assets are separate and
distinct from ours, and any payment from Sovereign will have no effect on our
results of operations, financial condition or liquidity.

Sovereign and certain of the stamp
companies have also expressed concern about the enforceability of certain
reinsurance put in place by WFUM on behalf of Sovereign and the stamp
companies. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that there will be no arbitration,
judicial decisions or settlements arising in the future that result in
shortfalls in reinsurance recoveries for Sovereign or the stamp companies. The
failure of Sovereign or the stamp companies to collect reinsurance following
any adverse arbitration awards would increase the likelihood of them pursuing
potential claims, including shortfalls in reinsurance recoveries, against WFUM.
Sovereign and the stamp companies have reserved their rights generally in
respect of such potential claims, and WFUM, Willis Group and certain of our
brokerage subsidiaries have entered into standstill agreements which preserve
the rights of potential claimants with respect to their potential claims.

All the stamp companies (both Sovereign and
the solvent stamp companies) have commenced the process of attempting to enter
into final cut-off schemes of arrangements with their creditors. For those
stamp companies whose creditors approve the schemes in sufficient numbers, the
operation of the schemes will crystallise and bring to an end all remaining
liabilities to insureds and reinsureds, with creditors receiving payments in
accordance with the scheme claim valuation process. There is a scheme arrangement
for each of the WFUM stamp companies and each scheme is legally separate. It is
therefore possible that

some schemes will
proceed and some will not. In contrast, those stamp companies who are not able
to agree a scheme arrangement with creditors may have to continue to run off
liabilities for many years.

Initial applications have been made to the
English Court and votes took place at creditors’ meetings on October 27, 2006.
The voting adjudication process (valuing and verifying creditors’ votes) will
be completed during the first quarter of 2007. Where sufficient voters (by
number and by value) have approved the scheme proposals, further applications
will be made to the English and US Courts for the schemes to be sanctioned. These
may be opposed by some creditors. The courts are entitled to refuse to sanction
schemes on the grounds of unfairness, either generally or to certain classes of
creditor. These applications to the English and US Courts are unlikely to be
heard before the middle of 2007.

In 2004, the solvent stamp companies
entered into a settlement agreement whereby Willis Group Limited and all its
subsidiaries received certain immediate releases and other releases staged in
return for certain staged payments. If any stamp company’s scheme arrangement
fails to achieve the required vote, the run-off may be lengthy, there will be
more opportunity for disputes to arise, the final staged payment may not be
accepted and claims may be made against us. Once the final staged payment is
made, Willis and its subsidiaries will be released from further potential
liabilities to the solvent stamp companies arising out of the WFUM pools.

World Trade
Center.

We
acted as the insurance broker, but not as an underwriter, for the placement of
both property and casualty insurance for a number of entities which were
directly impacted by the September 11, 2001 destruction of the World Trade
Center complex, including Silverstein Properties LLC, which acquired a 99-year
leasehold interest in the twin towers and related facilities from the Port
Authority of New York and New Jersey in July 2001. Although the World
Trade Center complex insurance was bound at or before the July 2001
closing of the leasehold acquisition, consistent with standard industry
practice, the final policy wording for the placements was still in the process
of being finalized when the twin towers and other buildings in the complex were
destroyed on September 11, 2001.

There are a number of lawsuits pending in
the United States between the insured parties and the insurers for several
placements, with the Silverstein property placement being the most significant
of these lawsuits. There were two jury trials in the Silverstein property suit
in which the principal issue was whether the September 11 events
constituted one or more occurrences for the purposes of the relevant insurance


policies. The
outcome from the two jury trials is that Silverstein has $4.6 billion in
coverage as opposed to the $7 billion it was seeking. On appeal, the verdicts
from both jury trials were upheld. Silverstein and a few insurers have filed
petitions with the appellate court for reargument. A federal court action was
commenced in the Southern District of New York on October 19, 2005, by CDL
Hotels USA, Inc. and Millennium & Copthorne Hotels alleging that
Willis, in placing the property insurance, failed to procure the amount of
business interruption coverage requested by CDL and Millennium and confirmed by
Willis. As a result of alleged damages to several of its hotels from the events
of September 11, 2001, CDL and Millennium sought damages in excess of
$45 million. This matter was settled in November 2006 for an amount
which was not material. Other disputes may also arise in respect of the World
Trade Center insurance placed by us which could affect Willis including claims
by one or more of the insureds that we made culpable errors or omissions in
connection with our brokerage activities. However, we do not believe that our
role as broker will lead to liabilities which in the aggregate would have a
material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition or
liquidity.

Proceedings
Relating to Contingent Compensation Arrangements.

In April 2005, we entered into an
Assurance of Discontinuance (“NY AOD”) with the New York Attorney General and
the New York Superintendent of Insurance resolving the investigation commenced
by the New York Attorney General in April 2004 which concerned, among
other things, arrangements pursuant to which insurers compensated insurance
brokers for distribution and other services provided to insurers and, as the
investigation of brokers and insurers continued, broadened into an
investigation of other possible violations of law, including violations of
fiduciary duty, securities laws and antitrust laws. Pursuant to the NY AOD, we
have paid $50 million to eligible customers. We have also agreed to
continue certain business reforms we had already implemented and to implement
certain other business reforms. These reforms include an agreement not to
accept contingent compensation; and an undertaking to disclose to customers any
compensation we will receive in connection with providing policy placement
services to the customer. We also resolved a similar investigation commenced by
the Minnesota Attorney General by entering into an Assurance of Discontinuance
pursuant to which we paid an additional $1 million to Minnesota customers
and implemented the business reforms described in the NY AOD. On October 1,
2005 we mailed letters to customers who were eligible to receive distributions
out of the fund. In March 2006 checks were mailed to eligible customers
who elected to participate in the fund. Eligible customers that elected to
participate represented 87.93 percent of the $51 million fund. As
required by the AOD, the remaining funds were redistributed on a pro rata
basis to the participating customers.

We
continue to respond to requests for documents and information by the regulators
and/or attorneys general of more than twenty other states, the District of
Columbia, one US city, Canada, and Australia that are conducting similar
investigations. We are co-operating fully with these investigations

and
have engaged in discussions with regulators and attorneys general about their
investigations

. We cannot predict at this
time how or when those investigations will be resolved.

Our operations in nine European countries
have received questionnaires from either the European Commission pursuant to
its Sector Inquiry or, in respect of Norway, the European Free Trade
Association Surveillance Authority, related to insurance business practices,
including compensation arrangements for brokers. At least 150 other European
brokers have received similar questionnaires. We responded to the European
Commission questionnaires within the timeframe set and have filed the European
Free Trade Association Surveillance Authority questionnaire for two of our
Norwegian entities within the agreed timeframes. The European Commission
reported on an interim basis on January 24, 2007. The Interim Report
included preliminary findings of potential conflicts of interest relating to
remuneration by assuming a dual role for clients and insurers. The European
Commission has requested by way of consultation, responses to the Interim
Report by April 10, 2007 and anticipates publishing a final report in
September 2007. We continue to co-operate with both the European Commission and
the European Free Trade Association Surveillance Authority.


In August 2004, a proceeding was
commenced in the Superior Court of the State of California, County of San Diego
against us by United Policyholders, an organization purporting to act in a
representative capacity on behalf of the California general public. The
complaint alleged that the compensation arrangements between us and insurance
carriers constituted deceptive trade practices, and it sought both injunctive
and equitable relief, including restitution. This action was dismissed in December 2004,
but United Policyholders filed an appeal. The dismissal of the complaint was
based on the retroactive application of newly passed legislation. In July 2006
the Supreme Court of California confirmed in a ruling that the newly passed
legislation applies to cases, like the United Policyholders case, that
were pending before the new legislation was enacted. Based on this ruling,
United Policyholders has dismissed its case.

Since August 2004, various plaintiffs
have filed purported class actions, in the United States District Court for the
Southern District of New York, the Northern District of Illinois, the Northern
District of California, the New Jersey District Court, and the Circuit Court
for the Eighteenth Judicial Circuit in and for Seminole County, Florida Civil
Division, under a variety of legal theories, including state tort, contract,
fiduciary duty and statutory theories, and federal antitrust and RICO theories,
and we anticipate that further similar suits could be filed. Other than a
federal suit in Illinois that was voluntarily dismissed by the plaintiff in May 2005,
all of the federal actions have been consolidated into two actions in federal
court in New Jersey. One of the consolidated actions addresses employee benefits,
while the other consolidated action addresses all other lines of insurance. In
addition to the two federal actions, we were also named as a defendant in
purported class actions in the Eighteenth Judicial Circuit in and for Seminole
County, Florida Civil Division and Commonwealth of Massachusetts Superior Court
Department of the Trial Court. In June 2006 the plaintiff in the
Massachusetts state action voluntarily dismissed its complaint with prejudice.
Both the consolidated federal actions and the Florida state action name various
insurance carriers and insurance brokerage firms, including us, as defendants.
The complaints seek monetary damages and equitable relief and make allegations
regarding the practices and conduct that has been the subject of the
investigation of state attorneys general and insurance commissioners, including
allegations that the brokers have breached their duties to their clients by
entering into contingent compensation agreements with either no disclosure or
limited disclosure to clients and entered into other improper activities. The
complaints also allege the existence of a conspiracy among the insurance
carriers and brokers and the federal court complaints allege violations of the
federal RICO statue. We dispute these allegations and intend to defend
ourselves vigorously against these actions. The outcomes of these lawsuits,
however, including any losses or other payments that may occur as a result,
cannot be predicted at this time.

Reinsurance
Market Dispute.

Various legal proceedings are pending, have been concluded or may
commence between reinsurers, reinsureds and in some cases their intermediaries,
including reinsurance brokers, relating to personal accident excess of loss
reinsurance for the years 1993 to 1998. The proceedings principally concern
allegations by reinsurers that they have sustained substantial losses due to an
alleged abnormal “spiral” in the market in which the reinsurance contracts were
placed, the existence and nature of which, as well as other information, was
not disclosed to them by the reinsureds or their reinsurance broker. A “spiral”
is a market term for a situation in which reinsureds and reinsurers reinsure
each other with the effect that the same loss or portion of that loss moves
through the market multiple times.

The reinsurers concerned have taken the
position that, despite their decisions to underwrite risks or a group of risks,
they are no longer bound by their reinsurance contracts. As a result, they have
stopped settling claims and are seeking to recover claims already paid. We also
understand that there have been two arbitration awards in relation to a spiral,
among other things, in which the reinsurer successfully argued that it was no
longer bound by parts of its reinsurance program. Willis Limited, our principal
insurance brokerage subsidiary in the United Kingdom, acted as the reinsurance
broker or otherwise as


intermediary,
but not as an underwriter, for numerous personal accident reinsurance
contracts, including for two contracts that were involved

in one of the arbitrations. Due to the small
number of reinsurance brokers generally, Willis Limited was one of a small
number of brokers active in the market for this reinsurance during the relevant
period. We also utilized other brokers active in this market as sub-agents,
including brokers who are parties to the legal proceedings described above, for
certain contracts and may be responsible for any errors and omissions they may
have made. In July 2003, one of the reinsurers received a judgment in the
English High Court against certain parties, including a sub-broker we used to
place two of the contracts involved in this trial. Although neither we nor any
of our subsidiaries were a party to this or any other proceeding or
arbitration, we entered into standstill agreements with certain of the
principals to the reinsurance contracts tolling the statute of limitations
pending the outcome of proceedings between the reinsureds and reinsurers.

Various arbitrations continue to be active
and from time to time the principals request our co-operation and suggest that
claims may be asserted against the Company, although at this time no actions
are pending against the Company. The outcome or settlement of some of these
arbitrations is pending and may lead to litigation against Willis. Claims may
be made against us if reinsurers do not pay claims on policies issued by them.
It is too early to know what amount of underwriting losses will be alleged to
be attributable to an abnormal spiral or the other issues that may be raised,
or what amount, if any, reinsureds or reinsurers or other intermediaries may
seek to recover from us.

Pender Insurance
Limited/Captive Insurance Management

.

We acted through one of our subsidiaries
as an independent captive manager for Pender from 1990 to 2003. In 2004, legal
proceedings were commenced in the English Commercial Court by Cable &
Wireless Plc and Pender Insurance Limited, its captive insurer, against six of
their former employees and certain other individuals and entities, and two of
our subsidiaries and one of our former employees and were settled in January 2006
for an undisclosed amount which was not material. The plaintiffs alleged a
fraudulent conspiracy involving the manner in which Pender was managed,
operated or advised by the defendants, which allegedly resulted in substantial
damages to the plaintiffs. A second claim was brought by Pender in 2005,
alleging negligence with respect to certain reinsurance policies. Pender Mutual
Insurance Company Limited (“PMIC”) has recently indicated it has similar claims
to Pender but no legal proceedings have yet been commenced by PMIC. If such
proceedings are commenced, it is not expected the amount claimed will have a
material adverse effect on our results of operations.

Gender Discrimination Class Action.

A federal district court action was
commenced against us in 2001 on behalf of an alleged nationwide class of
present and former female officer and officer equivalent employees alleging
that we discriminated against them on the basis of their gender and seeking
injunctive relief, money damages, attorneys’ fees and costs. To date the court
has denied plaintiffs’ motions to certify a nationwide class or to grant
nationwide discovery, but has certified a class of female officers and officer
equivalent employees based in our Northeast (New York, New Jersey and
Massachusetts) offices. We believe that the purported class consists of
approximately 200 women. We filed a petition for an immediate appeal of
the class certification ruling which was denied. The parties participated in
mediation before a court appointed mediator which has not yet brought about a
settlement. The trial in this matter has been scheduled in June 2007. We
have filed a motion to decertify the class based on new standards set by a
recent Second Circuit opinion for determining whether a class should be
certified. A former female employee, whose motion to intervene in the class
action was denied, has filed a purported class action with almost identical
allegations as those contained in this suit, except seeking a class period of
1998 to the time of trial. We cannot predict at this time what, if any, damages
might result from these actions.

There are no governmental laws, decrees or
regulations in Bermuda which will restrict the remittance of dividends or other
payments to non-resident holders of the Company’s common stock.


On the date of this document there is no
Bermuda income, corporation or profits tax, withholding tax, capital gains tax,
capital transfer tax, estate duty or inheritance tax payable by us or our
shareholders, other than shareholders ordinarily resident in Bermuda.

Pursuant to the Exempted Undertakings Tax
Protection Act 1966, as amended, we have received an undertaking from the
Bermuda Ministry of Finance, that, in the event of there being enacted in
Bermuda any legislation imposing withholding or other tax computed on profits
or income, or computed on any capital assets, gain or appreciation or any tax
in the nature of estate duty or inheritance tax, such tax shall not until March 28,
2016 be applicable to us or to any of our operations, or to our Shares,
debentures or other obligations except and so far as such tax applies to
persons ordinarily resident in Bermuda and holding such shares, debentures or
other obligations or any land leased or let to us in Bermuda.

The gross amount of dividends paid to US
shareholders will be treated as dividend income to such holders, to the extent
paid out of current or accumulated earnings and profits, as determined under
United States federal income tax principles. This income will be includable in
the gross income of a US shareholder as ordinary income on the day received by
the US shareholder. These dividends will not be eligible for the dividends
received deduction allowed to corporations under the Internal Revenue Code of
1986, as amended.

With respect to
non-corporate US shareholders, certain dividends received before January 1,
2009 from a qualified foreign corporation may be subject to reduced rates of
taxation. A foreign corporation is treated as a qualified foreign corporation
with respect to dividends received from that corporation on shares that are
readily tradable on an established securities market in the United States, such
as our shares. Non-corporate US shareholders that do not meet a minimum holding
period requirement for our Shares during which they are not protected from the
risk of loss or that elect to treat the dividend income as “investment income”
pursuant to section 163(d)(4) of the Code will not be eligible for
the reduced rates of taxation regardless of our status as a qualified foreign
corporation. In addition, the rate reduction will not apply to dividends if the
recipient of a dividend is obligated to make related payments with respect to
positions in substantially similar or related property. This disallowance
applies even if the minimum holding period has been met. Non-corporate US shareholders
should consult their own tax advisors regarding the application of these rules given
their particular circumstances.

(a)

As an intermediary, we hold funds in a fiduciary
capacity for the account of third parties, typically as a result of premiums
received from clients that are in transit to insurance carriers and claims due
to clients that are in transit from insurance carriers. We report premiums,
which are held on account of, or due from policyholders, as assets with a
corresponding liability due to the insurance carriers. Claims held by, or due
to, us which are due to clients are also shown as both assets and liabilities
of ours. All those balances due or payable are included in accounts receivable
and payable on the balance sheet. Investment income is earned on those funds
during the time between the receipt of the cash and the time the cash is paid
out. Fiduciary cash must be kept in certain regulated bank accounts subject to
guidelines, which vary according to legal jurisdiction. These guidelines
generally emphasize capital protection and liquidity. Fiduciary cash is not
available to service our debt or for other corporate purposes.


Item 7—Management’s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

EXECUTIVE
SUMMARY

SHAPING
OUR FUTURE

At our ‘‘Shaping
our Future’’ Investor day in June 2006, we set out our strategy for the
next five years. We aim to deliver strong revenue and profit growth by:

·

Driving
revenue growth by

·

defining
our core segments and how we will deliver value to our clients;

·

creating the most appropriate fee and commission structure;

·

enhancing
our sales process; and

·

fully
implementing our Client Advocacy program.

·

Creating
the optimal platform by

·

enhancing
our service model, processes and technology; and

·

determining the right locations for our administration centers and
resourcing them so that they can deliver the right level of service value
efficiently and cost effectively.

·

Truly
becoming the employer of choice by creating

·

a clear
path of career development for our people; and

·

a reward
and recognition framework that recognizes team work.

·

Attaining
our financial goals by

·

further
controlling our expenses by re-examining everything we do on a day-to-day basis
and whether we can do it more efficiently;

·

focusing on client profitability; and

·

enhancing
our capital structure.

Through
this strategy, we expect to deliver significant financial growth over the next
five years; in particular we have set ourselves the following targets by the
end of 2010:

·

salaries
and benefits as a percentage of revenues to be less than 54 percent;

·

adjusted
operating margin (operating margin excluding net gains and losses on disposals
and other one-time items) to be 28 percent or better; and

·

to have industry leading organic revenue growth.

SUMMARY

Overview

The insurance market remained highly
competitive throughout 2006, although the aggressive fee cutting and
competition for new staff seen in 2005 moderated slightly. Outside of
catastrophe-exposed markets, rates in most sectors have declined throughout the
year. Against this background, we are pleased that we achieved our earlier
forecasts for 2006 with the full year results reflecting the benefit of strong
organic revenue growth, improved operating margin and a decrease in the
salaries and benefits ratio (salaries and benefits as a percentage of
revenues).


Results
2006 compared with 2005

Net income in 2006 was $449

million, or $2.84

per diluted share, compared with $281
million, or $1.72 per diluted share, in 2005. This increase reflected good
organic revenue growth, improved operating margin and the benefit of a $71
million tax credit in the fourth quarter which primarily related to the
resolution of certain prior year tax matters.

Total revenues at $2,428

million were $161

million, or 7

percent, higher than in 2005 as organic revenue growth of 8

percent, reflecting net new business
growth in all our business units, more than offset a small reduction in market
remuneration.

Operating
margin for 2006 was 23

percent
compared with 20 percent in 2005. Our margins in 2006 and 2005 have been
impacted by a number of significant items:

·

a $102

million profit on the sale of our UK
head office in second half 2006 (equivalent to 4

percent of revenues);

·

$105

million of expenditure in 2006 in
support of our “Shaping Our Future’’ strategic initiatives, see “Strategic
initiative expenditure’’ below (equivalent to 4

percent of revenues);

·

a $78

million gain on the sale of Stewart
Smith in second quarter 2005 (equivalent to 3

percent
of revenues); and

·

first
quarter 2005 charges for: regulatory settlements and related costs, $60

million; the first quarter 2005
headcount reduction program, $28

million;
and a $20

million additional
charge for legal provisions following the March 31, 2005 review of legal
proceedings (in total, equivalent to


percent
of revenues).

The year on
year improvement in 2006 operating margin also reflected lower pension charges
than in 2005, the benefit of net new business and increased productivity from
recent hires. These were partly offset by the impact of lower market
remuneration.

Results
2005 compared with 2004

Net income in 2005 was $281 million,
or $1.72 per diluted share, compared with $402 million, or $2.42 per
diluted share, in 2004. Total revenues at $2,267 million were
$8 million lower than in 2004 as net new business growth and improved
client retention rates in all divisions were more than offset by a sharp
reduction in market remuneration and falling insurance premium rates.

Operating
margin in 2005 was 20 percent compared with 28 percent in 2004 with
the decline attributable to the sharp reduction in market remuneration, increased
compensation costs and a negative contribution from foreign currency
translation, together with first quarter charges of $60 million for
regulatory settlements and related costs, a $20 million increase in
severance payments, and a $20 million additional charge for legal
provisions following the March 31, 2005 review of legal proceedings. A
$78 million gain on the sale of Stewart Smith in April 2005 partly
offset the adverse impact of the significant first quarter charges.

Sale of
Ten Trinity Square

In September 2006,
we completed the sale of Ten Trinity Square, our UK head office building. The
building has been leased back until we move into our new head office on Lime
Street in early 2008. Gross proceeds were $202 million. The total pre-tax gain
on disposal was $121 million of which $99 million was recognized on completion
in third quarter 2006. The remaining $22 million (equivalent to the net present
value of the leaseback rentals) is being recognized over the two year expected
life of the lease, with $3 million having been recognized in fourth
quarter 2006. While there is no cash tax payable on the


disposal
due to capital losses carried forward, we recognized a tax charge of $8

million on the disposal. The sale of
our building, less related leaseback costs, contributed $0.58 to 2006 earnings
per diluted share.

Strategic
initiative expenditure

We incurred $105

million
of costs in 2006 on initiatives to support our “Shaping Our Future’’ strategy
set out above. $101 million of this expenditure was incurred in second half
2006 and relates to the following initiatives:

Net

Total
  expenses


In addition to the significant expenditure
in second half 2006, we incurred professional fees for platform redesign of $4
million in the first half of the year.

We expect this
expenditure will lead directly to annualized benefits of approximately $65
million pre-tax by 2009. These benefits include cost reductions attributable to
the elimination of nearly 500 positions. The benefit of these will be partly
offset by additional real estate costs related to our new London and New York
headquarters. Net of these real estate costs, we expect the net benefit from
these strategic initiatives to be approximately $20 million in 2007,
$30 million in 2008 and $45 million by 2009.


Future outlook

In 2007, we anticipate that we will
continue to grow organic revenue and to expand operating margin modestly. We
also expect that our adjusted effective tax rate (tax rate excluding the effect
of tax gains and losses on disposals and other one-time items) will be
approximately 31 percent.

In the longer
term, we expect to deliver breakout financial performance in the next four
years. Specifically, by full year 2010, we have set financial targets of
salaries and benefits as a percentage of revenues to be below 54 percent;
adjusted operating margin (operating margin excluding net gains and losses on
disposals and other one-time items) to be 28 percent or better; and to have
industry leading organic revenue growth.

Acquisitions

As announced at
our Investor Day in June 2006, we will seek opportunities to acquire new
business revenues of $50 million to $100 million per year over the next five
years, with acquisitions focused on targeted geographies and areas that will
reinforce our core businesses. Through 2006, we spent a total of $98 million on
acquisitions: completing eight acquisitions of subsidiaries with annual
revenues of approximately $30

million
for $73 million, net of cash acquired, and purchasing an additional 5 percent
of Gras Savoye & Cie, our French associate, for $25 million which
increased our ownership to 38 percent.

Cash and
financing

Cash at December 31, 2006 was $288

million, $95

million higher than at December 31, 2005. Net cash
from operating activities was $147

million
despite contributions to the UK and US pension schemes totaling $


million. This, together with a
$200

million drawdown on our
revolving credit facility and the $202

million
received from the sale of our London headquarters, was used to fund share
buybacks of $211

million,
dividends of $145

million and
acquisitions totaling $98

million.

Total long-term debt at December 31,
2006 was $800

million and
stockholders’ equity was $

1.5

billion.
The capitalization ratio (total long-term debt to total long-term debt and
stockholders’ equity) was 35

percent
at December 31, 2006 compared with 32 percent at December 31, 2005,
with the net increase including a 2 percent increase attributable to the
adoption of FAS 158, see “Accounting Changes’’ below.

We purchased
5.4 million of our own shares in 2006 at a cost of $211

million, including 3.8 million shares under an accelerated
share repurchase program, leaving us with $789 million remaining under our
existing $1 billion buyback authorization at December 31, 2006. Market
conditions permitting, we expect to utilize the remaining authorization over
the next two years or sooner if possible. We believe that the strength of our
balance sheet would allow us to increase our leverage to fund some of these
additional buybacks.

Management
structure

Effective January 1,
2007, we changed our management structure. Our UK and Irish retail operations,
Willis UK and Ireland, which were previously within our Global division have
been combined with our previously existing international units to create a
single International segment. The new International segment incorporates all
our retail operations outside North America.

BUSINESS
AND MARKET OVERVIEW

We provide a broad range of insurance
brokerage and risk management consulting services to our worldwide clients. Our
core businesses include Aerospace; Captives; Construction; Employee Benefits;
Energy; Financial Institutions; Fine Art, Jewelry and Specie; Healthcare;
Marine; Programs; Real Estate and Reinsurance.


In our capacity as an advisor and insurance
broker, we act as an intermediary between our clients and insurance carriers by
advising our clients on their risk management requirements, assisting clients
to determine the best means of managing risk, and negotiating and placing
insurance risk with insurance carriers through our global distribution network.

From the late 1980s through late 2000,
insurance premium rates generally trended downwards as a result of a number of
factors. However, following several years of underwriting losses, the declines
in world equity markets and lower interest rates, many insurance carriers began
to increase premium rates in 2000. The tragic events of September 11, 2001
acted as a catalyst, especially in areas such as aerospace, and rates generally
continued to rise through 2003.

During 2004, we saw a rapid transition from
a hard market, with premium rates stable or increasing, to a soft market, with
premium rates falling in most markets. The soft market continued throughout
2005, although the rate of decline moderated in the latter part of the year. In
addition to the effect of declining rates, the latter part of 2004 and 2005
were also impacted by widespread changes to market practices following various
regulatory investigations. These changes included the elimination of volume and
profit-based contingents for global brokers and a significant reduction in other
remuneration received from the market.

During 2006,
the insurance market has remained highly competitive and, outside of
catastrophe-exposed markets, rates in most sectors have declined

. However,

Marine, Energy and
catastrophe-exposed American and Caribbean Property reinsurance terms and
conditions have significantly tightened. Capacity in these markets remains
inadequate which, together with the shortage of retrocessional reinsurance, has
led to significant rate increases. However, in many other sectors of the
insurance and reinsurance market, pricing and terms continue to soften.

Effective
January 1, 2006 we changed our reporting structure: North America Global
Markets and International Global Markets revenues, which were previously
reported within our Global division, are now reported in the North America and
International divisions respectively. In addition we refined our method for
allocating revenues between our Global and North America divisions. We have
retrospectively adjusted our 2005 revenue analysis to reflect our 2006
structure.

(ii)

Organic
revenue growth excludes the impact of foreign currency translation,
acquisitions and disposals, and market remuneration from reported revenues. We
use organic growth as a measure of business growth generated by operations that
were part of the Group at the end of the period. Our method of calculating this
measure may differ from that used by other companies and therefore
comparability may be limited.


2006 revenues at $2,428

million were $161

million, or 7

percent, higher than in 2005 with organic revenue growth of

percent, reflecting strong net
new business growth, more than offsetting a 1 percent decrease
attributable to market remuneration.

Our Global and International operations
earn a significant portion of their revenues in currencies other than the US dollar.
In 2006, whilst there was no net impact on total reported revenues from the
year on year effect of foreign currency translation, Global revenues benefited
by a net 1 percent which mainly reflected stronger average sterling exchange
rates against the dollar, compared with 2005.

Net acquisitions and disposals had a
neutral impact on total revenues in 2006 as the benefit of acquisitions in:
International, including MGT Corredores de Seguros in Chile, Nicon in Sweden,
Asesores in Peru, Athos in Brazil and acquisitions of minority interests in
Sweden, Norway and Columbia; and Global, including Gueits Adams and
International Insurance Brokers Inc; was offset by the impact of the Stewart
Smith sale in April 2005.

Market remuneration continues to decline
and at $


million in 2006 was $


million lower than in 2005,
equivalent to a 1 percent revenue reduction.

Organic revenues in 2006 were
8 percent higher than in 2005 reflecting strong net new business growth in
all our operations. There was a net negligible year on year impact from rates
and other market factors as the impact of generally declining rates was offset
by other factors, including higher commission rates, higher insureds and
changes in limits or exposures, together with significant rate increases in
areas with exposures to windstorm and catastrophe.

Global:

Organic
revenues were 8 percent higher in 2006 compared with 2005 reflecting net
new business growth and a $9 million benefit from the Shaping our Future client
profitability project that was piloted in the global specialty business in the
second half of 2006. Finex, which is our financial and executive risk division,
Niche, Aerospace and Construction all continued to show strong growth.

After a mixed first quarter, there has been
strong growth in the rest of the year in Reinsurance compared with 2005. In
Marine, Energy and catastrophe-exposed American and Caribbean Property, terms
and conditions have significantly tightened. Capacity in these markets remains
inadequate which, together with the shortage of retrocessional reinsurance, has
led to significant rate increases. However, in many other sectors of the
reinsurance market, pricing and terms continue to soften.

Elsewhere our Global Employee Benefits
practice and Global Energy practice performed well. These are two areas we have
identified as high growth potential and are investing in. Our UK and Ireland
business also performed well; in particular Corporate Risk Solutions showed
good growth.

North America:

North
America reported 7 percent organic revenue growth in 2006, with strong
growth across the business reflecting the results of our hiring strategy over
the past two years and our sales culture. Geographies doing particularly well
in the year include the Northeast, Central and Southeast. Our Executive Risks
and Employee Benefits practices also continued to perform well.


International:

Organic revenue growth in commissions and fees was 8 percent
for 2006 compared with 2005 reflecting good business growth despite a declining
rate environment. Latin America (in particular Venezuela, Mexico and Brazil),
Asia (Singapore, Hong Kong, Korea and China), Iberia and Italy all performed
well.

Following
a change to our internal reporting structure effective January 1, 2006,
North America Global Markets and International Global Markets revenues, which
were previously reported within our Global division, are now reported in the
North America and International divisions, respectively. In addition, we
refined our method of allocating revenues between the Global and North America
divisions. As a result of these changes, $109 million of revenues previously
reported within our Global division in 2005 (2004: $123 million) have been
reclassified between the North America ($45 million) and International
divisions ($64 million) (2004: North America $46 million and International $77
million).

(ii)

Organic revenue growth
excludes the impact of foreign currency translation, acquisitions and
disposals, and market remuneration from reported revenues. We use organic
growth as a measure of business growth generated by operations that were part
of the Group at the end of the period. Our method of calculating this measure
may differ from that used by other companies and therefore comparability may be
limited.

2005 revenues at $2,267 million were
broadly in line with 2004 with the benefit of an increase from net new business
growth and an increase attributable to net acquisitions and disposals being
offset by the reduction in market remuneration.

Net acquisitions and disposals added
1 percent to total revenues in 2005 compared with 2004. In Global, the
benefit of recent acquisitions, mainly the Coyle Hamilton and Opus acquisitions
in second half 2004, was offset by the impact of the Stewart Smith sale in April 2005.
In North America, growth attributable to acquisitions was mainly due to the CGI
Consulting and Primary acquisitions in first quarter 2005.

Market remuneration was significantly lower
in 2005 at $29 million compared with $148 million in 2004. This reduction
followed our announcement in October 2004 that we were voluntarily
abolishing contingent commission arrangements.

Organic revenues in 2005 were
5 percent higher than in 2004, with net new business growth in all our
operations and improved client retention in 2005 only partly offset by soft or
declining rates in most of our markets.

Global:

Organic
revenues were 5 percent higher in 2005 compared with 2004. Rates were soft
in virtually all the sectors we operated in and in the reinsurance market we
saw a trend towards more centralized buying and higher retentions. Despite the
highly competitive market, net new business growth improved and we saw some
benefit in the London market from market remuneration migrating to fees. Our
Aerospace and Niche businesses in Global Specialties performed well.

North America:

North
America reported 5 percent revenue growth in 2005 compared with 2004
despite declining rates particularly in the first half of 2005. Net new
business growth remained robust


across all
regions and businesses with improved retention rates also a significant
contributor. Overall, most regional sectors performed well and we saw good
growth in the financial institutions and large account practices. In our large
account practice, we saw a sustained increase in requests for proposals with
total new business in 2005 higher than that achieved in 2004.

International:

International revenues were 4 percent higher than in
2004 as net new business growth and improved client retention in most regions
more than offset the impact of a further softening of rates in many areas.
South Africa, Russia, Latin America and Asia all performed well.

General and administrative expenses at
$1,911

million for 2006 were
$122

million, or 7

percent, higher than in 2005. Foreign
currency translation had a net


percent adverse impact
and there was a net nil impact from acquisitions net of disposals.

General and administrative expenses have
been adversely impacted by significant charges in both 2006 and 2005. In 2006
we incurred $96

million of
expenditure on strategic initiatives, as discussed above, and in 2005 we
incurred significant first quarter charges relating to: the first quarter 2005
headcount reduction program, $28 million; a $20 million additional charge for
legal provisions; and $9 million of costs related to regulatory settlements.

Salaries
and benefits were $1,457

million
in 2006 compared with $1,384 million in 2005. The compensation ratio
(salaries and benefits as a percentage of revenues) at 60

percent was down from 61

percent in 2005 and was mainly
impacted by:

·

pensions:

the pension charge in 2006 was $


million
lower than in 2005 which was mainly attributable to an increased return on
assets in the UK plan due to higher asset levels, reflecting the good returns
in 2005 and increased contributions by the Company, and an increase in the
expected rate of return assumption from 7.25 percent to 7.75 percent. In
addition, the US charge benefited from savings attributable to the 2005
headcount reduction program; and

·

the
benefit of net new business and an increased revenue contribution from our
recent hires;

offset by

·

severance:

severance costs
were $41

million in 2006 of
which $35

million related to our
strategic initiatives under which nearly 500 positions have been eliminated.
Severance costs were $


million
in 2005 of which $28 million related to a headcount reduction program in first
quarter 2005 under which approximately 500 positions were eliminated. We do not
expect to initiate a major headcount reduction program in 2007 and therefore
expect severance costs will be significantly lower in 2007 compared with both
2006 and 2005;


·

a $


million
reduction in market remuneration.

Net headcount on a full-time equivalent basis
at December 31, 2006 was approximately

13,000

compared with 12,800 at December 31, 2005. For the year ended December 31,
2006 average revenues per employee were approximately $

186,000

compared with $174,000 per employee for fiscal 2005.

Other expenses at $454

million were $49

million, or 12

percent, higher than in 2005 of which


percent was attributable to the
impact of net acquisitions and disposals and


percent
to foreign currency translation.

Other
expenses were 19

percent of
revenues in 2006 compared with 18 percent in 2005 with the net increase mainly
attributable to:

·

the $37

million expenditure on strategic
initiatives in 2006; partly offset by

·

an
additional $20 million provision for legal claims following the March 31,
2005 review of legal proceedings and $9 million of legal costs relating to the
2005 regulatory settlements.

2005 compared with 2004

General and administrative expenses at
$1,789 million in 2005 were $180 million, or 11 percent, higher
than in 2004 of which 3 percent was attributable to acquisitions net of
disposals and foreign currency translation.

Salaries and benefits were
$1,384 million, or 61 percent of revenues, in 2005 compared with
$1,218 million, or 54 percent of revenues, in 2004. The increase in
the compensation ratio (salaries and benefits as a percentage of revenues) was
mainly attributable to the $119 million reduction in market remuneration
and the incremental cost of net new hires and higher costs to retain and
incentivize existing staff, together with a $20 million increase in
severance costs, primarily relating to the first quarter 2005 headcount
reduction program, and the impact of foreign currency translation. Excluding
severance costs relating to the first quarter headcount reduction program, the
compensation ratio was 60 percent in 2005.

Other expenses
at $405 million were 4 percent higher than 2004 of which
5 percent was attributable to acquisitions net of disposals and foreign
currency translation. There was an underlying decrease of 1 percent
despite an additional $20 million provision for legal claims following the
March 31, 2005 review of legal cases and increased legal costs mainly
relating to regulatory proceedings. This decrease reflected strong controls on
discretionary spending throughout 2005.

Regulatory settlements

As discussed in
detail in Note 9 to our Consolidated Financial Statements, we entered into
agreements with the New York Attorney General, the New York Superintendent of
Insurance and the Minnesota Attorney General in second quarter 2005 under which
we paid $51 million into bank accounts for reimbursement funds.

compared with 2005

Operating
margin was 23 percent in 2006 compared with 20 percent in 2005. Our
margins in 2006 and 2005 have been impacted by a number of significant items:

·

the
$102 million profit on the sale of our UK head office in second half 2006
(equivalent to


percent of
revenues);

·

$105 million
of expenditure in 2006 in support of our “Shaping Our Future’’ strategic
initiatives (equivalent to 4 percent of revenues);

·

the $78
million gain on the sale of Stewart Smith in 2005 (equivalent to


percent of revenues); and

·

first
quarter 2005 charges for: regulatory settlements and related costs, $60
million; the first quarter 2005 headcount reduction program, $28 million; and a
$20 million additional charge for legal provisions following the March 31,
2005 review of legal proceedings (in total, equivalent to


percent of revenues).

The year on
year improvement in 2006 operating margin also reflected lower pension charges,
the benefit of net new business and increased productivity from recent hires,
partly offset by the impact of lower market remuneration.

2005 compared with 2004

Operating
margin at 20 percent for 2005 was significantly lower than 2004 and was
impacted by:

·

the first
quarter 2005 provision for regulatory settlements of $51 million and
related legal costs of $9 million;

·

a
$20 million increase in severance costs primarily as a result of the first
quarter 2005 headcount reduction program;

·

an
additional $20 million increase in the provision for claims following the March 31,
2005 review of legal proceedings; and

·

a
$67 million increase in net gains on disposal compared with 2004 mainly
reflecting the $78 million gain on the sale of Stewart Smith in second
quarter 2005.

The net effect
of these items was to reduce operating margin by 1 percent. The remaining
decline in operating margin was mainly attributable to: the $119 million
reduction in market remuneration; increased retention and recruitment costs;
the impact of foreign currency translation; and the effect of Stewart Smith
which was sold in April 2005.

Interest expense

Interest
expense in 2006 was $38 million, compared with $30 million in 2005
and $22 million in 2004, with the increases mainly due to higher average
levels of debt at higher interest rates following the replacement of the
$450 million term loan with $600 million of senior notes in July 2005,
as part of our long term capital structure planning, and the $200 million
drawdown on the revolving credit facility in the latter part of 2006.

The effective tax rate in 2006 was
12 percent compared with 34 percent in 2005. The lower effective tax
rate was primarily attributable to a $65 million tax credit arising in fourth
quarter 2006 and a low effective tax rate on the capital gain on the disposal
of our UK head office building. The tax credit reflects the resolution of
complex tax issues relating to the original KKR acquisition structure and
subsequent internal restructurings. In addition, there was a $6 million credit
in fourth quarter 2006 relating to deferred tax on acquired intangibles. The
$71 million fourth quarter tax credit contributed $

0.45

to diluted earnings per share in 2006.

The effective
tax rate in 2005 was 34 percent. The net impact of the effect of tax on
net disposals, the amortization of intangibles, and the $60 million of
regulatory settlements and related costs was 2 percent, of which
approximately 3 percent was attributable to the $78 million profit on
disposal of Stewart Smith and a negative 1 percent to the tax effect of
the regulatory settlements and related costs. Excluding the effect of tax on
net disposals of operations, the amortization of intangible assets, and
regulatory settlements and related costs, the underlying tax rate was
32 percent compared with 33 percent in 2004 which contributed
approximately $0.04 to diluted earnings per share in 2005.

diluted share in 2005. Net income in both 2006 and 2005 has been impacted by a
number of significant items: the third quarter 2006 sale of our London head
office building, less related leaseback costs, equivalent to $0.58 per diluted
share; the 2006 “Shaping our Future’’ expenditure, equivalent to $0.47 per
diluted share; the $71 million tax credit in fourth quarter 2006, equivalent to
$0.45 per diluted share; the gain on the sale of Stewart Smith in second
quarter 2005, equivalent to $0.25 per diluted share; and the first quarter 2005
charges for regulatory settlements and related costs, the headcount reduction
program and the March 31, 2005 review of legal proceedings, equivalent to
$0.43 per diluted share.

Foreign
currency translation had a negative $

impact on earnings per diluted share in 2006 compared with 2005. A five million
reduction in average diluted share count contributed $

0.09

to 2006 diluted earnings per share.

2005 compared with 2004

Net income for 2005 was $281 million,
or $1.72 per diluted share, compared with $402 million, or $2.42 per diluted
share, in 2004. Net income in 2005 was impacted by a number of significant
items: the $36 million post-tax cost of regulatory settlements in first
quarter 2005 together with related legal costs,


equivalent to
$0.22 per diluted share; the $19 million post-tax cost of the first
quarter 2005 headcount reduction program, equivalent to $0.12 per diluted
share; the $14 million post-tax cost of the additional $20 million
provision for legal claims following the March 31, 2005 review of legal
cases, equivalent to $0.09 per diluted share; and the $41 million post-tax
net gain on disposal of operations primarily relating to the second quarter
2005 sale of Stewart Smith, equivalent to $0.25 per diluted share. The decrease
excluding these significant items was mainly attributable to the reduction in
market remuneration; increased retention and recruitment costs; the impact of
foreign currency translation; and the effect of Stewart Smith which was sold in
April 2005; partly offset by the lower tax rate.

Excluding the gain on disposal in second quarter 2005, Stewart Smith’s
results contributed $Nil to net income per diluted share in 2005 and $0.12 in
2004. The following table shows the impact of Stewart Smith on results in the
periods prior to sale:

Foreign
currency translation reduced net income per diluted share by approximately
$0.06 for fiscal 2005 compared with fiscal 2004.

ACCOUNTING
CHANGES

Share-based
compensation

Effective January 1, 2006, the Company
adopted the fair value recognition provisions of FAS 123R

,

using the modified-retrospective transition method. Under that transition
method, compensation cost recognized from January 1, 2006 includes:
(a) compensation cost for all share-based payments granted prior to, but not
yet vested as of January 1, 2006, based on the grant date fair value
estimated in accordance with the original provisions of FAS 123,

Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation

, and
(b) compensation cost for all share-based payments granted subsequent to January 1,
2006, based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the
provisions of FAS 123R.

Results for all prior periods have been
retrospectively adjusted to recognize the compensation cost previously reported
in the pro forma footnote disclosures under the provisions of FAS 123.

As a consequence of the adoption of FAS
123R, we recognized share-based compensation of $18 million in both 2006
and 2005.

In addition to
the income statement, the adoption of FAS 123R impacted our prior period diluted
sharecount with diluted sharecount for 2005 being reduced by 1 million to 163
million and 2004 diluted sharecount by 2 million to 166 million as proceeds
under the treasury stock method were adjusted. The proceeds were adjusted to
include average unrecognized compensation cost outstanding in the period and
for changes to the calculation of future tax consequences. When we reported
previously under APB 25, time options granted at market value gave no rise to
an accounting charge and hence there was no increase from unrecognized
compensation cost to assumed proceeds under the treasury stock method.


Pensions:
market-related value

Effective January 1, 2006, the Company
changed the methodology used to determine the market-related value of UK
pension plan assets.

FAS 87,

Employers’ Accounting for
Pensions

, requires the expected return on plan assets to be
determined based on the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets and
the market-related value of plan assets. The market-related value of plan
assets may either be a fair value or a calculated value that recognizes changes
in a systematic and rational manner over not more than five years.

The Company has two principal defined
benefit plans: one in the United Kingdom and the other in the United States.
Prior to January 1, 2006, the market-related value of the UK pension plan
assets was determined using a calculated value that recognized asset gains or
losses over five years whereas the market-related value of US pension plan
assets was determined on a fair value basis. Effective January 1, 2006,
the Company changed its method for determining the market-related value of UK
pension plan assets to a fair value basis. The Company believes that fair value
is a preferable measure of determining the market-related value of plan assets
as it more fairly reflects the actual value of pension plan assets as of the
balance sheet date. In addition, it aligns the methodology used for calculating
the market-related value of plan assets for the Company’s two principal defined
benefit plans.

In accordance with FAS 154,

Accounting Changes and Error Corrections,

the change in
method of determining the market-related value of plan assets has been applied
retrospectively by adjusting all prior periods presented.

The
impact of this retrospective adjustment is to increase the UK pension charge
for 2005 by $10 million to $41 million and for 2004 by $27 million to $35
million, with a related adverse impact on diluted earnings per share for 2005
of $0.04 and on 2004 diluted earnings per share of $0.09. The increase in the
2005 and 2004 UK pension charges as a result of the change in accounting
methodology is mainly attributable to the recognition under the fair value
method of net prior period asset losses brought forward at January 1, 2005
and 2004 that had previously been deferred under the calculated value
methodology. The recognition of these losses:

·

reduces
the market related value of assets at January 1, 2005 and 2004 which
consequentially reduces the return on assets leading to an increase in the 2005
and 2004 pension charges; and

·

increases
actuarial losses at January 1, 2005 and 2004 which leads to an increased
amortization charge and consequently a further increase in the 2005 and 2004
pension charges.

If we
had used the previous calculated value methodology in 2006, the UK pension
expense for 2006 would have been $23 million higher. The lower charge under the
new fair value methodology mainly reflects the recognition of net asset gains
at January 1, 2006 that would have been deferred under the calculated
value methodology. The recognition of these gains:

·

increased
the market related value of assets at January 1, 2006 which
consequentially increased the return on assets leading to a decrease in the
2006 pension charge; and

·

reduced
actuarial losses at January 1, 2006 which led to a lower amortization
charge and consequently a further decrease in the 2006 pension charge.


Pensions—adoption
of FAS 158

·

In September 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
issued FAS 158,

Employers’ Accounting for
Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans—an amendment of
FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106 and 132(R)

(‘FAS 158’),
which required an employer to:

·

recognize
in its statement of financial position the funded status of a benefit plan
measured as the difference between the fair value of plan assets and the benefit
obligation;

·

recognize,
net of tax, the gains or losses and prior service costs or credits that arise
during the period but are not recognized as components of net periodic benefit
cost;

·

measure
defined benefit plan assets and obligations as of the date of the employer’s
statement of financial position; and

·

disclose
additional information in the notes to the financial statements about certain
effects on net periodic benefit cost for the next fiscal year that arise from
delayed recognition of the gains or losses, prior service costs or credits and
transition asset or obligation.

The
requirements of FAS 158 are applied prospectively upon adoption. The
requirements to recognize the funded status of a defined benefit postretirement
plan and provide related disclosures are effective for fiscal years ending
after December 15, 2006, and have been applied for the year ended December 31,
2006. The adoption of FAS 158 has resulted in a $189 million post tax charge to
other comprehensive income as at December 31, 2006.

ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES

The Company’s
accounting policies are described in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements. Management considers that the following accounting estimates or
assumptions are the most important to the presentation of the Company’s
financial condition or operating performance. Management has discussed its
critical accounting estimates and associated disclosures with our Audit
Committee.

that cover almost all our employees in the United States and United Kingdom,
although the UK plan was closed to new entrants in January 2006. New
entrants in the United Kingdom will now be offered the opportunity to join a
defined contribution plan. Elsewhere, pension benefits are typically provided
through defined contribution plans.

We make a number of assumptions when
determining our pension liabilities and pension expense which are reviewed
annually by senior management and changed where appropriate. The discount rate
will be changed annually if underlying rates have moved whereas the expected
long-term return on assets will be changed less frequently as longer term
trends in asset returns emerge. Other material assumptions include rates of
participant mortality, the expected long-term rate of compensation and pension
increases and rates of employee termination.

Effective January 1, 2006 we increased
our long-term expected rate of return assumption for our UK pension plan
assets from 7.25 percent to 7.75 percent. This change reflects management’s
best estimate of the longer term performance of the UK fund taking into account
average returns over the last ten years, the current asset mix and market
expectations. The increase in the long-term rate of return on assets assumption
benefited the 2006 pension expense by approximately $9 million.

Net pension expense for our defined benefit
pension plans in 2006 was $29 million, a decrease of $33 million
compared with 2005 of which $25 million related to the UK plan. The
decrease in the UK expense was mainly attributable to an increased return
on assets in the UK plan due to higher asset


levels,
reflecting the good returns in 2005 and increased contributions by the Company,
and an increase in the expected rate of return assumption from 7.25 percent to
7.75 percent. The US pension charge was $8 million lower in 2006 with the
decrease mainly due to savings attributable to the 2005 headcount reduction
program.

Based on December 31,
2006 assumptions, we expect our net pension expense in 2007 to decrease by
approximately $35 million compared with 2006 principally attributable to a
$25 million increase in the expected return on UK plan assets partly reflecting
higher asset levels following the incremental contributions made in 2006.

Expected long-term rates of return on plan
assets are developed from the expected future returns of the various asset
classes using the target asset allocations. The expected long-term rate of
return used for determining the net UK pension expense in 2006 was
7.75 percent, up from 7.25 percent in 2005, and equivalent to an
expected return in 2006 of $143 million. The actual return in 2006 was
$141 million.

Rates used to discount pension plan
liabilities at December 31, 2006 were based on yields prevailing at that
date of high quality corporate bonds of appropriate maturity. The selected rate
used to discount UK plan liabilities was 5.3 percent compared with
4.9 percent at December 31, 2005 with the increase reflecting an
increase in long term bond rates in the United Kingdom during 2006. The higher
discount rate at December 31, 2006 generated an actuarial gain of
$151 million at December 31, 2006 which was partly offset by a $53
million actuarial loss attributable to an increase in the inflation assumption.

Mortality
assumptions at December 31, 2006 were unchanged from December 31,
2005. As an indication of the longevity assumed, our calculations assume that a
UK male retiree aged 65 at December 31, 2006 would have a life expectancy
of 20 years.

The expected long-term rate of return used
for determining the net US pension expense in 2006 was 8.0 percent,
compared with an actual return of 14.6 percent. The rate used to discount
US plan liabilities at December 31, 2006 was 6.0 percent, determined based
on expected plan cash flows discounted using a corporate bond yield curve, an
increase of 0.25 percent compared with the rate used at December 31, 2005.

The mortality
assumption for the US plan at December 31, 2006 was unchanged from 2005.
As an indication of the longevity assumed, our calculations assume that a US
male retiree aged 65 at December 31, 2006 would have a life expectancy of
18 years.

Income
taxes

We are subject to the income tax laws of
the various tax jurisdictions in which we operate, principally the United
States and United Kingdom. These tax laws are complex and subject to different
interpretations by taxpayers and the tax authorities. When establishing income
tax provisions, we therefore make a number of judgments and interpretations
about the application and interaction of these tax laws. We have estimated tax
reserves that we believe are adequate in relation to the potential for future
assessments. Once established, we only adjust tax reserves when more
information is available or when an event occurs necessitating a change to tax
reserves. Changes in these tax laws or our interpretations of these laws and
the resolution of current and future tax audits could significantly impact our
effective tax rate and results of operations in a given period.

We recognize deferred tax assets and
liabilities for the estimated future tax consequences of events attributable to
differences between the financial statements carrying amounts of existing
assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating and capital
loss and tax credit carryforwards. We estimate deferred tax assets and
liabilities and assess the need for any valuation allowances using enacted
rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to be recovered
or settled taking into account our business plans and tax planning strategies.

At December 31,
2006, the Company had gross deferred tax assets of $247 million (2005:
$319 million) against which a valuation allowance of $73 million
(2005: $110 million) had been recognized. To the extent that the actual
future taxable income in the periods during which the temporary differences are
expected to reverse differs from current projections, or assumed prudent and
feasible tax planning strategies fail to materialize, or new tax planning
strategies are developed, or material changes occur in actual tax rates or loss
carry forward time limits, the Company may adjust the deferred tax asset
considered realizable in future periods. Such adjustments could result in a significant
increase or decrease in the effective tax rate and have a material impact on
our net income.

Commitments,
contingencies and accrued liabilities

We purchase
professional indemnity insurance which in part covers the errors and omission
claims arising in the ordinary course of business. The terms of this insurance
vary by policy year and self-insured risks have increased significantly over
recent years. We have established provisions against various actual and
potential claims, lawsuits and other proceedings relating principally to
alleged errors and omissions in connection with the placement of insurance and
reinsurance in the ordinary course of business. Such provisions cover claims
that have been reported but not paid and also claims that have been incurred
but not reported. These provisions are established based on actuarial estimates
together with individual case reviews and are believed to be adequate in the
light of current information and legal advice.

NEW
ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

In July 2006, the Financial Accounting
Standards Board (“FASB’’) issued FASB Interpretation No. 48,

Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes—an interpretation of FASB
Statement No. 109

(“FIN 48’’), which clarifies the
accounting for uncertainty in tax positions.


The
evaluation of a tax position under FIN 48 is a two-step process:

·

The first step is recognition

Tax positions
taken or expected to be taken in a tax return should be recognized only if
those positions are more likely than not of being sustained upon examination,
based on the technical merits of the position. In evaluating whether a tax
position has met the more likely than not recognition threshold, it should be
presumed that the position will be examined by the relevant taxing authority
that would have full knowledge of all relevant information.

·

The second
step is measurement

Tax positions that meet the recognition
criteria are measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50
percent likely of being recognized upon ultimate settlement.

FIN 48 also provides guidance on
derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim
periods, disclosure and transition. FIN 48 is effective for fiscal years
beginning after December 15, 2006 and will be adopted by the Company as of
January 1, 2007.

The Company has
evaluated the impact of adopting FIN 48 and has concluded that it will not
be material.

LIQUIDITY
AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

On
July 26, 2006 the Board authorized a new share buyback program for $1
billion. This replaced our previous $500 million buyback program and its
remaining $140 million authorization. We purchased 5.4 million shares in
2006 at a cost of $211

million,
including 3.8 million shares under an accelerated share repurchase program,
leaving us with $789 million remaining under our $1 billion buyback
authorization at December 31, 2006. Market conditions permitting, we
expect to utilize the remaining authorization over the next two years or sooner
if possible. We believe that the strength of our balance sheet would allow us
to increase our leverage to fund some of these additional buybacks.

Operating
activities

As an intermediary, we hold funds generally in a
fiduciary capacity for the account of third parties, typically as the result of
premiums received from clients that are in transit to insurers and claims due
to clients that are in transit from insurers. We report premiums, which are
held on account of, or due from, clients as assets with a corresponding
liability due to the insurers. Claims held by, or due to, us which are due to
clients are also shown as both assets and liabilities. All these balances due
or payable are included in accounts receivable and accounts payable on the
balance sheet. We earn interest on these funds during the time between the
receipt of the cash and the time the cash is paid out. Fiduciary cash must be
kept in certain regulated bank accounts subject to guidelines, which generally
emphasize capital preservation and liquidity, and is not generally available to
service our debt or for other corporate purposes.

Net cash provided by operating activities,
which excludes fiduciary cash movements, was $147 million in 2006 compared
with $95 million in 2005 and $360 million in 2004. In 2006, we paid
contributions into our UK and US pension funds of $


million compared with $


million in 2005 and $


million in
2004. Compared with 2004, both 2006 and 2005 cash inflows have been lower as a
result of the abolition of volume and profit-based contingent commissions
and the significant reduction in other market remuneration.


Net cash
provided by operations in 2005 was also adversely impacted by a
reclassification of approximately $134 million own funds to fiduciary
funds under Financial Services Authority (“FSA”) regulations in the United
Kingdom which came into force in January 2005 and affected the timing of
transferring commissions from fiduciary funds to own funds. The regulations
changed the basis for the withdrawal of commissions from fiduciary funds to own
funds from an earned to a receipts basis, with a consequential increase in
fiduciary funds and decrease in own funds.

Investing
activities

Total net cash provided by investing
activities was $67 million in 2006 compared with $32 million in 2005
and a $183 million outflow in 2004.

Cash used for acquisitions of subsidiaries
in 2006 amounted to $73 million (net of cash acquired), and was primarily
incurred in acquiring Gueits, Adams & Company and International
Insurance Brokers, Inc. in the United States, Reinsurance Consultants in
South Africa, Nicon in Sweden, MGT Corredores de Seguros in Chile and
acquisitions of minority interests in Sweden, Norway and Columbia.

In September 2006, we acquired a
further 5 percent of Gras Savoye & Cie, our French associate, for
$25 million bringing our total interest to 38 percent. The acquisition was
pursuant to

a put arrangement we
entered into in 1997, see ‘Contractual Obligations’ below.

In September 2006, we also completed
the sale of our UK head office at Ten Trinity Square. Gross proceeds from the
sale were $202 million. We have leased back the property at an annual
rental of $12 million until 2008 when we expect to move into our new
London offices.

Net cash proceeds from the sale of
operations in 2005 totaled $90 million pre-tax and were mainly
attributable to the sale of Stewart Smith on April 14, 2005. Cash used for
acquisitions in 2005 amounted to $35 million (net of cash acquired) was
primarily incurred in acquiring: CGI Consulting Group, Inc., now Willis
Benefits of Pennsylvania, Inc., a US employee benefits firm and Primary
Worldwide Corporation in the US; C.R. King and Partners Limited in the United
Kingdom; J.H. Asesores y Corredores de Seguros S.A. a Peruvian broker; K.R.
Athos Consultoria e Corretora de Seguros de Vida S/C Ltd, a Brazilian
employee benefits firm; and Essence, a Taiwanese broker.

Cash used for acquisitions in 2004 totaled
$147 million (net of cash acquired). The cash was used primarily for the
acquisitions of: Coyle Hamilton, the Republic of Ireland’s largest privately
owned insurance broker; the controlling interest in Willis A/S, Denmark’s
largest insurance broker; two reinsurance brokers in Italy and Denmark; and
Opus, a regional insurance broking business in the United Kingdom.

We have historically funded acquisitions
with cash or a combination of cash and equity. Depending on the acquisition and
the economics of the transaction, we would expect this pattern to continue.

Capital
expenditures for 2006, 2005 and 2004 were $55 million, $32 million
and $49 million, respectively. We have funded our requirements for capital
expenditures by cash generated internally from operations and expect to
continue to do so in the future.

Financing
activities

Cash used in financing activities amounted
to $129 million in 2006, compared with $270 million in 2005 and $203 million in
2004.

We continued to buy back shares in 2006,
repurchasing 5.4 million shares for $211 million during the year
compared with 10.3 million shares for $360 million in 2005 and
9.3 million shares at a cost of $339 million in 2004.


We increased our external debt by $200
million in 2006 by drawing down on our revolving credit facility, with the
increase primarily funding our increased pension contributions. In 2005, the
completion of our senior notes offering of $600 million in July 2005
and the subsequent repayment of the $450 million term loan generated a net
cash inflow of $143 million. There was a net inflow of $63 million
from refinancing debt in 2004.

Excess tax benefits from share-based
payment arrangements were $11 million in 2006 compared with $45 million
in 2005 and $130 million in 2004 reflecting a decrease in the level of
options exercised over the period.

Cash div

idends paid in 2006 were $145 million compared with $135

million in 2005 and $115

million in 2004. In February 2007,
the quarterly cash dividend declared was increased by 6 percent to $0.25 per
share, an annual rate of $1.00 per share. At this rate, the expected
annual cost of dividends payable in 2007 will be approximately $


million. We have funded dividends
from cash generated internally by operations and expect to do so in the future.

As of December 31,
2006, we had cash and cash equivalents of $288 million, compared with
$193 million at December 31, 2005, and $100 million of our $300
million revolving credit facility remained available to draw.

included in the above table as we are not able to predict when and how much we
will draw on the facility in the future

(ii)

Based
on the earliest dates on which options could be exercised

In November 2004, we entered into a
25 year agreement with British Land plc relating to our new UK headquarters
in London. Construction commenced in early 2005 and our occupancy is targeted
for early 2008. Our contractual obligations in relation to this commitment
totaling $918 million are included in the table above, but are contingent
upon the successful completion of construction.

Following changes to UK pensions
legislation in 2005, we are now required to agree a funding strategy for
our UK defined benefit plan with the plan’s trustees. In January 2006, we
agreed to make additional 2007 contributions of $98 million.

In connection with many of our investments
in less than wholly-owned subsidiaries and associates, we retain rights
to increase our ownership percentage over time, typically to a majority or
100 percent ownership position. In addition, in certain instances, the
other owners have a right, typically at a


price calculated
pursuant to a formula based on revenues or earnings, to put some or all of
their shares to us.

As part of the 1997 acquisition of our
initial 33 percent shareholding of Gras Savoye, we entered into a put
arrangement, whereby the other shareholders in Gras Savoye (primarily two
families, two insurance companies and Gras Savoye’s executive management team)
could put their shares to us. Until 2011, we will be obligated to buy the
shares of certain shareholders to the extent those shareholders put their
shares, potentially increasing our ownership from 38 percent to
90 percent if all shareholders put their shares, at a price determined by
a contractual formula based on earnings and revenue. We acquired an additional
5 percent of Gras Savoye at a cost of $25 million under these arrangements
in September 2006. Management shareholders of Gras Savoye (representing
approximately 10 percent of shares) do not have general put rights before
2011, but have certain put rights on their death, disability or retirement from
which payments, at December 31, 2006 based on the formula would not have
exceeded $64 million. The shareholders may put their shares individually
at any time during the put period.

While neither
we nor the management of Gras Savoye expect significant exercises of the puts,
on a separate or aggregate basis, in the near to medium term, we nevertheless
believe that, should the aggregate amount of shares be put to us, sufficient
funds would be available to satisfy this obligation. In addition, we have a
call option to move to majority ownership under certain circumstances and in
any event by December 2009. Upon exercising this call option, the
remaining Gras Savoye shareholders have a put option.

Off-balance
sheet transactions

Apart from
commitments, guarantees and contingencies, as disclosed in Note 9 of the
Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company has no off-balance sheet
arrangements that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a material effect on
the Company’s financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.

Item 7A—Quantitative
and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk

Financial
Risk Management

We are exposed to market risk from changes
in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. In order to manage the
risk arising from these exposures, we enter into a variety of interest rate and
foreign currency derivatives. We do not hold derivative or financial
instruments for trading purposes.

A discussion of
our accounting policies for financial and derivative instruments is included in
Note 2 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements and further
disclosure is provided in Note 15 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial
Statements.

Foreign
exchange risk management

We conduct our business in over 100
currencies. Accordingly, movements in currency exchange rates may affect our
results.

We report our operating results and financial condition in US dollars.
Our US operations earn revenue and incur expenses primarily in US dollars. In
the United Kingdom, however, we earn revenue in a number of different
currencies, but expenses are almost entirely incurred in pounds sterling.
Outside the United States and the United Kingdom, we predominantly generate
revenue and expenses in the local currency. The table below gives an
approximate analysis of revenues and expenses by currency in 2006.

Our operations are exposed to foreign
exchange risk arising from cash flows and financial instruments that are
denominated in currencies other than the US dollar. Our primary foreign
exchange risk arises from changes in the exchange rates between US dollars and
pounds sterling. Our objective is to maximize our cash flow in US dollars. Generally,
our policy is to convert into pounds sterling all revenue arising in currencies
other than US dollars together with sufficient US dollar revenues to fund the
remaining pound sterling expenses. Outside the United Kingdom only those cash
flows necessary to fund mismatches between revenues and expenses are converted
into local currency. Amounts remitted to the United Kingdom are usually converted
into pounds sterling and the currency exposures managed by entering into
forward exchange contracts. Generally, it is our policy to hedge at least
25 percent of the next 12 months’ exposure in significant currencies.
We do not hedge exposures beyond three years.

The table below provides information about our foreign currency forward
exchange contracts, which are sensitive to exchange rate risk. The table
summarizes the US dollar equivalent amounts of each currency bought and sold
forward and the weighted average contractual exchange rates. All forward
exchange contracts mature within three years.

Interest
rate risk management

Our operations are financed principally by
$600 million fixed rate Senior Notes issued by a subsidiary which are
split between $250 million due 2010 and $350 million due 2015. As of December 31,
2006 we had also drawn down $200 million on our $300 million
Revolving Credit Facility which expires in 2010. The interest rate applicable
to this borrowing is variable according to the period of each individual
drawdown.

We are also subject to market risk from
exposure to changes in interest rates based on our investing activities where
our primary interest rate risk arises from changes in short-term interest rates
in both US dollars and pounds sterling.

As a consequence of our insurance and
reinsurance broking activities, there is a delay between the time we receive
cash for premiums and claims and the time the cash needs to be paid. We earn
interest on this float, which is included in our consolidated financial
statements as investment income. This float is regulated in terms of access and
the instruments in which it may be invested, most of which are short-term in
maturity. We manage the interest rate risk arising from this exposure primarily
through the use of interest rate swaps. It is our policy that, for currencies
with significant balances, a minimum of 25 percent of forecast income
arising is hedged for each of the next three years.


The table below provides information about our derivative instruments
and other financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest. For
interest rate swaps, the table presents notional principal amounts and average
interest rates analyzed by expected maturity dates. Notional principal amounts
are used to calculate the contractual payments to be exchanged under the
contracts. The duration of interest rate swaps varies between one and four
years, with re-fixing periods of three months. Average fixed and variable rates
are, respectively, the weighted-average actual and market rates for the
interest hedges in place. Market rates are the rates prevailing at December 31,
2006 or 2005, as appropriate.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC
ACCOUNTING FIRM

To

the
Board of Directors and Stockholders of Willis Group Holdings Limited

Hamilton, Bermuda

We have audited the
accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Willis Group Holdings Limited and
subsidiaries (collectively, the ‘‘Company’’) as of December 31, 2006 and 2005,
and the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders’ equity and
comprehensive income, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period
ended December 31, 2006. Our audits also included the financial statement
schedule listed in the index at Item 15. These financial statements and
financial statement schedule are the responsibility of Willis Group Holdings
Limited management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the
financial statements and financial statement schedule based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the
standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit
also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates
made by management as well as evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our
opinion.

In our opinion, such
consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the
financial position of Willis Group Holdings Limited and subsidiaries as of
December 31, 2006 and 2005, and the results of their operations and their cash
flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2006, in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
of America. Also, in our opinion, such financial statement schedule, when
considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as
a whole, presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth
therein.

We have also audited in accordance with the standards
of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) the
effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of
December 31, 2006, based on the criteria established in Internal
Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February

28,
2007 expressed an unqualified opinion on management’s assessment of the
effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting and an
unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over
financial reporting.

As discussed in Note 2, the accompanying 2005 and 2004
financial statements have been retrospectively adjusted for the adoption of
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123R,

Share Based
Payment

, and retrospectively adjusted for the change in method for
determining the market related value of plan assets of the Company’s UK defined
benefit pension plan from a calculated value method to the fair value method.

As discussed in Note 2 to
the financial statements, in 2006 the Company changed its method of accounting
for its defined benefit pension plans to adopt Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 158,

Employers’ Accounting for
Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plan—an amendment of FASB
Statements No. 87, 88, 106, and 132R.

2.

BASIS
OF PRESENTATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

These
consolidated financial statements conform to accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America (“US GAAP”). Presented below are
summaries of:

·

Accounting
policy changes made in 2006;

·

Recent
accounting pronouncements; and

·

Major accounting policies followed in the preparation of the
accompanying consolidated financial statements.

Accounting Policy Changes in 2006

During
2006 the Company:

·

changed
the methodology used to determine the market-related value of UK pension plan
assets;

·

adopted
Financial Accounting Standard (“FAS”) 123R,

Share-Based
Payment,

(“FAS 123R”) using the modified-retrospective transition
method; and

·

adopted
FAS 158,

Employers’ Accounting for Defined Benefit
Pension and Other Postretirement Plans—an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87,
88, 106 and 132(R)

(“FAS 158”).

Each of these
accounting changes is discussed in more detail below.

Pensions—change
in methodology

FAS 87,

Employers’
Accounting for Pensions

, (“FAS 87”) requires the expected return on
plan assets to be determined based on the expected long-term rate of return on
plan assets and the market-related value of plan assets. The market-related
value of plan assets may either be a fair value or a calculated value that
recognizes changes in a systematic and rational manner over not more than five
years. Up to December 31, 2005, the market-related value of UK pension
plan assets was determined using a calculated value that recognized asset gains
or losses over five years. Effective January 1, 2006, the Company changed
its method for determining the market-related value of UK pension plan assets
to a fair value basis. The Company believes that fair value is a preferable
measure of determining the market-related value of plan assets as it more
fairly reflects the actual value of pension plan assets as of the balance sheet
date. In addition, it brings the methodology used for calculating the
market-related value of UK plan assets in line with the fair value methodology
already used to value US plan assets.


WILLIS GROUP HOLDINGS LIMITED

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

2.

BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND SIGNIFICANT
ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)

In accordance
with FAS 154,

Accounting Changes and Error Corrections,

(“FAS 154”) the change in method of determining the market-related value of
plan assets has been applied retrospectively by adjusting all prior periods
presented.

Share-based
compensation

Effective January 1, 2006, the Company adopted the fair value
recognition provisions of FAS 123R

,

using the
modified-retrospective transition method. Under that transition method,
compensation cost recognized from January 1, 2006 includes:

(a)    compensation cost for all share-based
payments granted prior to, but not yet vested as of January 1, 2006, based
on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original
provisions of FAS 123,

Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation

, and

(b)   compensation cost for all share-based
payments granted subsequent to January 1, 2006, based on the grant date
fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of FAS 123R.

Results for all
prior periods have been retrospectively adjusted to recognize the compensation
cost previously reported in the pro forma footnote disclosures under the
provisions of FAS 123.

Pensions—adoption
of FAS 158

In September 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (‘‘FASB’’)
issued FAS 158 which required an employer to:

·

recognize
in its statement of financial position the funded status of a benefit plan
measured as the difference between the fair value of plan assets and the
benefit obligation;

·

recognize,
net of tax, the gains or losses and prior service costs or credits that arise
during the period but are not recognized as components of net periodic benefit
cost;

·

measure
defined benefit plan assets and obligations as of the date of the employer’s
statement of financial position; and

·

disclose
additional information in the notes to the financial statements about certain
effects on net periodic benefit cost for the next fiscal year that arise from
delayed recognition of the gains or losses, prior service costs or credits and
transition asset or obligation.

The
requirements of FAS 158 are applied prospectively upon adoption. The
requirements to recognize the funded status of a defined benefit postretirement
plan and provide related disclosures are effective for fiscal years ending
after December 15, 2006, and have been applied for the year ended December 31,
2006.

The subsequent tables set out:

·

the line
items in the consolidated financial statements and any affected per-share
amounts that have been retrospectively adjusted to reflect the adoption of FAS 123R
and the change in the methodology for determining the market-related value of the
UK pension plan assets (‘‘Effect of pension accounting change’’);

Recent Accounting
Pronouncements

In

July 2006,
the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued FASB Interpretation No. 48,

Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes—an
interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109

(“FIN 48”), which
clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in tax positions.

The
evaluation of a tax position under FIN 48 is a two-step process:

·

The first step is recognition

Tax positions
taken or expected to be taken in a tax return should be recognized only if
those positions are more likely than not of being sustained upon examination,
based on the technical merits of the position. In evaluating whether a tax
position has met the more likely than not recognition threshold, it should be
presumed that the position will be examined by the relevant taxing authority
that would have full knowledge of all relevant information.

·

The second step is
measurement

Tax positions that meet the recognition
criteria are measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50
percent likely of being recognized upon ultimate settlement.

FIN 48 also provides guidance on
derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim
periods, disclosure and transition. FIN 48 is effective for fiscal years
beginning after December 15, 2006 and is effective for the Company in the
first quarter of the year beginning January 1, 2007.

The Company has
evaluated the impact of FIN 48 and has concluded that it will not have a
material effect on its financial position or results of operations.

2.      BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND
SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)

Significant Accounting Policies

Principles of Consolidation

The accompanying
consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Willis Group Holdings
and its subsidiaries, all of which are controlled through the ownership of a
majority voting interest. Intercompany balances and transactions have been
eliminated on consolidation.

Foreign Currency Translation

Transactions in currencies other than the
functional currency of the entity are recorded at the rates of exchange
prevailing at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities in
currencies other than the functional currency are translated at the rates of
exchange prevailing at the balance sheet date and the related transaction gains
and losses are reported in the statements of operations. Certain intercompany
loans are determined to be of a long-term investment nature. The Company
records transaction gains and losses from remeasuring such loans as a component
of other comprehensive income.

Upon
consolidation, the results of operations of subsidiaries and associates whose
functional currency is other than the US dollar are translated into US dollars
at the average exchange rate and assets and liabilities are translated at
year-end exchange rates. Translation adjustments are presented as a separate
component of other comprehensive income in the financial statements and are
included in net income only upon sale or liquidation of the underlying foreign
subsidiary or associated company.

Use of Estimates

The preparation
of financial statements in conformity with US GAAP requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities as of the
dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and
expenses during the year. In the preparation of these consolidated financial
statements, estimates and assumptions have been made by management concerning;
the selection of useful lives of fixed assets and intangible assets; provisions
necessary for trade receivables, commitments and contingencies and accrued
liabilities; the long-term asset returns, discount rates and mortality rates in
order to estimate pension liabilities and pension expense; income tax valuation
allowances; and other similar evaluations. Actual results could differ from
those estimates.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

Cash and cash
equivalents primarily consist of time deposits with original maturities of
three months or less.

Fiduciary Funds—Restricted

Fiduciary funds-restricted represent
unremitted premiums received from insureds and unremitted claims received from
insurers. Fiduciary funds are generally required to be kept in certain
regulated bank accounts subject to guidelines which emphasize capital
preservation and liquidity; such funds are not available to service the Company’s
debt or for other corporate purposes. Notwithstanding the legal relationships
with clients and insurers, the Company is entitled to retain investment income
earned on


WILLIS GROUP HOLDINGS LIMITED

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

2.      BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND
SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)

fiduciary funds
in accordance with industry custom and practice and, in some cases, as
supported by agreements with insureds.

Included in fiduciary funds-restricted are cash and cash
equivalents consisting primarily of time deposits.

The debt securities are classified as available-for-sale. Accordingly,
they are recorded at fair market value with unrealized holding gains and losses
reported, net of tax, as a component of other comprehensive income. As of December 31,
2006 and 2005, the amortized cost of such securities approximated fair value.

Short-Term Investments

The Company
classifies all short-term investments as available-for-sale in accordance with
the provisions of FAS 115,

Accounting
for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities

. These
securities are carried at fair market value, with unrealized gains and losses
reported in other comprehensive income. Realized gains and losses on
investments sold are included in net income and are derived using the specific
identification method for determining the cost of securities.

Accounts Receivable and Accounts Payable

In its capacity as an insurance agent or
broker, the Company collects premiums from insureds and, after deducting its
commissions, remits the premiums to the respective insurers; the Company also
collects claims or refunds from insurers on behalf of insureds. Uncollected
premiums from insureds and uncollected claims or refunds from insurers are
recorded as accounts receivable on the Company’s consolidated balance sheets.
Unremitted insurance premiums and claims are held in a fiduciary capacity. The
obligation to remit these funds is recorded as accounts payable on the Company’s
consolidated balance sheets. The period for which the Company holds such funds
is dependent upon the date the insured remits the payment of the premium to the
Company and the date the Company is required to forward such payment to the
insurer. Balances arising from insurance brokerage transactions are reported as
separate assets or liabilities unless such balances are due to or from the same
party and a right of offset exists, in which case the balances are recorded
net.

Accounts
receivable are stated at estimated net realizable values. Allowances are
recorded, when necessary, in an amount considered by management to be
sufficient to meet probable future losses related to uncollectible accounts.

Fixed Assets

Fixed assets are stated at cost less
accumulated depreciation. Expenditures for improvements are capitalized;
repairs and maintenance are charged to expenses as incurred. Depreciation is
computed using the straight-line method based on the estimated useful lives of
assets.

Depreciation on
buildings and long leaseholds is calculated over the lesser of 50 years or
the lease term. Depreciation on leasehold improvements is calculated over the
lesser of the useful life of the assets or the lease term. Depreciation on
furniture and equipment is calculated based on a range of 3 to 10 years.

Recoverability of Fixed Assets

Long-lived
assets and certain identifiable intangible assets are required to be reviewed
for impairment in accordance with FAS No. 144,

Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets

. An


WILLIS GROUP HOLDINGS LIMITED

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

2.      BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND
SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)

impairment
loss is recognized if the carrying amount of a long-lived asset exceeds its
fair value. Fair value is determined based on the undiscounted cash flows
expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset or asset
group. Long-lived assets and certain identifiable intangible assets to be
disposed of are reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less
cost to sell.

Operating leases

Rentals payable
on operating leases are charged to expense over the lease term as the rentals
become payable.

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

Goodwill
represents the excess of the cost of businesses acquired over the fair market
value of identifiable net assets at the dates of acquisition. The Company
reviews goodwill for impairment annually and whenever facts or circumstances
indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable. As part of the
evaluation the estimated future undiscounted cash flows associated with the
underlying business operation are compared to the carrying amount of goodwill
to determine if a write-down is required. If such an assessment indicates that
the undiscounted future cash flows will not be recovered, the carrying amount
is reduced to the estimated fair value. Acquired intangible assets are being
amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful life.

Investments in Associates

Investments in
entities less than 50% owned in which the Company has the ability to exercise
significant influence are accounted for by the equity method of accounting
whereby the investment is carried at cost of acquisition, plus the Company’s
equity in undistributed net income since acquisition, less dividends received.
Investments in entities less than 20% owned are accounted for by the cost method.
Such investments are not publicly traded. The Company periodically reviews its
investments in associates for which fair value is less than cost to determine
if the decline in value is other than temporary. If the decline in value is
judged to be other than temporary, the cost basis of the investment is written
down to fair value. The amount of any write-down is included in the statement
of operations as a realized loss.

Put and Call Options Relating to
Subsidiaries and Associates

For certain
subsidiaries and associates, the Company has the right to purchase shares (a
call option) from co-shareholders at various dates in the future. In addition,
the co-shareholders of certain subsidiaries and associates have the right to
sell their shares (a put option) to the Company at various dates in the future.
Generally, the exercise price of such puts and calls is formula-based
(using revenues and earnings) and is designed to reflect fair value. These put
and call options fall outside the scope of FAS 133,

Accounting
for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities

, and are not
therefore marked to market. Hence provision is made for any put options that
are out of the money at the balance sheet date.

Derivative Financial Instruments

The Company
uses derivative financial instruments for other than trading purposes to alter
the risk profile of an existing underlying exposure. Interest rate swaps are
used to manage interest risk exposures. Forward foreign currency exchange
contracts are used to manage currency exposures arising from future


WILLIS GROUP HOLDINGS LIMITED

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

2.      BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND
SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)

income.
The fair values of derivative contracts are recorded in other assets and other
liabilities with changes in fair value of derivatives that qualify for hedge
accounting recorded in other comprehensive income and changes in fair value of
derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting, together with any hedge
ineffectiveness, recorded in other operating expenses. Amounts are reclassified
from other comprehensive income into earnings when the hedged exposure affects
earnings.

Income Taxes

The Company accounts for income taxes under
the provisions of FAS No. 109, Accounting
for Income Taxes (“FAS 109”). The Company is subject to the income
tax laws of the various tax jurisdictions in which the Company operates,
principally the United States and United Kingdom. These tax laws are complex
and subject to different interpretations by taxpayers and the tax authorities.
When establishing income tax provisions, the Company therefore makes a number
of judgments and interpretations about the application and interaction of these
tax laws. The Company has estimated tax reserves that management believe are
adequate in relation to the potential for future assessments. Once established,
the Company only adjusts tax reserves when more information is available or
when an event occurs necessitating a change to tax reserves. Changes in these
tax laws or our interpretations of these laws and the

resolution of current and future tax audits could significantly impact
the Company’s effective tax rate and results of operations in a given period.

FAS 109
requires recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the estimated
future tax consequences of events attributable to differences between the
financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and
their respective tax bases and operating and capital loss and tax credit
carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted rates
in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to be recovered or
settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of changes in tax
rates is recognized in the statement of operations in the period in which the
enactment date changes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are reduced through
the establishment of a valuation allowance at such time as, based on available
evidence, it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will not be
realized.

Pensions

The Company has
two principal defined benefit pension plans which cover almost all employees in
the United States and United Kingdom. The UK plan was closed to new entrants in
January 2006. New entrants in the United Kingdom are now offered the
opportunity to join a defined contribution plan. Elsewhere, pension benefits
are typically provided through defined contribution plans.

Defined
benefit plans

The net periodic cost of the Company’s
defined benefit plans are measured on an actuarial basis using the projected
unit credit method and several actuarial assumptions. The most significant of
which are the discount rate and the expected long-term rate of return on plan
assets. Other material assumptions include rates of participant mortality, the
expected long-term rate of compensation and pension increases and rates of
employee termination.


WILLIS GROUP HOLDINGS LIMITED

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

2.      BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND
SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)

Gains and losses occur when actual
experience differs from actuarial assumptions. If such gains or losses exceed
ten percent of the greater of plan assets or plan liabilities the Company
amortizes those gains or losses over the average remaining service period of
the employees.

In accordance
with FAS 158, the Company records on balance sheet the funded status of its
pension plans based on the projected benefit obligation.

Defined
contribution plans

Contributions to the Company’s defined
contribution plans are recognized as they fall due. Differences between
contributions payable in the year and contributions actually paid are shown as
either other assets or other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet.

Further details
of the Company’s pension plans are set out in Note 14 to the Consolidated
Financial Statements.

Share-Based Compensation

The Company accounts for share-based
compensation in accordance with FAS 123R which replaced FAS 123 and
superseded APB 25. The main provisions of FAS 123R require that

·

the cost
resulting from all equity awards be recognized in the financial statements at
fair value estimated at the grant date;

·

the fair
value is recognized (generally as compensation cost) over the requisite service
period for all awards that vest; and

·

compensation
cost is not recognized for awards that do not vest because service or
performance conditions are not satisfied.

Further details
on how the Company applies FAS 123R are set out in Note 6 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements.

Revenue Recognition

Revenue includes insurance commissions,
fees for services rendered, certain commissions receivable from insurance
carriers and investment income earned on fiduciary balances.

The Company takes credit for commissions
(or fees negotiated in lieu of commission) in respect of insurance placements
at the date when the insured is billed or at the inception date of the policy,
whichever is later. Commissions on additional premiums and adjustments are
recognized as and when advised. Fees for risk management and other services are
recognized as the services are provided. Negotiated fee arrangements for an
agreed period covering multiple insurance placements, the provision of risk
management and/or other services are determined, contract by contract, on the
basis of the relative fair value of the services completed and the services yet
to be rendered. The Company establishes contract cancellation reserves where
appropriate; at December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, such amounts were not
material.

In October 2004, the Company announced
that it was voluntarily abolishing volume and profit-based contingent
commissions. Such commissions were recognized at the earlier of the date when
cash was

received, or
when formal, written notification of the actual amount due was received from
the insurance carrier. If some of the commissions received were potentially
subject to full or partial repayment to the carrier, then recognition was
deferred until the conditions for repayment had passed.

Investment
income is recognized as earned.

3.      GAIN ON DISPOSAL OF LONDON HEADQUARTERS

On September 27,
2006 Willis Group Services Limited, a subsidiary of Willis Group Holdings
Limited, completed the sale of Ten Trinity Square, the Company’s London
headquarters building. The building has been leased back at an annual rental of
$12 million until the Company occupies its new London headquarters on Lime
Street which is expected to be in early 2008. Gross proceeds were $202 million
of which 25 percent was received in cash on completion and 75 percent was
received on November 27, 2006. Of the total pre-tax gain on disposal of
$121 million, $99 million was recognized in third quarter 2006 and $3 million
in fourth quarter 2006; the remaining $19 million will be recognized over the
life of the lease.

4.      NET (LOSS) GAIN ON DISPOSAL OF OPERATIONS

Total proceeds for 2006 were $6 million,
inclusive of $3 million relating to 2006 dispositions of subsidiaries and
associates and $3 million of deferred proceeds, with a loss on disposal of $4 million
recorded in the consolidated statement of operations.

Total proceeds relating to 2005 dispositions of subsidiaries and
associates amounted to $97 million, inclusive of deferred proceeds
amounting to $1 million. A net gain of $78 million was recorded in
the consolidated statement of operations which relates primarily to the gain
arising on the sale of the Company’s US wholesale unit Stewart Smith on April 14,
2005. The carrying amounts of the Stewart Smith assets and liabilities disposed
of were as follows:

At December 31, 2006, the Company had
a valuation allowance of $73 million (2005: $110 million) to reduce
its deferred tax assets to estimated realizable value. The valuation allowance at
December 31, 2006 relates to the deferred tax assets arising from UK
capital loss carryforwards (2005: UK tax operating loss carryforwards and UK
capital loss carryforwards), which have no expiration date. Capital loss
carryforwards can only be offset against future UK capital gains. During the
year the Company reinstated and realized the deferred tax asset relating to UK
operating losses following the resolution of tax authority enquiries. US tax
operating loss carryforwards will largely expire in 2023 and 2024 unless

otherwise utilized. Management expects to
fully utilize these loss carryforwards prior to expiration.

At December 31, 2006, the Company had
deferred tax assets of $174 million (2005: $209 million), net of the
valuation allowance. Management believes, based upon the level of historical
taxable income and projections for future taxable income over the periods in
which the temporary differences are anticipated to reverse, and prudent and
feasible tax-planning strategies, it is more likely than not that the Company
will realize the benefits of these deductible differences, net of the valuation
allowance. However, the amount of the deferred tax asset considered realizable
could be adjusted in the future if estimates of taxable income are revised. In

(2005:
$110 million) is reduced in future years to recognize deferred tax assets,
an amount of up to $73 million (2005: $77 million) will be allocated
to reduce goodwill.

The Company
recognizes deferred tax balances (2005: current and deferred tax balances)
related to the undistributed earnings of subsidiaries when the Company expects
that it will recover those undistributed earnings in a taxable manner, such as
through receipt of dividends or sale of the investments. The Company does not,
however, provide for income taxes on the unremitted earnings of certain other
subsidiaries where, in management’s opinion, such earnings have been
indefinitely reinvested in those operations, or will be remitted either in a
tax free liquidation or as dividends with taxes substantially offset by foreign
tax credits. It is not practical to determine the amount of unrecognized
deferred tax liabilities for temporary differences related to these
investments.

SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION

On December 31,
2006, the Company had three share-based compensation plans, which are described
below. The compensation cost that has been charged against income for those
plans for the year ended December 31, 2006 was $18 million (2005: $18
million; 2004: $20 million). The total income tax benefit recognized in the
statement of operations for share-based compensation arrangements for the year
ended December 31, 2006 was $6 million (2005: $6 million; 2004: $6
million).

Stock Option Plans

The Company has
adopted the plans described below providing for the grant of time-based options
and performance-based options and various other share-based grants
to employees. The objectives of these plans include attracting and retaining
the best personnel, motivating management personnel by means of growth-related
incentives to achieve long-range goals and providing employees with the
opportunity to increase their share ownership in the Company.

Amended
and Restated 1998 Share Purchase and Option Plan

This plan, which was established on December 18,
1998, provides for the granting of time-based and performance-based
options to employees of the Company. There are 30,000,000 shares available for
grant under this plan provided, however, that in no event the total number of
shares subject to options and other equity for current and future participants
exceed 25 percent of the equity of Willis Group Holdings on a fully
diluted basis. All options granted under this plan are exercisable at £2 per
share ($3.92 using the year-end exchange rate of £1 = $1.96) except for
111,111 time-based options which are exercisable at $13.50. No further grants are
to be made under this plan.

Time-based options are earned upon the
fulfilment of vesting requirements. Options are generally exercisable in equal
instalments of 20 percent per year over a five-year period commencing on
or after December 18, 2000.

Performance-based
options became exercisable, subject to the fulfilment of vesting requirements
with effect from January 1, 2003, upon the achievement of cash flow and
EBITDA (as defined in the plan agreements) targets of Willis Group Limited.
Options are generally exercisable in equal instalments of 25 percent per
year over a four-year period commencing on or after December 18, 2001.

Willis
Award Plan

This plan,
which was established on July 13, 2000, provides for the granting of
time-based options to selected employees who have been identified as superior
performers. There are 5,000,000 shares available for grant under this plan
provided, however, that in no event the total number of shares subject to
options and other equity for current and future participants exceed
25 percent of the equity of Willis Group Holdings on a fully diluted
basis. All options granted under this plan are exercisable at £2 per share
($3.92 using the year-end exchange rate of £1 = $1.96). The options vest
immediately on the grant date and are exercisable any time up to July 13,
2010.

Share Purchase and Option Plan

This plan, which was established on May 3,
2001, provides for the granting of time-based options and various other share-based
grants at fair market value to employees of the Company. There are 25,000,000
shares available for grant under this plan. Options are exercisable on a
variety of dates, including from the first, second, third, sixth or eighth
anniversary of grant, although for certain options the exercisable date may
accelerate depending on the achievement of certain performance goals. Unless
terminated sooner by the Board of Directors, the 2001 Plan will expire
10 years after its adoption. That termination will not affect the validity
of any grant outstanding at that date.

The fair value of each option is estimated on the date of grant using
the Black-Scholes option pricing model that uses the assumptions noted in the
following table. Expected volatility is based on historical volatility of the
Company’s stock. With effect from January 1, 2006, the Company uses the
simplified method set out in Staff Accounting Bulletin No.107 to derive the
expected term of options granted. The risk-free rate for periods within the
expected life of the option is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect
at the time of grant.

EARNINGS
PER SHARE

Basic and diluted earnings per share is calculated
by dividing net income by the average number of shares outstanding during each
period. The computation of diluted earnings per share reflects the potential
dilution that could occur if dilutive securities and other contracts to issue
shares were exercised or converted into shares or resulted in the issue of
shares that then shared in the net income of the Company.

For the year ended December 31, 2006,
time-based and performance-based options to purchase 15.0 million
and 0.4 million (2005: 11.8 million and 1.0 million; 2004:
14.0 million and 3.0 million) shares, respectively, and
1.1 million restricted shares (2005: 0.3 million and 2004:
0.4 million), respectively, were outstanding.

SEVERANCE
COSTS

For the year ended December

31, 2006 the Company incurred severance
costs of $41 million (2005: $30 million, including severance costs of
$28 million in relation to the first quarter 2005 headcount reduction
program where 500 positions were terminated; 2004: $10 million). This
expenditure included $35 million of severance benefits relating to
employees whose employment has been, or is in the process of being, terminated
pursuant to our “Shaping our Future’’ strategic initiatives. Such severance
costs are payable under the terms of existing employee benefit arrangements or
employment agreements.

Of the $41 million
charge for severance costs for the twelve months ended December 31, 2006,
$27 million was paid in the year and $14 million has been carried
forward at December 31, 2006. In some countries, termination cash payments
are spread over periods of up to two years. The Company expects to have
paid the majority of the remaining $14 million of these costs by December 31,
2007.

In November 2004, the Company entered
into a 25 year agreement with long time client British Land plc relating
to its new UK headquarters in London. Construction commenced in early 2005 and
the Company’s occupancy is targeted for early 2008. The Company’s contractual
obligations in relation to this commitment total $918 million and are
included in the table above, but remain contingent upon the successful
completion of construction.

Rent expense
amounted to $93 million, $77 million and $87 million for the
years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The Company’s
rental income from subleases was $11 million, $9 million and
$9 million for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004,
respectively.

Guarantees

Guarantees issued by certain of Willis
Group Holdings’ subsidiaries with respect to the Senior Credit Facility are
discussed elsewhere in these consolidated financial statements.

Certain of Willis Group Holdings’
subsidiaries have given the landlords of some leasehold properties occupied by
the Company in the United Kingdom and the United States guarantees in respect
of the performance of the lease obligations of the subsidiary holding the
lease. The operating lease obligations subject to such guarantees amounted to
$1,033 million and $935 million at December 31, 2006 and 2005,
respectively.

In addition,
the Company has given guarantees to bankers and other third parties relating
principally to letters of credit amounting to $3 million and
$2 million at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively.

Put and
Call Options Relating to Subsidiaries and Associates

For certain
subsidiaries and associates, the Company has the right to purchase shares (a
call option) from co-shareholders at various dates in the future. In addition,
the co-shareholders of certain subsidiaries and associates have the right to
sell (a put option) their shares to the Company at various dates in the future.
Generally, the exercise price of such puts and calls is formula-based
(using revenues and earnings) and is designed to reflect fair value. Based on
current projections of profitability and

exchange
rates, the potential amount payable in 2007 from these options is not expected
to exceed $382 million. Of this balance, $337 million relates to Gras
Savoye, as disclosed in Note 12.

Claims, Lawsuits and
Other Proceedings

The

Company
is subject to various actual and potential claims, lawsuits and other
proceedings relating principally to alleged errors and omissions in connection
with the placement of insurance and reinsurance in the ordinary course of
business. Similar to other corporations, the Company is also subject to a
variety of other claims, including those relating to the Company’s employment
practices. Some of those claims, lawsuits and other proceedings seek damages in
amounts which could, if assessed, be significant.

Errors and omissions claims, lawsuits and
other proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business are covered in
part by professional indemnity or other appropriate insurance. The terms of
this insurance vary by policy year and self-insured risks have increased
significantly over recent years. In respect of self-insured risks, the
Company has established provisions which are believed to be adequate in the
light of current information and legal advice, and the Company adjusts such
provisions from time to time according to developments.

On the basis of
current information, the Company does not expect that the actual claims,
lawsuits and other proceedings, to which the Company is subject, or potential
claims, lawsuits and other proceedings relating to matters of which it is aware
will ultimately have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial
condition, results of operations or liquidity. Nonetheless, given the large or
indeterminate amounts sought in certain of these actions, and the inherent
unpredictability of litigation, it is possible that an adverse outcome in
certain matters could, from time to time, have a material adverse effect on the
Company’s results of operations or cash flows in particular quarterly or annual
periods.

Inquiries and
Investigations

In

April 2005, the Company entered into an Assurance of
Discontinuance (“NY AOD”) with the New York Attorney General and the New York
Superintendent of Insurance resolving the investigation commenced by the New
York Attorney General in April 2004 which concerned, among other things,
arrangements pursuant to which insurers compensated insurance brokers for
distribution and other services provided to insurers and, as the investigation
of brokers and insurers continued, broadened into an investigation of other
possible violations of law, including violations of fiduciary duty, securities
laws, and antitrust laws. Pursuant to the NY AOD, the Company has paid
$50 million to eligible customers. The Company has also agreed to continue
certain business reforms it had already implemented and to implement certain
other business reforms. These reforms include an agreement not to accept
contingent compensation; and an undertaking to disclose to customers any
compensation the Company will receive in connection with providing policy
placement services to the customer. The Company also resolved a similar
investigation commenced by the Minnesota Attorney General by entering into an
Assurance of Discontinuance pursuant to which the Company paid $1 million to
Minnesota customers and implemented the business reforms described in the
NY AOD. On October 1, 2005, the Company mailed letters to customers
who were eligible to receive distributions out of the fund. In March 2006
checks were mailed to eligible customers who elected to participate in the
fund. Eligible customers that elected to participate represented
87.93 percent of the $51 million fund. As required by the AOD, the
remaining funds were redistributed on a pro rata basis to the
participating customers. The Company continues to respond to requests for
documents and information by the regulators and/or attorneys general of more
than twenty other states, the District of Columbia, one US city, Canada, and
Australia that are conducting similar investigations. The Company is
co-operating fully with these investigations and has engaged in discussions

with regulators
and attorneys general about their investigations but cannot predict at this
time how or when those investigations will be resolved.

Our operations in nine European countries
have received questionnaires from either the European Commission pursuant to
its Sector Inquiry or, in respect of Norway, the European Free Trade
Association Surveillance Authority, related to insurance business practices,
including compensation arrangements for brokers. At least 150 other European
brokers received similar questionnaires. We responded to the European
Commission questionnaires within the timeframe set and have filed

the European Free Trade Association Surveillance Authority
for

two
of our Norwegian entities within the agreed timeframes.
The European Commission reported on an interim basis on January

24, 2007. The Interim Report included
preliminary findings of potential conflicts of interest relating to
remuneration by assuming a dual role for clients and insurers. The European
Commission has requested by way of consultation, responses to the Interim
Report by April 10, 2007 and anticipates publishing a final report in
September 2007.

We continue to co-operate with both the European
Commission and the European Free Trade Association Surveillance Authority.

In August 2004, a proceeding was
commenced in the Superior Court of the State of California, County of San Diego
against the Company by United Policyholders, an organization purporting to act
in a representative capacity on behalf of the California general public. The
complaint alleged that the compensation arrangements between the Company and
insurance carriers constituted deceptive trade practices, and it sought both
injunctive and equitable relief, including restitution. This action was
dismissed in December 2004, but United Policyholders filed an appeal. The
dismissal of the complaint was based on the retroactive application of newly
passed legislation. In July 2006 the Supreme Court of California confirmed
in a ruling that the newly passed legislation applies to cases, like the United
Policyholders case, that were pending before the new legislation was
enacted. Based on this ruling, United Policyholders has dismissed its case.

Since August 2004,
various plaintiffs have filed purported class actions in the United States
District Court for the Southern District of New York, the Northern District of
Illinois, the Northern District of California, the New Jersey District court,
and the Circuit Court for the Eighteenth Judicial Circuit in and for Seminole
County, Florida Civil Division, under a variety of legal theories, including
state tort, contract, fiduciary duty and statutory theories, and federal
antitrust and RICO theories. Other than a federal suit in Illinois that was
voluntarily dismissed by the plaintiff in May 2005, all of the federal
actions have been consolidated into two actions in federal court in New Jersey.
One of the consolidated actions addresses employee benefits, while the other
consolidated action addresses all other lines of insurance. In addition to the
two federal actions, we were also named as a defendant in purported class
actions in the Eighteenth Judicial Circuit in and for Seminole County, Florida
Civil Division and

Commonwealth of Massachusetts Superior Court Department of the Trial
Court. In June 2006 the plaintiff in the
Massachusetts state action voluntarily dismissed its complaint with prejudice.
Both the consolidated federal actions and the Florida state action name various
insurance carriers and insurance brokerage firms, including the Company, as
defendants. The complaints seek monetary damages and equitable relief and make
allegations regarding the practices and conduct that has been the subject of
the investigation of state attorneys general and insurance commissioners,
including allegations that the brokers have breached their duties to their
clients by entering into contingent compensation agreements with either no
disclosure or limited disclosure to clients and entered into other improper
activities. The complaints also allege the existence of a conspiracy

among
the insurance carriers and brokers and the federal court complaints allege
violations of the federal RICO statute. The Company disputes these allegations
and intends to defend itself vigorously against these actions. The outcomes of
these lawsuits, however, including any losses or other payments that may occur
as a result, cannot be predicted at this time.

Pender Insurance Limited/Captive Insurance
Management

We acted
through one of our subsidiaries as an independent captive manager for Pender
from 1990 to 2003.

In

2004,
legal proceedings were commenced in the English Commercial Court by Cable &
Wireless Plc and Pender Insurance Limited, its captive insurer, against six of
their former employees and certain other individuals and entities, and two of
our subsidiaries and one of our former employees and were settled in January 2006
for an undisclosed amount which was not material.The plaintiffs alleged a
fraudulent conspiracy involving the manner in which Pender was managed,
operated or advised by the defendants, which allegedly resulted in substantial
damages to the plaintiffs. A second claim was brought by Pender in 2005,
alleging negligence with respect to certain reinsurance policies. Pender Mutual
Insurance Company Limited (“PMIC”) has recently indicated it has similar claims
to Pender but no legal proceedings have yet been commenced by PMIC. If such
proceedings are commenced, it is not expected the amount claimed will have a
material adverse effect on our results of operations.

Gender
Discrimination Class Action

A federal district court action was
commenced against us in 2001 on behalf of an alleged nationwide class of
present and former female officer and officer equivalent employees alleging
that we discriminated against them on the basis of their gender and seeking
injunctive relief, money damages, attorneys’ fees and costs. To date the court
has denied plaintiffs’ motions to certify a nationwide class or to grant
nationwide discovery, but has certified a class of female officers and officer
equivalent employees based in our Northeast (New York, New Jersey and
Massachusetts) offices. We believe that the purported class consists of
approximately 200 women. We filed a petition for an immediate appeal of the
class certification ruling which was denied. The parties participated in
mediation before a court appointed mediator which has not yet brought about a
settlement. The trial in this matter has been scheduled in June 2007. We
have filed a motion to decertify the class based on new standards set by a
recent Second Circuit opinion for determining whether a class should be
certified.

A former female employee, whose
motion to intervene in the class action was denied, has filed a purported class
action with almost identical allegations as those contained in this suit,
except seeking a class period of 1998 to the time of trial.

We cannot predict at this time what, if any,
damages might result from these actions.

FIDUCIARY
FUNDS—RESTRICTED AND SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS

The Company’s fiduciary funds-restricted
and short-term investments consist mainly of cash and time deposits. Accrued
interest on investments is recorded as other assets.

The debt securities are classified as
available-for-sale. Accordingly, they are recorded at fair market value with
unrealized holding gains and losses reported, net of tax, as a component of
other comprehensive income. As of December 31, 2006 and 2005, the amortized
cost of such securities approximated fair value.

Realized gains and losses, net of tax, on
debt securities are included in net income. During years ended December 31,
2006, 2005 and 2004, sales of debt securities totaled $10 million,
$47 million and $79 million, respectively, on which realized gains
and losses were not material to the consolidated results of the Company.
Fiduciary funds-restricted, consisting primarily of time deposits with
original maturities of less than three months, were $1,772 million as of December 31,
2006 (2005: $1,563 million).

In accordance
with FASB Interpretation No. 46(R), Consolidation of Variable Interest
Entities an interpretation of ARB No. 51, the financial statements for the
years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005 reflect the consolidation of one
Variable Interest Entity (“VIE”), a UK non-statutory trust that was established
in January 2005 following the introduction of statutory regulation of
insurance in the UK by the Financial Services Authority. The regulation
requires that all fiduciary funds collected by an insurance broker such as
Willis be paid into a non-statutory trust designed to give additional
credit protection to the insurance carriers and clients of Willis. This trust
restricts the financial instruments in which such funds may be invested and
affects the timing of transferring commission from fiduciary funds to own
funds. As a result of the regulation, approximately $155 million of own funds
were reclassified to fiduciary funds in January 2005. As of December 31,
2006, the fair value of the assets in the VIE was approximately
$1,056 million (2005: $1,022 million) and the fair value of the associated
liabilities was approximately $1,056 million (2005: $1,022 million). There
are no assets of the Company that serve as collateral for the VIE.

Of those listed above, the Company’s
principal investment as of December 31, 2006 and 2005 is Gras Savoye,
France’s leading insurance broker. Included in the carrying amount of the Gras
Savoye investment as of  December 31,
2006 is goodwill of $93 million. Of this total, $21 million has been
recognized in the year in respect of an additional 5% holding in Gras Savoye,
with the remaining $72 million net of accumulated goodwill amortization of
$7 million, recorded prior to the adoption of FAS 142,

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

(“FAS 142”),

(2005: Goodwill of $72 million, net
of accumulated goodwill amortization of $7 million).

As of December 31, 2006 and 2005, the
Company’s other investments in associates individually and in the aggregate
were not material to the Company’s operations.

On July 23, 1997, the Company entered
into an agreement with Gras Savoye whereby, among other things, the
co-shareholders of Gras Savoye (other than management) have the right to sell
(put option)

their shares to
the Company possibly increasing the Company’s ownership interest from
38 percent to 90 percent. Management shareholders of Gras Savoye,
representing approximately 10% of the outstanding shares, do not have general
put rights before 2011, but have certain put rights on their death, disability
or retirement. The option expires in 2011 and Gras Savoye’s eligible
co-shareholders may exercise their rights from January 1, 2001. In
addition, the Company has the right to purchase (call option) at least
50.1 percent of Gras Savoye’s shares from the co-shareholders. The call
option is exercisable from December 1, 2009 until February 1, 2010.
The exact amount payable by the Company under the put and call is based on
formula-based price contingent on Gras Savoye’s future results.

Revolving Credit Facility

On

October 17,
2005, the Company completed the re-financing of the then existing 2003 undrawn
revolving credit facility. The $150 million revolving credit facility was
replaced by a new $300 million revolving credit facility with a term of
5 years. $200 million was drawn as at December 31, 2006, bearing an
interest rate of LIBOR plus 0.375 percent.

The revolving credit facility agreement
contains numerous operating and financial covenants, including requirements to
maintain minimum ratios of consolidated EBITDA to consolidated net interest
expense and maximum levels of net indebtedness in relation to consolidated
EBITDA, in each case subject to certain adjustments.

In addition, the credit agreement includes
covenants relating to the delivery of financial statements, reports and
notices, limitations on liens, limitations on sales and other disposals of
assets, limitations on indebtedness and other liabilities, limitations on sale
and leaseback transactions, limitations on mergers and other fundamental
changes, maintenance of property, maintenance of insurance, nature of business,
compliance with applicable laws, maintenance of corporate existence and rights,
use of proceeds, payment of taxes and access to information and properties. At December 31,
2006, the Company was in compliance with all covenants.

All obligations
of Willis North America Inc. (“Willis North America”) (the borrower) under
the credit agreement and under the Senior Notes offering are guaranteed by
Willis Group Holdings Limited, Trinity Acquisition Limited, Willis Group
Limited, TA I Limited, TA II Limited, TA III Limited and TA IV Limited.

Lines of Credit

Excluding

the $300 million revolving credit facility, the Company also
has available $7 million (2005: $3 million) in lines of credit, of
which $nil (2005: $nil) was drawn as of December 31, 2006.

14.   PENSION PLANS

The Company has two principal defined
benefit pension plans funded externally which cover all eligible employees. One
plan exists in the United Kingdom and the other in the United States. It is the
Company’s policy to fund pension costs as required by applicable laws and
regulations.

In September 2006, the FASB issued FAS
No. 158,

Employers’ Accounting for Defined Benefit
Pension and Other Postretirement Plans—an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87,
88, 106 and 132(R)

(‘‘FAS 158’’). The requirements of FAS 158
are to be applied prospectively upon adoption. The requirements to recognize
the funded status of a defined benefit postretirement plan and provide related
disclosures are effective for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2006,
and have been applied for the year ended December 31, 2006.

classes to achieve that goal. The UK Plan’s assets are divided into 10 separate
portfolios according to asset class and managed by 10 investment managers. The
broad target allocations are UK and foreign equities  (75 percent), debt securities
(20 percent) and real estate (5 percent). The US Plan’s assets are
currently invested in 20 funds representing most standard equity and debt
security classes. The broad target allocations are US and foreign equities
(64 percent) and debt securities (36 percent).

In 2007, the
Company expects to contribute $138 million to the UK defined benefit
pension plan and $17 million to the US plan.

2012–2016



Willis North
America has a 401(k) plan covering all eligible employees of Willis North
America and its subsidiaries. The plan allows participants to make pre-tax
contributions and the Company provides a matching contribution of
3 percent of employees’ annual eligible compensation. All investment
assets of the plan are held in a trust account administered by independent
trustees. The Company’s 401(k) matching contributions for 2006, 2005 and
2004 were approximately $5 million, $5 million and $1 million,
respectively.

15.

FINANCIAL
INSTRUMENTS

The Company’s principal financial instruments,
other than derivatives, comprise the fixed rate Senior Notes, a revolving
credit facility, cash deposits and short-term investments. The Company also
enters into derivative transactions (principally interest rate swaps and
forward foreign currency contracts) in order to manage interest rate and
currency risks arising from the Company’s operations and its sources of
finance. The Company does not hold financial instruments for trading purposes.

The main risks
arising from the Company’s financial instruments are interest rate risk,
liquidity risk, foreign currency risk and credit risk. The Company’s board of
directors reviews and agrees policies for managing each of these risks as
summarized below. The Company has applied FAS No. 133,

Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging
Activities

, as amended, (“FAS 133”), in accounting for these
financial instruments.

Interest Rate Risk

Our

operations
are financed principally by $600 million fixed rate Senior Notes issued by
a subsidiary which are split between $250 million due 2010 and
$350 million due 2015. As of December 31, 2006 we had also drawn down
$200 million on our $300 million Revolving Credit Facility which
expires in 2010. The interest rate applicable to this borrowing is variable
according to the period of each individual drawdown.

As a result of
the Company’s operating activities, the Company receives cash for premiums and
claims which it deposits in short-term investments denominated in US dollars
and other currencies. The Company earns interest on these funds, which is
included in the Company’s financial statements as investment income. These
funds are regulated in terms of access and the instruments in which they may be
invested, most of which are short-term in maturity. In order to manage interest
rate risk arising from these financial assets, the Company enters into interest
rate swaps to receive a fixed rate of interest and pay a variable rate


WILLIS GROUP HOLDINGS LIMITED

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

15.

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS (Continued)

of
interest fixed in the various currencies related to the short-term investments.
The use of interest rate contracts essentially converts groups of short-term
variable rate investments to fixed rates.

The fair value of these contracts is
recorded in other assets and other liabilities. For contracts that are
qualifying cash flow hedges as defined by FAS 133, changes in fair value
are recorded as a component of other comprehensive income.

Amounts are reclassified from other
comprehensive income into earnings when the hedged exposure affects earnings.
For contracts that do not qualify for hedge accounting as defined by
FAS 133, changes in fair value are recorded in other operating expenses.

The changes in fair value of derivative financial instruments have been
recorded as follows:

Liquidity
Risk

The Company’s
objective is to ensure that it has the ability to generate sufficient cash
either from internal or external sources, in a timely and cost-effective
manner, to meet its commitments as they fall due. The Company’s management of
liquidity risk is embedded within its overall risk management framework.
Scenario analysis is continually

undertaken
to ensure that the Company’s resources can meet its liquidity requirements.
These resources are supplemented by a $300 million revolving credit
facility which expires on October 17, 2010, of which $200 million was
drawn as at December 31, 2006.

Foreign
Currency Risk

The Company’s objective is to maximize its
cash flow in US dollars. In all locations, with the exception of the United
Kingdom, the Company predominantly generates revenues and expenses in the local
currency. In the United Kingdom, however, the Company earns revenues in a
number of different currencies but expenses are almost entirely in pounds
sterling. This mismatch creates a currency exposure.

Generally the Company’s policy within the
United Kingdom is to convert into sterling all revenues arising in currencies
other than US dollars together with sufficient US dollar revenues to fund the
remaining sterling expenses. Outside the United Kingdom, only those cash flows
necessary to fund mismatches between revenues and expenses are converted into
local currency. Amounts remitted to the United Kingdom are usually converted
into sterling and the currency exposures managed by entering into forward exchange
contracts.

The fair value of these contracts is
recorded in other assets and other liabilities. For contracts that are
qualifying cash flow hedges as defined by FAS 133, changes in fair value
are recorded as a component of other comprehensive income. Amounts are
reclassified from other comprehensive income into earnings when the hedged
exposure affects earnings. For contracts that do not qualify for hedge
accounting as defined by FAS 133, changes in fair value are recorded in other
operating expenses (see table on previous page).

Credit Risk and
Concentrations of Credit Risk

Credit

risk represents the
loss that would be recognized at the reporting date if counterparties failed to
perform as contracted and from movements in interest rates and foreign exchange
rates. The Company does not anticipate non-performance by counterparties. The
Company generally does not require collateral or other security to support financial
instruments with credit risk; however, it is the Company’s policy to enter into
master netting arrangements with counterparties as practical.

Concentrations
of credit risk that arise from financial instruments exist for groups of
customers or counterparties when they have similar economic characteristics
that would cause their ability to meet contractual obligations to be similarly
affected by changes in economic or other conditions. Financial instruments on
the balance sheet that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of
credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents, accounts
receivable, and derivatives which are recorded at fair value. The Company
maintains a policy providing for the diversification of cash and cash equivalent
investments and places such investments in an extensive number of high quality
financial institutions to limit the amount of credit risk exposure.
Concentrations of credit risk with respect to receivables are limited due to
the large number of clients and markets in which the Company does business, as
well as the dispersion across many geographic areas. Management does not
believe significant risk exists in connection with the Company’s concentrations
of credit as of December 31, 2006.

Fair Value

The

estimated
fair value of the Company’s financial instruments held or issued to finance the
Company’s operations is summarized below. Certain estimates and judgments were
required to develop the fair value amounts. The fair value amounts shown below
are not necessarily indicative of the amounts that the Company would realize
upon disposition nor do they indicate the Company’s intent or ability to
dispose of the financial instrument.

SEGMENT
INFORMATION

FAS No. 131,

Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and
Related Information

establishes standards for reporting information
about operating segments and related disclosures, products and services,
geographic areas and major customers. Operating segments are components of an
enterprise about which separate financial information is available that is
evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision-maker in deciding how
to allocate resources and in assessing performance.

The Company conducts its
worldwide insurance brokerage activities through three operating segments:
Global, North America and International. Each operating segment exhibits
similar economic characteristics, provides similar products and services and
distributes same through common distribution channels to a common type or class
of customer. In addition, the regulatory environment in each region is similar.
Consequently, for financial reporting purposes the Company has aggregated these
three operating segments into one reportable segment.

None of the Company’s customers
represented more than 10 percent of the Company’s consolidated commissions
and fees for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004.

FINANCIAL INFORMATION FOR PARENT GUARANTOR,
OTHER GUARANTOR SUBSIDIARIES AND NON-GUARANTOR SUBSIDIARIES

The Company filed a shelf registration on Form S-3
on June 21, 2006 under which Willis Group Holdings may offer debt
securities, preferred stock, common stock and other securities. In addition,
Trinity Acquisition Limited may offer debt securities (“the Subsidiary Debt
Securities”). The Subsidiary Debt Securities, if issued, will be guaranteed by
certain of the Company’s subsidiaries.

Presented below is condensed consolidating
financial information for: i) Willis Group Holdings, which will be a
guarantor, on a parent company only basis; ii) the Other Guarantors, which
are all wholly owned subsidiaries of the parent; iii) the Issuer, Trinity
Acquisition Limited; iv) Other, which are the non-guarantor subsidiaries,
on a combined basis; v) Eliminations; and vi) Consolidated Company
and subsidiaries. The equity method has been used for all investments in
subsidiaries.

The entities included in the Other
Guarantors column are TA I Limited, TA II Limited and
TA III Limited.

Previously the Company reported
inter-company dividends received and paid on a net basis in the condensed
consolidating statement of cash flows within the financial information for
parent guarantor, other guarantor subsidiaries and non-guarantor subsidiaries.
For the year ended December 31, 2006 the Company has reported
inter-company dividends received and paid on a gross basis within the operating
activities and the financing activities sections of the cash flow statement
respectively. Prior year information has been adjusted to conform to this
presentation.

Evaluation of
Disclosure Controls and Procedures

As of December 31,
2006, the Company carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the
participation of the Company’s management, including the Chairman and Chief
Executive Officer and the Group Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness
of the design and operation of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures
pursuant to Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(e). Based upon that evaluation,
the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer concluded that the
Company’s disclosure controls and procedures are effective in timely alerting
them to material information relating to the Company (including its
consolidated subsidiaries) required to be included in the Company’s periodic
SEC filings.

Management’s
Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

Management is responsible for establishing
and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined
in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

Under the supervision and with the
participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and
principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of
our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2006
based on the criteria related to internal control over financial reporting
described in

Internal Control—Integrated
Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
Treadway Commission. Based on our evaluation, management concluded that our
internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31,
2006.

Our independent
registered public accountants, Deloitte & Touche LLP (“D&T”),
who have audited and reported on our financial statements, issued an
attestation report on our assessment of the Company’s internal control over
financial reporting. D&T’s report is presented below.

REPORT
OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders
of Willis Group Holdings Limited, Hamilton, Bermuda

We have audited management's assessment,
included in the accompanying Management Report on Internal Controls, that
Willis Group Holdings Limited and subsidiaries (collectively, the
"Company") maintained effective internal control over financial
reporting as of December 31, 2006, based on criteria established in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

issued by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Willis Group
Holdings Limited's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal
control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of
internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on management's assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness of the
Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with
the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was
maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an
understanding of internal control over financial reporting, evaluating
management's assessment, testing and evaluating the design and operating
effectiveness of internal control, and performing such other procedures as we
considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a
reasonable basis for our opinions.


A company's internal control over financial
reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the company's
principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing
similar functions, and effected by the company's board of directors,
management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements
for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes
those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records
that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and
dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance
that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and
that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance
with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a
material effect on the financial statements.

Because of the inherent limitations of
internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of
collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements
due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Also,
projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over
financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls
may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of
compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, management's assessment
that the Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting
as of December 31, 2006, is fairly stated, in all material respects, based on
the criteria established in

Internal
Control—Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Also in our opinion, the Company
maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial
reporting as of December 31, 2006, based on the criteria established in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

issued by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

We have also
audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated financial statements and
financial statement schedule as of and for the year ended December 31, 2006 of
the Company and our report dated February 28, 2007 expressed an unqualified
opinion on those financial statements and financial statement schedule and
included explanatory paragraphs regarding the retrospective adjustment for the
adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123R,

Share Based Payment

, the retrospective adjustment for the
change in method for determining the market related value of plan assets of the
Company’s UK defined benefit pension plan from a calculated value method to the
fair value method, and for the adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 158,

Employers’ Accounting for
Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans—an amendment of FASB
Statements No. 87, 88, 106, and 132R

Changes in Internal Control over Financial
Reporting

There have been no changes in the Company’s
internal controls over financial reporting during the fourth fiscal quarter
ended December 31, 2006 that have materially affected, or are reasonably
likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial
reporting.

The Company has

The system went live in one business unit on December 4, 2006 and will

the Company’s internal controls over financial reporting.

The Amended and Restated 1998 Share
Purchase and Option Plan for Key Employees (the “1998 Plan”) and the Amended
and Restated Willis Award Plan for Key Employees (the “Willis Award Plan”), are
not approved by the Company’s shareholders. Each provides for the grant of
time-based vesting options, performance-based vesting options and various
other share-based grants to our employees to purchase Shares. The 1998
Plan and the Willis Award Plan are intended to promote the Company’s long-term
financial interests and growth by attracting and retaining management personnel
with the training, experience and ability to enable them to make a substantial
contribution to the success of our business; motivate management personnel by
means of growth-related incentives to achieve long range goals; and
further the alignment of interests of participants with those of shareholders
of the Company through opportunities for increased share ownership in us.

As of February 28, 2007, of the time
and performance-based options granted, 714,550 remained unforfeited under
the 1998 Plan and 6,710 remained unforfeited under the Willis Award Plan. No
further grants are to be made under the 1998 Plan. There are 5,000,000
shares available to be granted under the Willis Award Plan. Under the 1998
Plan, unless otherwise provided by our Board of Directors, time-based options
generally became exercisable in five equal annual installments beginning on the
second anniversary of the date of grant and performance-based options
generally became exercisable in four equal annual installments, beginning on
the third anniversary of grant, subject to performance targets. Effective from January 1,
2003, it was determined that these financial performance targets had been
achieved. The exercisability of the options may accelerate or terminate based
on the circumstances surrounding an optionee’s termination of employment, and
both time-based and performance-based options may (in the discretion of
our Board of Directors), fully accelerate upon a change in control of the
Company.

Unless sooner terminated by our Board of
Directors, the 1998 Plan and Willis Award Plan will expire 10 years after
its adoption. That termination will not affect the validity of any grant
outstanding on the date of the termination of either of the 1998 Plan or the
Willis Award Plan.

Our Board of Directors and its Compensation
Committee administer the 1998 Plan and Willis Award Plan. Our Board of
Directors may from time to time amend the terms of any grant, but, except for
adjustments made upon a change in our Shares by reason of a stock split,
spin-off, stock dividend, stock combination or reclassification,
recapitalization, reorganization, consolidation, change of control or similar
event, that action may not adversely affect the rights of any participant under
the 1998 Plan or Willis Award Plan, as applicable, with respect to the options
without at least a majority of the participants approving such action. Our
Board of Directors retains the right to amend, suspend or terminate the 1998
Plan and Willis Award Plan at any time.


Our UK subsidiary, Willis Group Limited,
maintains Employee Share Ownership Plans, which as of  February 28, 2007, held 35,313 Shares on
behalf of Willis Group employees. These Shares were acquired by the Plans at
the time of the 1998 acquisition of Willis Group Limited by Profit Sharing
(Overseas) in return for the employees forfeiting cash awards held by the Plans
for their benefit. As part of the forfeiture arrangements, certain employees
were granted, under our Zero Cost Share Option Scheme, options over shares (now
Shares), the value of which equaled on grant the cash amount of forfeited cash
awards. The Plans are obliged to deliver the Shares held when the zero cost
option is exercised upon payment of £1 and relevant taxes. No option may
be exercised more than 10 years from the date of grant and no further
options will be granted under the Zero Cost Share Option Scheme.

Those employees who forfeited cash awards
but did not receive a zero cost option grant have their Shares vested under the
Plans at the same time they would have received the cash awards.

In addition, options may be adjusted to
reflect variations in the share capital of the Company including the
capitalization, rights issue and subdivision, consolidation or reduction in the
capital of the Company. The Board of Directors may amend the provisions of the
Zero Cost Share Option Scheme at any time; however, the Board of Directors may
not make any amendments that would disadvantage the participants without
obtaining prior approval of the amendments from a majority of the participants.

In connection with the employee stock
purchase agreements described above, a trust was established at the time of the 1998
acquisition of Willis Group Limited by Profit Sharing (Overseas), which through
its trustees, is a party to the Management and Employee Shareholders’ and
Subscription Agreement, which governed the Shares purchased by our employees at
that time. Under this agreement, the trust repurchased Shares and options owned
by those employees whose employment with us terminated. Also, the trust has the
power to sell Shares at fair market value to current employees which is
undertaken in connection with certain option grants under the 2001 Plan.
As of February 28, 2007, the trust had an interest in 131,970 Shares
which can be purchased by employees or used to satisfy options grants made by
us.
