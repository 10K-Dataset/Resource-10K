    statements include information about possible or assumed future
    results of our operations. All statements, other than statements
    of historical facts, that address activities, events or

There are important uncertainties, events and factors that could
    cause our actual results or performance to differ materially
    from those in the forward-looking statements contained in this
    document, including the following:

•

the impact of any regional, national or global political,
    economic, business, competitive, market and regulatory
    conditions on our global business operations;

    of operations and financial condition, including as a result of
    any insolvencies of or other difficulties experienced by our

    affect expenses and revenue;

    or the pricing thereof;

our ability to achieve the expected strategic benefits of
    transactions, such as the Gras Savoye transaction or HRH
    acquisition;

•

the potential costs and difficulties in complying with a wide
    variety of foreign laws and regulations and any related changes,

    may emerge from time to time that could also affect actual
    performance and results.

Although we believe that the assumptions underlying our
    forward-looking statements are reasonable, any of these

    based on these



assumptions, could themselves prove to be inaccurate. In light
    of the significant uncertainties inherent in the forward-looking
    statements included in this document, our inclusion of this
    information is not a representation or guarantee by us that our
    objectives and plans will be achieved.

Our forward-looking statements speak only as of the date made
    and we will not update these forward-

looking statements unless the securities laws require us to do
    so. In light of these risks, uncertainties and assumptions, the
    forward-looking events discussed in this document may not occur,
    and we caution you against unduly relying on these
    forward-looking statements.

Item 1 —

Business

History
    and Development of the Company

Willis Group Holdings is the ultimate holding company for the
    Group. We trace our history to 1828 and are one of the largest
    insurance brokers in the world.

Willis Group Holdings was incorporated in Ireland on
    September 24, 2009 to facilitate the change of the place of
    incorporation of the parent company of the Group from Bermuda to
    Ireland (the ‘Redomicile’). At the Effective Time the
    common shares of Willis-Bermuda were canceled, the
    Willis-Bermuda common shareholders received, on a one-for-one
    basis, new ordinary shares of Willis Group Holdings, and Willis
    Group Holdings became the ultimate parent company for the Group.

For administrative convenience, we utilize the offices of a
    subsidiary company as our principal executive offices. The
    address is:

Willis Group Holdings Public Limited Company

c/o Willis

Group Limited

The Willis Building

51 Lime Street

London EC3M 7DQ

England

Tel: +44 203 124 6000

For several years, we have focused on our core retail and
    specialist broking operations. In 2008, we acquired HRH, at the
    time the eighth largest insurance and risk management
    intermediary in the United States. The acquisition almost
    doubled our North America revenues and created critical mass in
    key markets including California, Florida, Texas, Illinois, New
    York, Boston, New Jersey and Philadelphia. In addition, we have
    made a number of smaller acquisitions around the world and
    increased our ownership in several of our associates and
    existing subsidiaries, which were not wholly-owned, where doing
    so strengthened our retail network and our specialty businesses.

    Company, One World Financial, 200 Liberty Street, New York, NY

General

We provide a broad range of insurance brokerage, reinsurance and
    risk management consulting services to our clients worldwide. We
    have significant market positions in the United States, in the
    United Kingdom and, directly and through our associates, in many
    other countries. We are a recognized leader in providing
    specialized risk management advisory and other services on a
    global basis to clients in various industries including
    aerospace, marine, construction and energy.

In our capacity as an advisor and insurance broker, we act as an
    intermediary between our clients and insurance carriers by
    advising our clients on their



risk management requirements, helping clients determine the best
    means of managing risk, and negotiating and placing insurance
    risk with insurance carriers through our global distribution
    network.

We assist clients in the assessment of their risks, advise on
    the best ways of transferring suitable risk to the global
    insurance and reinsurance markets and then execute the
    transactions at the most appropriate available price, terms and
    conditions for our clients. Our global distribution network
    enables us to place the risk in the most appropriate insurance
    or reinsurance market worldwide.

We also offer clients a broad range of services to help them to
    identify and control their risks. These services range from
    strategic risk consulting (including providing actuarial
    analyses), to a variety of due diligence services, to the
    provision of practical

on-site

risk
    control services (such as health and safety or property loss
    control consulting) as well as analytical and advisory services
    (such as hazard modeling and reinsurance optimization studies).
    We assist clients in planning how to manage incidents or crises
    when they occur. These services include contingency planning,
    security audits and product tampering plans. We are not an
    insurance company and therefore we do not underwrite insurable
    risks for our own account.

We and our associates serve a diverse base of clients located in
    approximately 190 countries. These clients include major
    multinational and middle-market companies in a variety of
    industries, as well as public institutions and individual
    clients. Many of our client relationships span decades.
    Including our associates, we have approximately
    20,000 employees around the world and a network of about
    400 offices in some 100 countries.

We believe we are one of only a few insurance brokers in the
    world possessing the global operating presence, broad product
    expertise and extensive distribution network necessary to meet
    effectively the global risk management needs of many of our
    clients.

Business
    Strategy — Shaping Our Future

Our Shaping Our Future Strategy is our commitment to:

•

segment clients and deliver service consistent with their needs
    and target high growth businesses and geographies;

•

drive profitable growth through providing our clients with value
    and service above that provided by our competitors;

•

use our global scale to manage carrier relationships in the best
    interest of the clients and to deliver product innovation;

•

aim to deliver service to clients efficiently by streamlining
    our organization and utilizing industry leading technology. We
    aim to create the optimal platform by enhancing our service
    model, processes and technology; and

•

become the employer of choice by creating a clear path of career
    development for our people and a reward and recognition
    framework that recognizes team work.

Our
    Business

Insurance and reinsurance is a global business, and its
    participants are affected by global trends in capacity and
    pricing. Accordingly, we operate as one global business which
    ensures all clients’ interests are handled efficiently and
    comprehensively, whatever their initial point of contact. We
    organize our business into three segments: North America and
    International, which together comprise our principal retail
    operations, and Global. For information regarding revenues,
    operating income and total assets per segment, see Note 23
    of the Consolidated Financial Statements contained herein.

Global

Our Global business provides specialist brokerage and consulting
    services to clients worldwide for the risks arising from
    specific industrial and commercial activities. In these
    operations, we have extensive specialized experience handling
    diverse lines of coverage, including complex insurance programs,
    and acting as an intermediary between retail brokers and
    insurers. We increasingly provide consulting services on risk
    management with the objective of assisting clients to reduce the
    overall cost of risk. Our Global business serves clients in
    around 190 countries, primarily from offices in the United
    Kingdom, although we also serve clients from offices in the
    United States, Continental Europe and Asia.

•

Willis Capital Markets and Advisory Services

Willis Capital Markets and Advisory Services was established in

    a broad array of capital markets products and mergers and
    acquisitions.



International

Our International business unit comprises our operations in
    Eastern and Western Europe, the United Kingdom and Ireland,
    Asia-Pacific, Russia, the Middle East, South Africa and Latin
    America.

Our offices provide services to businesses locally in over 100
    countries around the world, making use of skills, industry
    knowledge and expertise available elsewhere in the Group.

The services provided are focused according to the
    characteristics of each market and vary across offices, but
    generally include direct risk management and insurance
    brokerage, specialist and reinsurance brokerage and employee
    benefits consulting.

We target large accounts and middle market clients. Recent
    global market conditions have resulted in excellent
    opportunities to recruit talented teams and individuals from the
    competition with new and complementary skills and relationships.
    Our Shaping Our Future initiative is delivering a range of
    efficiency and growth focused actions aimed at being the leading
    broker for customer service and providing a platform for
    sustainable and market leading growth. This includes the
    implementation of new client administration technology.

We believe the combined total revenues of our International
    subsidiaries and associates provide an indication of the spread
    and capability of our International network. The team generated
    over 30 percent of the Group’s total consolidated
    commissions and fees in 2009.

•

Emerging Markets

We have identified high growth markets across all International
    practice areas. These encompass the fast-developing, high growth
    regions of Eastern Europe, Russia, Asia (excluding Japan), the
    Middle East and South Africa. We bring particular capabilities
    and scale in energy, construction, marine and aerospace to these
    regions.

•

Global Markets International

Global Markets International work closely with our Global
    business segment to further develop access for our retail
    clients to global markets, and provide structuring and placing
    skills in the relevant areas of property, casualty, terrorism,
    accident & health, facultative and captives.

As part of our on-going strategy, we look for opportunities to
    strengthen our International market share through acquisitions
    and strategic investments. We have acquired a controlling
    interest in a broad geographic spread of other
    brokers — a list of the significant International
    subsidiaries is included in Exhibit 21.1 to this document.

We have also invested in associate companies; our significant
    associates at December 31, 2009 were GS & Cie
    Groupe (‘Gras Savoye’), France (31 percent
    holding) and Al-Futtaim Willis Co. LLC, Dubai (49 percent
    holding). In connection with many of our investments we retain
    the right to increase our ownership over time, typically to a
    majority or 100 percent ownership position. In addition, in
    certain instances our co-shareholders have a right, typically
    based on some price formula of revenues or earnings, to put some
    or all of their shares to us. On December 17, 2009 as part
    of a reorganization of the share capital of Gras Savoye our
    interest in that company reduced from 48 percent to
    31 percent. In addition, we have the option to acquire a
    100 percent interest in the capital of Gras Savoye in 2015.
    For further information on the Gras Savoye capital
    reorganization see ‘Item 8 — Financial
    Statements and Supplementary Data —
    Note 15 — Investments in Associates.’

Customers

Our clients operate on a global and local scale in a multitude
    of businesses and industries throughout the world and generally
    range in size from major multinational corporations to
    middle-market companies. Further, many of our client
    relationships span decades, for instance our relationship with
    The Tokio Marine and Fire Insurance Company Limited dates back
    over 100 years. No one client accounted for more than
    10 percent of revenues for fiscal year 2009. Additionally,
    we place insurance with over 5,000 insurance carriers, none of
    which individually accounted for more than 10 percent of
    the total premiums we placed on behalf of our clients in 2009.

Competition

We face competition in all fields in which we operate based on
    global capability, product breadth, innovation, quality of
    service and price. According to the Directory of Agents and
    Brokers published by Business Insurance in July 2009, the 150
    largest



commercial insurance brokers globally reported brokerage
    revenues totaling $40 billion in 2008, of which
    Marsh & McLennan Companies Inc. had approximately
    29 percent, Aon Corporation had approximately
    18 percent and Willis had approximately 8 percent.

We compete with Marsh & McLennan and Aon as well as
    with numerous specialist, regional and local firms.

Insurance companies also compete with brokers by directly
    soliciting insureds without the assistance of an independent
    broker or agent.

Competition for business is intense in all our business lines
    and in every insurance market. Competition on premium rates has
    also exacerbated the pressures caused by a continuing reduction
    in demand in some classes of business. For example, rather than
    purchase additional insurance through brokers, many insureds
    have been retaining a greater proportion of their risk
    portfolios than previously. Industrial and commercial companies
    are increasingly relying upon captive insurance companies,
    self-insurance pools, risk retention groups, mutual insurance
    companies and other mechanisms for funding their risks, rather
    than buying insurance.

Additional competitive pressures arise from the entry of new
    market participants, such as banks, accounting firms and
    insurance carriers themselves, offering risk management or
    transfer services.

In 2005, we, along with Marsh & McLennan and Aon, agreed to
    implement certain business reforms which included codification
    of our voluntary termination of contingent commission
    arrangements with insurers. However, most other special,
    regional and local insurance brokers continued to accept
    contingent compensation and did not disclose the compensation
    received in connection with providing policy placement services
    to its customers. In February 2010, we entered into the Amended
    and Restated Assurance of Discontinuance with the Attorney
    General of the State of New York and the Amended and Restated
    Stipulation with the Superintendent of Insurance of the State of
    New York which ended many of the requirements previously imposed
    upon us. The new agreement no longer limits the type of
    compensation we can receive and lowers the compensation
    disclosure requirements we must make to our clients.

Our position is to refuse to accept contingent commissions from
    carriers in our retail brokerage business. We seek to increase
    revenue through higher commissions and fees that we disclose to
    our clients, and to generate profitable revenue growth by
    focusing on the provision of value-added risk advisory services
    beyond traditional brokerage activities. Although we continue to
    believe in the success of our strategy, we cannot be certain
    that such steps will help us to continue to generate profitable
    organic revenue growth.

Regulation

Our business activities are subject to legal requirements and
    governmental and quasi-governmental regulatory supervision in
    virtually all countries in which we operate. Also, such
    regulations may require individual or company licensing to
    conduct our business activities. While these requirements may
    vary from location to location they are generally designed to
    protect our clients by establishing minimum standards of conduct
    and practice, particularly regarding the provision of advice and
    product information as well as financial criteria.

United
    States

Our activities in connection with insurance brokerage services
    within the United States are subject to regulation and
    supervision by state authorities. Although the scope of
    regulation and form of supervision may vary from jurisdiction to
    jurisdiction, insurance laws in the United States are often
    complex and generally grant broad discretion to supervisory
    authorities in adopting regulations and supervising regulated
    activities. That supervision generally includes the licensing of
    insurance brokers and agents and the regulation of the handling
    and investment of client funds held in a fiduciary capacity. Our
    continuing ability to provide insurance brokerage in the
    jurisdictions in which we currently operate is dependent upon
    our compliance with the rules and regulations promulgated from
    time to time by the regulatory authorities in each of these
    jurisdictions.

European
    Union

The European Union Insurance Mediation Directive introduced
    rules to enable insurance and reinsurance intermediaries to
    operate and provide services within each member state of the EU
    on a basis



consistent with the EU single market and customer protection
    aims. Each EU member state in which we operate is required to
    ensure that the insurance and reinsurance intermediaries
    resident in their country are registered with a statutory body
    in that country and that each intermediary meets professional
    requirements in relation to their competence, good repute,
    professional indemnity cover and financial capacity.

United
    Kingdom

In the United Kingdom, the statutory body is the Financial
    Services Authority (‘FSA’). The FSA has prescribed the
    methods by which our insurance and reinsurance operations are to
    conduct business, and has a wide range of rule-making,
    investigatory and enforcement powers aimed at meeting its
    overall aim of promoting efficient, orderly and fair markets and
    helping retail consumers achieve a fair deal. The FSA conducts
    monitoring visits to assess our compliance with regulatory
    requirements.

Certain of our activities are governed by other regulatory
    bodies, such as investment and securities licensing authorities.
    In the United States, Willis Capital Markets operates through
    our wholly-owned subsidiary Willis Securities, Inc., a

US-registered

broker-dealer and investment advisor, member FINRA/SIPC,
    primarily in connection with investment banking-related services
    and advising on alternative risk financing transactions. Willis
    Capital Markets provides advice on securities or investments in
    the EU through our wholly-owned

subsidiary Willis Structured Financial Solutions Limited, which
    is authorized and regulated by the FSA.

Our failure, or that of our employees, to satisfy the regulators
    that we are in compliance with their requirements or the legal
    requirements governing our activities, can result in
    disciplinary action, fines, reputational damage and financial
    harm.

All companies carrying on similar activities in a given
    jurisdiction are subject to regulations which are not dissimilar
    to the requirements for our operations in the United States and
    United Kingdom. We do not consider that these regulatory
    requirements adversely affect our competitive position.

See Part I, Item 1A — Risk Factors
    ‘Legal and Regulatory Risks’ for discussion of how
    actions by regulatory authorities or changes in legislation and
    regulation in the jurisdictions in which we operate may have an
    adverse effect on our business.

Employees

As of December 31, 2009 we had approximately
    17,000 employees worldwide of whom approximately 3,500 were
    employed in the United Kingdom and 6,700 in the United States,
    with the balance being employed across the rest of the world. In
    addition, our associates had approximately 3,200 employees,
    all of whom were located outside the United Kingdom and the
    United States.



Item 1A —

Risk
    Factors

Risks
    Relating to our Business and the Insurance Industry

This section describes material risks affecting the Group’s
    business. These risks could materially affect the Group’s
    business, its revenues, operating income, net income, net
    assets, liquidity and capital resources and ability to achieve
    its financial targets and, accordingly should be read in
    conjunction with any forward-looking statements in this Annual
    Report on

Form 10-K.

Competitive
    Risks

Worldwide economic conditions could have an adverse effect on
    our business.

Our business and operating results are materially affected by
    worldwide economic conditions. Current global economic
    conditions coupled with declining customer and business
    confidence, increasing energy prices, and other challenges, may
    have a significant negative impact on the buying behavior of
    some of our clients as their businesses suffer from these
    conditions. In particular, financial institutions, construction,
    aviation, and logistics businesses such as marine cargo are most
    likely to be affected. Further, the global economic downturn is
    also negatively affecting some of the international economies
    that have supported the strong growth in our International
    operations. Our employee benefits practice may also be adversely
    affected as businesses continue to downsize during this period
    of economic turmoil. In addition, a growing number of
    insolvencies associated with an economic downturn, especially
    insolvencies in the insurance industry, could adversely affect
    our brokerage business through the loss of clients or by
    hampering our ability to place insurance and reinsurance
    business. While it is difficult to predict consequences of any
    further deterioration in global economic conditions on our
    business, any significant reduction or delay by our clients in
    purchasing insurance or making payment of premiums could have a
    material adverse impact on our financial condition and results
    of operations.

The potential for a significant insurer to fail or withdraw from
    writing certain lines of insurance coverages that we offer our
    clients could negatively impact overall capacity in the
    industry, which could then reduce the placement of certain lines
    and types of insurance and reduce our revenues and

profitability. The potential for an insurer to fail could also
    result in errors and omissions claims by clients.

Since 2008, we have launched certain initiatives, such as Right
    Sizing Willis and Shaping Our Future, to achieve cost-savings or
    fund our future growth plans. In light of the global economic
    uncertainty, we continue to vigorously manage our cost base in
    order to fund further growth initiatives, but we cannot be
    certain whether we will be able to realize any further benefits
    from these initiatives or any new initiatives that we may
    implement.

We do not control the premiums on which our commissions are
    based, and volatility or declines in premiums may seriously
    undermine our profitability.

We derive most of our revenues from commissions and fees for
    brokerage and consulting services. We do not determine insurance
    premiums on which our commissions are generally based. Premiums
    are cyclical in nature and may vary widely based on market
    conditions. From the late 1980s through late 2000, insurance
    premium rates generally declined as a result of a number of
    factors, including the expanded underwriting capacity of
    insurance carriers; consolidation of both insurance
    intermediaries and insurance carriers; and increased competition
    among insurance carriers. From 2000 to 2003, we benefitted from
    a ‘hard’ market with premium rates stable or
    increasing. During 2004, we saw a rapid transition from a hard
    market, with premium rates stable or increasing, to a
    ‘soft’ market, with premium rates falling in most
    markets. The soft market continued to have an adverse impact on
    our commission revenues and operating margin from 2005 through
    2008. Rates continued to decline in most sectors through 2005
    and 2006, with the exception of catastrophe-exposed markets. In
    2007, the market softened further with decreases in many of the
    market sectors in which we operated and this continued into 2008
    with further premium rate declines averaging 10 percent
    across our market sectors. In 2009, the benefit of rate
    increases in the reinsurance market and stabilization in some
    specialty markets was offset by the continuing soft market in
    other sectors and the adverse impact of the weakened economic
    environment across the globe. Our North America and UK and Irish
    retail operations have been particularly impacted by the



weakened economic climate and continued soft market with no
    material improvement in rates across most sectors. This has
    resulted in declines in 2009 revenues in these operations,
    particularly amongst our smaller clients who are especially
    vulnerable to the economic downturn.

In addition, as traditional risk-bearing insurance carriers
    continue to outsource the production of premium revenue to
    non-affiliated agents or brokers such as ourselves, those
    insurance carriers may seek to reduce further their expenses by
    reducing the commission rates payable to those insurance agents
    or brokers. The reduction of these commission rates, along with
    general volatility

and/or

declines in premiums, may significantly undermine our
    profitability.

Competition in our industry is intense, and if we are unable
    to compete effectively, we may suffer lower revenue, reduced
    operating margins and lose market share which could materially
    and adversely affect our business.

We face competition in all fields in which we operate, based on
    global capability, product breadth, innovation, quality of
    service and price. We compete with Marsh & McLennan
    and Aon, the two other providers of global risk management
    services, as well as with numerous specialist, regional and
    local firms. Competition for business is intense in all our
    business lines and in every insurance market, and the other two
    providers of global risk management services have substantially
    greater market share than we do. Competition on premium rates
    has also exacerbated the pressures caused by a continuing
    reduction in demand in some classes of business. For example,
    rather than purchase additional insurance through brokers, many
    insureds have been retaining a greater proportion of their risk
    portfolios than previously. Industrial and commercial companies
    have been increasingly relying upon their own subsidiary
    insurance companies, known as captive insurance companies,
    self-insurance pools, risk retention groups, mutual insurance
    companies and other mechanisms for funding their risks, rather
    than buying insurance. Additional competitive pressures arise
    from the entry of new market participants, such as banks,
    accounting firms and insurance carriers themselves, offering
    risk management or transfer services.

In 2005, we, along with Marsh McLennan and Aon, agreed to
    implement certain business reforms which included codification
    of our voluntary termination

of contingent commission arrangements with insurers. However,
    most other special, regional and local insurance brokers
    continued to accept contingent compensation and did not disclose
    the compensation received in connection with providing policy
    placement services to its customers. In February 2010, we
    entered into the Amended and Restated Assurance of
    Discontinuance with the Attorney General of the State of New
    York and the Amended and Restated Stipulation with the
    Superintendent of Insurance of the State of New York which ended
    many of the requirements previously imposed upon us. The new
    agreement no longer limits the type of compensation we will
    receive and lowers the compensation disclosure requirements we
    must make to our clients.

Our position is to refuse to accept contingent commissions from
    carriers in our retail brokerage business. We seek to increase
    revenue through higher commissions and fees that we disclose to
    our clients, and to generate profitable revenue growth by
    focusing on the provision of value-added risk advisory services
    beyond traditional brokerage activities. Although we continue to
    believe in the success of our strategy, we cannot be certain
    that such steps will help us to continue to generate profitable
    organic revenue growth. If we are unable to compete effectively
    against our competitors who are or may accept contingent
    commissions, we may suffer lower revenue, reduced operating
    margins and loss of market share which could materially and
    adversely affect our business.

Dependence on Key Personnel — The loss of our
    Chairman and Chief Executive Officer or a number of our senior
    management or a significant number of our brokers could
    significantly impede our financial plans, growth, marketing and
    other objectives.

The loss of our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer or a number
    of our senior management or a significant number of our brokers
    could significantly impede our financial plans, growth,
    marketing and other objectives. Our success depends to a
    substantial extent not only on the ability and experience of our
    Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Joseph J. Plumeri and
    other members of our senior management, but also on the
    individual brokers and teams that service our clients and
    maintain client relationships. The insurance and reinsurance
    brokerage industry has in the past experienced intense
    competition for the services of



leading individual brokers and brokerage teams, and we have lost
    key individuals and teams to competitors. We believe that our
    future success will depend in part on our ability to attract and
    retain additional highly skilled and qualified personnel and to
    expand, train and manage our employee base. We may not continue
    to be successful in doing so because the competition for
    qualified personnel in our industry is intense.

Legal
    and Regulatory Risks

Our compliance systems and controls cannot guarantee that we
    are in compliance with all potentially applicable federal and
    state or foreign laws and regulations, and actions by regulatory
    authorities or changes in legislation and regulation in the
    jurisdictions in which we operate may have an adverse effect on
    our business.

Our activities are subject to extensive regulation under the
    laws of the United States, the United Kingdom and the European
    Union and its member states, and the other jurisdictions in
    which we operate. Compliance with laws and regulations that are
    applicable to our operations is complex and may increase our
    cost of doing business. These laws and regulations include
    insurance industry regulations, economic and trade sanctions and
    laws against financial crimes such as money laundering, bribery
    or other corruption, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt
    Practices Act. In most jurisdictions, governmental and
    regulatory authorities have the authority to interpret or amend
    these laws and regulations and could impose penalties for
    non-compliance, including sanctions or civil remedies, fines,
    injunctions, loss of an operating license or approval, the
    suspension of individual employees, limitations on engaging in a
    particular business or redress to clients.

Given the increase in focus and developments in these laws over
    the last few years in general, and the interest expressed by UK
    and US regulators in the effectiveness of compliance controls
    relating to financial crime in our market sector in particular,
    we began a voluntary internal review of our policies and
    controls three years ago. This ongoing review includes analysis
    and advice from external experts on best practices, review of
    public regulatory decisions, and ongoing discussions with
    government regulators in the UK and US. We believe our
    compliance policies, controls and programs are

effective and we make all reasonable efforts to comply with all
    applicable laws and regulations, but given the complex nature of
    these laws and regulations, we cannot assure the complete
    adequacy of our policies and controls or that at all times we
    have been or are in compliance with all applicable laws and
    regulations or interpretations of these laws and regulations.
    The cost of compliance or the consequences of non-compliance
    could adversely affect our business and results of operations
    and expose us to negative publicity, reputational damage or harm
    to our client or employee relationships.

Our business, results of operations, financial condition or
    liquidity may be materially adversely affected by actual and
    potential claims, lawsuits, investigations and proceedings.

We are subject to various actual and potential claims, lawsuits,
    investigations and other proceedings relating principally to
    alleged errors and omissions in connection with the placement of
    insurance and reinsurance in the ordinary course of business.
    Because we often assist our clients with matters, including the
    placement of insurance coverage and the handling of related
    claims, involving substantial amounts of money, errors and
    omissions claims against us may arise which allege our potential
    liability for all or part of the amounts in question. Claimants
    can seek large damage awards and these claims can involve
    potentially significant defense costs. Such claims, lawsuits and
    other proceedings could, for example, include allegations of
    damages for our employees or sub-agents improperly failing to
    place coverage or notify claims on behalf of clients, to provide
    insurance carriers with complete and accurate information
    relating to the risks being insured or to appropriately apply
    funds that we hold for our clients on a fiduciary basis. Errors
    and omissions claims, lawsuits and other proceedings arising in
    the ordinary course of business are covered in part by
    professional indemnity or other appropriate insurance. The terms
    of this insurance vary by policy year and self-insured risks
    have increased significantly in recent years. In respect of
    self-insured risks, we have established provisions against these
    items which we believe to be adequate in the light of current
    information and legal advice, and we adjust such provisions from
    time to time according to developments. Our business, results of
    operations, financial condition and liquidity may be



adversely affected if in the future our insurance coverage
    proves to be inadequate or unavailable or there is an increase
    in liabilities for which we self-insure. Our ability to obtain
    professional indemnity insurance in the amounts and with the
    deductibles we desire in the future may be adversely impacted by
    general developments in the market for such insurance or our own
    claims experience.

We are also subject to actual and potential claims, lawsuits,
    investigations and proceedings outside of errors and omissions
    claims. The material actual or potential claims, lawsuits and
    proceedings to which we are currently subject, including but not
    limited to errors and omissions claims, are: (1) legal
    proceedings and investigations relating to contingent commission
    arrangements, ‘bid rigging’ and ‘tying’;
    (2) potential claims arising out of various legal
    proceedings between reinsurers, reinsureds and their reinsurance
    brokers relating to personal accident excess of loss reinsurance
    placements for the years 1993 to 1998; (3) potential
    damages arising out of a court action, on behalf of a purported
    class of present and former female officer and officer
    equivalent employees for alleged discrimination against them on
    the basis of their gender; (4) claims with respect to our
    placement of property and casualty insurance for a number of
    entities which were directly impacted by the September 11,
    2001 destruction of New York’s World Trade Center complex;
    and (5) claims relating to the collapse of The Stanford
    Financial Group, for which we acted as brokers of record on
    certain lines of insurance.

The ultimate outcome of all matters referred to above cannot be
    ascertained and liabilities in indeterminate amounts may be
    imposed on us. It is thus possible that future results of
    operations or cash flows for any particular quarterly or annual
    period could be materially affected by an unfavorable resolution
    of these matters. In addition, these matters continue to divert
    management and personnel resources away from operating our
    business. Even if we do not experience significant monetary
    costs, there may also be adverse publicity associated with these
    matters that could result in reputational harm to the insurance
    brokerage industry in general or to us in particular that may
    adversely affect our business, client or employee relationships.

Interruption to or loss of our information processing
    capabilities or failure to effectively maintain and upgrade our
    information processing systems could cause material financial
    loss, loss of human resources, regulatory actions, reputational
    harm or legal liability.

Our business depends significantly on effective information
    systems.  Our capacity to service our clients relies on
    effective storage, retrieval, processing and management of
    information. Our information systems also rely on the commitment
    of significant resources to maintain and enhance existing
    systems and to develop new systems in order to keep pace with
    continuing changes in information processing technology or
    evolving industry and regulatory standards. The acquisition of
    HRH and additional information systems has added to this
    exposure.  If the information we rely on to run our business
    were found to be inaccurate or unreliable or if we fail to
    maintain effective and efficient systems (either through a
    telecommunications failure, if we fail to replace redundant or
    obsolete computer applications or software systems or if we
    experience other disruptions), this could result in material
    financial loss, regulatory action, reputational harm or legal
    liability.

Our inability to successfully recover should we experience a
    disaster or other significant disruption to business continuity
    could have a material adverse effect on our operations.

Our ability to conduct business may be adversely affected, even
    in the short-term, by a disruption in the infrastructure that
    supports our business and the communities where we are located.
    This may include a disruption caused by restricted physical site
    access, terrorist activities, disease pandemics, or outages to
    electrical, communications or other services used by our
    company, our employees or third parties with whom we conduct
    business. Although we have certain disaster recovery procedures
    in place and insurance to protect against such contingencies,
    such procedures may not be effective and any insurance or
    recovery procedures may not continue to be available at
    reasonable prices and may not address all such losses or
    compensate us for the possible loss of clients occurring during
    any period that we are unable to provide services.  Our
    inability to successfully recover should we experience a
    disaster or other



significant disruption to business continuity could have a
    material adverse effect on our operations.

Improper disclosure of personal data could result in legal
    liability or harm our reputation.

One of our significant responsibilities is to maintain the
    security and privacy of our clients’ confidential and
    proprietary information and the personal data of their
    employees. We maintain policies, procedures and technological
    safeguards designed to protect the security and privacy of this
    information in our database. However, we cannot entirely
    eliminate the risk of improper access to or disclosure of
    personally identifiable information. Our technology may fail to
    adequately secure the private information we maintain in our
    databases and protect it from theft or inadvertent loss. In such
    circumstances, we may be held liable to our clients, which could
    result in legal liability or impairment to our reputation
    resulting in increased costs or loss of revenue. Further
    database privacy, identity theft, and related computer and
    internet issues are matters of growing public concern and are
    subject to frequently changing rules and regulations. Our
    failure to adhere to or successfully implement processes in
    response to changing regulatory requirements in this area could
    result in legal liability or impairment to our reputation in the
    marketplace.

Financial
    Risks

We face certain risks associated with any acquisition or
    disposition of business or  reorganization of existing
    investments.

In pursuing our corporate strategy, we may acquire or dispose of
    or exit businesses or reorganize existing investments. The
    success of this strategy is dependent upon our ability to
    identify appropriate opportunities, negotiate transactions on
    favorable terms and ultimately complete such transactions. Once
    we complete acquisitions or reorganizations, such as the HRH
    acquisition or Gras Savoye transaction, there can be no
    assurance that we will realize the anticipated benefits of any
    transaction, including revenue growth, operational efficiencies
    or expected synergies. For example, if we fail to recognize some
    or all of the strategic benefits and synergies expected from the
    HRH transaction, goodwill and intangible assets may be impaired
    in future periods. In addition, we may not be able to integrate
    acquisitions successfully into our existing business, and we
    could incur or assume unknown or

unanticipated liabilities or contingencies, which may impact our
    results of operations. If we dispose of or otherwise exit
    certain businesses, there can be no assurance that we will not
    incur certain disposition related charges, or that we will be
    able to reduce overheads related to the divested assets.

Our outstanding debt could adversely affect our cash flows
    and financial flexibility.

As of December 31, 2009, we had total consolidated debt
    outstanding of approximately $2.4 billion and our 2009
    interest expense of $174 million is $69 million higher
    than in 2008. Although management believes that our cash flows
    will be more than adequate to service this debt, there may be
    circumstances in which required payments of principal

and/or

interest on this debt could adversely affect our cash flows and
    this level of indebtedness may:

•

require us to dedicate a significant portion of our cash flow
    from operations to payments on our debt, thereby reducing the
    availability of cash flow to fund capital expenditures, to
    pursue other acquisitions or investments in new technologies, to
    pay dividends and for general corporate purposes;

•

increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic
    conditions, including if we borrow at variable interest rates,
    which makes us vulnerable to increases in interest rates
    generally;

•

limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes
    or challenges relating to our business and industry; and

•

put us at a competitive disadvantage against competitors who
    have less indebtedness or are in a more favorable position to
    access additional capital resources.

The terms of our current financings also include certain
    limitations. For example, the agreements relating to the debt
    arrangements and credit facilities contain numerous operating
    and financial covenants, including requirements to maintain
    minimum ratios of consolidated adjusted EBITDA to consolidated
    fixed charges and maximum levels of consolidated funded
    indebtedness in relation to consolidated EBITDA, in each case
    subject to certain adjustments.

A failure to comply with the restrictions under our credit
    facilities and outstanding notes could result in a default under
    the financing obligations or could



require us to obtain waivers from our lenders for failure to
    comply with these restrictions. The occurrence of a default that
    remains uncured or the inability to secure a necessary consent
    or waiver could cause our obligations with respect to our debt
    to be accelerated and have a material adverse effect on our
    business, financial condition or results of operations.

Our pension liabilities may increase which could require us
    to make additional cash contributions to our pension plans.

We have two principal defined benefit plans: one in the United
    Kingdom and the other in the United States. Cash contributions
    of approximately $122 million will be required in 2010 for
    our pension plans, although we may elect to contribute more.
    Total cash contributions to these defined benefit pension plans
    in 2009 were $74 million. Future estimates are based on
    certain assumptions, including discount rates, interest rates,
    fair value of assets and expected return on plan assets.
    Following changes to UK pension legislation in 2005, we are now
    required to agree to a funding strategy for our UK defined
    benefit plan with the plan’s trustees. In February 2009, we
    agreed to make full year contributions to the UK plan of
    $40 million for 2009 through 2012, excluding those
    contributions made under our salary sacrifice scheme. In
    addition, as certain funding targets have not been met at the
    beginning of 2010, a further contribution of $40 million is
    required for 2010. A similar, additional contribution may also
    be required for 2011, depending on actual performance against
    funding targets at the beginning of 2011. We have taken actions
    to manage our pension liabilities, including closing our UK and
    US plans to new participants and restricting final pensionable
    salaries.

The determinations of pension expense and pension funding are
    based on a variety of rules and regulations. Changes in these
    rules and regulations could impact the calculation of pension
    plan liabilities and the valuation of pension plan assets. They
    may also result in higher pension costs, additional financial
    statement disclosure, and accelerate and increase the need to
    fully fund our pension plans. Our future required cash
    contributions to our US and UK defined benefit pension plans may
    increase based on the funding reform provisions that were
    enacted into law. Further, a significant decline in the value of

investments that fund our pension plan, if not offset or
    mitigated by a decline in our liabilities, may significantly
    differ from or alter the values and actuarial assumptions used
    to calculate our future pension expense and we could be required
    to fund our plan with significant amounts of cash. In addition,
    if the US Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation requires
    additional contributions to such plans or if other actuarial
    assumptions are modified, our future required cash contributions
    could increase. The need to make these cash contributions may
    reduce the cash available to meet our other obligations,
    including the payment obligations under our credit facilities
    and other long-term debt, or to meet the needs of our business.

In addition to the critical assumptions described above, our
    plans use certain assumptions about the life expectancy of plan
    participants and surviving spouses. Periodic revision of those
    assumptions can materially change the present value of future
    benefits and therefore the funded status of the plans and the
    resulting periodic pension expense. Changes in our pension
    benefit obligations and the related net periodic costs or
    credits may occur in the future due to any variance of actual
    results from our assumptions and changes in the number of
    participating employees. As a result, there can be no assurance
    that we will not experience future decreases in stockholders
    equity, net income, cash flow and liquidity or that we will not
    be required to make additional cash contributions in the future
    beyond those which have been estimated.

We could incur substantial losses if one of the financial
    institutions we use in our operations failed.

The deterioration of the global credit and financial markets has
    created challenging conditions for financial institutions,
    including depositories. As the fallout from the credit crisis
    persists, the financial strength of these institutions may
    continue to decline. We maintain cash balances at various US
    depository institutions that are significantly in excess of the
    US Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation insurance limits. We
    also maintain cash balances in foreign financial institutions.
    If one or more of the institutions in which we maintain
    significant cash balances were to fail, our ability to access
    these funds might be temporarily or permanently limited, and we
    could face a material liquidity problem and potentially material
    financial losses.



A downgrade in the credit ratings of our outstanding debt may
    adversely affect our borrowing costs and financial
    flexibility.

A downgrade in the credit ratings of our debt would increase our
    borrowing costs and reduce our financial flexibility. In
    addition, certain downgrades would trigger a

step-up

in
    interest rates under the indenture for our 6.2% senior
    notes due 2017 and our 7.0% senior notes due 2019, which
    would increase our interest expense. If we need to raise capital
    in the future, any credit rating downgrade could negatively
    affect our financing costs or access to financing sources.

International
    Risks

Our significant non-US operations, particularly our London
    market operations, expose us to exchange rate fluctuations and
    various risks that could impact our business.

A significant portion of our operations is conducted outside the
    United States. Accordingly, we are subject to legal, economic
    and market risks associated with operating in foreign countries,
    including devaluations and fluctuations in currency exchange
    rates; imposition of limitations on conversion of foreign
    currencies into pounds sterling or dollars or remittance of
    dividends and other payments by foreign subsidiaries;
    hyperinflation in certain foreign countries; imposition or
    increase of investment and other restrictions by foreign
    governments; and the requirement of complying with a wide
    variety of foreign laws.

We report our operating results and financial condition in US
    dollars. Our US operations earn revenue and incur expenses
    primarily in US dollars. In our London market operations,
    however, we earn revenue in a number of different currencies,
    but expenses are almost entirely incurred in pounds sterling.
    Outside the United States and our London market operations, we
    predominantly generate revenue and expenses in the local
    currency. The table gives an approximate analysis of revenues
    and expenses by currency in 2009.

Because of devaluations and fluctuations in currency exchange
    rates or the imposition of limitations on conversion of foreign
    currencies into US dollars, we

are subject to currency translation exposure on the profits of
    our operations, in addition to economic exposure. Furthermore,
    the mismatch between pounds sterling revenues and expenses,
    together with any net sterling balance sheet position we hold in
    our US dollar denominated London market operations, creates an
    exchange exposure.

For example, as the pound sterling strengthens, the US dollars
    required to be translated into pounds sterling to cover the net
    sterling expenses increase, which then causes our results to be
    negatively impacted. Our results may also be adversely impacted
    if we are holding a net sterling position in our US dollar
    denominated London market operations: if the pound sterling
    weakens any net sterling asset we are holding will be less
    valuable when translated into US dollars. Given these
    facts, the strength of the pound sterling relative to the
    US dollar has in the past had a material negative impact on
    our reported results. This risk could have a material adverse
    effect on our business financial condition, cash flow and
    results of operations in the future.

Where possible, we hedge part of our operating exposure to
    exchange rate movements, but such mitigating attempts may not be
    successful.

In conducting our businesses around the world, we are subject
    to political, economic, legal, market, nationalization,
    operational and other risks that are inherent in operating in
    many countries.

In conducting our businesses and maintaining and supporting our
    global operations, we are subject to political, economic, legal,
    market, nationalization, operational and other risks. Our
    businesses and operations are increasingly expanding into new
    regions throughout the world, including emerging markets, and we
    expect this trend to continue. The possible effects of economic
    and financial disruptions throughout the world could have an
    adverse impact on our businesses. These risks include:

•

the general economic and political conditions in foreign
    countries, for example, the recent devaluation of the Venezuelan
    Bolivar;

•

the imposition of controls or limitations on the conversion of
    foreign currencies or remittance of dividends and other payments
    by foreign subsidiaries;



•

imposition of withholding and other taxes on remittances and
    other payments from subsidiaries;

•

imposition or increase of investment and other restrictions by
    foreign governments;

•

difficulties in controlling operations and monitoring employees
    in geographically dispersed locations; and

•

the potential costs and difficulties in complying, or monitoring
    compliance, with a wide variety of foreign laws (some of which
    may conflict with US or other sources of law), laws and
    regulations applicable to US business operations abroad,
    including rules relating to trade sanctions administered by the
    US Office of Foreign Assets Control, the EU, the UK and the
    UN, and the requirements of the US Foreign Corrupt
    Practices Act as well as other anti-bribery and corruption rules
    and requirements in the countries in which we operate.

Legislative and regulatory action could materially and
    adversely affect us and our effective tax rate may increase.

There is uncertainty regarding the tax policies of the
    jurisdictions where we operate (which include the potential
    legislative actions described below), and our effective tax rate
    may increase and any such increase may be material.
    Additionally, the tax laws of Ireland and other jurisdictions
    could change in the future, and such changes could cause a
    material change in our effective tax rate. For example,
    legislative action may be taken by the US Congress which,
    if ultimately enacted, could override tax treaties upon which we
    rely or could broaden the circumstances under which we would be
    considered a US resident, each of which could materially
    and adversely affect our effective tax rate and cash tax
    position. We cannot predict the outcome of any specific
    legislative proposals. However, if proposals were enacted that
    had the effect of limiting our ability to take advantage of tax
    treaties between Ireland and other jurisdictions (including the
    US), we could be subjected to increased taxation. In

addition, any future amendments to the current income tax
    treaties between Ireland and other jurisdictions could subject
    us to increased taxation.

Irish law differs from the laws in effect in the United
    States and may afford less protection to holders of our
    securities.

It may not be possible to enforce court judgments obtained in
    the United States against us in Ireland based on the civil
    liability provisions of the US federal or state securities laws.
    In addition, there is some uncertainty as to whether the courts
    of Ireland would recognize or enforce judgments of
    US courts obtained against us or our directors or officers
    based on the civil liabilities provisions of the US federal
    or state securities laws or hear actions against us or those
    persons based on those laws. We have been advised that the
    United States currently does not have a treaty with Ireland
    providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of
    judgments in civil and commercial matters. Therefore, a final
    judgment for the payment of money rendered by any
    US federal or state court based on civil liability, whether
    or not based solely on US federal or state securities laws,
    would not be directly enforceable in Ireland.

As an Irish company, Willis Group Holdings is governed by the
    Irish Companies Acts, which differ in some material respects
    from laws generally applicable to US corporations and
    shareholders, including, among others, differences relating to
    interested director and officer transactions and shareholder
    lawsuits. Likewise, the duties of directors and officers of an
    Irish company generally are owed to the company only.
    Shareholders of Irish companies generally do not have a personal
    right of action against directors or officers of the company and
    may exercise such rights of action on behalf of the Company only
    in limited circumstances. Accordingly, holders of Willis Group
    Holdings securities may have more difficulty protecting their
    interests than would holders of securities of a corporation
    incorporated in a jurisdiction of the United States.

Submission
    of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders

On December 11, 2009, Willis-Bermuda held a special
    court-ordered meeting of its shareholders to vote:

1.

to approve a scheme of arrangement under Bermuda law pursuant to

    of Willis-Ireland instead common shares of Willis-Bermuda for
    the purpose of changing the place of incorporation of the parent
    company of the Group from Bermuda to Ireland; and

2.

to approve the creation of distributable reserves of
    Willis-Ireland (through the reduction of the entire share
    premium account of Willis-Ireland or such lesser amount as may
    be determined by the board of directors of Willis-Ireland) that
    was previously approved by Willis-Bermuda and the other
    shareholders of Willis-Ireland.

We normally pay dividends on a quarterly basis to shareholders
    of record on March 31, June 30, September 30 and
    December 31. The dividend payment dates and amounts are as
    follows:

On February 2, 2010, subject to the Irish High Court
    approving a reduction of our share capital in order to create
    distributable reserves, (which under Irish law are required to
    facilitate the payment of a dividend), and compliance generally
    with the requirements of the Irish Companies Acts relating to
    the payment of dividends, our Board of Directors authorized a
    regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.26 per share, which will
    be payable on April 16, 2010 to shareholders of record on
    March 31, 2010.

Subject to the above, there are no governmental laws, decrees or
    regulations in Ireland which will restrict the remittance of
    dividends or other payments to non-resident holders of the
    Company’s shares.

In circumstances where one of Ireland’s many exemptions
    from dividend withholding tax (‘DWT’) does not apply,
    dividends paid by the Company will be subject to Irish DWT
    (currently 20%). Residents of the US should be exempted from
    Irish DWT provided relevant documentation supporting the
    exemption has been put in place. While the US-Ireland Double Tax
    Treaty contains provisions reducing the rate of Irish DWT in
    prescribed circumstances, it should generally be unnecessary for
    US residents to rely on the provisions of this treaty due to the
    wide scope of exemptions from DWT available under Irish domestic
    law. Irish income tax may also arise in respect of dividends
    paid by the Company. However, US residents entitled to an
    exemption from Irish DWT generally have no Irish income tax
    liability on dividends. An exception to this position applies
    where a shareholder holds shares in the Company through a branch
    or agency in Ireland through which a trade is carried on.

With respect to non-corporate US shareholders, certain dividends
    received before January 1, 2009 from a qualified foreign
    corporation may be subject to reduced rates of taxation. A
    foreign corporation is treated as a qualified foreign
    corporation with respect to dividends received from that
    corporation on shares that are readily tradable on an
    established securities market in the United States, such as our
    shares. Non-corporate US shareholders that do not meet a minimum
    holding period requirement for our shares during which they are
    not protected from the risk of loss or that elect to treat the
    dividend income



as ‘investment income’ pursuant to
    section 163(d)(4) of the Code will not be eligible for the
    reduced rates of taxation regardless of our status as a
    qualified foreign corporation. In addition, the rate reduction
    will not apply to dividends if the recipient of a dividend is
    obligated to make related payments with respect to positions in
    substantially similar or related property. This disallowance
    applies even if the minimum holding period has been met.
    Non-corporate US shareholders should consult their own tax
    advisors regarding the application of these rules given their
    particular circumstances.

Unregistered
    Sales of Equity Securities and Use Of Proceeds

In addition to issuances disclosed in our quarterly filings
    throughout 2009 the Company issued a total of
    16,119 shares, during the period from October 1, 2009
    to December 31, 2009 without registration under the
    Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the ‘Securities
    Act’), in reliance upon the exemption under
    Section 4(2) of the Securities Act relating to sales by an
    issuer not involving a public offering, none of which involved
    the sale of more than 1 percent of the outstanding shares.

In connection with the Redomicile, Willis-Ireland issued a total
    of approximately 168,645,200 ordinary shares to holders of
    Willis-Bermuda common shares immediately prior to the Effective
    Time. The terms and conditions of the issuance of the securities
    were sanctioned by the Supreme Court of Bermuda after a hearing
    upon the fairness of such terms and conditions at which all
    Willis-Bermuda shareholders had a right to appear and of which
    adequate notice had been given. The issuance was exempt from the
    registration requirements of the Securities Act of by virtue of
    Section 3(a)(10) of the Securities Act.

Purchases
    of Equity Securities by the Issuer And Affiliated
    Purchasers

The Company may purchase shares, from time to time in the open
    market or through negotiated trades with persons who are not
    affiliates of the Company, at an aggregate purchase price of up
    to $1 billion under an open-ended program approved by the
    Board of Directors.

During the year ended December 31, 2009, there were no
    shares repurchased. At December 31, 2009, $925 million
    remained under the program for future repurchases.

The Company filed a Tender Offer Statement on Schedule TO, dated
    July 8, 2009 and as amended on July 23, 2009 and
    August 7, 2009, with the SEC to repurchase for cash options
    to purchase Company shares. The tender offer expired on
    August 6, 2009. Approximately 1.6 million options to
    purchase Company shares were repurchased at an average per share
    price of $2.04.

(i)

On October 1, 2008, we
    completed the acquisition of HRH, at the time the eighth largest
    insurance and risk management intermediary in the United States.
    The acquisition has significantly enhanced our North America
    revenues and the combined operations have critical mass in key
    markets across the US. We recognized goodwill and other
    intangible assets on the HRH acquisition of approximately
    $1.6 billion and $651 million, respectively.

(ii)

As an intermediary, we hold funds
    in a fiduciary capacity for the account of third parties,
    typically as a result of premiums received from clients that are
    in transit to insurance carriers and claims due to clients that
    are in transit from insurance carriers. We report premiums,
    which are held on account of, or due from policyholders, as
    assets with a corresponding liability due to the insurance
    carriers. Claims held by, or due to, us which are due to clients
    are also shown as both assets and liabilities of ours. All those
    balances due or payable are included in accounts receivable and
    payable on the balance sheet. Investment income is earned on
    those funds during the time between the receipt of the cash and
    the time the cash is paid out. Fiduciary cash must be kept in
    certain regulated bank accounts subject to guidelines, which
    vary according to legal jurisdiction. These guidelines generally
    emphasize capital protection and liquidity. Fiduciary cash is
    not available to service our debt or for other corporate
    purposes.



Item 7 —

Management’s
    Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
    Operations

This discussion includes references to non-GAAP financial
    measures as defined in Regulation G of SEC rules. We
    present such non-GAAP financial measures, as we believe such
    information is of interest to the investment community because
    it provides additional meaningful methods of evaluating certain
    aspects of the Company’s operating performance from period
    to period on a basis that may not be otherwise apparent on a
    GAAP basis. Organic revenue growth and organic growth in
    commissions and fees exclude the impact of acquisitions and
    disposals and year over year movements in foreign exchange from
    growth in revenues and commissions and fees. We believe organic
    revenue growth and organic growth in commissions and fees
    provide a measure that the investment community may find helpful
    in assessing the performance of operations that were part of our
    operations in both the current and prior periods,

and provide a measure against which our businesses may be
    assessed in the future. These financial measures should be
    viewed in addition to, not in lieu of, the Company’s

REDOMICILE

On September 24, 2009, Willis-Ireland was incorporated in
    Ireland to facilitate the redomicile of the Group’s parent
    company from Bermuda to Ireland. Willis-Ireland operated as a
    wholly-owned subsidiary of Willis-Bermuda until the Effective
    Time, when the outstanding common shares of Willis-Bermuda were
    canceled and Willis-Ireland issued ordinary shares, with
    substantially the same rights and preferences, on a one-for-one
    basis to the holders of the Willis-Bermuda common shares that
    were canceled. Upon completion of this transaction,
    Willis-Ireland replaced Willis-Bermuda as the ultimate parent
    company of the Group and Willis-Bermuda became a wholly-owned
    subsidiary of

Willis-Ireland. We do not expect the Redomicile to have a
    material impact on our financial results. We remain subject to
    the SEC reporting requirements, the mandates of the
    Sarbanes-Oxley Act and applicable corporate governance rules of
    the NYSE, and we continue to report our consolidated financial
    results in US dollars and in accordance with US GAAP. We also
    comply with any additional reporting requirements of Irish Law.
    The shares of Willis-Ireland are traded on the NYSE under the
    symbol ‘WSH’, the same symbol under which
    Willis-Bermuda shares traded prior to the Effective Time.

BUSINESS
    OVERVIEW AND MARKET OUTLOOK

We provide a broad range of insurance broking, risk management
    and consulting services to our clients worldwide. Our core
    specialty businesses include Aerospace; Energy; Marine;
    Construction; Financial and Executive Risks; Fine Art, Jewelry
    and Specie; Special Contingency Risks; and Reinsurance. Our
    retail operations provide services to small, medium and major
    corporations and the employee benefits practice, our largest
    product-based practice group, provides health, welfare and human
    resources consulting and brokerage services.

In our capacity as advisor and insurance broker, we act as an
    intermediary between our clients and

insurance carriers by advising our clients on their risk
    management requirements, helping clients determine the best
    means of managing risk, and negotiating and placing insurance
    risk with insurance carriers through our global distribution
    network.

We derive most of our revenues from commissions and fees for
    brokerage and consulting services and do not determine the
    insurance premiums on which our commissions are generally based.
    Fluctuations in these premiums charged by the insurance carriers
    have a direct and potentially material impact on our results of
    operations. Commission levels generally



follow the same trend as premium levels as they are derived from
    a percentage of the premiums paid by the insureds. Due to the
    cyclical nature of the insurance market and the impact of other
    market conditions on insurance premiums, they may vary widely
    between accounting periods. Reductions in premium rates, leading
    to downward pressure on commission revenues (a ‘soft’
    market), can have a potentially material impact on our
    commission revenues and operating margin.

A ‘hard’ market occurs when premium uplifting factors,
    including a greater than anticipated loss experience or capital
    shortages, more than offset any downward pressures on premiums.
    This usually has a favorable impact on our commission revenues
    and operating margin.

From 2000 through 2003 we benefited from a hard market with
    premium rates stable or increasing. During 2004, we saw a rapid
    transition from a hard market to a soft market, with premium
    rates falling in most markets. Rates continued to decline in
    most sectors through 2005 and 2006, with the exception of
    catastrophe-exposed markets. In 2007, the market softened
    further with decreases in many of the market sectors in which we
    operated and this

continued into 2008 with further premium rate declines averaging
    10% across our markets. The soft market had an adverse impact on
    our commission revenues and operating margin from 2005 through
    2008.

In 2009, the stabilization of rates in the reinsurance market
    and some specialty markets was offset by the continuing soft
    market in other sectors and the adverse impact of the weakened
    economic environment across the globe.

Our North America and UK and Irish retail operations have been
    particularly impacted by the weakened economic climate and
    continued soft market with no material improvement in rates
    across most sectors. This has resulted in declines in 2009
    revenues in these operations, particularly amongst our smaller
    clients who are especially vulnerable to the economic downturn.

In 2010, our main priorities will include driving revenue
    growth, continuing to execute our Shaping Our Future initiative,
    creating incremental savings to fund growth, completing the HRH
    integration and leveraging our growth opportunities from our
    expanded footprint.

EXECUTIVE
    SUMMARY

Overview

Despite the difficult trading conditions in 2009, we reported
    2 percent organic growth in commissions and fees in 2009
    compared with 2008. This reflected growth in Global operations,
    in particular in Reinsurance, and many of our International
    businesses partly offset by a fall in organic commissions and
    fees in our North America, UK and Irish retail operations where
    revenues were adversely impacted by the continued soft market
    and weak economic conditions.

Operating margin for full year 2009 was 21 percent compared
    with 18 percent for 2008. The increase over 2008 was
    attributable to organic growth in commissions and fees,
    continuing control of costs and favorable foreign exchange
    movements, offset by increased pension costs and amortization of
    intangible assets.

Results
    from continuing operations: 2009 compared with

Net income from continuing operations in 2009 was
    $436 million, or $2.58 per diluted share, compared with
    $302 million, or $2.04 per diluted share, in 2008. This
    increase included organic growth in commissions and fees, a
    reduction in costs associated with our 2008 expense review from
    $0.45 per diluted share in 2008 to $0.11 per diluted share for
    severance costs, in 2009 and a one-time tax release in 2009
    relating to a change in UK tax law in 2009 equivalent to $0.16
    per diluted share.

Total revenues from continuing operations at $3,263 million
    for 2009 were $436 million, or 15 percent, higher than
    in 2008. Organic revenue growth of 2 percent and a
    19 percent benefit from net acquisitions and disposals in
    2009, driven by the fourth quarter 2008 acquisition of HRH, were
    partly offset by a negative 4 percent impact from foreign
    currency translation and a $31 million decrease in
    investment income compared to 2008.



Organic revenue growth of 2 percent comprised
    5 percent net new business growth (which constitutes the
    revenue growth from business won over the course of the year net
    of the revenue from existing business lost) and a 3 percent
    negative impact from declining premium rates and other market
    factors.

Operating margin at 21 percent was 3 percentage points
    higher than in 2008 with the increase mainly reflecting:

•

2 percent organic growth in commissions and fees;

•

the realization of savings from prior years’ Shaping Our
    Future initiatives and disciplined cost control;

•

a favorable year over year impact from foreign currency
    translation, equivalent to 3 percentage points; and

•

a $10 million gain from the sale of part of our interest in
    Gras Savoye;

partly offset by

•

a $66 million increase in pension costs, mainly driven by
    lower asset levels in our UK pension plan and excluding the
    $12 million US curtailment gain and the impact of the UK
    salary sacrifice scheme;

•

a $31 million reduction in investment income; and

•

a $64 million increase in the amortization of intangible
    assets, including additional charges in respect of intangible
    assets recognized on the HRH acquisition.

Results
    from continuing operations: 2008 compared with

Net income from continuing operations in 2008 was
    $302 million, or $2.04 per diluted share, compared with
    $409 million, or $2.78 per diluted share, in 2007. The
    benefits of good organic revenue growth, improved margins in our
    International and Global operations and a lower effective tax
    rate were more than offset by a $0.45 per diluted share impact
    of charges for the 2008 expense review and a $0.27 per diluted
    share year over year impact from foreign exchange.

HRH’s fourth quarter results, net of related funding costs
    and intangible asset amortization, contributed $0.04 per diluted
    share. New shares issued as part

consideration for the HRH acquisition had an $0.11 dilutive
    impact on full year diluted earnings per share.

Total revenues at $2,827 million were $249 million, or
    10 percent, higher than in 2007. Organic revenue growth of
    4 percent, a 7 percent benefit from net acquisitions
    and disposals primarily reflecting the HRH acquisition and a
    1 percentage point benefit from foreign currency
    translation were partly offset by lower investment and other
    income. Organic revenue growth of 4 percent reflected net
    new business growth of 6 percent and a 2 percent
    negative impact from declining rates and other market factors.

Operating margin at 18 percent in 2008 was
    6 percentage points lower than in 2007 with the decrease
    mainly reflecting:

•

the $92 million charge for the 2008 expense review,
    equivalent to 4 percentage points;

•

an adverse year over year impact from foreign currency
    translation, equivalent to approximately 2 percentage
    points; and

•

a $22 million increase in intangible asset amortization, of
    which $21 million related to HRH;

partly offset by

•

increased productivity, with revenues per full time equivalent
    (‘FTE’) employee increasing to $190,000 in 2008
    compared with $186,000 in 2007;

•

HRH’s $38 million operating income in fourth quarter
    2008, equivalent to 1 percentage point; and

•

good cost control, the realization of savings from 2007’s
    Shaping Our Future initiatives and lower pension costs.

Discontinued
    operations

Income from discontinued operations relates to the disposals of
    our Bliss & Glennon and Managing Agency Group US-based
    wholesale insurance operations in the second and third quarters
    of 2009, respectively. There were no net gains or losses
    recognized on these disposals. These disposals were made as part
    of our plan to dispose of non-core HRH activities.



HRH
    acquisition and integration

On October 1, 2008, we completed the acquisition of HRH, at
    the time the eighth largest insurance and risk management
    intermediary in the United States.

We remain confident that the acquisition of HRH:

•

substantially improves our position in key markets such as New
    York, Atlanta, California, Texas, Chicago, Boston, and Florida;

•

greatly strengthens our position as a middle market broker and
    adds critical mass in the large account, Employee Benefits,
    small commercial and private client areas; and

•

enables our North America operation to deliver enhanced value to
    clients through a more robust and diversified platform.

The integration of HRH with the existing Willis North America
    business was a key priority throughout 2009 and the process is
    now substantially complete. We believe that the goals we set for
    the integration are being successfully met, as we have:

•

maintained high producer and client retention levels;

•

reduced our expense base through synergies and other cost
    savings. On a combined basis, we achieved approximately
    $205 million of cost savings in 2009; and

•

for over 90 percent of HRH’s contingent commissions we
    have either converted them into higher standard commissions or
    we have reaffirmed with carriers that the existing agreements
    will remain in force for so long as permitted by the regulatory
    authorities or until the commissions are converted, whichever
    occurs first.

We recognized goodwill and other intangible assets on the HRH
    acquisition of approximately $1.6 billion and
    $0.6 billion, respectively.

Gras
    Savoye

In December 2009, we completed a leveraged transaction with the
    original family shareholders of Gras Savoye and Astorg Partners,
    a private equity fund, to reorganize the capital of Gras Savoye.
    As a result of this transaction:

•

we received cash proceeds, less costs, of $155 million
    which we used to pay down debt;

•

we have one-third of the voting rights;

•

we reduced our ownership interest from 49 percent to
    31 percent;

•

we recognized a gain of $10 million on disposal;

•

the previous put option exercisable by the Gras Savoye
    shareholders until 2011 has been eliminated; and

•

we have a new call option to acquire a 100 percent interest
    in Gras Savoye in 2015.

We believe that the revised structure enhances our financial
    flexibility, while at the same time retaining Gras Savoye as a
    key strategic partner.

As a consequence of the reduction in our ownership interest we
    expect earnings from our associates to be approximately
    $10 million lower in 2010 compared with 2009.

    Expense Review, Shaping Our Future and Right Sizing
    Willis

Our Shaping Our Future strategy is a series of initiatives
    designed to deliver profitable growth. As part of this we have
    invested in key hires and initiatives in 2008 and 2009 and we
    have funded these initiatives from a thorough review in 2008 of
    all businesses to identify additional opportunities to
    rationalize our expense base.

Additionally, in the latter part of 2008 and in light of the
    global economic uncertainty, we launched Right Sizing Willis to
    reinforce our cost saving initiatives. Right Sizing Willis
    initiatives include talent management to either improve or
    manage out poor performers, location optimization and aggressive
    reduction of discretionary spending.

In 2009 we incurred pre-tax severance costs of $24 million
    relating to approximately 450 positions which have been
    eliminated ($17 million net of tax), equivalent to $0.11
    per diluted share, in connection with our Right Sizing Willis
    initiatives.

In 2008, we incurred a pre-tax charge of $92 million
    ($66 million net of tax, equivalent to $0.45 per diluted
    share) comprising:

•

$42 million to buy out remuneration packages that no longer
    align with the Group’s overall remuneration strategy;

•

$24 million of severance costs relating to approximately
    350 positions which have been eliminated; and



•

$26 million of other operating expenses, including property
    and systems rationalization costs.

In light of the current global economic uncertainty, we continue
    to vigorously manage our cost base in order to fund further
    growth initiatives. Our current funding for growth initiatives
    emphasize cost discipline including talent management, location
    optimization and robust management of discretionary spending.

In 2009, we realized approximately $100 million of gross
    benefits from previous initiatives, including:

•

approximately $30 million from global placement, which
    reflects increased commissions from working closely with our
    carrier partners;

•

approximately $20 million from client profitability, which
    aims to achieve increased remuneration from our clients in
    return for the value we deliver; and

•

approximately $15 million from a program of initiatives
    within Reinsurance focused on enhancing our client offering,
    including implementation of a global sales model, improving
    service delivery, developing further cutting edge analytical
    capabilities and hiring of additional production and specialist
    product resources.

Cash
    and financing

Cash at December 31, 2009 was $191 million,
    $15 million higher than at December 31, 2008.

In March 2009, we issued 12.875% senior notes due 2016 in
    an aggregate principal amount of $500 million to Goldman
    Sachs Mezzanine Partners which generated net proceeds of
    $482 million. These proceeds, together with
    $208 million of cash generated from operating activities
    and cash in hand, were used to pay down the $750 million
    outstanding on our interim credit facility as of
    December 31, 2008.

In September 2009, we issued $300 million of 7% senior
    notes due 2019. We then launched a tender offer on
    September 22, 2009 to repurchase any and all of our
    $250 million 5.125% senior notes

due July 2010 at a premium of $27.50 per $1,000 face value.
    Notes totaling $160 million were tendered and repurchased
    on September 29, 2009.

Total debt, total equity and the capitalization ratio at
    December 31, 2009 were as follows:

Liquidity

Our principal sources of liquidity are cash from operations,
    cash and cash equivalents of $191 million at
    December 31, 2009 and $300 million remaining
    availability under our revolving credit facility.

Based on current market conditions and information available to
    us at this time, we believe that we have sufficient liquidity to
    meet our cash needs for at least the next 12 months.

Share
    buybacks

The Board has authorized a share buyback program for
    $1 billion, of which $925 million remains available.

In 2008, we repurchased 2.3 million shares at a cost of
    $75 million. We did not make any repurchases in 2009.

We currently target a debt to adjusted EBITDA (earnings before
    interest, tax, depreciation and amortization) ratio of below 2.5
    times. Once we are in a position to remain at or below this
    ratio, we would consider recommencing our stock buy back
    program. At December 31, 2009 the actual ratio was 2.6
    times. However, there can be no assurance that we will achieve
    our target debt to EBITDA ratio or recommence our stock buyback
    program.

Revenues for 2009 at $3,263 million were $436 million,
    or 15 percent higher than in 2008, reflecting a
    19 percent benefit from net acquisitions and disposals,
    principally attributable to HRH, and organic growth in
    commissions and fees of 2 percent, offset by a
    4 percent adverse year over year impact from foreign
    currency translation and lower investment income.

Our International and Global operations earn a significant
    portion of their revenues in currencies other than the US
    dollar. For the year ended December 31, 2009, reported
    revenues were adversely impacted by the year over year effect of
    foreign currency translation: in particular due to the
    strengthening of the US dollar against the pound sterling
    and against the euro, compared with 2008.

Investment income was $50 million for 2009,
    $31 million lower than 2008, with the decrease reflecting
    significantly lower average interest rates

in 2009. The impact of rate decreases on our investment income
    was partially mitigated by our forward hedging program. In 2009
    this generated additional income of $27 million compared
    with LIBOR based rates. We expect to see a lower benefit from
    our forward hedging program in 2010.

Organic growth in commissions and fees was 2 percent for
    2009, despite a negative 3 percent impact from declining
    premium rates and other market factors. Overall organic growth
    comprises good growth in our Global operations and many of our
    International operations, partly offset by declines in our North
    America, UK and Irish retail operations reflecting the weak
    economic environments and continuing soft market conditions in
    these territories. Organic revenue growth by segment is
    discussed further in ‘Operating Results — Segment

Our 2008 total revenues at $2,827 million were
    $249 million, or 10 percent, higher than in 2007,
    reflecting a 7 percent benefit from net acquisitions and
    disposals, principally attributable to HRH, organic commissions
    and fee growth of 4 percent and a 1 percent benefit
    from foreign currency translation, partly offset by lower
    investment and other income.

For the year ended December 31, 2008, reported revenues in
    International benefited from the year over year weakening of the
    US dollar against the euro, compared with 2007. However, in our
    Global operations the revenue line benefit of the stronger euro
    was offset by sterling weakening against the US dollar, compared
    with 2007.

Investment income was $81 million for 2008,
    $15 million lower than in 2007, with the decrease
    reflecting lower average interest rates in 2008.

Other income was $2 million for 2008, $17 million
    lower than in 2007 which benefited from a higher than usual
    level of proceeds from the sale of books of business.

Organic growth in commissions and fees in 2008 was
    4 percent compared with 2007, reflecting:

•

net new business growth of 6 percent which comprised good
    growth in our International and Global Specialties businesses
    offset by lower revenues in North America and Reinsurance;

partly offset by

•

a negative 2 percent impact from premium rates and other
    market factors in 2008. The impact of significant rate decreases
    in both periods was tempered by the benefit of other market
    factors, including higher commission rates, client profitability
    analyses, higher insured values and changes in limits or
    exposures.

General and administrative expenses at $2,422 million for
    2009 were $181 million, or 8 percent, higher than
    2008. The increase was mainly attributable to:

•

$414 million impact from HRH, equivalent to approximately
    18 percentage points; and

•

a $66 million increase in pension costs, equivalent to
    approximately 3 percentage points. This excludes the
    $12 million US curtailment gain and $8 million due to
    the introduction of a salary sacrifice scheme in the UK. The
    increase attributable to the salary sacrifice scheme was
    marginally more than offset by a reduction in salaries and
    payroll taxes;

partly offset by

•

a year over year benefit from foreign currency translation of
    $172 million, equivalent to approximately 8 percentage
    points. This includes the impact of losses on forward contracts
    being more than offset by gains relating to the significant year
    over year strengthening of the US dollar against the pound
    sterling (in which our London market based operations incur the
    majority of their expenses), and the euro, together with the
    benefit of lower foreign exchange losses relating to the UK
    sterling pension asset;

•

the $92 million reduction in costs associated with our 2008
    expense review, equivalent to 4 percentage points, of which
    $66 million related to salaries and benefits and
    $26 million to other expenses; and

•

disciplined control of all discretionary costs, with significant
    savings in travel and entertaining, advertising, printing and a
    number of other areas.

Salaries
    and benefits

Salaries and benefits were 56 percent of revenues for 2009,
    compared with 58 percent in 2008 reflecting the benefits of:

•

good cost controls, including our previous Shaping Our Future
    and 2008 expense review initiatives, together with the initial
    benefits from our Right Sizing Willis initiatives in
    2009; and

•

a $12 million curtailment gain realized on the closure of
    our US defined benefit pension plan to accrual of benefit for
    future service, equivalent to approximately 0.5 percentage
    points (see below);

partly offset by

•

a $66 million increase in pension costs, mainly driven by
    lower asset levels in our UK pension plan and excluding the
    $12 million US curtailment gain and the impact of the UK
    salary sacrifice scheme.

Effective May 15, 2009, we closed our US defined benefit
    pension plan to future accrual and recognized a curtailment gain
    of $12 million in second quarter 2009. As a result the full
    year 2009 charge for the US plan was $7 million compared
    with an expected $39 million charge had the plan not been
    closed to future accrual.

We have also suspended the company match for our US 401(k) plan
    which benefited 2009 by $9 million compared with 2008.

UK
    salary sacrifice scheme

With effect from April 2009, the Company offered UK employees an
    alternative basis on which to fund contributions into the UK
    pension plans. UK employees can now agree to sacrifice an amount
    of their salary and in return the Company makes additional
    pension contributions on their behalf, equivalent to the value
    of the salary sacrificed.



From a payroll tax perspective, this is a more efficient method
    of making pension contributions.

As a result of this change, the Company made additional pension
    contributions of $8 million, with a marginally higher
    saving in salaries and payroll taxes.

Other
    expenses

Other expenses were 18 percent of revenues for 2009
    compared with 21 percent in 2008, reflecting the benefit of:

•

the non-recurrence of $26 million of costs eliminated by
    the 2008 expense review, equivalent to 5 percentage
    points; and

•

a reduction in discretionary expenses driven by our Right Sizing
    Willis initiatives;

partly offset by

•

foreign currency translation losses of $40 million arising
    on forward contracts maturing in 2009, compared with losses on
    the equivalent contracts in 2008 of $12 million.

    compared with 2007

General and administrative expenses at $2,241 million for
    2008 were $333 million, or 18 percent, higher than in
    2007 of which:

•

$135 million, or 7 percentage points, was attributable
    to the fourth quarter acquisition of HRH;

•

$92 million, or 5 percentage points, was attributable
    to the charge for the 2008 expense review, of which
    $66 million related to salaries and benefits and
    $26 million to other expenses; and

•

a foreign exchange loss of $68 million, or
    4 percentage points, including $34 million related to
    the revaluation of our UK pension benefits asset together with
    $23 million relating to sterling purchases to fund the
    Company’s contributions to the plan.

Salaries
    and benefits

Salaries and benefits were 58 percent of 2008 revenues,
    compared with 56 percent in 2007, with the increase
    reflecting:

•

the $66 million charge relating to the 2008 expense
    review; and

•

continued hiring in targeted development areas including
    selected US regions; targeted International growth areas such as
    Spain, Italy, Denmark and Brazil; and a number of our London
    specialty businesses;

partly offset by

•

increased productivity: average revenues per FTE employee were
    approximately $190,000 in 2008 compared with $186,000 in 2007;

•

the benefits of cost controls and previous Shaping Our Future
    initiatives; and

•

a $15 million reduction in pension charges. This decrease
    was mainly attributable to an increase in the expected return on
    assets in the UK pension plan reflecting higher opening asset
    levels due to the significant additional contributions we have
    made.

Other
    expenses

Other expenses were 21 percent of revenues in 2008 compared
    with 18 percent in 2007, with the increase reflecting:

•

$33 million additional other expenses in fourth quarter
    2008 as a result of the HRH acquisition, equivalent to
    approximately 1 percentage point;

•

the $26 million charge relating to the 2008 expense review,
    equivalent to approximately 1 percentage point; and

•

a $34 million foreign exchange loss related to the
    revaluation of our UK pension benefits asset. This asset is a
    sterling denominated asset but a portion of the asset is held
    within our UK London market operations, which are US dollar
    denominated for accounting purposes. As the US dollar
    strengthened significantly against sterling in 2008, the
    revaluation of the sterling pension benefit asset gave rise to a
    foreign exchange loss.

We have a program that hedges our sterling cash outflows from
    our London market operations, a part of which hedges the
    sterling denominated cash contributions into the UK pension
    plan. However, we do not hedge against the pension benefits
    asset or liability recognized for accounting purposes.

The effects of the above increases were partly mitigated by the
    benefits of our continued focus on cost controls.



Amortization
    of intangible assets

Amortization of intangible assets of $100 million in 2009
    was $64 million higher than in 2008.

The significant year over year increase was primarily
    attributable to additional charges of $58 million in 2009
    in respect of intangible assets recognized on the HRH
    acquisition, including $7 million of accelerated
    amortization relating to the HRH brand name. Following the
    success of our integration of HRH into our previously existing
    North America operations, we announced on October 1, 2009
    that we were changing the name of

our North America operations from Willis HRH to Willis North
    America. Consequently the intangible asset recognized on the
    acquisition of HRH relating to the HRH brand name has been fully
    amortized.

Amortization of intangible assets of $36 million in 2008
    was $22 million higher than in 2007 with the increase
    primarily attributable to a $21 million charge in fourth
    quarter 2008 in respect of intangible assets recognized on the
    HRH acquisition.

    compared with 2008

Operating margin was 21 percent for 2009 compared with

•

a reduction in costs associated with our 2008 expense review
    from $92 million in 2008 to $24 million for severance
    costs in 2009;

•

2 percent organic growth in fees and commissions;

•

the $12 million US pension curtailment gain recognized in
    second quarter 2009; and

•

a further improvement in productivity, with revenues per FTE
    employee increasing to $191,000 in 2009 compared with $190,000
    in 2008;

partly offset by

•

a $66 million increase in pension costs, excluding the
    $12 million US curtailment gain and the $8 million
    impact of the UK salary sacrifice scheme discussed above;

•

a $64 million increase in amortization of intangible
    assets, principally attributable to HRH; and

•

the $31 million year over year decline in investment income.

    compared with 2007

Operating margin was 18 percent in 2008 compared with
    24 percent in 2007. This decrease reflected the impact of:

•

the $92 million charge for the 2008 expense review,
    equivalent to 4 percentage points;

•

a negative 2 percentage point impact from foreign exchange
    movements;

•

a $22 million increase in intangible asset amortization, of
    which $21 million related to HRH;

•

our continued investments in targeted new hires and Shaping Our
    Future initiatives; and

•

lower investment and other income;

partly offset by

•

increased productivity, with revenues per FTE employee
    increasing to $190,000 in 2008 compared with $186,000 in 2007;

•

a $38 million benefit from the operating income
    contribution of HRH in the fourth quarter; and

•

good cost control, the realization of savings from Shaping Our
    Future initiatives and lower pension costs.

Interest expense

$


$

Interest expense in 2009 of $174 million was
    $69 million higher than in 2008. This increase primarily
    reflects higher average debt levels following the HRH
    acquisition, but also includes $5 million of premium and
    costs relating to the early repurchase in September 2009 of
    $160 million of our 5.125% senior notes due July 2010
    at a premium of $27.50 per $1,000 face value.

We are currently reviewing opportunities to reduce future
    interest costs, in the short-term, through a
    fixed / floating interest rate swap.

Interest expense in 2008 of $105 million was
    $39 million higher than in 2007. This increase primarily
    reflects higher average debt levels, and in particular:
    $18 million additional interest expense relating to the
    term loan and interim credit facilities connected with the HRH
    acquisition; a $9 million charge for amortization of debt
    fees associated with these facilities; and a $9 million
    additional interest expense in 2008 due to fixed term
    $600 million senior notes issued in March 2007.

%


%

    compared with 2008

The effective tax rate in 2009 was 18 percent compared with
    24 percent in 2008. The decrease in rate reflects:

•

a $27 million release relating to a 2009 change in tax law.
    As at June 30, 2009 we held a provision of $27 million
    relating to tax that would potentially be payable should the
    unremitted earnings of our foreign subsidiaries be repatriated.
    Following a change in UK tax law effective in third quarter
    2009, these earnings may now be repatriated without additional
    tax cost and, consequently, the provision has been
    released; and

•

an $11 million release relating to uncertain tax positions
    due to the closure of the statute of limitations on assessments
    for previously unrecognized tax benefits. There was a similar
    $5 million release of uncertain tax positions in 2008.

Excluding the benefit of these tax credits, the effective tax
    rate for 2009 would be 26 percent.

    compared with 2007

The effective tax rate in 2008 was 24 percent compared with
    26 percent in 2007, with the decrease in rate reflecting:

•

a change in the geographical mix of profits with a greater
    proportion of profits being earned outside the United States;

•

non-taxable exchange gains arising from the significant movement
    in the exchange rate between the US dollar and sterling; and

•

a decrease in the statutory rate of corporation tax in the UK
    from 30 percent in 2007 to an effective rate of
    28.5 percent in 2008;

partly offset by

•

the benefit of a $10 million release of uncertain tax
    provisions in 2007 compared to a $5 million release in
    2008. Both 2008 and 2007 benefited from the release of tax
    provisions relating to prior tax periods following the
    resolution of tax issues surrounding prior debt
    refinancing; and

•

a one-off benefit of $4 million in 2007 relating to the
    restatement of the closing UK deferred tax liabilities to
    reflect the reduced rate of corporation tax applicable on the
    reversal of those liabilities.



Interest
    in earnings of associates

Interest in earnings of associates, net of tax, was
    $33 million in 2009, $11 million higher than in 2008.
    These increases reflect improved performance and an increased
    ownership share in Gras Savoye, our largest associate, for most
    of the year. As described within the ‘Executive
    Summary’ section above, our interest in Gras Savoye reduced
    from

49 percent to 31 percent following the reorganization
    of that company’s capital in December 2009. As a result of
    this transaction we currently estimate that the interest in
    earnings of associates will be approximately $10 million
    lower in 2010 compared with 2009.

    $134 million increase primarily reflected the
    $191 million increase in operating income, discussed above,
    partly offset by the $69 million increase in interest
    expense.

Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for 2009
    increased to $2.58 compared to $2.04 in 2008 as the benefit of
    the increased net income was partly offset by a 21 million
    increase in average diluted shares outstanding due primarily to
    the shares issued on October 1, 2008 for the HRH
    acquisition. The additional shares issued had a negative $0.36
    impact on earnings per diluted share in 2009.

Foreign currency translation had a year over year $0.27 positive
    impact on earnings per diluted share in 2009.

    compared with 2007

Net income for 2008 was $302 million, or $2.04 per diluted
    share, compared to $409 million, or $2.78 per diluted
    share, in 2007 with the decrease mainly reflecting the impact of:

•

the $66 million post-tax charges associated with the 2008
    expense review, equivalent to $0.45 per diluted share; and

•

a year over year accounting loss of $0.27 per diluted share
    primarily relating to the retranslation of our sterling
    denominated UK pension benefits asset;

partly offset by

•

strong organic revenue growth in 2008;

•

a year over year benefit from a lower effective tax rate of
    $0.09 per diluted share; and

•

HRH’s fourth quarter results, net of related funding costs
    and intangible amortization, contributed $0.04 per diluted share.

In 2008, the Company changed its
    basis of segmental allocation for central costs. All accounting
    adjustments for foreign exchange hedging activities and foreign
    exchange movements on the UK pension plan asset or liability are
    held at the Corporate level, together



Revenues:
    2009 compared with 2008

Commissions and fees of $822 million were $38 million,
    or 5 percent, higher in 2009 compared with 2008 of which
    4 percent was attributable to the acquisition of the HRH UK
    wholesale business, Glencairn and 4 percent to organic
    revenue growth. These were partly offset by a 3 percent
    negative impact from foreign exchange movements.

Net new business growth was 5 percent and there was a
    1 percent adverse impact from rates and other market
    factors. Reinsurance led the growth in net new business. Global
    Specialties organic revenues were slightly higher than in 2008,
    as growth in Marine, Aerospace and Financial and Executive Risks
    was offset by reductions elsewhere. There was continued softness
    in most specialty rates although there were signs of
    stabilization and firming in some areas, including Aerospace and
    Energy. The Faber & Dumas businesses continue to be
    adversely impacted by the weakening economic environment.

There was a sharp decline in investment income in 2009 compared
    with 2008 as global interest rates fell markedly in the latter
    half of 2008 and early 2009.

Productivity continued to improve with a 3 percent rise in
    revenues per FTE employee to $358,000 in 2009 compared with
    2008. Client retention remained steady at 90 percent for
    the full year 2009.

Revenues:
    2008 compared with 2007

Commissions and fees were $34 million, or 5 percent,
    higher in 2008 compared with 2007 of which 3 percent was
    attributable to the net impact of acquisitions and disposals,
    mainly due to HRH’s UK-based specialty business. There was
    no net impact from foreign currency translation as a benefit
    from the euro strengthening year over year against the dollar
    was offset by a negative impact from sterling weakening against
    the dollar.

Organic revenue growth was 2 percent as the benefit of good
    growth in Global Specialties was partly offset by lower
    commissions and fees in Reinsurance.

Global Specialties organic revenue growth reflected the benefit
    of good growth in Marine, Financial Institutions, Bloodstock,
    Jewelry, Specie and Global Markets and was achieved despite
    significant rate reductions.

Organic revenue growth in Reinsurance in 2008 was adversely
    impacted by a combination of declining rates and a reduction in
    amounts reinsured. We continue to make investments in
    Reinsurance to strengthen capital markets and analytics
    capabilities throughout the soft market and are beginning to see
    the positive results of this investment as we moved into 2009.

Client retention levels in Global improved to approximately
    90 percent in 2008 compared with approximately
    89 percent in 2007.

Operating
    margin: 2009 compared with 2008

Operating margin was 31 percent in 2009 compared with
    29 percent in 2008. This improvement reflected a
    significant benefit from foreign currency translation, together
    with organic revenue growth, particularly driven by our
    Reinsurance business, and good cost controls including a
    reduction in discretionary expenses. The benefit of these was
    partly offset by a significant increase in the UK pension
    expense and the sharp reduction in investment income.

Despite an overall reduction in headcount since
    December 31, 2008, we continue to recruit selectively for
    our Global businesses. In first quarter 2009, we recruited a
    reinsurance team from Carvill. This team provides specialty,
    casualty and professional liability experience. We have also
    recruited specialty expertise in Marine, Aerospace and
    Faber & Dumas.



Operating
    margin: 2008 compared with 2007

Operating margin in our Global operations was 29 percent in
    2008 compared with 28 percent in 2007, as the benefit of
    organic revenue growth in Global Specialties was partly offset
    by the impact of lower revenues in Reinsurance and an adverse
    impact from foreign exchange.

Operating margin in Global Specialties increased in 2008
    compared with 2007 as the benefit from organic revenue growth,
    lower pension costs and our Shaping Our Future initiatives more
    than offset

further spend on targeted hires and strategic initiatives.

Operating margin in Reinsurance in 2008 was broadly in line with
    2007 as the impact of lower commissions and fees was largely
    offset by the benefits of Shaping Our Future initiatives, lower
    pension costs and the positive results of our continued
    investments to strengthen capital markets and analytics
    capabilities throughout the soft market.

Revenues:
    2009 compared with 2008

Commissions and fees in North America were 51 percent
    higher in 2009 compared with 2008 reflecting the uplift from the
    additional revenues of HRH, partly offset by 3 percent
    negative organic growth. Our North America operations were
    significantly adversely impacted by soft market conditions, the
    weakened US economy and a reduction in project based revenues
    which more than offset a positive impact from net new business.
    In particular, our Construction division has seen significant
    declines. However, we saw the rate of decline moderate in the
    third quarter of 2009 and North America reported 1 percent
    organic growth

for the fourth quarter of 2009, despite a 6 percent rate
    headwind.

Our primary focus in North America in 2009 was the integration
    of HRH into our existing operations and the improvement of
    margin. Additionally, in the second half of the year we
    refocused our efforts on revenue growth and we believe this has
    led to over 10 percent new business generation in parts of
    the business during that time period.

Despite the difficult market conditions, our productivity
    measured in terms of revenue per FTE employee remained high and
    with a marginal increase to $226,000 for 2009 compared with
    $225,000 for 2008.



Revenues:
    2008 compared with 2007

Commissions and fees in North America were $154 million, or
    21 percent, higher in 2008 compared with 2007, of which
    $174 million was attributable to HRH’s fourth quarter
    2008 revenues. Excluding HRH, organic commissions and fees
    declined by 1 percent reflecting the soft market conditions.

Chicago, Atlanta, Houston, Boston and Knoxville all generated
    growth in excess of 5 percent, though several offices
    recorded significant declines in the difficult market conditions.

The integration of the HRH acquisition made good progress in
    fourth quarter 2008 with only 2 percent attrition of legacy
    HRH producers since the announcement of the HRH acquisition in
    June 2008.

Client retention levels improved to approximately
    91 percent in 2008, an increase of approximately
    3 percentage points from 2007, and productivity continued
    to improve with an approximately 2 percent rise in revenues
    per FTE employee in 2008 compared with 2007.

Operating
    margin: 2009 compared with 2008

Operating margin in North America was 24 percent in 2009
    compared with 15 percent in 2008. The higher margin
    reflected:

•

the acquisition of HRH and the synergies and cost savings
    achieved from the integration of HRH with our existing North
    America operations;

•

a reduction in underlying expense base reflecting the benefits
    of our 2008 Expense Review and Right Sizing Willis
    initiatives; and

•

a $9 million benefit from the curtailment of the US pension
    scheme relating to our North America retail employees;

partly offset by

•

the decline in organic revenues against the backdrop of the soft
    market and weak economic conditions discussed above.

HRH
    integration

The integration of HRH into our existing operations is now
    substantially complete and, reflecting this success, we changed
    the name of our North America retail operations from Willis HRH
    to Willis North America on October 1, 2009. Progress to
    date includes:

•

maintaining high producer and client retention levels;

•

reducing our expense base through synergies and other cost
    savings. On a combined basis, we achieved approximately
    $205 million of cost savings in 2009; and

•

as of December 31, 2009, for over 90 percent of
    HRH’s contingent commissions we have either converted them
    into higher standard commissions or we have reaffirmed with
    carriers that the existing agreements will remain in force for
    so long as permitted by the regulatory authorities or until the
    commissions are converted, whichever occurs first.

Operating
    margin: 2008 compared with 2007

Operating margin in North America in 2008 was 15 percent
    compared with 19 percent in 2007. The decrease of
    4 percentage points reflected:

•

lower commissions and fees, reflecting the soft market
    conditions;

•

a $15 million decrease in other income compared with 2007
    which benefited from higher than usual proceeds from the sale of
    books of business; and

•

continued spend on targeted new hires and other initiatives;

partly offset by

•

the acquisition of HRH which contributed $37 million of
    operating income in fourth quarter 2008; and

•

the benefit of increased revenue per FTE employee and other cost
    savings.

Revenues:

Commissions and fees in International were $35 million, or
    3 percent, lower in 2009 compared with 2008 as double digit
    new business generation in many of our International units was
    more than offset by an adverse impact from foreign exchange of
    8 percent, a 3 percent adverse impact from rates and
    other market factors, and significantly lower revenues in our UK
    and Irish retail operations.

A significant part of International’s revenues are earned
    in currencies other than the US dollar which has strengthened
    significantly, on average, on a year over year basis against a
    number of these currencies, most notably the euro, pound
    sterling, Danish kroner and Australian dollar, consequently
    reducing International revenues on a year over year basis when
    reported in US dollars.

Despite the slowdown of the global economy, International
    continued its organic growth. Excluding our UK and Irish retail
    divisions, organic revenue growth was 8 percent in 2009,
    with Latin America and Asia, led by Brazil, Columbia and China,
    all reporting strong organic growth. However, our UK and Irish
    retail division, which

represents approximately 20 percent of International’s
    operations, saw a 6 percent revenue decline, reflecting
    weak local economic conditions.

Productivity in International continues to improve with revenues
    per FTE employee increasing by 4 percent in 2009 compared
    with 2008.

Client retention levels remained high at approximately
    90 percent for 2009.

Revenues:
    2008 compared with 2007

Commissions and fees in International were $93 million, or
    10 percent, higher in 2008 compared with 2007.

Foreign currency translation benefited 2008 revenues by
    1 percent compared with 2007.

Organic revenue growth of 9 percent in 2008 was achieved
    despite declining rates in most countries.

We have seen consistent growth in our International business
    over the last three years, with all twelve quarters in this
    period showing growth of 5 percent or higher, with Spain,
    Denmark and Latin America continuing to contribute significantly.



Productivity in International continued to improve with revenues
    per FTE employee rising by 6 percent in 2008 compared with
    2007 and average client retention levels remaining high at
    approximately 91 percent.

Operating
    margin: 2009 compared with 2008

Operating margin in International was 26 percent in 2009
    compared with 28 percent in 2008. The benefits of:

•

the strong organic revenue growth outside of Ireland; and

•

focused expense management including savings in discretionary
    costs driven by our Right Sizing Willis initiatives;

were more than offset by

•

increased pension expense for the UK pension plan;

•

a sharp reduction in investment income reflecting lower global
    interest rates; and

•

a weak performance by our Irish retail operations reflecting
    their difficult market conditions.

Operating
    margin: 2008 compared with 2007

Operating margin in International was 28 percent in 2008
    compared with 25 percent in 2007, with the
    3 percentage point improvement reflecting the strong
    organic revenue growth, increased productivity and continued
    expense discipline partly offset by significant investment in
    targeted hires and the adverse impact of declining rates in most
    countries.

Venezuela

On January 8, 2010 the Venezuelan government announced its
    intention to devalue its currency (Bolivar). Effective
    January 1, 2010, the Venezuelan economy has been designated
    as hyper-inflationary and, consequently, all future exchange
    movements will flow through the income statement.

Our preliminary estimate of the impact of these changes on our
    2010 income statement is that diluted earnings per share for the
    Group may be approximately $0.03 lower than it would otherwise
    have been.

Currently, we do not anticipate any material impact on our
    balance sheet from the devaluation.

CRITICAL
    ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES

Our accounting policies are described in Note 2 to the
    Consolidated Financial Statements. Management considers that the
    following accounting estimates or assumptions are the most
    important to the presentation of our financial condition or
    operating performance. Management has discussed its critical
    accounting estimates and associated disclosures with our Audit
    Committee.

Pension
    expense

We maintain defined benefit pension plans for employees in the
    US and UK. Both these plans are now closed to new entrants and,
    with effect from May 15, 2009 we closed our US defined
    benefit plan to future accrual. New entrants in the UK are
    offered the opportunity to join a defined contribution plan and
    in the United States are offered the opportunity to join a
    401(k) plan. We also have smaller defined benefit schemes in
    Ireland, Germany, Norway and the Netherlands. These schemes have
    combined total assets of $120 million and a combined net
    liability for pension benefits of $30 million as of
    December 31,

2009. Elsewhere, pension benefits are typically provided through
    defined contribution plans.

We make a number of assumptions when determining our pension
    liabilities and pension expense which are reviewed annually by
    senior management and changed where appropriate. The discount
    rate will be changed annually if underlying rates have moved
    whereas the expected long-term return on assets will be changed
    less frequently as longer term trends in asset returns emerge.
    Other material assumptions include rates of participant
    mortality, the expected long-term rate of compensation and
    pension increases and rates of employee termination.

We recorded a net pension charge on our UK and US defined
    benefit pension plans in 2009 of $32 million, compared to a
    net pension credit of $25 million in 2008, an increased
    expense of $57 million.



The UK plan charge was $63 million higher reflecting:

•

lower asset returns from lower asset levels following the
    decline in the equity markets;

•

additional pension contributions of $8 million in
    connection with the pension related salary sacrifice
    scheme; and

•

higher amortization from significant asset losses,

partly offset by

•

changes to the plan that cap the impact of future salary rises
    on pension benefits.

The US pension charge was $6 million lower in 2009 compared
    with 2008 reflecting the closure of the scheme and the resulting
    $12 million curtailment gain.

Based on December 31, 2009 assumptions, we expect the net
    pension charge in 2010 to increase by $2 million for the UK
    plan and decrease by $6 million for the US plan.

During the latter half of 2008 the value of assets held by our
    pension plans was significantly adversely affected by the
    turmoil in worldwide markets. The holdings of equity securities
    by our UK and US pension plans were particularly affected in
    2008, but have recovered, to some extent, in 2009.

Rates used to discount pension plan liabilities at
    December 31, 2009 were based on yields prevailing at that
    date of high quality corporate bonds of appropriate maturity.
    The selected rate used to discount UK plan liabilities was
    5.8 percent compared with 6.5 percent at
    December 31, 2008

with the decrease reflecting a reduction in UK long-term bond
    rates in the second half of 2009. The lower discount rate and
    reduced inflation assumption generated an actuarial gain of
    $208 million at December 31, 2009.

Mortality assumptions at December 31, 2009 were unchanged
    from December 31, 2008. The mortality assumption is the
    100 percent PNA00 table without an age adjustment. As
    an indication of the longevity assumed, our calculations assume
    that a UK male retiree aged 65 at December 31, 2009 would
    have a life expectancy of 22 years.

The expected long-term rate of return used for determining the

    consistent with 2008. The rate used to discount US plan
    liabilities at December 31, 2009 was 6.1 percent,
    determined based on expected plan cash flows discounted using

a corporate bond yield curve, a small reduction from
    6.3 percent at December 31, 2008. The expected and

The mortality assumption at December 31, 2009 is the
    RP-2000 Mortality Table (blended for annuitants and
    non-annuitants), projected to 2010 by Scale AA
    (December 31, 2008: projected to 2009 by Scale

AA). As an indication of the longevity assumed, our calculations
    assume that a US male retiree aged 65 at December 31, 2009,
    would have a life expectancy of 18 years.

Intangible
    assets

Intangible assets represent the excess of cost over the value of
    net tangible assets of businesses acquired. We classify our
    intangible assets into three categories:

•

Goodwill;

•

‘Customer and Marketing Related’ includes client
    lists, client relationships, trade names and non-compete
    agreements; and

•

‘Contract-based, Technology and Other’ includes all
    other purchased intangible assets.

Client relationships acquired on the HRH acquisition are
    amortized over twenty years in line with the pattern in which
    the economic benefits of the client relationships are expected
    to be consumed. Over 80 percent of the client relationships
    intangible will have been amortized after 10 years.
    Non-compete agreements acquired in connection with the HRH
    acquisition are amortized

over two years on a straight line basis. Intangible assets
    acquired in connection with other acquisitions are amortized
    over their estimated useful lives on a straight line basis.
    Goodwill is not subject to amortization.

To determine the allocation of intangible assets between
    goodwill and other intangible assets and the estimated useful
    lives in respect of the HRH acquisition we considered a report
    produced by a qualified independent appraiser. The calculation
    of the allocation is subject to a number of estimates and
    assumptions. We base our allocation on assumptions we believe to
    be reasonable. However, changes in these estimates and
    assumptions could affect the allocation between goodwill and
    other intangible assets.

Impairment
    review

We review all our intangible assets for impairment periodically
    (at least annually) or whenever events or circumstances indicate
    impairment may have



occurred. Application of the impairment test requires judgment,
    including:

•

the identification of reporting units;

•

assignment of assets, liabilities and goodwill to reporting
    units; and

•

determination of fair value of each reporting unit.

The fair value of each reporting unit is estimated using a
    discounted cash flow methodology and, in aggregate, validated
    against our market capitalization. This analysis requires
    significant judgments, including:

•

estimation of future cash flows which is dependent on internal
    forecasts;

•

estimation of the long-term rate of growth for our business;

•

the estimation of the useful life over which cash flows will
    occur; and

•

determination of our weighted average cost of capital.

We base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be
    reasonable. However, changes in these estimates and assumptions
    could materially affect the determination of fair value and
    goodwill impairment for each reporting unit.

Our annual goodwill impairment analysis, which we performed
    during the fourth quarter of 2009, did not result in an
    impairment charge (2008: $nil, 2007: $nil).

Income
    taxes

We recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the
    estimated future tax consequences of events attributable to
    differences between the financial statements carrying amounts of
    existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases
    and operating and capital loss and tax credit carry-forwards. We
    estimate deferred tax assets and liabilities and assess the need
    for any valuation allowances using tax rates in effect for the
    year in which the differences are expected to be recovered or
    settled taking into account our business plans and tax planning
    strategies.

At December 31, 2009, we had gross deferred tax assets of
    $390 million (2008: $362 million) against which a
    valuation allowance of $92 million (2008:

$85 million) had been recognized. To the extent that:

•

the actual future taxable income in the periods during which the
    temporary differences are expected to reverse differs from
    current projections;

•

assumed prudent and feasible tax planning strategies fail to
    materialize;

•

new tax planning strategies are developed; or

•

material changes occur in actual tax rates or loss carry-forward
    time limits,

we may adjust the deferred tax asset considered realizable in
    future periods. Such adjustments could result in a significant
    increase or decrease in the effective tax rate and have a
    material impact on our net income.

Positions taken in our tax returns may be subject to challenge
    by the taxing authorities upon examination. We recognize the
    benefit of uncertain tax positions in the financial statements
    when it is more likely than not that the position will be
    sustained on examination by the tax authorities. The benefit
    recognized is the largest amount of tax benefit that has a
    greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized on
    settlement with the tax authority, assuming full knowledge of
    the position and all relevant facts. The Company adjusts its
    recognition of these uncertain tax benefits in the period in
    which new information is available impacting either the
    recognition or measurement of its uncertain tax positions. In
    2009, $11 million was released relating to uncertain tax
    positions due to the closure of the statute of limitations on
    assessments for previously unrecognized tax benefits. There was
    a similar $5 million release of uncertain tax positions in
    2008.

Commitments,
    contingencies and accrued liabilities

We purchase professional indemnity insurance for errors and
    omissions claims. The terms of this insurance vary by policy
    year and self-insured risks have increased significantly over
    recent years. We have established provisions against various
    actual and potential claims, lawsuits and other proceedings
    relating principally to alleged errors and omissions in
    connection with the placement of insurance and reinsurance in
    the ordinary course of business. Such provisions cover claims
    that have been reported but not paid and also claims that have
    been incurred but



not reported. These provisions are established based on
    actuarial estimates together with individual case

reviews and are believed to be adequate in the light of current
    information and legal advice.

NEW
    ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

New accounting standards issued during the year that would have
    a significant impact on the

Company’s reporting are described in Note 2 to the
    Consolidated Financial Statements.

LIQUIDITY
    AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

During 2009, we have taken a number of actions to significantly
    improve our debt maturity profile:

•

in March 2009, we issued 12.875% senior notes due 2016 in
    an aggregate principal amount of $500 million to Goldman
    Sachs Mezzanine Partners which generated net proceeds of
    $482 million. These proceeds, together with
    $208 million cash generated from operating activities and
    cash in hand, were used to pay down the $750 million
    outstanding on our interim credit facility as of
    December 31, 2008; and

•

in September 2009, we issued $300 million of
    7.0% senior unsecured notes due 2019. We then launched a
    tender offer on September 22, 2009 to repurchase any and
    all of our $250 million 5.125% senior notes due July
    2010 at a premium of $27.50 per $1,000 face value. Notes
    totaling $160 million were tendered and repurchased on
    September 29, 2009.

Since December 31, 2009 we have:

•

repurchased on the open market a further $7 million of July
    2010 bonds; and

•

repaid the full value of $9 million in respect of a fixed
    rate loan note due 2010.

Once the remaining $83 million of senior notes due July
    2010 are repaid, the only mandatory repayments over the next
    5 years are the scheduled repayments on our
    $700 million

5-year

term
    loan and $4 million due on a fixed rate loan note due 2012.

In the short term, our capital management priority is debt
    reduction and we are currently targeting a debt to adjusted
    EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and
    amortization) ratio of below 2.5 times. Once we are in a
    position to remain at or below this ratio, we would consider
    recommencing our stock buyback program. At December 31,
    2009 the actual ratio was 2.6 times. However, there can be no
    assurance that we will achieve our target debt

to EBITDA ratio or recommence our stock buyback program.

Liquidity

Our principal sources of liquidity are cash from operations,
    cash and cash equivalents of $191 million at
    December 31, 2009 and remaining availability of
    $300 million under our revolving credit facility.

As of December 31, 2009, our short-term liquidity
    requirements consisted of:

•

payment of interest on debt and $110 million of mandatory
    repayments under our 2013 term loan;

•

payment of the $90 million principal outstanding on our
    senior notes due July 2010;

•

capital expenditure; and

•

working capital.

Our long-term liquidity requirements consist of:

•

the principal amount of outstanding notes; and

•

borrowings under our 2013 term loan and revolving credit
    facility.

Based on current market conditions and information available to
    us at this time, we believe that we have sufficient liquidity to
    meet our cash needs for at least the next 12 months.

In an effort to reduce future cash interest payments as well as
    future amounts due at maturity, we may from time to time seek to
    retire or purchase our outstanding debt through tender offers,
    cash purchases, in open market purchases, privately negotiated
    transactions or otherwise. Such actions, if any, will depend on
    prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements,
    contractual restrictions and other factors. The amounts involved
    may be material.

In September 2009, Standard and Poor’s and Moody’s
    revised their outlook on the Company to Stable from Negative. We
    believe that the improved



outlook and our current ratings allow us more flexibility in our
    capital planning.

We continue to identify and implement further actions to control
    costs and enhance our operating performance, including cash
    flow. These actions include the rationalization of our cost base
    through our ongoing Right Sizing Willis initiatives to achieve
    the best structure within the current environment.

Fiduciary
    funds

As an intermediary, we hold funds generally in a fiduciary
    capacity for the account of third parties, typically as the
    result of premiums received from clients that are in transit to
    insurers and claims due to clients that are in transit from
    insurers. We report premiums, which are held on account of, or
    due from, clients as assets with a corresponding liability due
    to the insurers. Claims held by, or due to, us which are due to
    clients are also shown as both assets and liabilities. All of
    these balances due or payable are included in accounts
    receivable and accounts payable on the balance sheet. We earn
    interest on these funds during the time between the receipt of
    the cash and the time the cash is paid out. Fiduciary cash must
    be kept in certain regulated bank accounts subject to
    guidelines, which generally emphasize capital preservation and
    liquidity, and is not generally available to service our debt or
    for other corporate purposes.

Operating
    activities

    compared to 2008

Net cash provided by operations was $418 million in 2009
    compared with $224 million in 2008. The $194 million
    increase between 2008 and 2009 mainly reflects:

•

a $198 million increase in net income before the non-cash
    charge for amortization of intangible assets; and

•

a reduction in pension scheme contributions to $82 million
    in 2009, compared with $154 million in 2008;

partly offset by

•

the timing of cash collections and other working capital
    movements.

    compared to 2007

Net cash from operations in 2008 was $51 million lower than
    in 2007, mainly reflecting:

•

an $81 million decrease in net income before the non-cash
    charge for amortization of intangible assets; and

•

a $65 million increase in cash payments for interest
    reflecting higher average debt levels, particularly following
    the funding of the HRH acquisition;

partly offset by

•

a $46 million reduction in additional contributions to our
    UK and US defined benefit pension plans;

•

the benefit of a $14 million reduction in taxes
    paid; and

•

the timing of cash collections and other working capital
    movements.

Investing
    activities

    compared to 2008

Total net cash inflow from investing activities was
    $102 million in 2009 compared with an outflow of
    $1,033 million in 2008, reflecting:

•

the $926 million net cash outflow attributable to the HRH
    acquisition in 2008;

•

$113 million cash received in 2009 in respect of
    investments in associates, compared with $31 million paid
    in 2008. The 2009 receipt includes $155 million from the
    reorganization of Gras Savoye, less $42 million settled in
    January 2009 for an additional investment in Gras Savoye made in
    December 2008; and

•

a $40 million increase in net proceeds from sale of
    operations, mainly attributable to the second quarter 2009
    disposal of Bliss & Glennon.

    compared to 2007

Total net cash used in investing activities was
    $1,033 million in 2008 compared with $181 million in
    2007. The movement was attributable to:

•

an $899 million net increase in the cost of acquisitions,
    primarily reflecting $926 million attributable to the HRH
    acquisition; and



•

a reduction in proceeds from disposals of operations,
    investments and other assets of $14 million;

partly offset by

•

a reduction in fixed asset spend of $91 million,
    principally attributable to sharply reduced expenditure on our
    new London and US headquarters buildings following their
    completion.

Financing
    activities

Net cash used in financing activities was $516 million in
    2009 compared with an inflow of $808 million in 2008 and an
    outflow of $193 million in 2007.

Long-term
    debt

In March 2009, we issued $500 million of senior notes due
    2016 at 12.875%.

We used the $482 million net proceeds of the notes,
    together with $208 million cash generated from operating
    activities and $60 million cash in hand, to pay down the
    $750 million outstanding on our interim credit facility as
    of December 31, 2008.

In September 2009, we issued $300 million of
    7.0% senior notes due 2019. We then launched a tender offer
    on September 22, 2009 to repurchase any and all of our
    $250 million 5.125% senior notes due July 2010 at a
    premium of $27.50 per $1,000 face value. Notes totaling
    $160 million were tendered and repurchased on
    September 29, 2009.

In December 2009, we applied the net cash proceeds of
    $155 million from the Gras Savoye transaction, together
    with other cash in hand, to reduce the balance outstanding on
    the

5-year

term loan by approximately $180 million to

$521 million, of which $27 million related to our
    first mandatory debt repayment.

As of December 31, 2009, there were no amounts outstanding
    under our $300 million revolving credit facility (2008:
    $nil; 2007: $50 million).

Share
    buybacks

We did not buyback any shares in 2009. There remains
    $925 million under the current buyback authorization.

In 2008, we repurchased 2.3 million shares at a cost of
    $75 million and in 2007 we repurchased 11.5 million
    shares for $480 million of cash.

In 2009, the Company filed a Tender Offer Statement with the SEC
    to repurchase for cash options to purchase Company shares. The
    tender offer expired on August 6, 2009. Approximately 1.6
    million options to purchase Company shares were repurchased at
    an average per share price of $2.04.

Dividends

Cash dividends paid in 2009 were $174 million compared with
    $146 million in 2008 and $143 million in 2007.

The $28 million increase primarily reflects dividend
    payments on the 24 million additional shares issued in
    connection with the fourth quarter 2008 acquisition of HRH. In
    February 2010, we declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.26
    per share, an annual rate of $1.04 per share, subject to the
    Irish High Court approving a reduction of our share capital in
    order to create distributable reserves, (which under Irish law
    are required to facilitate the payment of a dividend), and
    compliance generally with the requirements of the Irish
    Companies Act relating to the payment of dividends.

Debt
    facilities

In March 2009, we issued 12.875% senior notes due 2016 in
    an aggregate principal amount of $500 million to Goldman
    Sachs Mezzanine Partners which generated net proceeds of
    $482 million. These proceeds, together with
    $208 million cash generated from operating activities and
    cash in hand, were used to pay down the $750 million
    outstanding on our interim credit facility as of
    December 31, 2008.

In September 2009, we issued $300 million of
    7.0% senior notes due 2019. We then launched a tender offer
    on September 22, 2009 to repurchase any and all of our
    $250 million 5.125% senior notes due July 2010 at a
    premium of $27.50 per $1,000 face value. Notes totaling
    approximately $160 million were tendered and repurchased on
    September 29, 2009.

In December 2009, we applied the net cash proceeds of
    $155 million from the Gras Savoye transaction, together
    with other cash in hand, to reduce the balance outstanding on
    the

5-year

term loan by approximately $180 million to
    $521 million.

Since the end of the year, we have:

•

repurchased a further $7 million of July 2010
    bonds; and

•

repaid the full value of $9 million in respect of a fixed
    rate loan note due 2010.

Once the remaining $83 million of July 2010 bonds are
    repaid, the only mandatory repayments over the next 5 years
    are the scheduled repayments on our $700 million

5-year

term
    loan and $4 million due on a fixed rate loan note due 2012.

Operating
    leases

We lease our London headquarters building under a 25 year
    operating lease, which expires in 2032. Annual rentals are
    $31 million per year and we have subleased approximately
    30 percent of the premises under leases up to
    15 years. The outstanding contractual obligation for lease
    rentals at December 31, 2009 was $785 million and the
    amounts receivable from subleases was $100 million.



Pensions

Contractual obligations for our pension plans reflect the
    contributions we expect to make over the next five years into
    our US and UK plans. These contributions are based on current
    funding positions and may increase or decrease dependent on the
    future performance of the two plans.

In the UK, we are required to agree a funding strategy for our
    UK defined benefit plan with the plan’s trustees. In
    February 2009, we agreed to make full year contributions to the
    UK plan of $40 million for 2009 through 2012, excluding
    amounts in respect of the salary sacrifice scheme. In addition,
    as certain funding targets have not been met at the beginning of
    2010, a further contribution

of $40 million is required for 2010. A similar, additional
    contribution may also be required for 2011, depending on actual
    performance against funding targets at the beginning of 2011.

For the US plan, expected contributions are the contributions we
    will be required to make under US pension legislation based on
    our December 31, 2009 balance sheet position. We currently
    expect to contribute $30 million in 2010 and
    $30 million per year from 2011 to 2014.

The total contributions for all plans are currently estimated to
    be approximately $120 million in 2010 excluding amounts in
    respect of the salary sacrifice scheme.

OFF-BALANCE
    SHEET TRANSACTIONS

Apart from commitments, guarantees and contingencies, as
    disclosed in Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial
    Statements, the Company has no off-balance sheet arrangements
    that have, or

are reasonably likely to have, a material effect on the
    Company’s financial condition, results of operations or
    liquidity.



Item 7A —

Quantitative
    and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk

Financial
    Risk Management

We are exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency
    exchange rates and interest rates. In order to manage the risk
    arising from these exposures, we enter into a variety of
    interest rate and foreign currency derivatives. We do not hold
    financial or derivative instruments for trading purposes.

A discussion of our accounting policies for financial and
    derivative instruments is included in Note 2 —
    Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies of
    Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, and further
    disclosure is provided in Note 22 — Financial
    Instruments of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Foreign
    exchange risk management

Because of the large number of countries and currencies we
    operate in, movements in currency exchange rates may affect our
    results.

We report our operating results and financial condition in US
    dollars. Our US operations earn revenue and incur expenses
    primarily in US dollars. Outside the United States, we
    predominantly generate revenues and expenses in the local
    currency with the exception of our London market operations
    which earns revenues in several currencies but incurs expenses
    predominantly in pounds sterling.

The table below gives an approximate analysis of revenues and
    expenses by currency in 2009.

Our principal exposures to foreign exchange risk arise from:

•

our London market operations; and

•

translation.

London
    market operations

In our London market operations, we earn revenue in a number of
    different currencies, principally US dollars, pounds sterling,
    euros and Japanese yen, but incur expenses almost entirely in
    pounds sterling.

We hedge this risk as follows:

•

to the extent that forecast pound sterling expenses exceed pound
    sterling revenues, we limit our exposure to this exchange rate
    risk by the use of forward contracts matched to specific,
    clearly identified cash outflows arising in the ordinary course
    of business; and

•

to the extent our London market operations earn significant
    revenues in euros and Japanese yen, we limit our exposure to
    changes in the exchange rate between the US dollar and these
    currencies by the use of forward contracts matched to a
    percentage of forecast cash inflows in specific currencies and
    periods.

Generally, it is our policy to hedge at least 25 percent of
    the next 12 months’ exposure in significant
    currencies. We do not hedge exposures beyond three years.

In addition, we are also exposed to foreign exchange risk on any
    net sterling asset or liability position in our London market
    operations. Where this risk relates to short-term cash flows, we
    hedge all or part of the risk by forward purchases or sales.

However, where the foreign exchange risk relates to any sterling
    pension assets benefit or liability for pensions benefit, we do
    not hedge the risk. Consequently, if our London market
    operations have a significant pension asset or liability, we may
    be exposed to accounting gains and losses if the US dollar and
    pounds sterling exchange rate changes. We do, however, hedge the
    pounds sterling contributions into the pension plan.

Translation
    risk

Outside our US and London market operations, we predominantly
    earn revenues and incur expenses in the local currency. When we
    translate the results and net assets of these operations into US
    dollars for reporting purposes, movements in exchange rates will
    affect reported results and net assets. For example, if the US
    dollar strengthens against the euro, the reported results of our
    Eurozone operations in US dollar terms will be lower. We do not
    hedge translation risk.

The table below provides information about our foreign currency
    forward exchange contracts, which are sensitive to exchange rate
    risk. The table



summarizes the US dollar equivalent amounts of each currency
    bought and sold forward and the weighted average contractual
    exchange rates. All

forward exchange contracts mature within four years.

Represents the difference between

    have been receivable had the foreign currency forward exchange
    contracts been entered into on December 31, 2009 or 2008 at
    the forward exchange rates prevailing at that date.

Income earned within foreign subsidiaries outside of the UK is
    generally offset by expenses in the same local currency but the
    Company does have exposure to foreign exchange movements on the
    net income of these entities. The Company does not hedge net
    income earned within foreign subsidiaries outside of the UK.

Interest
    rate risk management

Our operations are financed principally by $1,840 million
    fixed rate senior notes issued by subsidiaries and
    $521 million under a

5-year

term
    loan facility. Of the fixed rate senior notes, $90 million
    are due 2010, $350 million are due 2015, $500 million
    are due 2016, $600 million are due 2017 and
    $300 million are due 2019. The

5-year

term
    loan facility amortizes at the rate of $27 million per
    quarter. As of December 31, 2009 we had access to, but had
    not drawn $300 million under a

5-year

revolving credit facility. The interest rate applicable to the
    bank borrowing is variable according to the period of each
    individual drawdown.

We are also subject to market risk from exposure to changes in
    interest rates based on our investing activities where our
    primary interest rate risk arises from changes in short-term
    interest rates in both US dollars and pounds sterling.

As a consequence of our insurance and reinsurance broking
    activities, there is a delay between the time we receive cash
    for premiums and claims and the time the cash needs to be paid.
    We earn interest on this float, which is included in our
    consolidated financial statements as investment income.

This float is regulated in terms of access and the instruments
    in which it may be invested, most of which are short-term in
    maturity. We manage the interest rate risk arising from this
    exposure primarily through the use of interest rate swaps. It is
    our policy that, for currencies with significant balances, a
    minimum of 25 percent of forecast income arising is hedged
    for each of the next three years.

The table below provides information about our derivative
    instruments and other financial



instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest. For
    interest rate swaps, the table presents notional principal
    amounts and average interest rates analyzed by expected maturity
    dates. Notional principal amounts are used to calculate the
    contractual payments to be exchanged under the contracts. The
    duration of interest rate swaps varies

between one and four years, with re-fixing periods of three
    months. Average fixed and variable rates are, respectively, the
    weighted-average actual and market rates for the interest hedges
    in place. Market rates are the rates prevailing at
    December 31, 2009 or 2008, as appropriate.

REPORT OF
    INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board
    of Directors and Stockholders of Willis Group Holdings Public
    Limited Company

Dublin, Ireland

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
    Willis Group Holdings Public Limited Company and subsidiaries
    (the ‘Company’) as of December 31, 2009 and 2008,
    and the related consolidated statements of operations, changes
    in equity and comprehensive income, and cash flows for each of
    the three years in the period ended December 31, 2009. Our
    audits also included the consolidated financial statement
    schedule listed in the Index at Item 15. These financial
    statements and financial statement schedule are the
    responsibility of the Company’s management. Our
    responsibility is to express an opinion on the financial
    statements and financial statement schedule based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
    free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
    test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
    the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the
    accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
    management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
    statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
    reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present
    fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of
    Willis Group Holdings Public Limited Company and subsidiaries as
    of December 31, 2009 and 2008, and the results of their
    operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in
    the period ended December 31, 2009, in conformity with
    accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
    America. Also, in our opinion, such consolidated financial
    statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic
    consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, present
    fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth
    therein.

As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial
    statements, on January 1, 2009, the Company adopted the
    noncontrolling interest guidance from Accounting Standards
    Codification 810,

Consolidations

(formerly Statement of
    Financial Accounting Standards No. 160,

Noncontrolling
    Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements — an
    amendment of ARB 51

). The Company has retrospectively
    adjusted all periods presented in the consolidated financial
    statements for the effect of this change.

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
    Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of
    December 31, 2009, based on the criteria established in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework

issued
    by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
    Commission and our report dated February 26, 2010 expressed an
    unqualified opinion on the Company’s internal control over
    financial reporting.

NOTES
    TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1.

NATURE OF
    OPERATIONS

Willis Group Holdings plc (‘Willis Group Holdings’)
    (formerly Willis Group Holdings Limited
    (‘Willis-Bermuda’) — see
    Note 2 — Redomicile to Ireland) and subsidiaries
    (collectively, the ‘Company’ or the Group) provide a
    broad range of insurance and reinsurance broking and risk
    management consulting services to its clients worldwide, both
    directly and indirectly through its associates. The Company
    provides both specialized risk management advisory and
    consulting services on a global basis to clients engaged in
    specific industrial and commercial activities, and services to
    small, medium and major corporates through its retail operations.

In its capacity as an advisor and insurance broker, the Company
    acts as an intermediary between clients and insurance carriers
    by advising clients on risk management requirements, helping
    clients determine the best means of managing risk, and
    negotiating and placing insurance risk with insurance carriers
    through the Company’s global distribution network.

2.

BASIS OF
    PRESENTATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Redomicile
    to Ireland

On September 24, 2009, Willis Group Holdings was
    incorporated in Ireland, in order to effectuate the change of
    the place of incorporation of the parent company of the Group.
    Willis Group Holdings operated as a wholly-owned subsidiary of
    Willis-Bermuda until December 31, 2009, when the
    outstanding common shares of Willis-Bermuda were canceled and
    Willis Group Holdings issued ordinary shares with substantially
    the same rights and preferences on a

one-for-one

basis to the holders of the Willis-Bermuda common shares that
    were canceled. Upon completion of this transaction, Willis Group
    Holdings replaced Willis-Bermuda as the ultimate parent company
    and Willis-Bermuda became a wholly-owned subsidiary of Willis
    Group Holdings.

This transaction was accounted for as a merger between entities
    under common control; accordingly, the historical financial
    statements of Willis-Bermuda for periods prior to this
    transaction are considered to be the historical financial
    statements of Willis Group Holdings. No changes in capital
    structure, assets or liabilities resulted from this transaction,
    other than Willis Group Holdings has provided a guarantee of
    amounts due under certain borrowing arrangements of two of its
    subsidiaries as described in notes 24 and 25.

Recent
    Accounting Pronouncements and Significant Accounting
    Policies

These consolidated financial statements conform to accounting
    principles generally accepted in the United States of America
    (‘US GAAP’). Presented below are summaries of:

•

Recent accounting pronouncements; and

•

Significant accounting policies followed in the preparation of
    the consolidated financial statements.

Recent
    Accounting Pronouncements

Accounting
    Standards Codification

During third quarter 2009, the new Accounting Standards
    Codification (‘ASC’) was issued by the Financial
    Accounting Standards Board (‘FASB’). The ASC has
    become the source of authoritative US GAAP recognized by the
    FASB to be applied by nongovernmental entities. The ASC is not
    intended to change or alter existing GAAP and therefore all
    references to GAAP remain throughout this document.

NOTES TO
    THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

BASIS OF
    PRESENTATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
    (Continued)

Business
    Combinations

New accounting guidance related to business combinations was
    effective from January 1, 2009. This guidance made
    substantial changes to how entities account for business
    combinations, establishing principles and requirements for how
    the acquirer:

•

recognizes and measures the identifiable assets acquired, the
    liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interest in the
    acquiree;

•

recognizes and measures goodwill acquired in the business
    combination; and

•

determines what information to disclose to enable users of
    financial statements to evaluate the nature and financial
    effects of the business combination.

Assets and liabilities that arose from business combinations
    with acquisition dates prior to the effective date (financial
    years beginning after December 15, 2008) are not
    adjusted upon adoption, with certain exceptions for acquired
    deferred tax assets and acquired income tax positions.

The income tax provisions pertaining to changes in the valuation
    allowance of deferred tax assets and uncertain tax positions are
    applicable prospectively to business combinations occurring
    prior to the effective date. Reductions to the valuation
    allowance of acquired deferred tax assets and all changes to
    acquired uncertain tax positions occurring after the measurement
    period are now recorded in the statement of operations in the
    period of reversal.

Noncontrolling
    Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements

New accounting guidance related to noncontrolling interests was
    effective from January 1, 2009. The guidance established
    accounting and reporting standards for the noncontrolling
    interest in a subsidiary and for the retained interest and gain
    or loss when a subsidiary is deconsolidated. It clarified that a
    noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary is an ownership interest
    in the consolidated entity and should be reported as equity in
    the Consolidated Financial Statements.

The impact of this change on the Company’s balance sheet is
    outlined below:

Variable
    Interest Entities

In June 2009, the FASB issued new accounting guidance which
    amends the evaluation criteria to identify the primary
    beneficiary of a Variable Interest Entity (‘VIE’) and
    requires ongoing reassessment of whether an



WILLIS
    GROUP HOLDINGS PLC

    THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

    PRESENTATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
    (Continued)

enterprise is the primary beneficiary of the VIE. This analysis
    identifies the primary beneficiary of a VIE as the enterprise
    that has both of the following characteristics:

•

the power to direct the activities of a VIE that most
    significantly impact the entity’s economic
    performance; and

•

the obligation to absorb losses of the entity that could
    potentially be significant to the VIE or the right to receive
    benefits from the entity that could potentially be significant
    to the VIE.

The Company does not believe that the implementation of this
    guidance will have a material effect on its financial position
    or results of operations.

Significant
    Accounting Policies

Principles
    of Consolidation

The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the
    accounts of Willis Group Holdings and its subsidiaries, which
    are controlled through the ownership of a majority voting
    interest. Intercompany balances and transactions have been
    eliminated on consolidation.

Foreign
    Currency Translation

Transactions in currencies other than the functional currency of
    the entity are recorded at the rates of exchange prevailing at
    the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities in
    currencies other than the functional currency are translated at
    the rates of exchange prevailing at the balance sheet date and
    the related transaction gains and losses are reported in the
    statements of operations. Certain intercompany loans are
    determined to be of a long-term investment nature. The Company
    records transaction gains and losses from remeasuring such loans
    as a component of other comprehensive income.

Upon consolidation, the results of operations of subsidiaries
    and associates whose functional currency is other than the US
    dollar are translated into US dollars at the average exchange
    rate and assets and liabilities are translated at year-end
    exchange rates. Translation adjustments are presented as a
    separate component of other comprehensive income in the
    financial statements and are included in net income only upon
    sale or liquidation of the underlying foreign subsidiary or
    associated company.

Use of
    Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with US
    GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
    affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
    disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities as of the dates
    of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues
    and expenses during the year. In the preparation of these
    consolidated financial statements, estimates and assumptions
    have been made by management concerning: the valuation of
    intangible assets (including those acquired through business
    combinations), the selection of useful lives of fixed and
    intangible assets; impairment testing; provisions necessary for
    accounts receivable, commitments and contingencies and accrued
    liabilities; long-term asset returns, discount rates and
    mortality rates in order to estimate pension liabilities and
    pension expense; income tax valuation allowances; and other
    similar evaluations. Actual results could differ from the
    estimates underlying these consolidated financial statements.

Cash
    and Cash Equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents primarily consist of time deposits
    with original maturities of three months or less.

    GROUP HOLDINGS PLC

NOTES TO
    THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

BASIS OF
    PRESENTATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
    (Continued)

Fiduciary
    Funds — Restricted

Fiduciary funds — restricted represent unremitted
    premiums received from insureds and unremitted claims received
    from insurers. Fiduciary funds are generally required to be kept
    in certain regulated bank accounts subject to guidelines which
    emphasize capital preservation and liquidity; such funds are not
    available to service the Company’s debt or for other
    corporate purposes. Notwithstanding the legal relationships with
    clients and insurers, the Company is entitled to retain
    investment income earned on fiduciary funds in accordance with
    industry custom and practice and, in some cases, as supported by
    agreements with insureds.

Included in fiduciary funds — restricted are cash and
    cash equivalents consisting primarily of time deposits. The debt
    securities are classified as

available-for-sale.

Accordingly, they are recorded at fair market value with
    unrealized holding gains and losses reported, net of tax, as a
    component of other comprehensive income.

Accounts
    Receivable and Accounts Payable

In its capacity as an insurance agent or broker, the Company
    collects premiums from insureds and, after deducting its
    commissions, remits the premiums to the respective insurers; the
    Company also collects claims or refunds from insurers on behalf
    of insureds. Uncollected premiums from insureds and uncollected
    claims or refunds from insurers are recorded as accounts
    receivable on the Company’s consolidated balance sheets.
    Unremitted insurance premiums and claims are held in a fiduciary
    capacity. The obligation to remit these funds is recorded as
    accounts payable on the Company’s consolidated balance
    sheets. The period for which the Company holds such funds is
    dependent upon the date the insured remits the payment of the
    premium to the Company and the date the Company is required to
    forward such payment to the insurer. Balances arising from
    insurance brokerage transactions are reported as separate assets
    or liabilities unless such balances are due to or from the same
    party and a right of offset exists, in which case the balances
    are recorded net.

Accounts receivable are stated at estimated net realizable
    values. Allowances are recorded, when necessary, in an amount
    considered by management to be sufficient to meet probable
    future losses related to uncollectible accounts.

Fixed
    Assets

Fixed assets are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation.
    Expenditures for improvements are capitalized; repairs and
    maintenance are charged to expenses as incurred. Depreciation is
    computed using the straight-line method based on the estimated
    useful lives of assets.

Depreciation on buildings and long leaseholds is calculated over
    the lesser of 50 years or the lease term. Depreciation on
    leasehold improvements is calculated over the lesser of the
    useful life of the assets or the remaining lease term.
    Depreciation on furniture and equipment is calculated based on a
    range of 3 to 10 years.

Recoverability
    of Fixed Assets

Long-lived assets are tested for recoverability whenever events
    or changes in circumstance indicate that their carrying amounts
    may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognized if the
    carrying amount of a long-lived asset is not recoverable and
    exceeds its fair value. Recoverability is determined based on
    the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and
    eventual disposition of the asset or asset group. Long-lived
    assets and certain identifiable intangible assets to be disposed
    of are reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value
    less cost to sell.

    GROUP HOLDINGS PLC

NOTES TO
    THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

BASIS OF
    PRESENTATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
    (Continued)

Operating
    Leases

Rentals payable on operating leases are charged straight line to
    expenses over the lease term as the rentals become payable.

Goodwill
    and Other Intangible Assets

Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of businesses
    acquired over the fair market value of identifiable net assets
    at the dates of acquisition. The Company reviews goodwill for
    impairment annually and whenever facts or circumstances indicate
    that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable. As part of the
    evaluation the estimated future discounted cash flows associated
    with the underlying business operation are compared to the
    carrying amount of goodwill to determine if a write-down is
    required. If such an assessment indicates that the discounted
    future cash flows are not sufficient, the carrying amount is
    reduced to the estimated fair value. Acquired intangible assets
    are being amortized on a straight-line basis over their
    estimated useful life with the exception of customer
    relationships for HRH which are amortized in line with the
    underlying cash flows.

Investments
    in Associates

Investments are accounted for using the equity method of
    accounting if the Company has the ability to exercise
    significant influence, but not control, over the investee.
    Significant influence is generally deemed to exist if the
    Company has an equity ownership in the voting stock of the
    investee between 20 and 50 percent, although other factors,
    such as representation on the Board of Directors and the impact
    of commercial arrangements, are considered in determining
    whether the equity method of accounting is appropriate. Under
    the equity method of accounting the investment is carried at
    cost of acquisition, plus the Company’s equity in
    undistributed net income since acquisition, less any dividends
    received since acquisition.

The Company periodically reviews its investments in associates
    for which fair value is less than cost to determine if the
    decline in value is other than temporary. If the decline in
    value is judged to be other than temporary, the cost basis of
    the investment is written down to fair value. The amount of any
    write-down is included in the statements of operations as a
    realized loss.

All other equity investments where the Company does not have the
    ability to exercise significant influence are accounted for by
    the cost method. Such investments are not publicly traded.

Derivative
    Financial Instruments

The Company uses derivative financial instruments for other than
    trading purposes to alter the risk profile of an existing
    underlying exposure. Interest rate swaps are used to manage
    interest risk exposures. Forward foreign currency exchange
    contracts are used to manage currency exposures arising from
    future income and expenses. The fair values of derivative
    contracts are recorded in other assets and other liabilities.
    Changes in the fair value of derivatives that qualify for hedge
    accounting are recorded in other comprehensive income. Amounts
    are reclassified from other comprehensive income into earnings
    when the hedged exposure affects earnings. Changes in fair value
    of derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting,
    together with any hedge ineffectiveness, are recorded in other
    operating expenses or interest expense as appropriate.

Income
    Taxes

The Company recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for
    the estimated future tax consequences of events attributable to
    differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of
    existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases
    and operating and capital loss and tax credit carry forwards.
    Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted
    rates in effect for the year in which the differences are
    expected to



WILLIS
    GROUP HOLDINGS PLC

NOTES TO
    THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

2.

BASIS OF
    PRESENTATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
    (Continued)

be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and
    liabilities of changes in tax rates is recognized in the
    statement of operations in the period in which the enactment
    date changes. Deferred tax assets are reduced through the
    establishment of a valuation allowance at such time as, based on
    available evidence, it is more likely than not that the deferred
    tax assets will not be realized.

Positions taken in the Company’s tax returns may be subject
    to challenge by the taxing authorities upon examination. The
    Company recognizes the benefit of uncertain tax positions in the
    financial statements when it is more likely than not that the
    position will be sustained on examination by the tax
    authorities. The benefit recognized is the largest amount of tax
    benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely to be
    realized on settlement with the tax authority, assuming full
    knowledge of the position and all relevant facts. The Company
    adjusts its recognition of these uncertain tax benefits in the
    period in which new information is available impacting either
    the recognition or measurement of its uncertain tax positions.

The Company recognizes interest relating to unrecognized tax
    benefits and penalties within income taxes.

Pensions

The Company has two principal defined benefit pension plans
    which cover the majority of employees in the United States and
    United Kingdom. Both these plans are now closed to new entrants.
    Effective May 15, 2009, the Company closed the US defined
    benefit pension plan to future accrual. New entrants in the
    United Kingdom are offered the opportunity to join a defined
    contribution plan and in the United States are offered the
    opportunity to join a 401(k) plan. In addition, there are
    smaller plans in certain other countries in which the Company
    operates. Elsewhere, pension benefits are typically provided
    through defined contribution plans.

Defined
    benefit plans

The net periodic cost of the Company’s defined benefit
    plans are measured on an actuarial basis using the projected
    unit credit method and several actuarial assumptions. The most
    significant of which are the discount rate and the expected
    long-term rate of return on plan assets. Other material
    assumptions include rates of participant mortality, the expected
    long-term rate of compensation and pension increases and rates
    of employee termination. Gains and losses occur when actual
    experience differs from actuarial assumptions. If such gains or
    losses exceed ten percent of the greater of plan assets or plan
    liabilities the Company amortizes those gains or losses over the
    average remaining service period of the employees.

In accordance with US GAAP the Company records on the balance
    sheet the funded status of its pension plans based on the
    projected benefit obligation.

Defined
    contribution plans

Contributions to the Company’s defined contribution plans
    are recognized as they fall due. Differences between
    contributions payable in the year and contributions actually
    paid are shown as either other assets or other liabilities in
    the consolidated balance sheets.

BASIS OF

    (Continued)

Share-Based
    Compensation

The Company accounts for share-based compensation as follows:

•

the cost resulting from all equity awards is recognized in the
    financial statements at fair value estimated at the grant date;

•

the fair value is recognized (generally as compensation cost)
    over the requisite service period for all awards that
    vest; and

•

compensation cost is not recognized for awards that do not vest
    because service or performance conditions are not satisfied.

Revenue
    Recognition

Revenue includes insurance commissions, fees for services
    rendered, certain commissions receivable from insurance
    carriers, investment income and other income.

Brokerage income and fees negotiated instead of brokerage are
    recognized at the later of policy inception date or when the
    policy placement is complete. Commissions on additional premiums
    and adjustments are recognized as and when advised.

Fees for risk management and other services are recognized as
    the services are provided. Negotiated fee arrangements for an
    agreed period covering multiple insurance placements, the
    provision of risk management

and/or

other
    services are determined, contract by contract, on the basis of
    the relative fair value of the services completed and the
    services yet to be rendered. The Company establishes contract
    cancellation reserves where appropriate: at December 31,
    2009, 2008 and 2007, such amounts were not material.

Investment income is recognized as earned.

Other income comprises gains on disposal of intangible assets,
    which primarily arise on the disposal of books of business.
    Although the Company is not in the business of selling
    intangible assets (mainly books of business), from time to time
    the Company will dispose of a book of business (a customer list)
    or other intangible assets that do not produce adequate margins
    or fit with the Company’s strategy.

SEVERANCE
    COSTS

The Company incurred severance costs of $24 million in the
    year ended December 31, 2009 (2008: $26 million)
    relating to over 450 positions that have been, or are in the
    process of being, eliminated as part of the Company’s
    continuing focus on managing expense. Of these costs,
    $18 million was incurred in first half 2009 as part of the
    Company’s Right Sizing Willis initiatives and
    $6 million was incurred in the second half of 2009 relating
    to severance costs arising in the normal course of business
    (2008: $2 million; 2007: $2 million). Severance costs
    for these employees were recognized pursuant to the terms of
    their existing benefit arrangements or employment agreements.

In 2008, the Company also incurred severance expenses as it
    integrated HRH into its existing North America operations.
    Severance costs of $2 million (2007: $nil) relating to the
    elimination of approximately 100 positions in the Company’s
    existing operations were recognized through the consolidated
    statement of operations in 2008. In addition, $16 million
    of severance expenses relating to 900 HRH positions eliminated
    as part of the integration plan were recognized as a liability
    on acquisition.

SHARE-BASED
    COMPENSATION

On December 31, 2009, the Company had four open share-based
    compensation plans, under which options and other share based
    grants may be made to employees. All of the Company’s
    share-based compensation plans under which any options or other
    share-based grants are outstanding as at December 31, 2009
    are described below. The compensation cost that has been charged
    against income for those plans for the year ended
    December 31, 2009 was $39 million (2008:
    $40 million; 2007: $33 million). The total income tax
    benefit recognized in the statement of operations for
    share-based compensation arrangements for the year ended
    December 31, 2009 was $12 million (2008:
    $12 million; 2007: $10 million).

Stock
    Option Plans

The Company has adopted the plans described below, which provide
    for the grant of time-based options and performance-based
    options and various other share-based grants to employees. The
    objectives of these plans include attracting and retaining the
    best personnel, motivating management personnel by means of
    growth-related incentives to achieve long-range goals and
    providing employees with the opportunity to increase their share
    ownership in the Company.

Amended
    and Restated 1998 Share Purchase and Option Plan

This plan, which was established on December 18, 1998,
    provides for the granting of time-based and performance-based
    options to employees of the Company. There are
    30,000,000 shares available for grant under this plan,
    provided, however, that in no event shall the total number of
    shares subject to options and other equity for current and
    future participants exceed 25 percent of the equity of
    Willis Group Holdings on a fully diluted basis. All options
    granted under this plan are exercisable at £2 per share
    ($3.22 using the year-end exchange rate of £1 = $1.61)
    except for 111,111 time-based options which are exercisable at
    $13.50. No further grants are to be made under this plan, which
    expired on December 18, 2008. Outstanding grants will not
    be affected.

Time-based options are earned upon the fulfillment of vesting
    requirements. Options are generally exercisable in equal
    installments of 20 percent per year over a five-year period
    commencing on or after December 18, 2000.

Performance-based options became exercisable, subject to the
    fulfillment of vesting requirements with effect from
    January 1, 2003, upon the achievement of cash flow and
    EBITDA (as defined in the plan agreements) targets of the Group.
    Options are generally exercisable in equal installments of
    25 percent per year over a four-year period commencing on
    or after December 18, 2001.

Willis
    Award Plan

This plan, which was established on July 13, 2000, provides
    for the granting of time-based options to selected employees who
    have been identified as superior performers. There are
    5,000,000 shares available for grant under this plan
    provided, however, that in no event may the total number of
    shares subject to options and other equity for current and
    future participants exceed 25 percent of the equity of
    Willis Group Holdings on a fully diluted basis.

All options granted under this plan are exercisable at £2
    per share ($3.22 using the year-end exchange rate of £1 =
    $1.61). The options vest immediately on the grant date and are
    exercisable any time up to July 13, 2010.

2001 Share
    Purchase and Option Plan

This plan, which was established on May 3, 2001, provides
    for the granting of time-based options and various other
    share-based grants at fair market value to employees of the
    Company. There are 25,000,000 shares

available for grant under this plan. Options are exercisable on
    a variety of dates, including from the first, second, third,
    sixth or eighth anniversary of grant, although for certain
    options the exercisable date may accelerate depending on the
    achievement of certain performance goals. Unless terminated
    sooner by the Board of Directors, the 2001 Plan will expire
    10 years after the date of its adoption. That termination
    will not affect the validity of any grant outstanding at that
    date.

2008 Share
    Purchase and Option Plan

This plan, which was established on April 23, 2008,
    provides for the granting of time and performance-based options
    and various other share-based grants at fair market value to
    employees of the Company. There are 8,000,000 shares
    available for grant under this plan. Options are exercisable on
    a variety of dates, including from the third, fourth or fifth
    anniversary of grant. Unless terminated sooner by the Board of
    Directors, the 2008 Plan will expire 10 years after the
    date of its adoption. That termination will not affect the
    validity of any grant outstanding at that date.

HRH
    Option Plans

Options granted under the Hilb Rogal and Hamilton Company 2000
    Stock Incentive Plan, the Hilb Rogal & Hobbs Company
    2007 Stock Incentive Plan and the Hilb Rogal & Hobbs
    Company Non-Employee Directors Stock Incentive Plan were
    converted into options to acquire shares of Willis Group
    Holdings. No further grants are to be made under these plans.

Option
    Valuation Assumptions

The fair value of each option is estimated on the date of grant
    using the Black-Scholes option pricing model that uses the
    assumptions noted in the following table. Expected volatility is
    based on historical volatility of the Company’s stock. With
    effect from January 1, 2006, the Company uses the
    simplified method set out in ASC

718-10-S99

to derive the expected term of options granted. The risk-free
    rate for periods within the expected life of the option is based
    on the US Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant.

GAIN ON
    DISPOSAL OF LONDON HEADQUARTERS

On September 27, 2006, Willis Group Services Limited, a
    subsidiary of Willis Group Holdings, completed the sale of Ten
    Trinity Square, the Company’s London headquarters building.
    The building was then leased back at an annual rental of
    $13 million until the Company occupied its new London
    headquarters in April 2008. Gross proceeds were
    $202 million of which 25 percent was received in cash
    on completion and 75 percent was received on
    November 27, 2006. Of the total pre-tax gain on disposal,
    $102 million was recognized in 2006; $14 million in
    2007; and $7 million in 2008.

6.

NET GAIN
    ON DISPOSAL OF OPERATIONS

Total proceeds from the disposal of operations for 2009 were
    $315 million, including $281 million for
    18 percent of the Group’s 49 percent interest in
    Gras Savoye and $39 million for 100 percent of
    Bliss & Glennon.

On December 17, 2009, the Company completed a leveraged
    transaction with the original family shareholders of Gras Savoye
    and Astorg Partners, a private equity fund, to reorganize the
    capital of Gras Savoye (‘December 2009 leveraged
    transaction’), its principal investment in associates. The
    Company, the family shareholders and Astorg now own equal stakes
    of 31 percent in Gras Savoye and have equal representation
    of one third of the voting rights on its board. The remaining
    shareholding is held by a large pool of Gras Savoye managers.

As a result of the December 2009 leveraged transaction the
    Company recognized a gain of $10 million in the
    consolidated statement of operations from the reduction of its
    interest in Gras Savoye from 49 percent to 31 percent.
    The Company received total proceeds of $281 million,
    comprising cash and interest bearing

At December 31, 2009, the Company had valuation allowances
    of $92 million (2008: $85 million) to reduce its
    deferred tax assets to estimated realizable value. The valuation
    allowances at December 31, 2009 relate to the deferred tax
    assets arising from UK capital loss carryforwards
    ($56 million) and UK trading losses ($2 million),
    which have no expiration date and to the deferred tax assets
    arising from US State net operating losses ($34 million).
    Capital loss carryforwards can only be offset against future UK
    capital gains.

At December 31, 2009, the Company had deferred tax assets
    of $298 million (2008: $277 million), net of the
    valuation allowance. Management believes, based upon the level
    of historical taxable income and projections for future taxable
    income, it is more likely than not that the Company will realize
    the benefits of these

deductible differences, net of the valuation allowance. However,
    the amount of the deferred tax asset considered realizable could
    be adjusted in the future if estimates of taxable income are
    revised.

The Company recognizes deferred tax balances related to the
    undistributed earnings of subsidiaries when the Company expects
    that it will recover those undistributed earnings in a taxable
    manner, such as through receipt of dividends or sale of the
    investments. The Company does not, however, provide for income
    taxes on the unremitted earnings of certain other subsidiaries
    where, in management’s opinion, such earnings have been
    indefinitely reinvested in those operations, or will be remitted
    either in a tax free liquidation or as dividends with taxes
    substantially offset by foreign tax credits. It is not practical
    to determine the amount of unrecognized deferred tax liabilities
    for temporary differences related to these investments.

Unrecognized
    tax benefits

Total unrecognized tax benefits as at December 31, 2009,
    totaled $17 million. During the next 12 months it is
    reasonably possible that the Company will recognize
    approximately $10 million of tax benefits related to the
    release of provisions no longer required due to either
    settlement through negotiation or closure of the statute of
    limitations on assessment.

A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amounts of
    unrecognized tax benefits is as follows:

All of the unrecognized tax benefits at December 31, 2009

The Company files tax returns in the various tax jurisdictions
    in which it operates. The 2005 US tax year closed in 2009 upon
    the expiration of the statute of limitations on assessment. US
    tax returns have been filed timely. The Company has not received
    notice that the IRS will be conducting an audit of the open
    years. The Company has not extended the federal statute of
    limitations for assessment in the US.

All UK tax returns have been filed timely and are in the normal
    process of being reviewed, with HM Revenue & Customs
    making enquiries to obtain additional information. There are no
    material ongoing enquiries in relation to filed UK returns other
    than in relation to the quantification of foreign tax reliefs
    available on the remittance of foreign earnings.

ACQUISITION
    OF HILB ROGAL & HOBBS COMPANY

On October 1, 2008, Willis completed the acquisition of HRH
    in a transaction involving both cash and stock consideration.
    The acquisition was effected by merging Willis HRH Inc, an
    indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Willis Group Holdings, with
    and into HRH.

The acquisition of HRH was accounted for using the purchase
    method. Under the purchase method of accounting, the assets and
    liabilities of HRH were recorded at their fair values at the
    acquisition date. The financial statements and reported results
    of the operations of Willis after the completion of the
    acquisition reflect these fair values. The results of HRH are
    included within the consolidated statement of operations from
    October 1, 2008.

Purchase
    price allocation

Willis’ cost of acquiring HRH of $1.8 billion was
    allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed
    according to their estimated fair values at the date of
    acquisition. By September 30, 2009, being one year from the
    acquisition date, the Company finalized the purchase price
    allocation, resulting in an additional net $20 million of
    goodwill being recognized over the preliminary allocation made.

The following table presents the Company’s final allocation
    of the purchase price to the assets acquired and liabilities
    assumed, based on their fair values:

The acquired intangible assets were attributable to the

    cashflows

(i)(ii)

$



Non-compete agreements

(i)

After 5 years
    $320 million will have been amortized on a cumulative
    basis; after 10 years $486 million; and after
    15 years $582 million.

(ii)

As a result of the Company
    finalizing the purchase price allocation, an additional
    $12 million was recognized in the Customer Relationships
    intangible asset.

Customer relationships were identified as the key intangible
    asset as approximately 95 percent of HRH’s revenue was
    historically generated by existing customer relationships. The
    fair value of customer relationships was estimated using the
    discounted cash flow income approach. This involved calculating
    the present value of future cash flows arising from customer
    relationships existing at the acquisition date.

Non-compete agreements were also valued by estimating the
    present value of the cashflows protected by the non-compete
    arrangement over their expected enforcement period.

Trade names were valued using the relief from royalty method,
    whereby the fair value of the trademark was estimated as the
    present value of the after tax royalty income stream that could
    be derived by licensing out the trade names.

Following the successful integration of HRH into the
    Company’s North America operations, it was announced on
    October 1, 2009 that the North America retail operations
    would change their operating name from Willis HRH to Willis
    North America. Consequently, the intangible asset recognized on
    the acquisition of HRH relating to the HRH brand has been fully
    amortized.

The weighted average amortization period for the acquired
    intangible assets is 18.7 years.

Goodwill

The total amount of goodwill recognized on the purchase of HRH
    is $1.6 billion of which $70 million is attributable
    to the Company’s Global operations and the remainder is
    attributable to our North America operations.

Among the assets and liabilities acquired is tax deductible
    goodwill in HRH of $325 million that arose in a previous
    business combination by HRH. The tax basis in this historical
    goodwill of HRH continues to have tax basis after the
    acquisition of HRH by Willis, and will continue to be amortized
    for tax purposes. At the transaction date there is no temporary
    difference relating to the historical tax deductible goodwill,
    and therefore no deferred taxes. A temporary difference will
    arise in future periods as the tax deductible goodwill is
    amortized for tax purposes. Goodwill arising on the transaction
    above the historical HRH goodwill is not deductible for tax
    purposes and will not generate a temporary difference currently
    or in the future.

term
    loan facility drawn down for the purpose of financing the

(ii)

An adjustment to eliminate the interest expense in HRH on

(iii)

Elimination of amortization of intangible assets and impairment
    of goodwill previously recognized by HRH.

(iv)

An adjustment to increase amortization expense based on the
    estimated fair value of identifiable intangible assets from the
    purchase price allocation, which are being amortized over their
    estimated useful lives over a range of 2 to 20 years, of
    $80 million and $83 million for the year to
    December 31, 2008 and 2007.

(v)

An adjustment to the weighted average number of shares used in
    the pro forma EPS calculation to reflect the issuance of
    24.4 million new shares on October 1, 2008 as if it
    took place on January 1, 2007.

(vi)

The above adjustments have been tax effected where appropriate
    at a rate of 40%.

The pro forma information is presented for informational
    purposes only and is not necessarily indicative of the results
    of operations that actually would have been achieved as of that
    time, nor is it intended to be indicative of future results.

Integration
    Costs

Once the proposed acquisition of HRH was announced, the Company
    worked with HRH management to develop a plan to integrate HRH
    and its existing North America operations. This plan was
    substantially complete at the time of the acquisition. The plan
    sought to centralize HRH’s dispersed back office processes
    and integrate these with Willis’ existing service hubs and
    to close down HRH’s Richmond Head Office. The plan also
    identified locations where office space was duplicated or could
    be rationalized. In implementing the integration plan, the
    Company has incurred $23 million of predominantly severance
    expenses and vacant space provisions relating to HRH staff and
    premises. This has been recognized as a liability assumed in the
    purchase business combination within accounts payable and
    accrued expenses.

FIDUCIARY
    FUNDS — RESTRICTED AND SHORT-TERM
    INVESTMENTS

The Company’s fiduciary funds — restricted and
    short-term investments consist mainly of cash and time deposits.
    Accrued interest on investments is recorded as other assets.

Debt securities are classified as

available-for-sale.

Accordingly, they are recorded at fair market value with
    unrealized holding gains and losses reported, net of tax, as a
    component of other comprehensive income. As of December 31,
    2009 and 2008, the amortized cost of such securities
    approximated fair value.

Realized gains and losses, net of tax, on debt securities are
    included in net income. During the years ended December 31,
    2009, 2008 and 2007, sales of debt securities totaled
    $21 million, $15 million and $19 million,
    respectively, on which realized gains and losses were not
    material to the consolidated results of the Company. Fiduciary
    funds — restricted, consisting primarily of time
    deposits with original maturities of less than or equal to three
    months, were $1,683 million as of December 31, 2009
    (2008: $1,854 million).

Consolidation
    of fiduciary funds

The financial statements for the years ended December 31,
    2009 and 2008 reflect the consolidation of one Variable Interest
    Entity (‘VIE’), a UK non-statutory trust that was
    established in January 2005 following the introduction of
    statutory regulation of insurance in the UK by the Financial
    Services Authority. The regulation requires that all fiduciary
    funds collected by an insurance broker such as the Company be
    paid into a non-statutory trust designed to give additional
    credit protection to the clients and insurance carriers of the
    Company. This trust restricts the financial instruments in which
    such funds may be invested and affects the timing of
    transferring commission from fiduciary funds to own funds.

As of December 31, 2009, the fair value of the assets in
    the VIE was approximately $903 million (2008:
    $931 million) and the fair value of the associated
    liabilities was approximately $903 million (2008:
    $931 million). There are no assets of the Company that
    serve as collateral for the VIE.

GOODWILL

Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of businesses
    acquired over the fair market value of identifiable net assets
    at the dates of acquisition. Goodwill is not amortized but is
    subject to impairment testing annually and whenever facts or
    circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be
    recoverable. As part of the evaluation the estimated future
    discounted cash flows associated with the underlying business
    operation are compared to the carrying amount of goodwill to
    determine if a write-down is required. If such an assessment
    indicates that the discounted future cash flows are not
    sufficient, the carrying amount is reduced to the estimated fair
    value.

The Company’s annual goodwill impairment tests for 2009 and
    prior years, have not resulted in an impairment charge.

When a business entity is sold, goodwill is allocated to the
    disposed entity based on the fair value of that entity compared
    to the fair value of the reporting unit in which it is included.

The changes in the carrying amount of goodwill by operating
    segment for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008 are

INVESTMENTS
    IN ASSOCIATES

The Company holds a number of investments which it accounts for
    using the equity method. The Company’s approximate interest
    in the outstanding stock of the more significant associates is
    as follows:

December 31,

Country



Al-Futtaim Willis Co. L.L.C.

Dubai

49%

49%

GS & Cie Groupe

France

31%

48%

The Company’s principal investment as of December 31,
    2009 and 2008 is GS & Cie Groupe (‘Gras
    Savoye’), France’s leading insurance broker.

The Company’s original investment in Gras Savoye was made
    in 1997, when it acquired a 33 percent ownership interest.
    Between 1997 and December 2009 this interest was increased by a
    series of incremental investments to 49 percent.

On December 17, 2009, the Company completed a leveraged
    transaction with the original family shareholders of Gras Savoye
    and Astorg Partners, a private equity fund, to reorganize the
    capital of Gras Savoye (‘December 2009 leveraged
    transaction’). The Company, the original family
    shareholders and Astorg now own equal stakes of 31 percent
    in Gras Savoye and have equal representation of one third of the
    voting rights on its board. The remaining shareholding is held
    by a large pool of Gras Savoye managers and minority
    shareholders.

A put option that was in place prior to the December 2009
    leveraged transaction, and which could have increased the
    Company’s interest to 90 percent, has been canceled
    and the Company now has a new call option to purchase
    100 percent of the capital of Gras Savoye. If the Company
    does not waive the new call option before April 30, 2014,
    then it must exercise the new call option in 2015 or the other
    shareholders may initiate procedures to sell Gras Savoye. Except
    with the unanimous consent of the supervisory board and other
    customary exceptions, the parties are prohibited from
    transferring any shares of Gras Savoye until 2015. At the end of
    this period, shareholders are entitled to pre-emptive and
    tag-along rights.

As a result of the December 2009 leveraged transaction the
    Company recognized a gain of $10 million in the
    consolidated statement of operations from the reduction of its
    interest in Gras Savoye from 49 percent to 31 percent.
    The Company received total proceeds of $281 million,
    comprising cash and interest bearing vendor loans and
    convertible bonds issued by Gras Savoye. See
    Note 6 — Net Gain on Disposal of Operations for
    an analysis of the proceeds and the calculation of the gain.

The carrying amount of the Gras Savoye investment as of
    December 31, 2009 includes goodwill of $94 million
    (2008: $141 million) and interest bearing vendor loans and
    convertible bonds issued by Gras Savoye of $45 million and
    $75 million respectively.

As of December 31, 2009 and 2008, the Company’s other
    investments in associates, individually and in the aggregate,
    were not material to the Company’s operations.

PENSION
    PLANS

The Company maintains two principal defined benefit pension
    plans that cover the majority of our employees in the United
    States and United Kingdom. Both of these plans are now closed to
    new entrants. New entrants in the United Kingdom are offered the
    opportunity to join a defined contribution plan and in the
    United States are offered the opportunity to join a 401(k) plan.
    In addition to the Company’s UK and US defined benefit
    pension plans, the Company has several smaller defined benefit
    pension plans in certain other countries in which it operates.
    Elsewhere, pension benefits are typically provided through
    defined contribution plans. It is the Company’s policy to
    fund pension costs as required by applicable laws and
    regulations.

At December 31, 2009, the Company recorded, on the
    Consolidated Balance Sheets:

•

a pension benefit asset of $69 million (2008:
    $111 million) in respect of the UK defined benefit pension
    plan; and

•

a total liability for pension benefits of $187 million
    (2008: $237 million) representing:

•

$157 million (2008: $208 million) in respect of the US
    defined benefit pension plan; and

•

$30 million (2008: $29 million) in respect of the
    International defined benefit pension plans.

2009 US Pension Benefits figure
    includes $4 million due to curtailment.

During 2009, the Group moved to a salary sacrifice arrangement.
    The impact of this on the pensions charge is to reduce employee
    contributions (by $8 million in 2009) and increase
    employer service cost and employer contributions by the same
    amount. There is a corresponding reduction in salaries and
    benefits expenses.

The estimated net loss and prior service cost for the UK and US
    defined benefit plans that will be amortized from accumulated
    other comprehensive loss into net periodic benefit cost over the
    next fiscal year are:

    are UK and foreign equities (59 percent), debt securities
    (20 percent), hedge funds (16 percent) and real estate
    (5 percent). The US plan’s assets are currently
    invested in 17 funds representing most standard equity and debt

Fair
    Value Hierarchy

The fair value hierarchy has three levels based on the
    reliability of the inputs used to determine fair value:

•

Level 1: refers to fair values determined based on quoted
    market prices in active markets for identical assets;

•

Level 2: refers to fair values estimated using observable
    market based inputs or unobservable inputs that are corroborated
    by market data; and

•

Level 3: includes fair values estimated using unobservable
    inputs that are not corroborated by market data.

The following tables present, at December 31, 2009, for

The UK plan’s real estate investment comprises UK property

    market based comparable data. The UK plan’s hedge fund
    investments are primarily invested in various ‘fund of
    funds’ and are valued based on net asset values calculated
    by the fund and are not publicly available. Liquidity is
    typically monthly and is subject to liquidity of the underlying
    funds.

As a result of the inherent limitations related to the
    valuations of the Level 3 investments, due to the
    unobservable inputs of the underlying funds, the estimated fair

In 2010, the Company expects to contribute $92 million to

    sacrifice contributions, and $30 million to the US plan.

2015-2019



Effective May 15, 2009, the Company closed the US defined
    benefit plan to future accrual. Consequently, a curtailment gain
    of $12 million was recognized during the year ended
    December 31, 2009.

Willis North America has a 401(k) plan covering all eligible
    employees of Willis North America and its subsidiaries. The plan
    allows participants to make pre-tax contributions which the
    Company, at its discretion may match. During 2009, the Company
    has decided not to make any matching contributions other than
    for former HRH employees whose contributions were matched up to
    75 percent under the terms of the acquisition. All
    investment assets of the plan are held in a trust account
    administered by independent trustees. The Company’s 401(k)
    matching contributions for 2009 were $5 million (2008:
    $8 million; 2007: $6 million).

International
    defined benefit pension plans

In addition to the Company’s UK and US defined benefit
    pension plans, the Company has several smaller defined benefit
    pension plans in certain other countries in which it operates.
    Prior to 2008, management determined that these international
    plans were not material to the Company’s results of
    operations, financial condition or liquidity: as at
    December 31, 2007 the net pension liability in respect of
    these schemes was $2 million. Consequently such plans were
    not included in the Company’s pension plan disclosures,
    prior to 2008.

However, as a result of the turmoil in worldwide equity markets
    in the latter half of 2008 and consequent declines in pension
    plan asset values, the Company now provides pension plan
    disclosures for these schemes. A $30 million pension
    benefit liability (2008: $29 million) has been recognized
    in respect of these schemes.

Debt
    issuances in 2009

In March 2009, the Company issued 12.875% senior notes due
    2016 in an aggregate principal amount of $500 million to
    Goldman Sachs Mezzanine Partners which generated net proceeds of
    $482 million. These proceeds were used to refinance part of
    the interim credit facility.

In September 2009, the Company issued $300 million of
    7.0% senior notes due 2019. A tender offer was launched on
    September 22, 2009, to repurchase any and all of the
    $250 million 5.125% senior notes due July 2010 at a
    premium of $27.50 per $1,000 face value. Notes totaling
    approximately $160 million were tendered and repurchased.

The agreement relating to the 12.875% senior notes contains a
    requirement to maintain maximum levels of consolidated funded
    indebtedness in relation to consolidated EBITDA, subject to
    certain adjustments.  In addition, the agreement includes
    covenants relating to the delivery of financial statements,
    reports and notices, limitations on liens, limitations on sales
    and other disposals of assets, limitations on indebtedness and
    other liabilities, limitations on sale and leaseback
    transactions, limitations on mergers and other fundamental

Debt
    issuances in 2008

On October 1, 2008, the Company funded the HRH acquisition
    with $1 billion from an interim credit facility and
    $525 million from a $700 million

5-year

term
    loan facility. In addition, the Company repaid the outstanding
    balance on its existing revolving credit facility and replaced
    this with a new $300 million revolving credit facility.
    During fourth quarter 2008, the Company repaid $250 million
    of the interim credit facility and drew down the
    $175 million balance under the

5-year

term
    loan.

The $1 billion interim credit facility bore interest at
    LIBOR plus 2.250% and was repayable on September 30, 2009.
    The interim credit facility was fully paid down by June 2009
    using proceeds from further debt issuances, together with cash
    generated from operating activities during 2009.

The agreements relating to the senior credit facilities and
    revolving credit facility contain numerous operating and
    financial covenants, including requirements to maintain minimum
    ratios of consolidated adjusted EBITDA to consolidated fixed
    charges and maximum levels of consolidated funded indebtedness
    in relation to consolidated EBITDA, in each case subject to
    certain adjustments.

In addition, the credit agreements include covenants relating to
    the delivery of financial statements, reports and notices,
    limitations on liens, limitations on sales and other disposals
    of assets, limitations on indebtedness and other liabilities,
    limitations on sale and leaseback transactions, limitations on

Put
    and Call Options Relating to Subsidiaries and
    Associates

For certain subsidiaries and associates, the Company has the
    right to purchase shares (a call option) from co-shareholders at
    various dates in the future. In addition, the co-shareholders of
    certain subsidiaries and associates have the right to sell (a
    put option) their shares to the Company at various dates in the
    future. Generally, the exercise price of such put options and
    call options is formula-based (using revenues and earnings) and
    is designed to reflect fair value. Based on current projections
    of profitability and exchange rates, the potential amount
    payable from these options is not expected to exceed
    $49 million (2008: $434 million).

Claims,

    insurance and reinsurance in the ordinary course of business.
    Similar to other corporations, the Company is also subject to a
    variety of other claims, including those relating to the
    Company’s employment practices. Some of the claims,
    lawsuits and other proceedings seek damages in amounts which
    could, if assessed, be significant.

Errors and omissions claims, lawsuits and other proceedings
    arising in the ordinary course of business are covered in part
    by professional indemnity or other appropriate insurance. The
    terms of this insurance vary by policy year and self-insured
    risks have increased significantly in recent years. In respect
    of self-insured risks, the Company has established provisions
    which are believed to be adequate in the light of current
    information and legal advice, and the Company adjusts such
    provisions from time to time according to developments.

On the basis of current information, the Company does not expect
    that the actual claims, lawsuits and other proceedings, to which
    the Company is subject, or potential claims, lawsuits and other
    proceedings relating to matters of which it is aware will
    ultimately have a material adverse effect on the Company’s
    financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.
    Nonetheless, given the large or indeterminate amounts sought in
    certain of these actions, and the inherent unpredictability of
    litigation and disputes with insurance companies, it is possible
    that an adverse outcome in certain matters could, from time to
    time, have a material adverse effect on the Company’s
    results of operations or cash flows in particular quarterly or
    annual periods.

The material actual or potential claims, lawsuits and other
    proceedings, of which the Company is currently aware, are:

Inquiries
    and Investigations

In connection with the investigation commenced by the New York
    State Attorney General in April 2004 concerning, among other
    things, contingent commissions paid by insurers to insurance
    brokers, in April 2005, the Company entered into an Assurance of
    Discontinuance (‘NY AOD’) with the New York State
    Attorney General and the Superintendent of the New York
    Insurance Department and paid $50 million to eligible
    customers. As part of the NY AOD, the Company also agreed not to
    accept contingent compensation and to disclose to customers any
    compensation the Company will receive in connection with
    providing policy placement services to the customer. The Company
    also resolved similar investigations commenced by the Minnesota
    Attorney General, the Florida Attorney General, the Florida
    Department of Financial Services and the Florida Office of
    Insurance Regulation for amounts that were not material to the
    Company. Similarly, in August 2005 HRH entered into an agreement
    with the Attorney General of the State of Connecticut (the
    ‘CT Attorney General’) and the Insurance Commissioner
    of the State of Connecticut to resolve all issues related to
    their investigations into certain insurance brokerage and
    insurance agency practices and to settle a lawsuit brought in
    August 2005 by the CT Attorney General alleging violations of
    the Connecticut Unfair Trade Practices Act and the Connecticut
    Unfair Insurance Practices Act. As part of this settlement, HRH
    agreed to take certain actions including establishing a
    $30 million national fund for distribution to certain
    clients,

enhancing disclosure practices for agency and broker clients,
    and declining contingent compensation on brokerage business. The
    Company has co-operated fully with other similar investigations
    by the regulators

and/or

attorneys general of other jurisdictions, some of which have
    been concluded with no indication of any finding of wrongdoing.

On February 16, 2010, Willis Group Holdings entered into
    the Amended and Restated Assurance of Discontinuance with the
    Attorney General of the State of New York and the Amended and
    Restated Stipulation with the Superintendent of Insurance of the
    State of New York (the ‘Amended and Restated AOD’) on
    behalf of itself and its subsidiaries named therein
    (‘Willis’). The Amended and Restated AOD is effective
    February 11, 2010 and supersedes and replaces the Assurance
    of Discontinuance with the Attorney General of the State of New
    York, dated April 7, 2005, and the Stipulation with the
    Superintendent of Insurance of the State of New York, dated
    April 8, 2005, each as amended from time to time
    (collectively, the ‘AOD’).

The Amended and Restated AOD specifically recognizes that Willis
    has substantially met its obligations under the AOD and ends
    many of the requirements previously imposed. It relieves Willis
    of a number of technical compliance obligations that have
    imposed significant administrative and financial burdens on its
    operations. The Amended and Restated AOD no longer limits the
    types of compensation Willis can receive and has lowered the
    compensation disclosure requirements to clients that the AOD
    originally imposed.

The Amended and Restated AOD requires Willis to: (i) in New
    York, and each of the other 49 states of the United States,
    the District of Columbia and U.S. territories, provide
    compensation disclosure that will, at a minimum, comply with the
    terms of 11 NYCCR 30 (adopted on February 10, 2010), as may
    be amended from time to time, or the provisions of the AOD that
    existed prior to the adoption of the Amended and Restated AOD;
    and (ii) maintain its compliance programs and continue to
    provide appropriate training to relevant employees in business
    ethics, professional obligations, conflicts of interest and
    antitrust and trade practices compliance. In addition, in
    placing, renewing, consulting on or servicing any insurance
    policy, it prohibits Willis from directly or indirectly
    (a) accepting from or requesting of any insurer any promise
    or commitment to use any of Willis’s brokerage, agency,
    producing or consulting services in exchange for production of
    business to such insurer or (b) knowingly place, renew or
    consult on or service a client’s insurance business through
    a wholesale broker in a manner that is contrary to the
    client’s best interest.

In 2006, the European Commission issued questionnaires pursuant
    to its Sector Inquiry or, in respect of Norway, the European
    Free Trade Association Surveillance Authority, related to
    insurance business practices, including compensation
    arrangements for brokers, to at least 150 European brokers
    including our operations in nine European countries. The Company
    responded to the European Commission questionnaires and has
    filed responses with the European Free Trade Association
    Surveillance Authority for two of its Norwegian entities. The
    European Commission reported on a final basis on
    September 25, 2007, expressing concerns over potential
    conflicts of interest in the industry relating to remuneration
    and binding authorities when assuming a dual role for clients
    and insurers and also over the nature of the coinsurance market.
    The Company continues to co-operate with both the European
    Commission and the European Free Trade Association Surveillance
    Authority.

Since August 2004, the Company and HRH (along with various other
    brokers and insurers) have been named as defendants in purported
    class actions in various courts across the United States. All of
    these actions have been consolidated into a single action in the
    US District Court for the District of New Jersey
    (‘MDL’). There are two amended complaints within the
    MDL, one that addresses employee benefits (‘EB
    Complaint’) and one that addresses all other lines of
    insurance (‘Commercial Complaint’). HRH was a named
    defendant in the EB Complaint, but has since been voluntarily
    dismissed. HRH is a named defendant in the Commercial Complaint.
    The Company is a named defendant in both MDL complaints. Each of
    the EB Complaint and the Commercial Complaint seeks monetary
    damages, including punitive damages, and equitable relief and
    makes

allegations regarding the practices and conduct that have been
    the subject of the investigation of state attorneys general and
    insurance commissioners, including allegations that the brokers
    have breached their duties to their clients by entering into
    contingent compensation agreements with either no disclosure or
    limited disclosure to clients and participated in other improper
    activities. The complaints also allege the existence of a
    conspiracy among insurance carriers and brokers and allege
    violations of federal antitrust laws, the federal Racketeer
    Influenced and Corrupt Organizations (‘RICO’) statute
    and the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974
    (‘ERISA’). In separate decisions issued in August and
    September 2007, the antitrust and RICO Act claims were dismissed
    with prejudice and the state claims were dismissed without
    prejudice from the Commercial Complaint. In January 2008, the
    Judge dismissed the ERISA claims with prejudice from the EB
    Complaint and the state law claims without prejudice. Plaintiffs
    filed a notice of appeal regarding the dismissal of the
    antitrust and RICO claims and oral arguments on this appeal were
    heard in April 2009 but there is no indication when a ruling
    will be issued. Additional actions could be brought in the
    future by individual policyholders. The Company disputes the
    allegations in all of these suits and has been and intends to
    continue to defend itself vigorously against these actions. The
    outcomes of these lawsuits, however, including any losses or
    other payments that may occur as a result, cannot be predicted
    at this time.

Reinsurance
    Market Dispute

Various legal proceedings are pending, have concluded or may
    commence between reinsurers, reinsureds and in some cases their
    intermediaries, including reinsurance brokers, relating to
    personal accident excess of loss reinsurance for the years 1993
    to 1998. The proceedings principally concern allegations by
    reinsurers that they have sustained substantial losses due to an
    alleged abnormal ‘spiral’ in the market in which the
    reinsurance contracts were placed, the existence and nature of
    which, as well as other information, was not disclosed to them
    by the reinsureds or their reinsurance broker. A
    ‘spiral’ is a market term for a situation in which
    reinsureds and reinsurers reinsure each other with the effect
    that the same loss or portion of that loss moves through the
    market multiple times.

The reinsurers concerned have taken the position that, despite
    their decisions to underwrite risks or a group of risks, they
    are no longer bound by their reinsurance contracts. As a result,
    they have stopped settling claims and are seeking to recover
    claims already paid. The Company also understands that there
    have been at least two arbitration awards in relation to a
    ‘spiral’, among other things, in which the reinsurer
    successfully argued that it was no longer bound by parts of its
    reinsurance program. Willis Limited, the Company’s
    principal insurance brokerage subsidiary in the United Kingdom,
    acted as the reinsurance broker or otherwise as intermediary,
    but not as an underwriter, for numerous personal accident
    reinsurance contracts, including two contracts that were
    involved in one of the arbitrations. Due to the small number of
    reinsurance brokers generally, Willis Limited also utilized
    other brokers active in this market as

sub-agents,

including brokers who are parties to the legal proceedings
    described above, for certain contracts and may be responsible
    for any errors and omissions they may have made. In July 2003,
    one of the reinsurers received a judgment in the English High
    Court against certain parties, including a

sub-broker

Willis Limited used to place two of the contracts involved in
    this trial. Although neither the Company nor any of its
    subsidiaries were a party to this proceeding or any arbitration,
    Willis Limited entered into tolling agreements with certain of
    the principals to the reinsurance contracts tolling the statute
    of limitations pending the outcome of proceedings between the
    reinsureds and reinsurers.

Two former clients of Willis Limited, American Reliable
    Insurance Company and one of its associated companies
    (collectively, ‘ARIC’), and CNA Insurance Company
    Limited and two of its associated companies (‘CNA’)
    terminated their respective tolling agreements with Willis
    Limited and commenced litigation in September 2007 and January
    2008, respectively, in the English Commercial Court against
    Willis Limited. ARIC alleged conspiracy between a former Willis
    Limited employee and the ARIC underwriter as well as negligence
    and CNA alleged deceit and negligence by the same Willis Limited
    employee both in connection

with placements of personal accident reinsurance in the excess
    of loss market in London and elsewhere. ARIC asserted a claim of
    approximately $257 million (plus unspecified interest and
    costs). On June 9, 2009, Willis Limited entered into a
    settlement agreement with American Reliable Insurance Company
    and Assurant General Insurance Limited pursuant to which Willis
    Limited agreed to pay a total of $139 million to ARIC in
    two installments. All installments have been paid by the
    Company. Each party has also released and waived all claims it
    may have against any of the other parties arising out of or in
    connection with the subject matter of the litigation. The
    settlement includes no admission of wrongdoing by any party. The
    $139 million required to fund the settlement agreement was
    covered by errors and omissions insurance.

On September 11, 2009, Willis Limited, entered into a
    settlement agreement with CNA, subsidiaries of CNA Financial
    Corporation. Pursuant to the settlement agreement, Willis
    Limited has agreed to pay a total of $130 million to CNA in
    two installments. The first installment of $60 million was
    paid on October 9, 2009 and the second installment of
    $70 million was paid on December 23, 2009. Each party
    has also released and waived all claims it may have against any
    of the other parties arising out of or in connection with the
    subject-matter of the litigation. The settlement includes no
    admission of wrongdoing by any party. The Company has partially
    collected and believes it will collect in full the
    $130 million required to fund the settlement agreement from
    errors and omissions insurers.

Various arbitrations relating to reinsurance continue to be
    active and from time to time the principals request co-operation
    from the Company and suggest that claims may be asserted against
    the Company. Such claims may be made against the Company if
    reinsurers do not pay claims on policies issued by them. The
    Company cannot predict at this time whether any such claims will
    be made or the damages that may be alleged.

Gender
    Discrimination Class Action

In March 2008, the Company settled an action in the United
    States District Court for the Southern District of New York
    commenced against the Company in 2001 on behalf of an alleged
    nationwide class of present and former female officer and
    officer equivalent employees alleging that the Company
    discriminated against them on the basis of their gender and
    seeking injunctive relief, money damages, attorneys’ fees
    and costs. Although the Court had denied plaintiffs’
    motions to certify a nationwide class or to grant nationwide
    discovery, it did certify a class of approximately 200 female
    officers and officer equivalent employees based in the
    Company’s offices in New York, New Jersey and
    Massachusetts. The settlement agreement provides for injunctive
    relief and a monetary payment, including the amount of attorney
    fees plaintiffs’ counsel are entitled to receive, which was
    not material to the Company. In December 2006, a former female
    employee, whose motion to intervene in the class action was
    denied, filed a purported class action in the United States
    District Court, Southern District of New York, with almost
    identical allegations as those contained in the suit that was
    settled in 2008, except seeking a class period of 1998 to the
    time of trial (the class period in the settled suit was 1998 to
    the end of 2001). The Company’s motion to dismiss this suit
    was denied and the Court did not grant the Company permission to
    immediately file an appeal from the denial of its motion to
    dismiss. The parties are in the discovery phase of the
    litigation. The suit was amended to include one additional
    plaintiff and another has filed an arbitration demand that
    includes a class allegation. The Court has decided that, to the
    extent a class is ever certified, the class period will end at
    the end of 2007 and not up to the time of trial as plaintiffs
    had sought. The Company cannot predict at this time what, if
    any, damages might result from this action.

World
    Trade Center

The Company acted as the insurance broker, but not as an
    underwriter, for the placement of both property and casualty
    insurance for a number of entities which were directly impacted
    by the September 11, 2001, destruction of the World Trade
    Center complex, including Silverstein Properties LLC, which
    acquired a

99-year

leasehold interest in the twin towers and related facilities
    from the Port Authority of New York and

New Jersey in July 2001. Although the World Trade Center complex
    insurance was bound at or before the July 2001 closing of the
    leasehold acquisition, consistent with standard industry
    practice, the final policy wording for the placements was still
    in the process of being finalized when the twin towers and other
    buildings in the complex were destroyed on September 11,
    2001. There have been a number of lawsuits in the United States
    between the insured parties and the insurers for several
    placements and other disputes may arise in respect of insurance
    placed by us which could affect the Company including claims by
    one or more of the insureds that the Company made culpable
    errors or omissions in connection with our brokerage activities.
    However, the Company does not believe that our role as broker
    will lead to liabilities which in the aggregate would have a
    material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial
    condition or liquidity.

Stanford
    Financial Group

On July 2, 2009, a putative class action complaint,
    captioned

Troice, et al. v. Willis of Colorado, Inc., et
    al.

, C.A.

No. 3:09-CV-01274-N,

was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern
    District of Texas against Willis Group Holdings, Willis of
    Colorado, Inc. and a Willis associate, among others, relating to
    the collapse of The Stanford Financial Group
    (“Stanford”), for which Willis of Colorado, Inc. acted
    as broker of record on certain lines of insurance. The complaint
    generally alleged that the defendants actively and materially
    aided Stanford’s alleged fraud by providing Stanford with
    certain letters regarding coverage that they knew would be used
    to help retain or attract actual or prospective Stanford client
    investors. The complaint alleged that these letters, which
    contain statements about Stanford and the insurance policies
    that the defendants placed for Stanford, contained untruths and
    omitted material facts and were drafted in this manner to help
    Stanford promote and sell its allegedly fraudulent certificates
    of deposit. The putative class consisted of Stanford investors
    in Mexico and the complaint asserted various claims under Texas
    statutory and common law and sought actual damages in excess of
    $1 billion, punitive damages and costs. On August 12,
    2009, the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint, which,
    notwithstanding the addition of certain factual allegations and
    Texas common law claims, largely mirrored the original and
    sought the same relief.

On July 17, 2009, a putative class action complaint,
    captioned

Ranni v. Willis of Colorado, Inc., et al.

,
    C.A.

No. 09-22085,

was filed against Willis Group Holdings and Willis of Colorado,
    Inc. in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District
    of Florida, relating to the same alleged course of conduct as
    the Troice complaint described above. Based on substantially the
    same allegations as the Troice complaint, but on behalf of a
    putative class of Venezuelan and other South American Stanford
    investors, the Ranni complaint asserts a claim under
    Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and

Rule 10b-5

thereunder, as well as various claims under Florida statutory
    and common law, and seeks damages in an amount to be determined
    at trial and costs.

On or about July 24, 2009, a motion was filed by certain
    individuals (collectively, the “Movants”) with the
    U.S. Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation (the
    “JPML”) to consolidate and coordinate in the Northern
    District of Texas nine separate putative class
    actions — including the Troice and Ranni actions
    described above, as well as other actions against various
    Stanford-related entities and individuals and the Commonwealth
    of Antigua and Barbuda — relating to Stanford and its
    allegedly fraudulent certificates of deposit.

On August 6, 2009, a putative class action complaint,
    captioned

Canabal, et al. v. Willis of Colorado, Inc.,

No. 3:09-CV-01474-D,

was filed against Willis Group Holdings, Willis of Colorado,
    Inc. and the same Willis associate, among others, also in the
    Northern District of Texas, relating to the same alleged course
    of conduct as the Troice complaint described above. Based on
    substantially the same allegations as the Troice complaint, but
    on behalf of a putative class of Venezuelan investors, the
    Canabal complaint asserted various claims under Texas statutory
    and common law and sought actual damages in excess of
    $1 billion, punitive damages, attorneys’ fees and
    costs.

On or about August 10, 2009, the Movants filed with the
    JPML a Notice of Related Action that referred the Canabal action
    to the JPML. On October 6, 2009, the JPML ruled on the
    transfer motion, transferring seven of the subject actions
    (including the Troice and Ranni actions) — i.e., the
    original nine actions minus two that had since been
    dismissed — for consolidation or coordination in the
    Northern District of Texas. On October 27, 2009, the
    parties to the Canabal action stipulated to the designation of
    that action as an “xyz case” properly part of the new
    Stanford MDL proceeding in the Northern District of Texas.

On September 14, 2009, a complaint, captioned

Rupert, et
    al. v. Winter, et al., Case No. 2009C115137

, was
    filed on behalf of 97 Stanford investors against Willis Group
    Holdings, Willis of Colorado, Inc. and the same Willis
    associate, among others, in Texas state court (Bexar County).
    Based on substantially the same allegations as the Troice
    complaint, the Rupert complaint asserts claims under the
    Securities Act of 1933, as well as various Texas statutory and
    common law claims, and seeks rescission, damages, special
    damages and consequential damages of $79.1 million, treble
    damages of $237.4 million under the Texas Insurance Code,
    attorneys’ fees and costs. On October 20, 2009,
    certain defendants, including Willis of Colorado, Inc.,
    (i) removed the Rupert action to the U.S. District
    Court for the Western District of Texas, (ii) notified the
    JPML of the pendency of this additional “tag-along”
    action and (iii) moved to stay the action pending a
    determination by the JPML as to whether it should be transferred
    to the Northern District of Texas for consolidation or
    coordination with the other Stanford-related actions. In
    November 2009, the JPML issued a conditional transfer order (the
    “CTO”) for the transfer of the Rupert action to the
    Northern District of Texas. On December 22, 2009, the
    plaintiffs filed a motion to vacate, or alternatively stay, the
    CTO, to which Willis of Colorado, Inc. responded on
    January 4, 2010. That motion is also currently pending. On
    December 18, 2009, the parties to the Troice and Canabal
    actions stipulated to the consolidation of those actions and, on
    December 31, 2009, the plaintiffs therein, collectively,
    filed a Second Amended Class Action Complaint, which
    largely mirrors the Troice and Canabal predecessor complaints,
    but seeks relief on behalf of a worldwide class of Stanford
    investors. Also on December 31, 2009, the plaintiffs in the
    Canabal action filed a Notice of Dismissal, dismissing the
    Canabal action without prejudice. On February 25, 2010, the
    defendants filed motions to dismiss the Second Amended
    Class Action Complaint in the consolidated Troice/Canabal
    action.

The defendants have not yet responded to the Ranni or Rupert
    complaints.

Additional actions could be brought in the future by other
    investors in certificates of deposit issued by Stanford and its
    affiliates. The Company disputes these allegations and intends
    to defend itself vigorously against these actions. The outcomes
    of these actions, however, including any losses or other
    payments that may occur as a result, cannot be predicted at this
    time.

SHARE
    BUYBACKS

The Company has in place a share buyback program for
    $1 billion. The program is an open-ended plan to repurchase
    the Company’s shares from time to time in the open market
    or through negotiated sales with persons who are not affiliates
    of the Company. In addition the board authorized in June 2008,
    the repurchase of up to the number of shares issued by the
    Company in connection with the acquisition of HRH.

No shares were repurchased by the Company during the year ended
    December 31, 2009 (year ended December 31, 2008, the
    Company repurchased 2.3 million shares for a total
    consideration of $75 million at an average price of
    $33.12). Repurchased shares were subsequently canceled. There
    was also a $1 million adjustment in 2008 relating to prior
    year price adjustments.

As at December 31, 2009, $925 million remains under
    the program for future repurchases.

Accelerated
    Share Repurchase Programs

During the year ended December 31, 2007, the Company
    completed the $150 million November 2006 accelerated share
    repurchase program and started and completed two further
    accelerated share repurchase programs, one for $50 million
    and one for $400 million.

FINANCIAL
    INSTRUMENTS

The Company’s principal financial instruments, other than
    derivatives, comprise the fixed rate senior notes, the

5-year

term
    loan, a revolving credit facility and cash deposits. The Company
    also enters into derivative transactions (principally interest
    rate swaps and forward foreign currency contracts) in order to
    manage interest rate and currency risks arising from the
    Company’s operations and its sources of finance. The
    Company does not hold financial or derivative instruments for
    trading purposes.

The main risks arising from the Company’s financial
    instruments are interest rate risk, liquidity risk, foreign
    currency risk and credit risk. The Company’s board of
    directors reviews and agrees policies for managing each of these
    risks as summarized below.

Interest
    Rate Risk

The Company’s operations are financed principally by
    $1,840 million fixed rate senior notes and
    $521 million under a

5-year

term
    loan facility. Of the fixed rate senior notes $90 million
    are due 2010, $350 million are due 2015, $500 million
    are due 2016, $600 million are due 2017 and
    $300 million are due 2019. The Company also has a

5-year

$300 million revolving credit facility which was undrawn as
    of December 31, 2009. All debt is issued by subsidiaries of
    the Company.

The interest rates applicable to the borrowings under the

5-year

term
    loan and the revolving credit facility vary according to LIBOR
    on the date of individual drawdowns.

As a result of the Company’s operating activities, the
    Company receives cash for premiums and claims which it deposits
    in short-term investments denominated in US dollars and other
    currencies. The Company earns interest on these funds, which is
    included in the Company’s financial statements as
    investment income. These funds are regulated in terms of access
    and the instruments in which they may be invested, most of which
    are short-term in maturity. In order to manage interest rate
    risk arising from these financial assets, the Company enters
    into interest rate swaps to receive a fixed rate of interest and
    pay a variable rate of interest fixed in the various currencies
    related to the short-term investments. The use of interest rate
    contracts essentially converts groups of short-term variable
    rate investments to fixed rates.

The fair value of these contracts is recorded in other assets
    and other liabilities. For contracts that qualify as accounting
    hedges, changes in fair value are recorded as a component of
    other comprehensive income.

Amounts are reclassified from other comprehensive income into
    earnings when the hedged exposure affects earnings. For
    contracts that do not qualify for hedge accounting, changes in
    fair value are recorded in other operating expenses.

Liquidity
    Risk

The Company’s objective is to ensure that it has the
    ability to generate sufficient cash either from internal or
    external sources, in a timely and cost-effective manner, to meet
    its commitments as they fall due. The Company’s management
    of liquidity risk is embedded within its overall risk management
    framework. Scenario analysis is continually undertaken to ensure
    that the Company’s resources can meet its liquidity
    requirements. These resources are supplemented by a
    $300 million revolving credit facility which expires on
    October 1, 2013, all of which was available to draw as at
    December 31, 2009.

Foreign
    Currency Risk

The Company’s primary foreign exchange risks arise:

•

from changes in the exchange rate between US dollars and pounds
    sterling as its London market operations earn the majority of
    their revenues in US dollars and incur expenses predominantly in
    pounds sterling, and may also hold a significant net sterling
    asset or liability position on the balance sheet. In addition,
    the London market operations earn significant revenues in euros
    and Japanese yen; and

•

from the translation into US dollars of the net income and net
    assets of its foreign subsidiaries, excluding the London market
    operations which are US dollar denominated.



WILLIS
    GROUP HOLDINGS PLC

NOTES TO
    THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

22.

FINANCIAL
    INSTRUMENTS (Continued)

The foreign exchange risks in its London market operations are
    hedged as follows:

•

To the extent that forecast pound sterling expenses exceed pound
    sterling revenues, the Company limits its exposure to this
    exchange rate risk by the use of forward contracts matched to
    specific, clearly identified cash outflows arising in the
    ordinary course of business;

•

To the extent the UK operations earn significant revenues in
    euros and Japanese yen, the Company limits its exposure to
    changes in the exchange rate between the US dollar and these
    currencies by the use of forward contracts matched to a
    percentage of forecast cash inflows in specific currencies and
    periods; and

•

To the extent that the net sterling asset or liability position
    in its London market operations relate to short-term cash flows,
    the Company limits its exposure by the use of forward purchases
    and sales. These forward purchases and sales are not effective
    hedges for accounting purposes.

The Company does not hedge net income earned within foreign
    subsidiaries outside of the UK.

The fair value of foreign currency contracts is recorded in
    other assets and other liabilities. For contracts that qualify
    as accounting hedges, changes in fair value resulting from
    movements in the spot exchange rate are recorded as a component
    of other comprehensive income whilst changes resulting from a
    movement in the time value are recorded in interest expense. For
    contracts that do not qualify for hedge accounting, the total
    change in fair value is recorded in interest expense. Amounts
    held in comprehensive income are reclassified into earnings when
    the hedged exposure affects earnings.

Credit
    Risk and Concentrations of Credit Risk

Credit risk represents the loss that would be recognized at the
    reporting date if counterparties failed to perform as contracted
    and from movements in interest rates and foreign exchange rates.
    The Company does not



WILLIS

FINANCIAL
    INSTRUMENTS (Continued)

anticipate non-performance by counterparties. The Company
    generally does not require collateral or other security to
    support financial instruments with credit risk; however, it is
    the Company’s policy to enter into master netting
    arrangements with counterparties as practical.

Concentrations of credit risk that arise from financial
    instruments exist for groups of customers or counterparties when
    they have similar economic characteristics that would cause
    their ability to meet contractual obligations to be similarly
    affected by changes in economic or other conditions. Financial
    instruments on the balance sheet that potentially subject the
    Company to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of
    cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable and derivatives
    which are recorded at fair value.

The Company maintains a policy providing for the diversification
    of cash and cash equivalent investments and places such
    investments in an extensive number of financial institutions to
    limit the amount of credit risk exposure. These financial
    institutions are monitored on an ongoing basis for credit
    quality predominantly using information provided by credit
    agencies.

Concentrations of credit risk with respect to receivables are
    limited due to the large number of clients and markets in which
    the Company does business, as well as the dispersion across many
    geographic areas. Management does not believe significant risk
    exists in connection with the Company’s concentrations of
    credit as of December 31, 2009.

The following methods and assumptions were used by the Company
    in estimating its fair value disclosure for financial
    instruments:

Cash and Cash Equivalents

— The estimated fair
    value of these financial instruments approximates their carrying
    values due to their short maturities.

Fiduciary Funds — Restricted and Short-Term
    Investments —

Fair values are based on quoted
    market values.

Long-Term Debt —

Fair values are based on
    quoted market values.

Derivative Financial Instruments —

Market
    values have been used to determine the fair value of interest
    rate swaps and forward foreign exchange contracts based on
    estimated amounts the Company would receive or have to pay to
    terminate the agreements, taking into account the current
    interest rate environment or current foreign currency forward
    rates.

SEGMENT
    INFORMATION

During the periods presented, the Company operated through three
    segments: Global; North America and International. Global
    provides specialist brokerage and consulting services to clients
    worldwide for specific industrial and commercial activities and
    is organized by specialism. North America and International
    predominantly comprise our retail operations which provide
    services to small, medium and major corporates, accessing
    Global’s specialist expertise when required.

The Company evaluates the performance of its operating segments
    based on organic revenue growth and operating income. For
    internal reporting and segmental reporting, the following items
    for which segmental management are not held accountable are
    excluded from segmental expenses:

i)

costs of the holding company;

ii)

foreign exchange hedging activities and foreign exchange
    movements on the UK pension plan asset or liability;

iii)

amortization of intangible assets;

iv)

gains and losses on the disposal of operations and major
    properties;

v)

significant legal and regulatory settlements which are managed
    centrally;

vi)

integration costs associated with the acquisition of HRH;

vii)

costs associated with the redomicile of the Company’s
    parent company from Bermuda to Ireland; and

viii)

2008 expense review costs.

The accounting policies of the operating segments are consistent
    with those described in Note 2 — Basis of
    Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies. There are no
    inter-segment revenues, with segments operating on a
    revenue-sharing basis equivalent to that used when sharing
    business with other third-party brokers.

In 2008, the Company changed its basis of segmental allocation
    for central costs. All accounting adjustments for foreign
    exchange hedging activities and foreign exchange movements on
    the UK pension plan asset or liability are held at the Corporate
    level.

    THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

    INFORMATION FOR PARENT GUARANTOR, OTHER GUARANTOR SUBSIDIARIES
    AND NON-GUARANTOR SUBSIDIARIES

In March 2009, Trinity Acquisition plc issued senior notes
    totaling $500 million in a private transaction
    (Note 17 — Debt). The debt securities are jointly
    and severally, irrevocably and fully and unconditionally
    guaranteed by Willis Group Holdings, Willis Netherlands Holdings
    B.V., Willis Investment UK Holdings Limited, TA I Limited, TA II
    Limited, TA III Limited, TA IV Limited, Willis Group Limited and
    Willis North America.

Willis Group Holdings was incorporated on September 24,
    2009 and as discussed in Note 2 replaced Willis-Bermuda as
    the ultimate parent company on December 31, 2009. Willis
    Netherlands Holdings B.V. was incorporated on November 27,
    2009.

This debt has not been registered with the Securities Exchange
    Commission. If and when registered, any necessary financial
    statements will be provided.

The Company filed a shelf registration on

Form S-3

under which Willis Group Holdings may offer debt securities,
    preferred stock, ordinary stock and other securities. In

As of December 31, 2009, the Company carried out an
    evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of
    the Company’s management, including the Chairman and Chief
    Executive Officer and the Group Chief Financial Officer, of the
    effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company’s

Based upon that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and the

    the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures as defined
    in

Rule 13a-15(e)

Management’s
    Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining
    adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in

Rule 13a-15(f)

under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

Under the supervision and with the participation of our
    management, including our principal executive officer and
    principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the
    effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting
    as of December 31, 2009, based on the criteria related to
    internal control over financial reporting described in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework

issued
    by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
    Commission. Based on our evaluation, management concluded that
    our internal control over financial reporting was effective as
    of December 31, 2009.

Our independent registered public accountants, Deloitte LLP, who
    have audited and reported on our

financial statements, have undertaken an assessment of the
    Company’s internal control over

financial reporting. Deloitte’s report is presented below.

February 26, 2010.



REPORT OF
    INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Willis Group
    Holdings Public Limited Company

Dublin, Ireland

We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of
    Willis Group Holdings Public Limited Company and subsidiaries
    (the ‘Company’) as of December 31, 2009, based on
    criteria established in

Internal Control —
    Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
    Organizations of the Treadway Commission. The Company’s
    management is responsible for maintaining effective internal
    control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the
    effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting,
    included in the accompanying Management’s Report on
    Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is
    to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control
    over financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control
    over financial reporting was maintained in all material
    respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of
    internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk
    that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the
    design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on
    the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we
    considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our
    audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
    process designed by, or under the supervision of, the
    company’s principal executive and principal financial
    officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected
    by the company’s board of directors, management, and other
    personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
    internal control over financial reporting includes those
    policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance
    of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
    reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
    company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions
    are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
    statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
    principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
    are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
    management and directors of the company; and (3) provide
    reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
    unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
    company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
    financial statements.

Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over
    financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or
    improper management override of controls, material misstatements
    due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a
    timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of the
    effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting
    to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may
    become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the
    degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may
    deteriorate.

In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material
    respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as
    of December 31, 2009, based on the criteria established in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework

issued
    by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
    Commission.

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
    consolidated financial statements and financial statement
    schedule as of and for the year ended December 31, 2009 of
    the Company and our report dated February 26, 2010 expressed an
    unqualified opinion on those financial statements and financial
    statement schedule and included an explanatory paragraph
    regarding the adoption of the noncontrolling interest guidance
    from Accounting Standards Codification 810,

Consolidations

(formerly Statement of Financial
    Accounting Standards No. 160,

Noncontrolling Interests in
    Consolidated Financial Statements - an amendment of ARB 51)
