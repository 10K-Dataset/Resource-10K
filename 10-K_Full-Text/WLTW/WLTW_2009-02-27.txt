"anticipate", "believe", "estimate", "expect", "intend", "plan", "probably", or similar expressions, we are making forward-looking statements.

There
are important uncertainties, events and factors that could cause our actual results or performance to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements contained in this document,
including regional, national or global political, economic, business, competitive, market and regulatory conditions and the following:

•

our ability to achieve the expected cost savings, synergies and other strategic benefits as a result of the acquisition of
HRH or the amount of time it may take to achieve such cost savings, synergies and benefits expected to be realized as a result of the integration of HRH with our operations;

•

our ability to continue to manage our indebtedness;

•

our ability to implement and realize anticipated benefits of the Shaping our Future initiative and other new initiatives;

a catastrophic event such as a hurricane;

•

impact of competition;

•

the impact of insolvencies of clients or insurance companies resulting from an economic downturn;

•

the timing or ability to carry out share repurchases or take other steps to manage our capital and limitations in our

•

a significant decline in the value of investments that fund our pension plans or changes in our pension plan funding
obligations;

•

rating agency actions that could inhibit ability to borrow funds or the pricing thereof;

•

Although
we believe that the assumptions underlying our forward-looking statements are reasonable, any of these assumptions, and therefore also the forward-looking statements

based
on these assumptions, could themselves prove to be inaccurate. In light of the significant uncertainties inherent in the forward-looking statements included in this document, our inclusion of
this information is not a representation or guarantee by us that our objectives and plans will be achieved.

uncertainties and assumptions, the forward-looking events discussed in this document may not occur, and we caution you against unduly relying on these forward-looking statements.


PART I

Item 1—Business

History and Development of the Company

Willis Group Holdings is the ultimate holding company for the Group. We trace our history to 1828 and are one of the largest insurance brokers in the
world.

Willis
Group Holdings was incorporated in Bermuda on February 8, 2001 as an exempted company under the Companies Act, for the sole purpose of redomiciling the ultimate parent company of the
Willis Group from the United Kingdom to Bermuda.

For
administrative convenience, we utilize the offices of a subsidiary company as our principal executive offices. The address is:

Willis
Group Holdings Limited

c/o Willis Group Limited

The Willis Building

51 Lime Street

London EC3M 7DQ

England

Tel: +44 203 124 6000

For
several years, we have focused on our core retail and specialist broking operations. Prior to 2008, we made a number of smaller acquisitions around the world and increased our ownership in several
of our associates and existing subsidiaries, which were not wholly-owned, where doing so strengthened our retail network and our specialty businesses.

On
October 1, 2008, we completed the acquisition of HRH, the eighth largest insurance and risk management intermediary in the United States. The acquisition doubled our North America revenues
and the combined Willis HRH operation has critical mass in key markets including California, Florida, Texas, Illinois, New York, Boston, New Jersey and Philadelphia.

Available Information

Willis Group Holdings files annual, quarterly and current reports, proxy statements and other information with the Securities and Exchange Commission
(the "SEC"). You may read and copy any documents we file at the SEC's Public Reference Room at 100 F Street, NE

quarterly and current reports, proxy statements and other information that issuers (including Willis Group Holdings) file electronically with the SEC. The SEC's website is www.sec.gov.

The
Company makes available, free of charge through our website, www.willis.com, our annual report on Form 10-K, our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, our proxy
statement, current reports on Form 8-K and Forms 3, 4, and 5 filed on behalf of directors and executive officers, as well as any amendments to those reports filed or
furnished pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the "Exchange Act") as soon as reasonably practicable after such material is electronically filed with, or furnished to, the SEC. Unless
specifically incorporated by reference, information on our website is not a part of this Form 10-K.

Company's Corporate Governance Guidelines, Audit Committee Charter, Compensation Committee Charter and Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee Charter are also available on our website,

General

We provide a broad range of insurance brokerage, reinsurance and risk management consulting services to our worldwide clients. We have significant
market positions in the United States, in the United Kingdom and, directly and through our associates, in many other countries. We are a recognized leader in providing specialized risk management
advisory and other services on a global basis to clients in various industries including the aerospace, marine, construction and energy industries.

In
our capacity as an advisor and insurance broker, we act as an intermediary between our clients and insurance carriers by advising our


clients
on their risk management requirements, helping clients determine the best means of managing risk, and negotiating and placing insurance risk with insurance carriers through our global
distribution network.

We
assist clients in the assessment of their risks, advise on the best ways of transferring suitable risk to the global insurance and reinsurance markets and then execute the transactions at the most
appropriate available price, terms and conditions for our clients. Our global distribution network enables us to place the risk in the most appropriate insurance or reinsurance market worldwide.

We
also offer clients a broad range of services to help them to identify and control their risks. These services range from strategic risk consulting (including providing actuarial analyses), to a
variety of due diligence services, to the provision of practical on-site risk control services (such as health and safety or property loss control consulting) as well as analytical and
advisory services (such as hazard modeling and reinsurance optimization studies). We assist clients in planning how to manage incidents or crises when they occur. These services include contingency
planning, security audits and
product tampering plans. We are not an insurance company and therefore we do not underwrite insurable risks for our own account, with the exception of a small legacy HRH operation (which is immaterial
to the Group) in Omaha that underwrites for college fraternities.

We
and our associates serve a diverse base of clients located in approximately 190 countries. These clients include major multinational and middle-market companies in a variety of industries, as well
as public institutions and individual clients. Many of our client relationships span decades. Including our associates, we have approximately 20,000 employees around the world and a network of about
400 offices in some 100 countries.

We
believe we are one of only a few insurance brokers in the world possessing the global operating presence, broad product expertise and extensive distribution network necessary to meet effectively
the global risk management needs of many of our clients.

Business Strategy—Shaping our Future

Shaping our Future, our strategy introduced in 2006, aims to deliver profitable growth over the next several years.

Our
vision is that Willis will:

•

segment clients and deliver service consistent with their needs and target high growth businesses and geographies;

•

drive profitable growth through providing our clients with value and service above that provided by our competitors;

•

use our global scale to manage carrier relationships in the best interest of the clients and to deliver product
innovation;

•

aim to deliver service to clients efficiently by streamlining our organization and utilizing industry leading technology.
We expect to create the optimal platform by enhancing our service model, processes and technology; and

•

become the employer of choice by creating a clear path of career development for our people and a reward and recognition
framework that recognizes team work.

Our Business

Insurance and reinsurance is a global business, and its participants are affected by global trends in capacity and pricing. Accordingly, we operate
as one global business which ensures all clients' interests are handled efficiently and comprehensively, whatever their initial point of contact. We organize our business into three segments: North
America and International, which together comprise our principal retail operations, and Global. For information regarding revenues, operating income and total assets per segment, see Note 22 of
the Consolidated Financial Statements contained herein.

Global

Our Global business provides specialist brokerage and consulting services to clients worldwide for the risks arising from specific industrial and
commercial activities. In these operations, we have extensive specialized


experience
handling diverse lines of coverage, including complex insurance programs, and acting as an intermediary between retail brokers and insurers. We increasingly provide consulting services on
risk management with the objective of assisting clients to reduce the overall cost of risk. Our Global business serves clients in around 190 countries, primarily from offices in the United Kingdom,
although we also serve clients from offices in the United States, Continental Europe and Asia.

The
Global business is divided into:

•

Global Specialties;

•

Willis Re; and

•

Faber & Dumas

Faber &
Dumas, our new wholesale brokerage division, was launched in October 2008 on completion of Willis' acquisition of HRH. Faber & Dumas comprises HRH's London-based operation
Glencairn, together with our Fine Art, Jewelry and Specie; Special Contingency Risk and Hughes-Gibb units.

Global Specialties

Global Specialties has strong global positions in Aerospace, Energy, Marine, Construction, Financial and Executive Risks and several niche
businesses.

•

Aerospace

We
are highly experienced in the provision of insurance and reinsurance brokerage and risk management services to Aerospace clients, including aircraft manufacturers, air cargo handlers and shippers,
airport managers and other general aviation companies. Advisory services provided by aerospace include claims recovery, contract and leasing risk management, safety services and market information.
Aerospace's clients are spread throughout the world and include approximately 350 airlines and in excess of 30 percent of the top 30 of the world's leading insured non-American
airports by passenger movement. Aerospace is also prominent in supplying the space industry through providing insurance and risk management services to approximately 40 companies.

•

Energy

Our
Energy practice provides insurance brokerage services including property damage, offshore construction, liability and control of well and pollution insurance to the energy industry. The Energy

construction and pipelines.

•

marine unit provides marine insurance and reinsurance brokerage services, including hull, cargo and general marine liabilities. Marine's clients include ship owners, ship builders, logistics
operators, port authorities, traders and shippers, other insurance intermediaries and insurance companies. Marine insurance brokerage is our oldest line of business dating back to our establishment in
1828.

•

Our
Financial and Executive Risks unit specializes in broking directors' and officers' insurance as well as professional indemnity insurance for corporations and professional firms. It incorporates
our political risk unit, as well as structured finance and credit teams. It also places structured crime and specialist liability insurance for clients across the broad spectrum of financial
institutions as well as specializing in strategic risk assessment and transactional risk transfer solutions.


Willis Re

We are one of the world's largest intermediaries for reinsurance and have a significant market share in the world's major markets, particularly
marine and aviation. We operate this business on a global basis and our clients are both insurance and reinsurance companies.

We
provide a complete range of transactional capabilities, including risk transfer via the capital markets, as well as analytical and advisory services including enterprise risk management, hazard
modeling, financial and balance sheet analysis and reinsurance optimization studies.

Faber & Dumas

Faber & Dumas is our wholesale brokerage division and comprises Glencairn; Fine Art, Jewelry and Specie; Special Contingency Risk and
Hughes-Gibb units.

•

Glencairn principally provides property, energy, casualty and personal accident insurance to independent wholesaler
brokers worldwide who wish to access the London, European and Bermudan markets.

against special contingencies such as kidnap and ransom, extortion, detention and political repatriation.

•

The Hughes-Gibb unit principally services the insurance and reinsurance needs of the horse racing and horse
breeding industry.

Retail operations

Our North America and International retail operations provide services to small, medium and major corporate clients, accessing Global's specialist
expertise when required.

North America

In October 2008, we completed the acquisition of HRH, a leading middle market US-based insurance broker with a large account portfolio.
HRH generated $800 million of revenues in 2007, with $57 million from its international operations, which are based in London. The acquisition substantially improves our position in
important areas in North America including California, Florida, Texas, Illinois, New York, Massachusetts, New Jersey and Pennsylvania, and in key business lines. In particular, it will more than
double our North America revenues in Employee Benefits, an already strong area of expertise that we have targeted for further growth. In addition, it will further strengthen key practice areas
including personal lines, real estate, health care, environmental, construction, complex property and executive risk.

Our
North America business provides risk management, insurance brokerage, related risk services, and employee benefits brokerage and consulting to a wide array of industry and client segments in the
United States and Canada. With around 95 retail locations, organized into 8 regions including Canada, Willis North America locally delivers our global and national resources and specialist
expertise through this retail distribution network.

In
addition to being organized geographically and by specialty, our North America business focuses on four client segments: global, large national/middle-market, small commercial, and private client,
with service, marketing and sales platform support for each segment. Further, our North America Marketing Practice provides clients with efficient access to worldwide insurance capital.

•

North America Construction

The
largest industry practice group in North America is Construction which specializes in providing risk management, insurance brokerage, and surety bonding services to the construction industry.
Willis Construction provides these services to around 25 percent of the

Engineering News Record

Top 400 contractors (a listing of the largest 400
North American contractors based on revenue). In addition, this practice group has expertise in


owner
controlled insurance programs for large projects and insurance for national homebuilders.

•

Other industry practice groups

Other
industry practice groups include Healthcare, serving the professional liability and other insurance and risk management needs of private and not-for-profit health
systems, hospitals and physicians groups; Financial Institutions, serving the needs of large banks, insurers and other financial services firms; Mergers & Acquisitions, providing due diligence,
and risk management and insurance brokerage services to private equity and merchant banking firms and their portfolio companies.

•

Employee Benefits

Willis
Employee Benefits, fully integrated into the North America platform, is our largest product-based practice group and provides health, welfare and human resources consulting, and brokerage
services to all of our commercial client segments. This practice group's value lies in helping clients control employee benefit plan costs, reducing the amount of time human resources professionals
spend administering their companies' benefit plans and educating and training employees on benefit plan issues.

•

Executive Risks

Another
industry-leading North America practice group is Willis Executive Risks, a national team of technical professionals who specialize in meeting the directors & officers, employment
practices, fiduciary liability insurance risk management, and claims advocacy needs of public and private corporations and organizations. This practice group also has expertise in professional
liability, especially internet risks.

•

Excess & Surplus

The
Excess and Surplus segment, based in Redondo Beach, California with offices operating in California, Texas, Florida and Illinois, is a wholesale broker providing access to excess and surplus lines
markets for the domestic network of retail brokers.

•

CAPS

The
Captive, Actuarial, and Pooling Solutions (CAPS) practice has a national team of actuaries, certified public accountants, financial analysts and pooled insurance program experts who help large
clients develop, implement and manage alternative risks financing vehicles.

•

Willis HRH Programs

Willis
HRH Programs, based in Portsmouth, New Hampshire with operations in Florida, Michigan, Utah, Colorado, Connecticut and Vermont, is a managing general agent/managing general underwriter and a
leader in providing national insurance programs to niche industries including ski resorts, auto dealers, recycling, environmental, and specialty workers' compensation.

International

Our International unit consists of our retail operations in Eastern and Western Europe, the United Kingdom and Ireland, Asia/Pacific, Russia, the
Middle East, South Africa and Latin America, with a presence in over 100 countries worldwide.

Our
offices are there to grow our business locally around the world, making use of skills, industry knowledge and expertise available elsewhere in the Group.

The
services provided are focused according to the characteristics of each market and are not identical in every office, but generally include direct risk management and insurance brokerage,
specialist and reinsurance brokerage and employee benefits consulting.

We
target both large accounts and middle market clients. Recent global market conditions have resulted in excellent opportunities to recruit talented teams and individuals from the competition with
new and complementary skills and relationships. We have a dedicated team within International working on the implementation of our Shaping our Future strategy and initiatives, identifying
opportunities for increased efficiency and growth.

We
believe the combined total revenues of our International subsidiaries and associates provide


an
indication of the spread and capability of our International network. Our International segment generated close to 40 percent of total consolidated commissions and fees in 2008.

•

Emerging Markets

We
have separately identified high growth markets across all International retail operations. This encompasses the fast-developing, high growth regions of Eastern Europe, Russia, Asia
(excluding Japan), the Middle East and South Africa. We bring particular capabilities and scale in energy, construction, marine and aerospace to these regions.

•

Global Markets International

Global
Markets International works closely with Global to further develop access for our retail clients to global markets, and provide structuring and placing skills in the relevant areas of property,
casualty, terrorism, accident & health, facultative and captives.

•

Strategic Investments

As
part of our on-going strategy, we are continually strengthening our International market share through acquisitions and strategic investments. We have acquired a controlling interest in
a broad geographic spread of other brokers—a list of the significant International subsidiaries is included in Exhibit 21.1 to this document.

We
have also invested in associate companies; our significant associates at December 31, 2008 were Gras Savoye & Cie ("Gras Savoye"), France (48 percent voting rights) and
Al-Futtaim Willis Co. LLC, Dubai (49 percent holding). In connection with many of our investments, we retain the rights to increase our ownership percentage over time,
typically to a majority or 100 percent ownership position. In addition, in certain instances our co-shareholders have a right, typically based on some price formula of revenues or
earnings, to put some or all of their shares to us (see "Item 1a—Risk Factors—Put and Call Arrangements"). On January 2, 2008, we acquired an additional
4 percent of Gras Savoye and a further 5 percent on December 31, 2008, bringing our total current voting rights to 48 percent.

Customers

Our clients operate on a global and local scale in a multitude of businesses and industries throughout the world and generally range in size from
major multinational corporations to middle-market companies. Further, many of our client relationships span decades, for instance our relationship with The Tokio Marine and Fire Insurance Company
Limited dates back over 100 years. No one client accounted for more than 10 percent of revenues for fiscal year 2008. Additionally, we place insurance with over 5,000 insurance carriers,
none of which individually accounted for more than 10 percent of the total premiums we placed on behalf of our clients in 2008.

Competition

We face competition in all fields in which we operate based on global capability, product breadth, innovation, quality of service and price.
According to the Directory of Agents and Brokers published by Business Insurance in July 2008, the 140 largest commercial insurance brokers globally reported brokerage revenues totaling
$37 billion in 2007, of which Marsh & McLennan Companies Inc. had approximately 31 percent, Aon Corporation had approximately 19 percent and Willis had approximately
7 percent.

We
compete with Marsh & McLennan and Aon as well as with numerous specialist, regional and local firms. Although Marsh & McLennan and Aon, along with us, have agreed to implement certain
business reforms, many specialist, regional and local firms have not agreed to those business reforms. These firms are continuing to accept contingent compensation and are not disclosing the
compensation received in connection with providing policy placement services to the customer.

Insurance
companies also compete with brokers by directly soliciting insureds without the assistance of an independent broker or agent.

Competition
for business is intense in all our business lines and in every insurance market. Competition on premium rates has also exacerbated the pressures caused by a continuing reduction in demand
in some classes of business.


For
example, insurers are currently retaining a greater proportion of their risk portfolios than previously. Industrial and commercial companies are increasingly relying upon captive insurance
companies, self-insurance pools, risk retention groups, mutual insurance companies and other mechanisms for funding their risks, rather than buying insurance.

Additional
competitive pressures arise from the entry of new market participants, such as banks, accounting firms and insurance carriers themselves, offering risk management or transfer services.

Regulation

Our business activities are subject to legal requirements and governmental and quasi-governmental regulatory supervision in virtually all countries
in which we operate. Also, such regulations may require individual or company licensing to conduct our business activities. While these requirements may vary from location to location they are
generally designed to protect our clients by establishing minimum standards of conduct and practice, particularly regarding the provision of advice and product information as well as financial
criteria.

Our
activities in connection with insurance brokerage services within the United States are subject to regulation and supervision by state authorities. Although the scope of regulation and form of
supervision may vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, insurance laws in the United States are often complex and generally grant broad discretion to supervisory authorities in adopting regulations
and supervising regulated activities. That supervision generally includes the licensing of insurance brokers and agents and the regulation of the handling and investment of client funds held in a
fiduciary capacity. Our continuing ability to provide insurance brokerage in the jurisdictions in which we currently operate is dependent upon our compliance with the rules and regulations promulgated
from time to time by the regulatory authorities in each of these jurisdictions.

The
European Union Insurance Mediation Directive introduced rules to enable insurance

and
reinsurance intermediaries to operate and provide services within each member state of the EU on a basis consistent with the EU single market and customer protection aims. Each EU member state, in
which we operate, is required to ensure that the insurance and reinsurance intermediaries resident in their country are registered with a statutory body in that country and that each intermediary
meets professional requirements in relation to their competence, good repute, professional indemnity cover and financial capacity. In the United Kingdom the statutory body is the Financial Services
Authority.

The
Financial Services Authority has prescribed the methods by which our insurance and reinsurance operations are to conduct business, and they generally conduct their regulatory functions through the
establishment of net worth and other financial criteria. They also require the submission of reports and have investigative and disciplinary powers. Monitoring visits are carried out to assess our
compliance with regulatory requirements.

Our
failure, or that of our employees, to satisfy the regulators that we are in compliance with their requirements or the legal requirements governing our activities, can result in disciplinary
action, fines, reputational damage and financial harm.

All
companies carrying on similar activities in a given jurisdiction are subject to regulations which are not dissimilar to the requirements for our operations in the United States and United Kingdom.
We do not consider that these regulatory requirements adversely affect our competitive position.

Employees

As of December 31, 2008 we had approximately 17,000 employees worldwide of whom approximately 3,500 were employed in the United Kingdom and
7,400 in the United States, with the balance being employed across the rest of the world. In addition, our associates had approximately 3,300 employees, all of whom were located outside the United
Kingdom and the United States.


Item 1A—Risk Factors

Risks Relating to our Business and the Insurance Industry

This section describes material risks affecting the Group's business. These risks could materially affect the Group's business, its revenues,
operating income, net income, net assets, liquidity and capital resources and ability to achieve its financial targets and, accordingly should be read in conjunction with any forward-looking
statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Competitive Risks

Our business may be adversely affected by an overall decline in economic activity.

Our business and operating results are materially affected by worldwide economic conditions. Current global economic conditions including the current
credit crisis coupled with declining customer and business confidence, increasing energy prices, and other challenges, may have a significant negative impact on the buying behavior of some of our
clients as their businesses suffer from these conditions. In particular, financial institutions, construction, aviation, and logistics businesses such as marine cargo are most likely to be affected.
Further, the global economic downturn is also negatively affecting some of the international economies that have supported the strong growth in our International operations. Our employee benefits
practice may also be adversely affected as businesses continue to downsize during this period of economic turmoil. In addition, a growing number of insolvencies associated with an economic downturn,
especially insolvencies in the insurance industry, could adversely affect our brokerage business through the loss of clients or by hampering our ability to place insurance and reinsurance business.
While it is difficult to predict consequences of any further deterioration in global economic conditions on our business, any significant reduction or delay by our clients in purchasing insurance or
making payment of premiums could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.

We do not control the premiums on which our commissions are based, and volatility or declines in premiums may seriously undermine our profitability.

We derive most of our revenues from commissions and fees for brokerage and consulting services. We do not determine insurance premiums on which our
commissions are generally based. Premiums are cyclical in nature and may vary widely based on market conditions.
From the late 1980s through late 2000, insurance premium rates generally declined as a result of a number of factors, including the expanded underwriting capacity of insurance carriers; consolidation
of both insurance intermediaries and insurance carriers; and increased competition among insurance carriers. During 2004, we saw a rapid transition from a "hard" market, with premium rates stable or
increasing, to a "soft" market, with premium rates falling in most markets. Rates continued to decline in most sectors through 2005 and 2006, with the exception of catastrophe-exposed markets. In
2007, the market softened further with decreases in many of the market sectors in which we operated and this has continued into 2008 with further declines of between 5 and 15 percent in many
territories.

In
addition, as traditional risk-bearing insurance carriers continue to outsource the production of premium revenue to non-affiliated agents or brokers such as ourselves, those
insurance carriers may seek to reduce further their expenses by reducing the commission rates payable to those insurance agents or brokers. The reduction of these commission rates, along with general
volatility and/or declines in premiums, may significantly undermine our profitability.

Competition in our industry is intense, and if we are unable to compete effectively, we may lose market share and our business may be materially adversely affected.

We face competition in all fields in which we operate, based on global capability, product breadth, innovation, quality of service and price. We
compete with Marsh & McLennan and Aon, the two other providers of global risk


management
services, as well as with numerous specialist, regional and local firms. Although Marsh & McLennan and Aon, along with us, have agreed to implement certain business reforms, many
specialist, regional and local firms have not agreed to these business reforms. These firms are continuing to accept contingent compensation and are not disclosing the compensation received in
connection with providing policy placement services to the customer. If we are unable to compete effectively against these competitors, we will suffer lower revenue, reduced operating margins and loss
of market share. As a result of our acquisition of HRH, we must phase out the contingent compensation payable to HRH over 3 years. We are currently seeking to increase revenue through higher
commissions and fees that we disclose to our clients, and to generate profitable revenue growth by focusing on the provision of value-added risk advisory services beyond traditional brokerage
activities. We cannot be certain that such steps will generate the profitable revenue growth we are targeting.

Competition
for business is intense in all our business lines and in every insurance market, and the other two providers of global risk management services have substantially greater market share than
we do. Competition on premium rates has also exacerbated the pressures caused by a continuing reduction in demand in some classes of business. For example, rather than purchase additional insurance
through brokers, many insureds have been retaining a greater proportion of their risk portfolios than previously. Industrial and commercial companies have been increasingly relying upon their own
subsidiary insurance companies, known as captive insurance companies, self-insurance pools, risk retention groups, mutual insurance companies and other mechanisms for funding their risks,
rather than buying insurance. Additional competitive pressures arise from the entry of new market participants, such as banks, accounting firms and insurance carriers themselves, offering risk
management or transfer services.

Dependence on Key Personnel—The loss of our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer or a number of our senior management or a significant number of our brokers
could significantly impede our financial plans, growth, marketing and other objectives.

The loss of our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer or a number of our senior management or a significant number of our brokers could significantly
impede our financial plans, growth, marketing and other objectives. Our success depends to a substantial extent not only on the ability and experience of our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer,
Joseph J. Plumeri and other members of our senior management, but also on the individual brokers and teams that service our clients and maintain client relationships. The insurance and
reinsurance brokerage industry has in the past experienced intense competition for the services of leading individual brokers and brokerage teams, and we have lost key individuals and teams to
competitors. We believe that our future success will depend in part on our ability to attract and retain additional highly skilled and qualified personnel and to expand, train and manage our employee
base. We may not continue to be successful in doing so because the competition for qualified personnel in our industry is intense.

Legal and Regulatory Risks

We are subject to insurance industry regulation worldwide. If we fail to comply with regulatory requirements, we may not be able to conduct our business.

Many of our activities are subject to regulatory supervision in virtually all the countries in which we are based or our activities are undertaken.
Failure to comply with some of these regulations could lead to disciplinary action, including requiring clients to be compensated for loss, the imposition of penalties and the revocation of our
authorization to operate. In addition, changes in legislation or regulations and actions by regulators, including changes in administration and
enforcement policies, could from time to time require operational improvements or modifications at various locations which could result in higher costs or hinder our ability to operate our business.


We are subject to a number of legal proceedings concerning contingent compensation, other industry practices and certain conduct, which, if determined unfavorably to us,
could adversely affect our financial results.

We have been subject to investigations by the departments of insurance or attorneys general of over 20 states, the District of Columbia, one US city,
Canada and Australia concerning, among other things, arrangements pursuant to which insurers compensated insurance brokers for distribution and other services provided to insurers known as contingent
compensation, bid rigging, tying and other possible violations of law, including violations of fiduciary duty, securities laws and antitrust laws. As more fully described in Note 17 to our
consolidated financial statements included under Part II, Item 8 of this report, we are subject to a number of legal proceedings and other contingencies related to the subject of these
investigations. If one or more of these matters is determined unfavorably to us it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition in any given
quarterly or annual period. We intend to vigorously defend ourselves against these claims. The outcomes of these lawsuits, however, including any losses or other payments that may occur as a result,
cannot be predicted at this time.

Our business, results of operations, financial condition or liquidity may be materially adversely affected by errors and omissions and the outcome of certain actual and
potential claims, lawsuits and proceedings.

We are subject to various actual and potential claims, lawsuits and other proceedings relating principally to alleged errors and omissions in
connection with the placement of insurance and reinsurance in the ordinary course of business. Because we often assist our clients with matters, including the placement of insurance coverage and the
handling of related claims, involving substantial amounts of money, errors and omissions claims against us may arise which allege our potential liability for all or part of the amounts in question.
Claimants can seek large damage awards and these claims can involve potentially significant defense costs. Such claims,

lawsuits
and other proceedings could, for example, include allegations of damages for our employees or sub-agents improperly failing to place coverage or notify claims on behalf of
clients, to provide insurance carriers with complete and accurate information relating to the risks being insured or to appropriately apply funds that we hold for our clients on a fiduciary basis.
Errors and omissions claims, lawsuits and other proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business are covered in part by professional indemnity or other appropriate insurance. The terms of this
insurance vary by policy year and self-insured risks have increased significantly in recent years. In respect of self-insured risks, we have established provisions against
these items which we believe to be adequate in the light of current information and legal advice, and we adjust such provisions from time to time according to developments. Our business, results of
operations, financial condition and liquidity may be adversely affected if in the future our insurance coverage proves to be inadequate or unavailable or there is an increase in liabilities for which
we self-insure. Our ability to obtain professional indemnity insurance in the amounts and with the deductibles we desire in the future may be adversely impacted by general developments in
the market for such insurance or our own claims experience. In addition, claims, lawsuits and other proceedings may harm our reputation or divert management resources away from operating our business.

The
principal actual or potential claims, lawsuits and proceedings to which we are currently subject, including but not limited to errors and omissions claims, are: (1) the regulatory and other
proceedings relating to contingent compensation arrangements referred to above; (2) potential claims arising out of various legal proceedings between reinsurers, reinsureds and their
reinsurance brokers relating to personal accident excess of loss reinsurance placements for the years 1993 to 1998; (3) potential damages arising out of a court action, on behalf of a purported
class of present and former female officer and officer equivalent employees for alleged discrimination against them on the basis of their gender; and (4) claims with respect to our placement of
property and casualty insurance for a number of entities which were


directly
impacted by the September 11, 2001 destruction of New York's World Trade Center complex.

The
ultimate outcome of all matters referred to above cannot be ascertained and liabilities in indeterminate amounts may be imposed on us. It is thus possible that future results of operations or cash
flows for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by an unfavorable resolution of these matters. In addition, even if we do not experience significant monetary costs,
there may be adverse publicity associated with these matters that will result in reputational harm to the insurance brokerage industry in general or to us in particular that may adversely affect our
business.

Interruption or loss of our information processing systems or failure to maintain secure information systems could have a material adverse effect on our business.

Our business depends on highly available systems, secure information and the ability of our employees to process transactions. Our capacity to
service our clients relies on storing, retrieving, processing and managing information. Interruption or loss of our information processing capabilities through loss of stored data, the failure of
computer equipment or software systems, telecommunications failure or other disruption could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Despite the
business contingency plans we have in place, our ability to conduct business may be adversely affected by a disruption in the infrastructure that supports our business and the communities where we are
located. This may include a disruption involving physical site access, terrorist activities, disease pandemics, electrical, communications or other services used by our company, our employees or third
parties with whom we conduct business. Although we have certain disaster recovery procedures in place and insurance to protect against such contingencies, such procedures may not be effective and any
insurance or recovery procedures may not continue to be available at reasonable prices and may not address all such losses or compensate us for the possible loss of clients occurring during any period
that we are unable to provide services.

Furthermore,
we depend on computer systems to store information about our clients, some of which is private. Database privacy, identity theft, and related computer and internet issues are matters of
growing public concern and are subject to frequently changing rules and regulations. Our failure to adhere to or successfully implement processes in response to changing regulatory requirements in
this area could result in legal liability or harm to our reputation. We have taken reasonable and appropriate security measures to prevent unauthorized access to information in our database. However,
our technology may fail to adequately secure the private information we maintain in our databases and protect it from theft or inadvertent loss. In such circumstances, we may be held liable to our
clients, which could result in litigation or adverse publicity that could have a material adverse effect on our business.

Financial Risks

The integration of the businesses and operations of HRH into our company involves risks and we may fail to realize all of the anticipated benefits of the acquisition of HRH.

The success of the acquisition of HRH completed in October 2008 will depend, in part, on our ability to achieve the anticipated cost synergies and
other strategic benefits from combining the businesses of our company and HRH. We expect to benefit from operational synergies resulting from the consolidation of capabilities and elimination of
redundancies as well as greater efficiencies from increased scale. We may face significant challenges in consolidating the functions of our company and HRH and their subsidiaries, integrating their
technologies, organizations, procedures, policies and operations, addressing differences in the business cultures of the two companies, retaining key personnel and maintaining relationships with
certain third parties. The integration process and other disruptions resulting from the acquisition may disrupt our ongoing businesses or cause inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures and
policies that adversely affect our relationships with clients and customers and with other market participants, employees, regulators and others with whom we have business or other dealings. If we are
not able to successfully


integrate
the businesses, the anticipated cost synergies and other strategic benefits of the acquisition may not be realized fully or at all or may take longer to realize than expected.

Our incurrence of additional debt to pay a portion of the consideration related to the HRH acquisition significantly increased our interest expense, financial leverage and
debt service requirements.

In October 2008, in connection with the acquisition of HRH, we incurred incremental borrowings of $1.525 billion which significantly increased
our leverage. These borrowings were drawn down under new credit facilities consisting of a $700 million 5-year term loan facility, a $300 million revolving credit facility and a
$1 billion interim credit facility. In February 2009, we entered into an agreement with Goldman Sachs Mezzanine Partners to issue notes in an aggregate principal amount of $500 million.
We anticipate that the net proceeds of this issuance of approximately $480 million will be applied towards the balance of the interim credit facility. Although consummation of the issuance,
which is subject to customary closing conditions, is expected to take place in March 2009, there is no certainty that the transaction will close. In addition, while the closing of the transaction
would significantly extend the payment date for amounts otherwise due under the interim credit facility, the issuance of the notes will also result in a significant increase in our interest expense
compared to that under the interim credit facility.

Although
management believes that our cash flows will be more than adequate to service this debt, there may be circumstances in which required payments of principal and/or interest on this new debt
could adversely affect our cash flows and this level of indebtedness may:

•

require us to dedicate a significant portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our debt, thereby reducing
the availability of cash flow to fund capital expenditures, to pursue other acquisitions or investments in new technologies, to pay dividends and for general corporate purposes;

•

increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic conditions, including increases in interest rates if the borrowings
bear interest at variable rates;

•

limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes or challenges relating to our business and industry; and

•

put us at a competitive disadvantage against competitors who have less indebtedness or are in a more favorable position to
access additional capital resources.

The
terms of the financing also include certain limitations on the amount and type of investments that may be made, the amount of dividends that may be declared, and the amount of shares that may be
repurchased. In addition, any borrowings may be made at variable interest rates, making us vulnerable to increases in interest rates generally.

A
failure to comply with the restrictions under our credit facilities and outstanding notes could result in a default under the financing obligations or could require us to obtain waivers from our
lenders for failure to comply with these restrictions. The occurrence of a default that remains uncured or the inability to secure a necessary consent or waiver could cause our obligations with
respect to our debt to be accelerated and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.

A downgrade in the credit ratings of our outstanding debt may adversely affect our borrowing costs and financial flexibility.

As of December 31, 2008, we had total consolidated debt outstanding of approximately $2.7 billion. A downgrade in the credit ratings of
our debt would increase our borrowing costs and reduce our financial flexibility. In addition, certain downgrades would trigger a step-up in interest rates under the indenture for our 6.2%
senior notes, which would increase our interest expense. If we need to raise capital in the future, any credit rating downgrade could negatively affect our financing costs or access to financing
sources.


If we are unable to repay or refinance the interim credit facility, it could have a significant negative effect on our financial condition.

In connection with the HRH acquisition we entered into an interim credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of $1 billion, of which
approximately $750 million remains outstanding. Failure to repay or refinance the interim credit facility at or prior to maturity would constitute an event of default under the interim credit
agreement and would trigger cross default provisions in our other debt instruments and agreements, potentially causing such other debt to become immediately due and payable. However, our access to
capital is affected by prevailing conditions in the financial and capital markets and other factors beyond our control and, given the current uncertainty in the capital markets, we may not be able to
obtain additional financing on favorable terms or at all.
While we anticipate applying approximately $480 million of the proceeds of the March 2009 note issuance towards the outstanding balance of the interim credit facility, there is no assurance
that the transaction will close. If we are not able to issue new debt to repay the interim credit facility, we may have to use other sources of cash such as drawing down on our current revolving
credit facility, future cash flows or cash on hand. The use of our revolving credit facility and other cash resources would restrict our financial flexibility and our ability to use such cash for
other purposes and could have a significant negative impact on our liquidity.

Our pension liabilities may increase which could require us to make additional cash contributions to our pension plans.

We have two principal defined benefit plans: one in the United Kingdom and the other in the United States. Cash contributions of approximately
$55 million will be required in 2009 for our pension plans, although we may elect to contribute more. Total cash contributions to these defined benefit pension plans in 2008 were
$148 million. Future estimates are based on certain assumptions, including discount rates, interest rates, fair value of assets and expected return on plan assets. Following changes to UK
pension legislation in 2005, we are now required to agree to a funding strategy for our UK

defined
benefit plan with the plan's trustees. In February 2009, we agreed to make full year contributions to the UK plan of $37 million for 2009 through 2012. However, if certain funding
targets are not met at the beginning of 2010 and 2011, full year contributions for these years will increase to $74 million. We have taken actions to manage our pension liabilities, including
closing our UK and US plans to new participants and restricting final pensionable salaries.

The
determinations of pension expense and pension funding are based on a variety of rules and regulations. Changes in these rules and regulations could impact the calculation of pension plan
liabilities and the valuation of pension plan assets. They may also result in higher pension costs, additional financial statement disclosure, and accelerate and increase the need to fully fund our
pension plans. Our future required cash contributions to our US and UK defined benefit pension plans may increase based on the funding reform provisions that were enacted into law. Further, a
significant decline in the value of investments that fund our pension plan, if not offset or mitigated by a decline in our liabilities, may significantly differ from or alter the values and actuarial
assumptions used to calculate our future pension expense and we could be required to fund our plan with significant amounts of cash. In addition, if the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation requires
additional contributions to such plans or if other actuarial assumptions are modified, our future required cash contributions could increase. The need to make these cash contributions may reduce the
cash available to meet our other obligations, including the payment obligations under our credit facilities and other long-term debt, or to meet the needs of our business.

In
addition to the critical assumptions described above, our plans use certain assumptions about the life expectancy of plan participants and surviving spouses. Periodic revision of those assumptions
can materially change the present value of future benefits and therefore the funded status of the plans and the resulting periodic pension expense. Changes in our pension benefit obligations and the
related net periodic costs or credits may occur in the future due to any variance of actual results from our assumptions


and
changes in the number of participating employees. As a result, there can be no assurance that we will not experience future decreases in stockholders equity, net income, cash flow and liquidity or
that we will not be required to make additional cash contributions in the future beyond those which have been estimated.

We have entered into significant put and call arrangements which require us to pay substantial amounts to purchase shares in one of our associates. Those payments would
reduce our liquidity and short-term cash flow.

In connection with many of our investments in our associates, we retain rights to increase our ownership percentages over time and, in some cases,
the existing owners also have a right to put their shares to us. The put arrangements in place for shares of our associate, Gras Savoye, require us to pay substantial amounts to purchase those shares,
which could decrease our liquidity and short-term cash flow.

The
rights under the put arrangement may be exercised through 2011. Under the put arrangement, we will be required to buy shares of Gras Savoye increasing our voting rights from the 48 percent
we currently hold up to 100 percent if all shareholders put their shares under this arrangement, subject to the pre-emption provisions set out in the bye-laws of Gras Savoye.

Following
our initial acquisition of shares, we acquired an additional 5 percent of Gras Savoye at a cost of $25 million under these arrangements in September 2006, another
4 percent at a cost of $31 million in January 2008 and another 5 percent at a cost of $41 million at the end of December 2008.

According
to the put arrangement, the aggregate management shareholding may not fall below approximately 10% of Gras Savoye's share capital while the management shareholders remain general partners of
the company. The current appointments of the relevant individuals will expire on December 31, 2009. Accordingly (and except in case of death, disability or retirement prior to such date),
management shareholders will not have a general put right until January 1, 2011. Payments in connection

with
management put rights would not have exceeded $67 million if those rights had been fully exercised at December 31, 2008. In addition, we have a call option to move to majority
ownership under certain circumstances and in any event from December 2009. Once we exercise this call option, the remaining Gras Savoye shareholders will have a put option to require us to purchase
their shares.

Subject
to the pre-emption provisions set out in the bye-laws of Gras Savoye, the incremental 42 percent of Gras Savoye shares held by shareholders (excluding the
10 percent holding of management shareholders described above) may be put to us at a price determined by a contractual formula based on earnings and revenue, which at December 31, 2008
would have amounted to approximately $285 million. The shareholders may put their shares individually at any time during the put period and the amounts we may have to pay in connection with the
put arrangements may significantly exceed this estimate. In each case, we would have 90 days from the date of a notification from a shareholder who wished to put his shares to us to acquire
those shares. The timing of any exercise of these put and call arrangements could have a material affect on our results of operations or cash flows for a particular quarter or annual period.

We
recently received a notification from one of the shareholders of Gras Savoye, namely AXA Corporate Solutions, informing us of its intention to put its shares in Gras Savoye to us, subject to the
pre-emption provisions set out in bye-laws of Gras Savoye. The shares held by AXA represent approximately 4 percent of the share capital of Gras Savoye. Notwithstanding that we have received
this notice from AXA we believe that it is likely that we will not be required to acquire all of the AXA shares in the immediate future or, in some circumstances, at all. We believe that either:-

•

Gras Savoye itself will buy back all the AXA shares on 23 March 2009 and as a result, we would not acquire any of
them; or

•

AXA will agree to extend the date for payment of the amount due in respect of the AXA shares and that Gras Savoye itself
will buy back all the AXA shares on the agreed


date
for payment. In these circumstances we believe that Gras Savoye will buy back all the AXA shares and would agree to pay the amount due in respect of the shares into an escrow account to be paid
to AXA upon completion of the acquisition of the shares. Again, as a result, we would not be required to acquire any of the shares; or

•

certain of the other shareholders of Gras Savoye will exercise their pre-emption rights to acquire a portion of the AXA
shares. In these circumstances we believe that AXA would withdraw its notification in respect of the remaining shares held by it although we believe that it would then exercise its right to put those
to us later in 2009.

In
the event that none of the above occurred or an alternative arrangement was agreed, we would be required to acquire the AXA shares on 23 March 2009. The amount payable by us for the AXA
shares would be approximately $25 million.

International Risks

Our significant non-US operations, particularly our London market operations, expose us to exchange rate fluctuations and various risks that could impact our
business.

A significant portion of our operations is conducted outside the United States. Accordingly, we are subject to legal, economic and market risks
associated with operating in foreign countries, including devaluations and fluctuations in currency exchange rates; imposition of limitations on conversion of foreign currencies into pounds sterling
or dollars or remittance of dividends and other payments by foreign subsidiaries; hyperinflation in certain foreign countries; imposition or increase of investment and other restrictions by foreign
governments; and the requirement of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws.

We
report our operating results and financial condition in US dollars. Our US operations earn revenue and incur expenses primarily in US dollars. In our London market operations, however, we earn
revenue in a number of different currencies, but expenses are almost

entirely
incurred in pounds sterling. Outside the United States and our London market operations, we predominantly generate revenue and expenses in the local currency. The table gives an approximate
analysis of revenues and expenses by currency in 2008, and includes full year HRH results on a proforma basis.

Because of devaluations and fluctuations in currency exchange rates or the imposition of limitations on conversion of foreign currencies into US dollars, we are
subject to currency translation exposure on the profits of our operations, in addition to economic exposure. Furthermore, the mismatch between pounds sterling revenues and expenses, together with any
net sterling balance sheet position we hold in our US dollar denominated London market operations, creates an exchange exposure.

For
example, as the pound sterling strengthens, the US dollars required to be translated into pounds sterling to cover the net sterling expenses increase, which then causes our results to be
negatively impacted. Our results may also be adversely impacted if we are holding a net sterling position in our US dollar denominated London market operations: if the pound sterling weakens any net
sterling asset we are holding will be less valuable when translated into US dollars. Given these facts, the relative strength of the pound sterling relative to the US dollar has in the past had a
material negative impact on our reported results. This risk could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition, cash flow and results of operations in the future.

Where
possible, we hedge part of our exposure to exchange rate movements, for example:

•

to the extent that forecast pound sterling expenses exceed pound sterling revenues, we limit our exposure to this exchange
rate risk by the use of forward contracts matched to specific, clearly identified cash outflows arising in the ordinary course of business; and


•

to the extent the London market operations also earn significant revenues in Euros and Japanese Yen, we limit our exposure
to changes in the exchange rate between the US dollar and these currencies by the use of forward contracts matched to a percentage of forecast cash inflows in specific currencies and periods.

Generally,
it is our policy to hedge at least 25 percent of the next 12 months' exposure in significant currencies.

We
do not hedge exposures beyond three years or exposures arising from items, such as our UK pension asset, which will not be reflected in our cash flows in the short term.

In conducting our businesses around the world, we are subject to political, economic, legal, operational and other risks that are inherent in operating in many countries.

In conducting our businesses and maintaining and supporting our global operations, we are subject to legal, economic and market risks. Our businesses
and operations are increasingly expanding into new regions throughout the world, including emerging markets, and we expect this trend to continue. The possible effects of economic and financial
disruptions throughout the
world could have an adverse impact on our businesses. These risks include:

•

the general economic and political conditions in foreign countries;

•

the imposition of controls or limitations on the conversion of foreign currencies or remittance of dividends and other
payments by foreign subsidiaries;

•

imposition of withholding and other taxes on remittances and other payments from subsidiaries;

•

imposition or increase of investment and other restrictions by foreign governments;

•

difficulties in controlling operations and monitoring employees in geographically dispersed locations; and

•

the requirement of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws as well as laws and regulations applicable to US business
operations abroad, including rules relating to trade sanctions administered by the US Office of Foreign Assets Control, the EU and the UN, and the requirements of the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act
as well as other anti-bribery and corruption rules and requirements in the countries in which we operate.

We could incur substantial losses if one of the financial institutions we use in our operations would happen to fail.

The recent deterioration of the global credit and financial markets has created challenging conditions for financial institutions, including
depositories. As the fallout from the credit crisis persists, the financial strength of these institutions may continue to decline. We maintain cash balances at various US depository institutions that
are significantly in excess of the US Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation insurance limits. We also maintain cash balances in foreign financial institutions. If one or more of the institutions in
which we maintain significant cash balances were to fail, our ability to access these funds might be temporarily or permanently limited, and we could face a material liquidity problem and potentially
material financial losses.

Item 1B—Unresolved Staff Comments

The
Company had no unresolved comments

from the SEC's staff.


Item 2—Properties

We
own and lease a number of properties for use as offices throughout the world and believe that our properties are generally suitable and adequate for the purposes for which they are used. The
principal properties are located in the United Kingdom and the United States.

London

We moved into our new London headquarters in Lime Street in April 2008. This 491,000 sq ft development occupies a prime site comprising
a 29 story tower and adjoining 10 story building. We have entered into a 25 year lease for this building.

On
September 27, 2006, Willis Group Services Limited, a subsidiary of Willis Group Holdings Limited, completed the sale of Ten Trinity Square, the Company's London headquarters building. The
building was then leased back at an annual rental of $13 million until the Company occupied its new London headquarters on Lime Street in April 2008.

New York

In New York, we occupy 200,000 sq ft of office space at One World Financial Center under a 20 year lease.

Item 3—Legal Proceedings

Claims, Lawsuits and Other Proceedings

The Company is subject to various actual and potential claims, lawsuits and other proceedings relating principally to alleged errors and omissions in
connection with the placement of insurance and reinsurance in the ordinary course of business. Similar to other corporations, the Company is also subject to a variety of other claims, including those
relating to the Company's employment practices. Some of the claims, lawsuits and other proceedings seek damages in amounts which could, if assessed, be significant.

Errors
and omissions claims, lawsuits and other proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business are covered in part by professional indemnity or other appropriate insurance. The terms of this
insurance vary by policy year and self-insured risks have increased significantly in recent years. In respect of self-insured risks, the Company has established provisions
which are believed to be adequate in the light of current information and legal advice, and the Company adjusts such provisions from time to time according to developments.

On
the basis of current information, the Company does not expect that the actual claims, lawsuits and other proceedings, to which the Company is subject, or potential claims, lawsuits and other
proceedings
relating to matters of which it is aware will ultimately have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial

condition,
results of operations or liquidity. Nonetheless, given the large or indeterminate amounts sought in certain of these actions, and the inherent unpredictability of litigation, it is possible
that an adverse outcome in certain matters could, from time to time, have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations or cash flows in particular quarterly or annual periods.

The
most significant actual or potential claims, lawsuits and other proceedings, of which we are currently aware are:

Inquiries and Investigations

In connection with the investigation commenced by the New York State Attorney General in April 2004 concerning, among other things, contingent
commissions paid by insurers to insurance brokers, in April 2005, the Company entered into an Assurance of Discontinuance ("NY AOD") with the New York State Attorney General and the Superintendent of
the New York Insurance Department and paid $50 million to eligible customers. As part of the NY AOD the Company also agreed not to accept contingent compensation and to disclose to customers
any compensation the Company will receive in connection with providing policy placement services to the customer. The Company also resolved similar investigations commenced by the Minnesota Attorney
General, the Florida Attorney General, the Florida


Department
of Financial Services and the Florida Office of Insurance Regulation for amounts that were not material to the Company. Similarly, in August 2005 HRH, which the Company acquired in October
2008, entered into an agreement with the Attorney General of the State of Connecticut (the "CT Attorney General") and the Insurance Commissioner of the State of Connecticut to resolve all issues
related to their investigations into certain insurance brokerage and insurance agency practices and to settle a lawsuit brought in August 2005 by the CT Attorney General alleging violations of the
Connecticut Unfair Trade Practices Act and the Connecticut Unfair Insurance Practices Act. As part of this settlement, HRH agreed to take certain actions including establishing a $30 million
national fund for distribution to certain clients, enhancing disclosure practices for agency and broker clients, and declining contingent compensation on brokerage business. The Company has
co-operated fully with other similar investigations by the regulators and/or attorneys general of other jurisdictions, some of which have been concluded with no indication of any finding
of wrongdoing.

The
European Commission issued questionnaires pursuant to its Sector Inquiry or, in respect of Norway, the European Free Trade Association Surveillance Authority, related to insurance business
practices, including compensation arrangements for brokers, to at least 150 European brokers including our operations in nine European countries. The Company responded to the European Commission
questionnaires and has filed the European Free Trade Association Surveillance Authority for two of its Norwegian entities. The European Commission reported on a final basis on September 25,
2007, expressing concerns over potential conflicts of interest in the industry relating to remuneration and binding authorities when assuming a dual role for clients and insurers and also over the
nature of the coinsurance market. The Company continues to co-operate with both the European Commission and the European Free Trade Association Surveillance Authority.

Since
August 2004, the Company and HRH (along with various other brokers and insurers) have been named as defendants in purported class actions in various courts across the United States. All of these
actions have been consolidated or are in the process of being consolidated into a single action in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey ("MDL"). There are two amended
complaints within the MDL, one that addresses employee benefits ("EB Complaint") and one that addresses all other lines of insurance ("Commercial Complaint"). HRH was a named defendant in the EB
Complaint, but has since been voluntarily dismissed. HRH is a named defendant in the Commercial Complaint. The Company is a named defendant in both MDL Complaints. The EB Complaint and the Commercial
Complaint seek monetary damages, including punitive damages, and equitable relief and make allegations regarding the practices and conduct that have been the subject of the investigation of state
attorneys general and insurance commissioners, including allegations that the brokers have breached their duties to their clients by entering into contingent compensation agreements with either no
disclosure or limited disclosure to clients and participated in other improper activities. The Complaints also allege the existence of a conspiracy among insurance carriers and brokers and allege
violations of federal antitrust laws, the federal RICO statute and the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 ("ERISA"). In separate decisions issued in August and September 2007, the
antitrust and RICO claims were dismissed with prejudice and the state claims were dismissed without prejudice from both Complaints. Plaintiffs have filed a notice of appeal regarding these dismissal
rulings and oral arguments on this appeal are scheduled to be heard in April 2009. In January 2008, the Judge dismissed the ERISA claims with prejudice from the EB Complaint. Additional actions could
be brought in the future by individual policyholders. The Company disputes the allegations in all of these suits and has been and intends to continue to defend itself vigorously against these actions.
The outcomes of these lawsuits, however, including any losses


or
other payments that may occur as a result, cannot be predicted at this time.

Reinsurance Market Dispute

Various legal proceedings are pending, have been concluded or may commence between reinsurers, reinsureds and in some cases their intermediaries,
including reinsurance brokers, relating to personal accident excess of loss reinsurance for the years 1993 to 1998. The proceedings principally concern allegations by reinsurers that they have
sustained substantial losses due to an alleged abnormal "spiral" in the market in which the reinsurance contracts were placed, the existence and nature of which, as well as other information, was not
disclosed to them by the reinsureds or their reinsurance broker. A "spiral" is a market term for a situation in which reinsureds and reinsurers reinsure each other with the effect that the same loss
or portion of that loss moves through the market multiple times.

The
reinsurers concerned have taken the position that, despite their decisions to underwrite risks or a group of risks, they are no longer bound by their reinsurance contracts. As a result, they have
stopped settling claims and are seeking to recover claims already paid. The Company also understands that there have been at least two arbitration awards in relation to a spiral, among other things,
in which the reinsurer successfully argued that it was no longer bound by parts of its reinsurance program. Willis Limited, the Company's principal insurance brokerage subsidiary in the United
Kingdom, acted as the reinsurance broker or otherwise as intermediary, but not as an underwriter, for numerous personal accident reinsurance contracts, including two contracts that were involved in
one of the arbitrations. Due to the small number of reinsurance brokers generally, Willis Limited was one of a small number of brokers active in the market for this reinsurance during the relevant
period. Willis Limited also utilized other brokers active in this market as sub-agents, including brokers who are parties to the legal proceedings described above, for certain contracts
and may be responsible for any errors and omissions they may have made.

In
July 2003, one of the reinsurers received a judgment in the English High Court against certain parties, including a sub-broker Willis Limited used to place two of the contracts involved
in this trial. Although neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries were a party to this proceeding or any arbitration, Willis Limited entered into tolling agreements with certain of the
principals to the reinsurance contracts tolling the statute of limitations pending the outcome of proceedings between the reinsureds and reinsurers.

Two
former clients of Willis Limited, American Reliable Insurance Company and one of its associated companies ("ARIC") and CNA Insurance Company Limited and two of its associated companies ("CNA")
have each terminated their respective tolling agreements with Willis Limited and commenced litigation in September 2007 and January 2008, respectively, in the English Commercial Court against Willis
Limited. ARIC has alleged conspiracy between a former Willis Limited employee and the ARIC underwriter as well as negligence and CNA has alleged deceit and negligence by the same Willis Limited
employee both in connection with placements of personal accident reinsurance in the excess of loss market in London and elsewhere. The Company disputes these allegations and is vigorously defending
itself in these actions. ARIC's asserted claim is approximately $257 million (plus unspecified interest and costs) and CNA's asserted claim is approximately $251 million (plus various
unspecified claims for exemplary damages, interest and costs). Pleadings have been exchanged in both actions and the parties have been and continue to be engaged in extensive discovery prior to the
trial which the Court has fixed on a preliminary basis for ten weeks commencing October 7, 2009. The Company cannot predict at this time what, if any, damages might result from these claims but
has kept its errors and omissions insurance carriers fully informed of developments in the claims. The Company believes that any amounts required to resolve the claims will be covered by errors and
omissions insurance.


Various
arbitrations continue to be active and from time to time the principals request co-operation from the Company and suggest that claims may be asserted against the Company. Such
claims may be made against the Company if reinsurers do not pay claims on policies issued by them. The Company cannot predict at this time whether any such claims will be made or the damages that may
be alleged.

Gender Discrimination Class Action

In March 2008, the Company settled an action in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York commenced against the Company
in 2001 on behalf of an alleged nationwide class of present and former female officer and officer equivalent employees alleging that the Company discriminated against them on the basis of their gender
and seeking injunctive relief, money damages, attorneys' fees and costs. Although the Court had denied plaintiffs' motions to certify a nationwide class or to grant nationwide discovery, it did
certify a class of approximately 200 female officers and officer equivalent employees based in the Company's offices in New York, New Jersey and Massachusetts. The settlement agreement provides for
injunctive relief and a monetary payment, including the amount of attorney fees plaintiffs' counsel are entitled to receive, which was not material to the Company. In December 2006, a former female
employee, whose motion to intervene in the class action was denied, filed a purported class action in the United States District Court, Southern District of New York, with almost identical allegations
as those contained in the suit that was settled in 2008, except seeking a class period of 1998 to the time of trial (the class period in the settled suit was 1998 to the end of 2001). The Company's
motion to dismiss this suit was denied and the

Court
did not grant the Company permission to immediately file an appeal from the denial of its motion to dismiss. The suit was recently amended to include two additional plaintiffs. The parties are
in the discovery phase of the litigation. The Company cannot predict at this time what, if any, damages might result from this action.

World Trade Center

We acted as the insurance broker, but not as an underwriter, for the placement of both property and casualty insurance for a number of entities which
were directly impacted by the September 11, 2001 destruction of the World Trade Center complex, including Silverstein Properties LLC, which acquired a 99-year leasehold
interest in the twin towers and related facilities from the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey in July 2001. Although the World Trade Center complex insurance was bound at or before the July
2001 closing of the leasehold acquisition, consistent with standard industry practice, the final policy wording for the placements was still in the process of being finalized when the twin towers and
other buildings in the complex were destroyed on September 11, 2001. There have been a number of lawsuits in the United States between the insured parties and the insurers for several
placements and other disputes may arise in respect of insurance placed by us which could affect the Company including claims by one or more of the insureds that we made culpable errors or omissions in
connection with our brokerage activities. However, we do not believe that our role as broker will lead to liabilities which in the aggregate would have a material adverse effect on our results of
operations, financial condition or liquidity.

There
are no governmental laws, decrees or regulations in Bermuda which will restrict the remittance of dividends or other payments to non-resident holders of the Company's common stock.

On
the date of this document there is no Bermuda income, corporation or profits tax, withholding tax, capital gains tax, capital transfer tax, estate duty or inheritance tax payable by us or our
shareholders, other than shareholders ordinarily resident in Bermuda.

Pursuant
to the Exempted Undertakings Tax Protection Act 1966, as amended, we have received an undertaking from the Bermuda Ministry of Finance, that, in the event of there being enacted in Bermuda
any legislation imposing withholding or other tax computed on profits or income, or computed on any capital assets, gain or appreciation or any tax in the nature of estate duty or inheritance tax,
such tax shall not until March 28, 2016 be applicable to us or to any of our operations, or to our Shares, debentures or other obligations except and so far as such tax applies to persons
ordinarily resident in Bermuda and holding such shares, debentures or other obligations or any land leased or let to us in Bermuda.

The
gross amount of dividends paid to US shareholders will be treated as dividend income to such holders, to the extent paid out of current or accumulated earnings and profits, as determined under
United States federal income tax principles. This income will be includable in the gross income of a US shareholder as ordinary income on the day received by the US shareholder. These dividends will
not be eligible for the dividends received deduction allowed to corporations under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.

With
respect to non-corporate US shareholders, certain dividends received before January 1, 2009


from
a qualified foreign corporation may be subject to reduced rates of taxation. A foreign corporation is treated as a qualified foreign corporation with respect to dividends received from that
corporation on shares that are readily tradable on an established securities market in the United States, such as our shares. Non-corporate US shareholders that do not meet a minimum
holding period requirement for our Shares during which they are not protected from the risk of loss or that elect to treat the dividend income as "investment income" pursuant to
section 163(d)(4) of the Code will not be eligible for the reduced rates of taxation regardless of our status as a qualified foreign corporation. In addition, the rate reduction will not apply
to dividends if the recipient of a dividend is obligated to make related payments with respect to positions in substantially similar or related property. This disallowance applies even if the minimum
holding period has been met. Non-corporate US shareholders should consult their own tax advisors regarding the application of these rules given their particular circumstances.

$100 invested in the Company, the S&P 500 and the peer group on January 1, 2003, assuming full dividend reinvestment.

Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use Of Proceeds

In addition to issuances disclosed in our quarterly filings throughout 2008 the Company issued a total of 71,989 shares of common stock, during the
period from October 1, 2008 to December 31, 2008 without registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, in reliance upon the exemption under Section 4(2) of such Act
relating to sales by an issuer not involving a public offering, none of which involved the sale of more than 1 percent of the outstanding shares of common stock of the Company.

Following the acquisition of HRH on October 1, 2008, certain HRH employees surrendered 7,342 shares to the Company in lieu of taxes payable on HRH
restricted stock which vested immediately prior to the acquisition. There were no other repurchases of the Company's common stock during the quarter ended December 31, 2008.

On
November 1, 2007, the Board of Directors authorized an open-ended plan to purchase, from time to time in the open market or

through
negotiated trades with persons who are not affiliates of the Company, shares of the Company's common stock at an aggregate purchase price of up to $1 billion. This authorization
replaced the $308 million remaining under the Company's previously announced $1 billion repurchase plan. In addition the board authorized in June 2008, the repurchase of up to the number
of shares issued by the Company in connection with the acquisition of HRH.

As
an intermediary, we hold funds in a fiduciary capacity for the account of third parties, typically as a result of premiums received from clients that are
in transit to insurance carriers and claims due to clients that are in transit from insurance carriers. We report premiums, which are held on account of, or due from policyholders, as assets with a
corresponding liability due to the insurance carriers. Claims held by, or due to, us which are due to clients are also shown as both assets and liabilities of ours. All those balances due or payable
are included in accounts receivable and payable on the balance sheet. Investment income is earned on those funds during the time between the receipt of the cash and the time the cash is paid out.
Fiduciary cash must be kept in certain regulated bank accounts subject to guidelines, which vary according to legal jurisdiction. These guidelines generally emphasize capital protection and liquidity.
Fiduciary cash is not available to service our debt or for other corporate purposes.


Item 7—Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

This discussion includes references to non-GAAP financial measures as defined in Regulation G of SEC rules. We present such non-GAAP financial
measures, as we believe such information is of interest to the investment community because it provides additional meaningful methods of evaluating certain aspects of the Company's operating
performance from period to period on a basis that may not be otherwise apparent on a GAAP basis. These financial measures should be viewed in addition to, not in lieu of, the Company's consolidated
financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2008.

This discussion includes forward-looking statements, including under the heading "Summary—2008 Expense Review," "—Market outlook" and
"—Financial Targets". Please see "Information Concerning Forward-Looking Statements" for certain cautionary information regarding forward-looking statements and a list of factors that
could cause actual results to differ materially from those predicted in the forward-looking statements.

BUSINESS OVERVIEW AND MARKET OUTLOOK

We
provide a broad range of insurance brokerage and risk management consulting services to our worldwide clients. Our core businesses include Aerospace; Energy; Marine; Construction;
Financial and Executive Risks; Fine Art, Jewelry and Specie; Special Contingency Risks; and Reinsurance.

In
our capacity as an advisor and insurance broker, we act as an intermediary between our clients and insurance carriers by advising our clients on their risk management requirements, helping clients
determine the best means of managing risk, and negotiating and placing insurance risk with insurance carriers through our global distribution network.

We
derive most of our revenues from commissions and fees for brokerage and consulting services and we do not determine the insurance premiums on which our commissions are generally based. Fluctuations
in these premiums charged by the insurance carriers have a direct and potentially material impact on our results of operations. Commission levels generally trend with such premium levels as they are
derived from a percentage of the premiums paid by the insureds. Due to the cyclical nature and impact of other market conditions on insurance premiums, they may vary widely between accounting periods.
Such variations can result in a reduction in premium rates leading to downward pressure on commission revenues (a "soft" market) which in turn can have a

potentially
material impact on our commission revenues and operating margin.

A
"hard" market occurs when premium uplifting factors, including a greater than anticipated loss experience or capital shortages, more than offset any downward pressures on premiums. This usually has
a favorable impact on our commission revenues and operating margin.

From
2000 through 2003 we benefited from a hard market with premium rates stable or increasing. During 2004, we saw a rapid transition from a hard market to a soft market, with premium rates falling
in most markets. The soft market continued through 2005 and 2006 with rates declining in most sectors, with the exception of catastrophe exposed markets.

In
2007, the market softened further and this has continued through 2008 with year on year premium rate decreases averaging approximately 10 percent across our market sectors during 2008.

It
is possible that the market may harden in 2009 as insurers seek higher premiums to cover a combination of weak investment returns, significant losses in 2008 and three years of soft market
underwriting. In the reinsurance market, we have seen stabilization in rates and early signs of market recovery going into 2009.

However,
these potential benefits may be offset in whole or in part by potential changes in the


buying
behavior of some of our clients as their businesses suffer from the current global market uncertainty. In particular, financial institutions, construction, aviation, and logistics businesses
such as marine cargo are most likely to be affected. Further, the global economic activity is

also
negatively affecting some of the international economies that have supported the strong growth in our International operations. Our employee benefits practice may also be adversely affected as
businesses continue to downsize during this period of economic turmoil.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Overview

Despite the difficult trading conditions in 2008, we reported 4 percent organic commissions and fee growth in 2008 compared with 2007,
reflecting growth in our International and Global Specialties operations, partly offset by a 1 percent fall in North America organic commissions and fees.

Operating
margin for full year 2008 was 18 percent compared with 24 percent for 2007, of which 4 percentage points were attributable to charges relating to our 2008 expense review
and 2 percentage points were attributable to the impact of foreign exchange movements.

In
October 2008, we completed the acquisition of HRH, the eighth largest insurance and risk intermediary in the United States. The acquisition doubled our North America revenues and the combined
Willis HRH operation has critical mass in key markets including California, Florida, Texas, Illinois, New York, Boston, New Jersey and Philadelphia.

Results 2008 compared with 2007

Net income in 2008 was $303 million, or $2.05 per diluted share, compared with $409 million, or $2.78 per diluted share, in 2007. The
benefits of good organic revenue growth, improved margins in our International and Global operations and a lower effective tax rate were more than offset by a $0.45 per diluted share impact of charges
for the 2008 expense review and a $0.27 per diluted share year on year impact from foreign exchange, discussed in detail within "General and administrative expenses" below.

HRH's
fourth quarter results, net of related funding costs and intangible amortization, contributed $0.04 per diluted share. New shares

issued
as part consideration for the HRH acquisition had an $0.11 dilutive impact on full year diluted earnings per share.

Total
revenues at $2,834 million were $256 million, or 10 percent, higher than in 2007. Organic revenue growth of 4 percent, a 7 percent benefit from net
acquisitions and disposals primarily reflecting the HRH acquisition and a 1 percentage point benefit from foreign currency translation were partly offset by lower investment and other income.
Organic revenue growth of 4 percent reflected net new business growth of 6 percent and a 2 percent negative impact from declining rates and other market factors. Net new business
growth benefitted from a 1 percentage point improvement in client retention rate to 91 percent, compared with 90 percent in 2007.

Operating
margin at 18 percent in 2008 was 6 percentage points lower than in 2007 with the decrease mainly reflecting:

•

the $92 million charge for the 2008 expense review, equivalent to 4 percentage points;

•

an adverse year on year impact from foreign currency translation, equivalent to approximately 2 percentage points;

•

a $22 million increase in intangibles amortization, of which $21 million related to HRH;

•

our continued investment in targeted new hires and Shaping our Future initiatives; and

•

lower investment and other income;

partly
offset by

•

increased productivity, with revenues per full time equivalent ("FTE") employee increasing to $190,000 in 2008 compared
with $186,000 in 2007;


•

HRH's $38 million operating income in fourth quarter 2008, equivalent to 1 percentage point; and

•

good cost control, the realization of savings from last year's Shaping our Future initiatives and lower pension costs.

A
combination of factors, including a reduction in the UK corporate tax rate and a change in our geographical mix of income, enabled us to reduce our effective underlying tax rate to 26 percent
in 2008 compared with 30 percent in 2007. This underlying rate excludes the tax effects of the disposal of our London headquarters, gains and losses on disposal of operations and the benefit of
the release of tax provisions relating to the resolution of prior period tax positions.

Results 2007 compared with 2006

Net income in 2007 was $409 million, or $2.78 per diluted share, compared with $449 million, or $2.84 per diluted share, in 2006 as the
benefits of increased revenues and a 1 percent increase in margin were more than offset by the non-recurrence of a $71 million tax credit in fourth quarter 2006, primarily
relating to the resolution of certain prior year tax matters.

Total
revenues at $2,578 million were $150 million, or 6 percent, higher than in 2006 of which 2 percent related to foreign currency translation and 1 percent to net
acquisitions and disposals. Organic revenue growth was 3 percent reflecting net new business growth of 4 percent and a 1 percent negative impact from declining rates and other
market factors.

Operating
margin at 24 percent was 1 percentage point higher than in 2006 mainly reflecting:

•

the $102 million gain on disposal of our London headquarters in 2006, equivalent to approximately a
4 percentage point decrease in margin;

•

the $105 million expenditure in 2006 to launch our Shaping our Future strategy, equivalent to approximately a
4 percentage point increase in margin;

•

the benefit of 2007 cost savings relating to our Shaping our Future strategy and lower charges for pensions and legal
provisions; and

•

an adverse year on year impact from foreign currency translation, equivalent to approximately a 1 percentage point
decrease in margin.

HRH acquisition

On October 1, 2008, we completed the acquisition of HRH, the eighth largest insurance and risk management intermediary in the United States.

We
believe that the acquisition of HRH will:

•

substantially improve our position in key markets including California, Florida, Texas, Illinois, New York, Boston, New
Jersey and Philadelphia;

•

greatly strengthen our position as a middle market broker and reinforce our large account presence; and

•

enable the combined Willis HRH operation to deliver enhanced value to clients through a more robust and diversified
platform.

We
also expect to achieve significant synergies by 2010 of approximately $140 million as we centralize HRH's dispersed back office processes and integrate these into Willis hubs, rationalize
the combined office network and close down HRH's Richmond head office.

Assuming
the acquisition had occurred on January 1, 2007, pro forma combined revenues for the Group for full year 2008 would have been $3,451 million (2007: $3,378 million), of
which $1,546 million, or 45 percent (2007: $1,586 million, or 47 percent), would be attributable to North America operations.

Total
consideration paid by Willis for HRH was approximately $1.8 billion, which comprised approximately 24.4 million shares of common stock valued at $792 million and
$982 million of cash. The total purchase price of approximately $2.1 billion included the assumption of approximately $340 million of HRH existing debt. The funding of the HRH
transaction is discussed in "

Cash and financing

" below.


On
acquisition we recognized an intangible asset of $639 million comprising:

October 1,


(millions)

Customer relationships

$


Non-compete agreements


Trade names


$


Customer relationships were identified as the key intangible asset as HRH has historically generated approximately 95 percent of its revenues from
existing customers. The charge for HRH's intangible amortization was $21 million in fourth quarter 2008; we expect the full year 2009 charge relating to HRH's intangibles to be
$82 million.

We
recognized goodwill on the acquisition of $1.6 billion. However, we are still in the process of finalizing the valuation of certain assets and liabilities, thus the purchase price allocation
is still subject to refinement.

HRH
is being rapidly integrated into our North America segment. We complete our annual goodwill impairment review in the fourth quarter. Based on our forecasts of the combined Willis HRH's future
revenue streams and anticipated synergies from the deal, we believe the combined goodwill for North America of $1,810 million was not impaired as of December 31, 2008. However, if we
fail to recognize some or all of the strategic benefits and synergies expected from the HRH transaction, goodwill may be impaired in future periods.

Other acquisitions

Additionally in 2008, we acquired a further 10 percent of voting rights in Gras Savoye & Cie, our French associate at a cost of
approximately $70 million, bringing our ownership share of voting rights to approximately 48 percent as at December 31, 2008.

2008 expense review

Our Shaping our Future strategy is a series of initiatives designed to deliver profitable growth. As previously announced, we
decided:

•

to invest in further key hires and initiatives in 2008 and 2009;

and,
in order to fund a portion of these initiatives,

•

to conduct a thorough review in 2008 of all businesses to identify additional opportunities to rationalize our expense
base.

In
2008, we incurred a pre-tax charge of $92 million ($66 million net of tax, equivalent to $0.45 per diluted share) comprising:

•

$42 million to buy out remuneration packages that no longer align with the Group's overall remuneration strategy;

•

$24 million of severance costs relating to approximately 350 positions which have been eliminated; and

•

$26 million of other operating expenses, including property and systems rationalization costs.

In
light of the current global economic uncertainty, we are vigorously reviewing our cost base and will continue our right-sizing initiatives in 2009. Our current right-sizing initiatives emphasize
cost discipline including talent management, location optimization and aggressive reduction of discretionary spending. We now expect that the 2008 charges above, together with the benefits of the
ongoing review, may lead to 2009 cost savings in excess of the $45 million to $55 million originally estimated.

Financial targets

In light of the current uncertainty in the global economy, we have suspended our practice of providing annual earnings guidance for the year ahead,
as we cannot predict the potential impact of this uncertainty on insurance pricing or on potential changes in the buying decisions of clients with any degree of certainty.

In
addition, our previously stated earnings per share targets should not be relied upon.


Cash and financing

Cash at December 31, 2008 was $176 million; $24 million lower than at December 31, 2007.

Net
cash from operating activities of $211 million and net proceeds from the issuance of long and short-term debt totaling $1,669 million, together with a net
$30 million benefit from other smaller cash flows less the impact of foreign exchange, were used to fund:

•

acquisitions of $978 million, of which $926 million related to HRH;

•

repayments of outstanding debt of $641 million, of which $341 million related to HRH debt assumed on the
acquisition;

•

dividend payments of $146 million;

•

fixed asset additions of $94 million, of which $38 million related to our new London headquarters building;
and

•

share buybacks of $75 million.

Total
long-term debt at December 31, 2008 was $1,865 million (December 31, 2007: $1,250 million), total short-term debt was $785 million
(December 31, 2007: nil) and total stockholders' equity was $1,845 million (December 31, 2007: $1,347 million) giving a capitalization ratio (total long-term
and short-term debt to total long-term debt, short-term debt and stockholders' equity) of 59 percent at December 31, 2008 compared with
48 percent at December 31, 2007. The 11 percent increase in the capitalization ratio is mainly attributable to debt drawn down as part of the HRH acquisition, partly offset by the
$792 million equity issued to fund the remainder of the transaction.

On
October 1, 2008, we funded the HRH acquisition with $1 billion from an interim credit facility and $525 million from a $700 million 5-year term loan
facility. In addition, we repaid the outstanding balance on our existing revolving credit facility and replaced this with a new 5-year $300 million line of credit.

During
fourth quarter 2008, we repaid $250 million of the then outstanding $1 billion balance on the interim credit facility funded by

using
free cash flow (cash flow from operating and investing activities excluding acquisitions, disposals and additional pension contributions) of $75 million together with the draw down of the
remaining $175 million available under the 5-year term loan facility.

In
February 2009, we entered into an agreement with Goldman Sachs Mezzanine Partners to issue 12.875 percent senior unsecured notes due 2016 in an aggregate principal amount of
$500 million. The transaction is subject to customary closing conditions and is expected to close during March 2009. The net proceeds of the issue will be used to repay approximately
$480 million of the interim credit facility. We expect to be able to repay the approximately $270 million remaining balance on this short-term facility over the next two
quarters from free cash flow and proceeds from the sale of non-core businesses.

Over
time, following full repayment of the interim credit facility, and subject to limitations in our debt facilities, we also plan to repurchase the majority of the shares issued in connection with
the acquisition of HRH under our existing $1 billion buyback authorization.

Liquidity

We believe that existing cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2008 of $176 million, the consummation of the agreement with Goldman
Sachs Mezzanine Partners to issue $500 million of senior unsecured notes, availability under our $300 million revolving credit facility together with future generation of free cash flow
and proceeds from the sale of non-core businesses should be adequate to meet our cash needs for at least the next 12 months. These sources of liquidity should also be adequate to
finance full repayment of the $750 million outstanding balance on our interim credit facility, current portions of our long-term debt and other contractual obligations and presently
known operating needs.

Long-term
liquidity for debt service and other contractual obligations will be dependent on continued generation of free cash flow and,


given
favorable market conditions, future borrowings or refinancing. However, our cash requirements could be materially affected by a deterioration in our results of operations, as well as various
uncertainties discussed in this section and elsewhere in this document, which could require us to pursue other financing options, including, but not limited to, additional borrowings, debt
refinancing, asset sales or other financing alternatives. With the current tightening in the credit markets, the amount and terms, if any, of these financing sources cannot be assured.

We
continue to identify and implement further actions to control costs and enhance our operating performance, including cash flow. These actions include the rationalization of our cost base through
the 2008 expense review and our ongoing right-sizing initiatives to achieve best fit within the current environment.

Share buybacks

On November 1, 2007, the Board authorized a new share buyback program for $1 billion. This replaced our previous $1 billion
buyback program and its remaining $308 million

authorization.
In addition the board authorized in June 2008, the repurchase of up to the number of shares issued by the Company in connection with the acquisition of HRH.

In
first quarter 2008, we repurchased 2.3 million shares at a cost of $75 million under the new authorization of which $925 million is outstanding.

London headquarters

We completed the move from Ten Trinity Square into our new London headquarters on Lime Street in April 2008. We entered into an agreement to lease
the Lime Street building in November 2004, and took control of the building in June 2007, under a 25 year lease. Annual rentals are approximately $35 million per year and we have
subleased or agreed to sublease approximately 30 percent of the site under leases with terms up to 15 years. The outstanding contractual obligation for lease rentals at
December 31, 2008 was $720 million and the amounts receivable from committed subleases were $106 million.

Organic
revenue growth excludes the impact of foreign currency translation, the first twelve months of net commission and fee revenues generated from

of calculating this measure may differ from that used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited.

(ii)

Effective
October 1, 2008, we changed how we calculate organic growth in commissions and fees. Previously, organic growth included growth from
acquisitions from the date of acquisition. Under the new method, the first twelve months of commissions and fees generated from acquisitions are excluded from organic growth in commissions and fees.


Our
2008 total revenues at $2,834 million were $256 million, or 10 percent, higher than in 2007, reflecting a 7 percent benefit from net acquisitions and disposals
principally attributable to HRH, organic commissions and fee growth of 4 percent and a 1 percentage point benefit from foreign currency translation, partly offset by lower investment and
other income.

Our
International and Global operations earn a significant portion of their revenues in currencies other than the US dollar. For the year ended December 31, 2008, reported revenues in
International benefited from the year on year weakening of the US dollar against the euro, compared with 2007. However, in our Global operations the revenue line benefit of the stronger euro
was offset by sterling weakening against the US dollar, compared with 2007.

Investment
income was $81 million for 2008, $15 million lower than in 2007, with the decrease reflecting lower average interest rates in 2008. We expect investment income to decrease by
approximately $20 million in 2009 compared with 2008 as interest rates have continued to experience sharp declines across the globe. This estimated decrease includes the mitigating effect of
our forward hedging program, from which we expect to generate significant savings compared to LIBOR based rates.

Other
income was $2 million for 2008, $17 million lower than in 2007 which benefited

from
a higher than usual level of proceeds from the sale of books of business.

Organic
growth in commissions and fees in 2008 was 4 percent compared with 2007, reflecting

•

net new business growth of 6 percent which comprised good growth in our International and Global Specialties
businesses offset by lower revenues in North America and Reinsurance. Net new business growth also included the benefit of our Shaping our Future growth initiatives and a 1 percentage point
improvement in client retention rates to 91 percent for 2008 compared with 90 percent for 2007;

partly
offset by

•

a negative 2 percent impact from premium rates and other market factors in 2008. The impact of significant rate
decreases in both periods has been tempered by the benefit of other market factors, including higher commission rates, client profitability analyses, higher insured values and changes in limits or
exposures.

Our 2007 total revenues of $2,578 million were $150 million, or 6 percent, higher than in 2006 of which 2 percent was attributable
to foreign currency translation and 1 percent to net acquisitions and disposals.

For
the year ended December 31, 2007, reported revenues in International benefited significantly from the year on year effect of foreign currency translation, in particular due to the weakening
of the dollar against both sterling and the euro, compared with 2006.

Net
acquisitions and disposals added a net 1 percent to total revenues in 2007 which was primarily attributable to the acquisitions of: InsuranceNoodle in Chicago; Burkart Risk Consulting and
Partner in Switzerland; and Gras Savoye Re, a new venture with Gras Savoye & Cie.

Organic
growth in commissions and fees in 2007 was 3 percent compared with 2006, reflecting

net new business growth of 4 percent, together with the benefit of maintaining client retention levels in excess of
90 percent;

2008 compared with 2007

General and administrative expenses at $2,247 million for 2008 were $339 million, or 18 percent, higher than in 2007 of
which:

•

$141 million, or 7 percentage points, was attributable to the fourth quarter acquisition of HRH;

•

$92 million, or 5 percentage points, was attributable to the charge for the 2008 expense review discussed
above, of which $66 million related to salaries and benefits and $26 million to other expenses; and

•

a foreign exchange loss of $68 million, or 4 percentage points, including $34 million related to the
revaluation of our UK pension benefits asset as discussed below together with $23 million relating to pound sterling purchases to fund the Company's contributions to the plan.

Salaries
and benefits were 58 percent of 2008 revenues, compared with 56 percent in 2007, with the increase reflecting:

•

the $66 million charge relating to the 2008 expense review; and

•

continued hiring in targeted development areas including selected US regions; targeted International growth areas such as
Spain, Italy, Denmark and Brazil; and a number of our London specialty businesses;

partly
offset by

•

increased productivity: average revenues per FTE employee at constant exchange rates were approximately $190,000 in 2008
compared with $186,000 in 2007;

•

the benefits of cost controls and previous Shaping our Future initiatives; and

•

a $15 million reduction in pension charges. This decrease was mainly attributable to an increase in the expected
return on assets in the UK pension plan reflecting higher opening asset levels due to the significant additional contributions we have made.

Net
headcount on an FTE basis at December 31, 2008 was approximately 17,000 compared with approximately 13,000 at December 31, 2007, with the increase primarily reflecting the
acquisition of HRH. The increase in average revenues per FTE employee discussed above reflected growth

across
all business units, particularly driven by our International business which has continued its record of outstanding growth.

Other
expenses were 21 percent of revenues in 2008 compared with 18 percent in 2007, with the increase reflecting:

•

$33 million additional other expenses in fourth quarter 2008 as a result of the HRH acquisition, equivalent to
approximately 1 percentage point;

•

the $26 million charge relating to the 2008 expense review, equivalent to approximately 1 percentage point;
and

•

a $34 million foreign exchange loss related to the revaluation of our UK pension benefits asset. This asset is a
sterling denominated asset but a portion of the asset is held within our UK London market operations, which are US dollar denominated for accounting purposes. As the dollar strengthened significantly
against sterling in 2008, the revaluation of the sterling pension benefits asset gave rise to a foreign exchange loss.

We
have a program that hedges our sterling cash outflows from our London market operations, as part of which we hedge the sterling denominated cash contributions into the UK pension plan. However, we
do not hedge against the pension benefits asset or liability recognized for accounting purposes.

The
effects of the above increases were partly mitigated by the benefits of our continued focus on cost controls.

2007 compared with 2006

General and administrative expenses at $1,908 million for 2007 were $3 million lower than in 2006. This decrease was mainly
attributable to:

•

the 2006 strategic initiative expenditure of $96 million relating to the launch of our Shaping our Future strategy,
of which $59 million related to salaries and benefits and $37 million to other expenses; and

•

the benefits of our Shaping our Future initiatives;


partly
offset by

•

a 4 percent adverse impact from foreign currency translation.

Salaries
and benefits were 56 percent of 2007 revenues, compared with 60 percent in 2006, with the decrease reflecting:

•

the $59 million benefit as a result of 2006 strategic initiative expenditure, equivalent to approximately
2 percentage points;

•

the benefits of cost controls and our Shaping our Future initiatives; and

•

a $36 million reduction in pension charges, equivalent to approximately 1 percentage point. This decrease
was mainly attributable to an increase in the expected return on assets in the UK plan reflecting higher asset levels due to the significant additional contributions we have made in 2007 and 2006;

partly
offset by

•

an adverse impact from foreign currency translation, equivalent to approximately 4 percentage points; and

•

continued hiring in targeted development areas, including energy, construction, marine, financial institutions,
reinsurance analytics and employee benefits.

Other
expenses were 18 percent of revenues in 2007 compared with 19 percent in 2006, with the decrease reflecting:

•

the $37 million benefit as a result of 2006 strategic initiative expenditure, equivalent to approximately
2 percentage points;

•

a $22 million reduction in the net charge for legal provisions, reflecting both the favorable resolution of a small
number of potentially significant claims and the benefit of a favorable trend in UK claims expense; and

•

the benefit of our continued focus on cost controls;

partly
offset by

•

an adverse impact from foreign currency translation, equivalent to approximately 4 percentage points; and

•

a $17 million additional rental expense recognized in second half 2007, following practical completion of our new
London headquarters in June 2007 which gave us control of the building.

Other
expenses in 2007 also included $13 million of rent on our then existing London headquarters building, following its sale and leaseback in September 2006. We terminated this lease when we
completed the move to our new London headquarters in April 2008. Of the $121 million pre-tax gain on the sale of the building, $22 million was deferred and subsquently
recognized over the revised life of the lease, of which $14 million was recognized in 2007.

Depreciation and amortization

Depreciation
and amortization of $90 million in 2008 was $24 million higher than in 2007 with the increase primarily attributable to a $21 million charge in fourth quarter 2008
in respect of intangible assets recognized on the HRH acquisition.

Depreciation
and amortization was $66 million in 2007 compared to $63 million in 2006 with the increase mainly attributable to the initial depreciation of assets associated with World
Financial Center, our new lease in New York.

2008 compared with 2007

Operating margin was 18 percent in 2008 compared with 24 percent in 2007. This decrease reflected the impact
of:

•

the $92 million charge for the 2008 expense review, equivalent to 4 percentage points;

•

a negative 2 percentage point impact from foreign exchange movements as discussed in "General and administrative
expenses" above;

•

a $22 million increase in intangibles amortization, of which $21 million related to HRH;

•

our continued investments in targeted new hires and Shaping our Future initiatives; and

•

lower investment and other income;

partly
offset by

•

increased productivity, with revenues at constant exchange rates per FTE employee increasing to $190,000 in 2008 compared
with $186,000 in 2007;

•

a $38 million benefit from the operating income contribution of HRH in the fourth quarter; and

•

good cost control, the realization of savings from Shaping our Future initiatives and lower pension costs.

2007 compared with 2006

Operating margin was 24 percent in 2007 compared with 23 percent in 2006. This increase reflected the impact
of:

•

the $105 million of expenditure in 2006 in support of the Shaping our Future strategic initiatives, equivalent to
4 percentage points; and

•

a 4 percentage point improvement in our retail margin, reflecting the increased margins in both North America and
International as a result of our focus on productivity and profitable growth, together with the benefit of lower charges for pensions and legal provisions in our UK and US operations;

partly
offset by

•

the $102 million pre-tax gain on the sale of our London headquarters, equivalent to
4 percentage points; and

•

a 2 percentage point reduction in Global's operating margin mainly reflecting the difficult reinsurance trading
environment and an adverse impact from foreign exchange, partly offset by the benefit of our productivity initiatives and the benefit of lower charges for pensions and legal provisions.

Operating
segment margins are discussed further in "Operating Results—Segment Information" below.

Interest expense

Interest
expense in 2008 of $105 million was $39 million higher than in 2007 with the increase reflecting:

•

$18 million additional interest expense in 2008 relating to our new term loan and interim credit facilities
connected with the HRH acquisition;

•

a $9 million charge for amortization of debt fees associated with the above facilities;

•

$9 million additional interest expense in 2008 due to fixed term $600 million senior notes issued in March
2007; and

•

increased interest relating to higher average drawings under our revolving credit facilities.

Interest
expense was $66 million in 2007 compared with $38 million in 2006, with the increase due to higher average levels of debt at higher interest rates following the issuance of
$600 million of senior notes in March 2007. Interest expense will increase in 2009 as a result of higher average levels of debt due to the HRH acquisition and higher rates of interest on the
anticipated Goldman Sachs financing.

%

2008 compared with 2007

The effective tax rate in 2008 was 24 percent compared with 26 percent in 2007, with the decrease in rate
reflecting:

•

a change in the geographical mix of profits with a greater proportion of profits being earned outside the United States;

•

non-taxable exchange gains arising from the significant movement in the exchange rate between the US dollar
and sterling; and

•

a decrease in the statutory rate of corporation tax in the UK from 30 percent in 2007 to an effective rate of
28.5 percent in 2008;

partly
offset by

•

the benefit of a $10 million release of tax provisions in 2007 compared to a $2 million release in 2008.
Both 2008 and 2007

benefited
from the release of tax provisions relating to prior tax periods following the resolution of tax issues surrounding prior debt refinancing; and

•

a one-off benefit of $4 million in 2007 relating to the restatement of the closing UK deferred tax
liabilities to reflect the reduced rate of corporation tax applicable on the reversal of those liabilities.

2007 compared with 2006

The effective tax rate in 2007 was 26 percent compared with 12 percent in 2006. The lower effective tax rate in 2006 is primarily
attributable to a $65 million tax credit in 2006 arising following the resolution of complex tax issues associated with the original KKR acquisition structure, together with a low tax rate on
the gain on disposal of our previous London headquarters also in 2006.

the decrease mainly reflecting the impact of:

•

the $66 million post-tax impact of charges associated with the 2008 expense review, equivalent to
$0.45 per diluted share; and

•

a year on year accounting loss of $0.27 per diluted share primarily relating to the retranslation of our sterling
denominated UK pension benefits asset as discussed in

"General

partly
offset by

•

strong organic revenue growth in 2008; and

•

a year on year benefit from a lower effective tax rate of $0.09 per diluted share.

HRH's
fourth quarter results, net of related funding costs and intangible amortization, contributed $0.04 per diluted share.

Average
diluted sharecount increased from 147 million in 2007 to 148 million in 2008 as the impact of the 11.5 million shares


repurchased
under accelerated share repurchase programs in first half 2007 was more than offset by the additional 24.4 million shares issued on October 1, 2008 as part consideration for
the HRH acquisition. The additional shares issued had a negative $0.11 cent impact on earnings per diluted share in 2008.

2007 compared with 2006

Net income for 2007 was $409 million, or $2.78 per diluted share, compared with $449 million, or $2.84 per diluted share, in 2006 with
the decrease mainly reflecting the impact of:

•

the $94 million post-tax gain on the sale of our London headquarters in 2006, equivalent to $0.59 per
diluted share;

•

the $71 million tax credit in 2006 as discussed above, equivalent to $0.45 per diluted share; and

•

a $20 million post-tax increase in interest expense in 2007 reflecting increased long-term borrowing
to fund share buybacks and

additional

Foreign
currency translation had a $0.06 negative year on year impact on diluted earnings per share in 2007.

diluted sharecount reduced from 158 million in 2006 to 147 million in 2007 primarily reflecting the impact of the 15 million shares repurchased under accelerated share
repurchase programs in November 2006 and March 2007. After taking into account incremental funding costs, there was a $0.09 benefit to diluted earnings per share from these share buybacks for 2007.

In
2008, the Company changed its basis of segmental allocation for central costs. All accounting adjustments for foreign exchange hedging activities and
foreign exchange movements on the UK pension plan asset or liability are held at the Corporate level, together with legal costs that are managed centrally. As a result of this change, $nil in 2007 and
$2 million net operating loss for full year 2006, previously allocated to the operating segments, has been reported within Corporate.

$1 million net operating profit for full year 2007 and $10 million net operating loss for full year 2006, previously allocated to the Global segment, has been reported within Corporate.

(ii)

Organic
revenue growth excludes the impact of foreign currency translation, the first twelve months of net commission and fee revenues generated from
acquisitions, the net commission and fee revenues related to operations disposed of in each period presented, market remuneration, investment income and other income from reported revenues. Our method
of calculating this measure may differ from that used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited.

(iii)

Effective
October 1, 2008, we changed how we calculate organic growth in commissions and fees. Previously, organic growth included growth from
acquisitions from the date of acquisition. Under the new method, the first twelve months of commissions and fees generated from acquisitions are excluded from organic growth in commissions and fees.

Revenues:

2008 compared with 2007

Commissions and fees were $34 million, or 5 percent, higher in 2008 compared with 2007 of which 3 percent was attributable to
the net impact of acquisitions and disposals, mainly due to HRH's UK-based specialty business. There was no net impact from foreign currency translation as a benefit from the euro
strengthening year on year against the dollar was offset by a negative impact from sterling weakening against the dollar.

Organic
revenue growth was 2 percent as the benefit of good growth in Global Specialties was partly offset by lower commissions and fees in Reinsurance.

Global
Specialties revenue growth reflected the benefit of good growth in Marine, Financial Institutions, Bloodstock, Jewelry, Specie and Global Markets and was achieved despite significant rate
reductions.

Organic
revenues in Reinsurance in 2008 were adversely impacted by a combination of declining rates and a reduction in amounts reinsured. We continue to make investments in Reinsurance to strengthen
capital markets and analytics capabilities throughout the soft market and are beginning to see the positive results of this investment as we move into 2009.

Client
retention levels in Global improved to 90 percent in 2008 compared with 89 percent in 2007.

Revenues: 2007 compared with 2006

Commissions and fees were $13 million, or 2 percent, higher in 2007 compared with 2006 of which 1 percent was attributable to
the net impact of acquisitions and disposals and 1 percent to foreign currency translation. Organic revenue growth was flat in 2007 with the benefit of a 6 percent increase in Global


Specialties
offset by a 4 percent decrease in Reinsurance.

Global
Specialties revenue growth reflected the benefit of one-time income from satellite launches and strong growth in Construction, especially in global infrastructure projects, together
with good performances from Energy, Financial Institutions and Niche. This revenue growth was achieved despite significant rate reductions with rates decreasing in: Aerospace by some 15 to
20 percent year on year; Marine Hull by 15 to 20 percent; Marine cargo by 25 to 40 percent; and Financial Institutions, Energy and Niche by some 10 to 15 percent.

Organic
revenues in Reinsurance declined in 2007 and were adversely impacted by a combination of declining rates, a reduction in amounts reinsured and other changes, including recent changes in
Florida legislation which significantly increased capacity and reduced prices.

Operating margin:

2008 compared with 2007

Operating margin in our Global operations was 29 percent in 2008 compared with 28 percent in 2007, as the benefit of organic revenue
growth in Global Specialties was partly offset by the impact of lower revenues in Reinsurance and an adverse impact from foreign exchange.

Operating
margin in Global Specialties increased in 2008 compared with 2007 as the benefit from organic revenue growth, lower pension costs and our Shaping our Future initiatives more than offset
further spend on targeted hires and strategic initiatives.

Operating
margin in Reinsurance in 2008 was broadly in line with 2007 as the impact of lower

commissions
and fees was largely offset by the benefits of Shaping our Future initiatives, lower pension costs and the positive results of our continued investments to strengthen capital markets and
analytics capabilities throughout the soft market.

Operating margin: 2007 compared with 2006

Operating margin in our Global operations was 28 percent in 2007 compared with 31 percent in 2006. Revenues in our Global operations
are largely US dollar denominated while our expense base is primarily sterling denominated. The weakening of average dollar rates against sterling generated a negative 2 percentage point impact
on Global's margin.

Operating
margin in Global Specialties decreased in 2007 compared with 2006 as the moderate revenue growth achieved against the backdrop of a very tough rate environment was more than offset by
expense growth. The expense growth reflected an adverse impact from foreign exchange and continued hiring in targeted areas such as Construction, Energy and Financial Institutions, partly offset by
the benefits of Shaping our Future initiatives, lower charges for pension costs and legal provisions and good cost control.

Reinsurance's
operating margin in 2007 was broadly in line with 2006 as the decline in revenues, an adverse impact from foreign exchange and our continued investment in analytics were offset by the
benefit of lower charges for pension costs and legal provisions, and good cost control.

Organic
revenue growth excludes the impact of foreign currency translation, the first twelve months of net commission and fee revenues generated from
acquisitions, the net commission and fee revenues related to operations disposed of in each period presented, market remuneration, investment income and other income from reported revenues. Our method

(iv)

Effective
October 1, 2008, we changed how we calculate organic growth in commissions and fees. Previously, organic growth included growth from
acquisitions from the date of acquisition. Under the new method, the first twelve months of commissions and fees generated from acquisitions are excluded from organic growth in commissions and fees.

Revenues:

2008 compared with 2007

Commissions and fees in North America were $161 million, or 21 percent, higher in 2008 compared with 2007, of which $181 million
was attributable to HRH's fourth quarter 2008 revenues. Excluding HRH, organic commissions and fees declined by 1 percent reflecting the soft market conditions.

Chicago,
Georgia, Houston, Boston and Knoxville all generated growth in excess of 5 percent though several offices recorded significant declines in the difficult market conditions.

The
integration of the HRH acquisition made good progress in fourth quarter 2008 with only 2 percent attrition of legacy HRH producers since the announcement of the HRH acquisition in
June 2008.

Client
retention levels improved to 91 percent in 2008, an increase of 3 percentage points from 2007, and productivity continued to improve with an approximately 2 percent rise in
revenues per FTE employee in 2008 compared with 2007.

Revenues: 2007 compared with 2006

Commissions and fees in North America were $7 million, or 1 percent, higher in 2007 compared with 2006 which was attributable to
organic growth. The organic revenue growth was achieved in the face of declining rates across most regions of the United States: MarketScout data for 2007 showed average property and casualty rate
declines in the year of 13 percent. Despite the declining rates, we saw good growth in the Southeast, Central and New York regions and in our program business and employee benefits.


The
rate of organic revenue growth moderated in 2007 compared to previous years as the focus was on profitable growth. From mid-2006 we moderated the pace of hiring and at the same time
managed out under performers. Consequently, while there was a year on year decline in producers, revenue per FTE employee was 5 percent higher in 2007 compared with 2006.

Operating margin:

2008 compared with 2007

Operating margin in North America in 2008 was 15 percent compared with 19 percent in 2007. The decrease of 4 percentage points
reflected:

•

lower commissions and fees, reflecting the soft market conditions;

•

a $15 million decrease in other income compared with 2007 which benefited from higher than usual proceeds from the
sale of books of business; and

•

continued spend on targeted new hires and other initiatives;

partly
offset by

•

the acquisition of HRH which contributed $38 million of operating income in fourth quarter 2008; and

•

the benefit of increased revenue per FTE employee and other cost savings.

Operating margin: 2007 compared with 2006

Operating margin in North America was 19 percent in 2007 compared with 17 percent in 2006 and reflected the benefit of the increased
revenue per employee and effective expense control, together with a $5 million increase in proceeds from the sale of books of business. Margin improvement was most significant in our New York
and Central regions.

Revenues:

2008 compared with 2007

Commissions and fees in International were $93 million, or 10 percent, higher than in 2008 compared with 2007.

A
significant part of International's revenues are earned in currencies other than the US dollar and foreign currency translation benefited 2008 revenues by 1 percent compared with 2007.

Organic
revenue growth of 9 percent in 2008 was achieved despite declining rates in most countries.

We
have seen consistent growth in our International business over the last three years, with all twelve quarters in this period showing growth of 5 percent or higher, with Spain, Denmark and
Latin America continuing to contribute significantly.

Productivity
in International continued to improve with revenues per FTE employee rising by 6 percent in 2008 compared with 2007 and average client retention levels remaining high at
91 percent.

Revenues: 2007 compared with 2006

Commissions and fees in International were $115 million, or 14 percent, higher in 2007 compared with 2006. Some 6 percent of
this increase was attributable to foreign currency translation as a significant part of International's revenues are earned in currencies that have strengthened against the dollar on a year on year
basis, in particular the euro. Organic growth of 8 percent was achieved despite declining rates in most countries, with decreases of between 5 and 20 percent.

Organic
growth in 2008 was driven by the emerging markets, particularly Latin America, China and Asia, all of which continued to generate strong double-digit growth. The emerging market growth was
complemented by good growth in mainland Europe, especially in the Nordic region, Spain, Italy and Eastern Europe. However, there was a modest decline in our UK and Irish operations revenues compared
with 2006 primarily due to the declining rates environment, with decreases averaging between 15 and 20 percent.

Operating margin:

2008 compared with 2007

Operating margin in International was 28 percent in 2008 compared with 25 percent in 2007, with the 3 percentage point
improvement reflecting the strong organic revenue growth, increased productivity and continued expense discipline partly offset by significant investment in targeted hires and the adverse impact of
declining rates in most countries.

Operating margin: 2007 compared with 2006

Operating margin in International was 25 percent in 2007 compared with 20 percent in 2006, with the 5 percentage point
improvement reflecting the strong organic revenue growth, particularly in the emerging markets, coupled with sustained cost control and a lower UK pension expense.

Significant
operating margin improvement was reported across most areas of our International segment as the effect of strong organic revenue growth, our productivity efficiencies and joint focus more
than offset the adverse impact of declining rates in most countries.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES

Our
accounting policies are described in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Management considers that the following accounting estimates or assumptions are the
most important to the presentation of our financial condition or operating performance. Management has discussed its critical accounting estimates and associated disclosures with our Audit Committee.

Pension expense

We maintain defined benefit pension plans that cover a majority of our employees in the United States and United Kingdom. Both these plans are now
closed to new entrants. New entrants in the United Kingdom are offered the opportunity to join a defined contribution plan and in the United States are offered the opportunity to join a
401(k) plan. We also have smaller defined benefit schemes in Ireland, Germany, Denmark


and
the Netherlands: these schemes have combined total assets of $89 million and a combined liability for pension benefits of $29 million as of December 31, 2008. Elsewhere,
pension benefits are typically provided through defined contribution plans.

We
make a number of assumptions when determining our pension liabilities and pension expense which are reviewed annually by senior management and changed where appropriate. The discount rate will be
changed annually if underlying rates have moved whereas the expected long-term return on assets will be changed less frequently as longer term trends in asset returns emerge. Other
material assumptions include rates of participant mortality, the expected long-term rate of compensation and pension increases and rates of employee termination.

We
recorded a net pension credit on our UK and US defined benefit pension plans in 2008 of $25 million, compared to a net pension credit of $10 million in 2007, an increase of
$15 million.

The
UK plan increase was $17 million mainly reflecting an increase in the expected return on assets in the UK plan due to higher asset levels following significant additional contributions in
2007 and 2008 and increased member contributions in 2008. The US pension charge was $2 million higher in 2008 compared with 2007.

Based
on December 31, 2008 assumptions, we expect the net pension credit in 2008 to decrease to a net pension expense in 2009 of between $50 to $60 million due to lower expected asset
returns and increased amortization following the significant asset losses in the UK and US during 2008.

Expected long-term rates of return on plan assets are developed from the expected future returns of the various asset classes using the target asset
allocations. The expected long-term rate of return used for determining the net UK pension expense in 2008 remained unchanged at 7.75 percent, equivalent to an expected return in
2008 of $184 million. The expected and actual returns on UK plan assets for the three years ended December 31, 2008 were as follows:

During the latter half of 2008 the value of assets held by our pension plans has been significantly adversely affected by the turmoil in worldwide markets. The
holdings of equity securities by our UK and US pension plans have been particularly affected.

Rates
used to discount pension plan liabilities at December 31, 2008 were based on yields prevailing at that date of high quality corporate bonds of appropriate maturity. The selected rate used
to discount UK plan liabilities was 6.5 percent compared with 5.9 percent at December 31, 2007 with the increase reflecting an increase in UK long-term bond rates in the latter
part of 2008. The higher discount rate and reduced inflation assumption generated an actuarial gain of $248 million at December 31, 2008.


Mortality
assumptions at December 31, 2008 were changed from December 31, 2007. The new mortality assumption is the 100 percent PNA00 table without an age adjustment. As an

indication
of the longevity assumed, our calculations assume that a UK male retiree aged 65 at December 31, 2008 would have a life expectancy of 22 years.

The expected long-term rate of return used for determining the net US pension scheme expense in 2008 was 8.0 percent, consistent with 2007.
The rate used to discount US plan liabilities at December 31, 2008 was 6.3 percent, determined based on expected plan cash flows discounted using a corporate bond yield curve, an
increase from 6.0 percent at December 31, 2007. The expected and actual returns on US plan assets for the three years ended December 31, 2008 were as follows:

The mortality assumption at December 31, 2008 is the RP-2000 Mortality Table (blended for annuitants and non-annuitants),
projected to 2009 by Scale AA (December 31, 2007: projected to 2008 by Scale AA). As an indication of the longevity assumed, our calculations assume that a US male retiree aged 65 at
December 31, 2008, would have a life expectancy of 18 years.

Intangible assets

Intangible assets represent the excess of cost over the value of net tangible assets of

businesses
acquired. We classify our intangible assets into three categories:

•

Goodwill;

•

"Customer and Marketing related" includes client lists, client relationships and non-compete agreements; and

•

"Contract based, Technology and Other" includes all other purchased intangible assets.

Client
relationships acquired on the HRH acquisition are amortized over twenty years in line with the pattern in which the economic benefits of the client relationships are expected to be consumed.
Over 80 percent of the client relationships intangible will have been amortized after 10 years. Non-compete agreements acquired in connection with the HRH acquisition are
amortized over two years on a straight line basis. Intangible assets acquired in connection with other acquisitions are amortized over their estimated useful lives on a straight line basis. Goodwill
is not subject to amortization.

To
determine the allocation of intangible assets between goodwill and other intangible assets and the estimated useful lives in respect of the HRH acquisition we considered a report produced by a
qualified independent appraiser. The calculation of the allocation is subject to a number of estimates and assumptions. We base our allocation on assumptions we believe to be reasonable. However,
changes in these estimates and assumptions could affect the allocation between goodwill and other intangible assets.


Impairment review

We review all our intangible assets for impairment periodically (at least annually) or whenever events or circumstances indicate impairment may have
occurred. Application of the impairment test requires judgment, including:

•

the identification of reporting units;

•

assignment of assets, liabilities and goodwill to reporting units; and

•

determination of fair value of each reporting unit.

The
fair value of each reporting unit is estimated using a discounted cash flow methodology and, in aggregate, validated against our market capitalization. This analysis requires significant
judgments, including:

•

estimation of future cash flows which is dependent on internal forecasts;

•

estimation of the long-term rate of growth for our business;

•

the estimation of the useful life over which cash flows will occur; and

•

determination of our weighted average cost of capital.

We
base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable. However, changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value and goodwill
impairment for each reporting unit.

Our
annual goodwill impairment analysis, which we performed during the fourth quarter of 2008, did not result in an impairment charge (2007: $nil, 2006: $nil).

Income taxes

We recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the estimated future tax consequences of events attributable to differences between the
financial statements carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating and capital loss and tax credit carryforwards. We estimate deferred tax assets and
liabilities and assess the need for any valuation allowances using enacted rates in effect for the year in which the differences are

expected
to be recovered or settled taking into account our business plans and tax planning strategies.

At
December 31, 2008, the Company had gross deferred tax assets of $362 million (2007: $184 million) against which a valuation allowance of $85 million (2007:
$69 million) had been recognized. To the extent that:

•

the actual future taxable income in the periods during which the temporary differences are expected to reverse differs
from current projections;

•

assumed prudent and feasible tax planning strategies fail to materialize;

•

new tax planning strategies are developed; or

•

material changes occur in actual tax rates or loss carry forward time limits,

the
Company may adjust the deferred tax asset considered realizable in future periods. Such adjustments could result in a significant increase or decrease in the effective tax rate and have a material
impact on our net income.

Positions
taken in the Company's tax returns may be subject to challenge by the taxing authorities upon examination. The Company recognizes the benefit of uncertain tax positions in the financial
statements when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on examination by the tax authorities. The benefit recognized is the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than
50 percent likely of being realized on settlement with the tax authority, assuming full knowledge of the position and all relevant facts. The Company adjusts its recognition of these uncertain
tax benefits in the period in which new information is available impacting either the recognition or measurement of its uncertain tax positions.

Commitments, contingencies and accrued liabilities

We purchase professional indemnity insurance for errors and insurance claims. The terms of this insurance vary by policy year and
self-insured risks have increased significantly over recent years. We have established provisions against various actual and potential claims, lawsuits and other proceedings relating


principally
to alleged errors and omissions in connection with the placement of insurance and reinsurance in the ordinary course of business. Such provisions cover claims that have been reported but
not paid and also claims that have

been
incurred but not reported. These provisions are established based on actuarial estimates together with individual case reviews and are believed to be adequate in the light of current information
and legal advice.

NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

New
accounting standards issued during the year that would have a significant impact on the

Company's
reporting are described in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

On
October 1, 2008, the Company completed the acquisition of HRH.

Under
the terms of the definitive merger agreement, we acquired all of the outstanding shares of common stock of HRH for $46.00 per share, with approximately 55 percent of the total
consideration being paid in cash and 45 percent being paid in our stock. The total purchase price of approximately $2.1 billion included the assumption of approximately
$340 million of HRH existing debt.

We
funded the transaction on October 1, 2008 from committed bank financing, with a $1 billion drawdown from an interim credit facility and a $525 million draw down from a
$700 million 5-year term loan facility. In addition, we repaid approximately $340 million of HRH
existing debt and the $170 million outstanding balance on our existing revolving credit facility, which has been replaced by a new $300 million facility, all of which remains available
to draw at December 31, 2008.

During
fourth quarter 2008, we repaid $250 million of the then outstanding $1 billion balance on the interim credit facility funded by using free cash flow of $75 million together
with the drawdown of the remaining $175 million available under the 5-year term loan facility.

Total
long term debt at December 31, 2008 was $1,865 million and total short term debt was $785 million. Included in total long-term debt is $250 million of
5.125% senior notes due 2010.

In
February 2009, we entered into an agreement with Goldman Sachs Mezzanine Partners to issue 12.875 percent senior unsecured notes due 2016 in an aggregate principal amount of
$500 million. The transaction is subject to customary closing conditions and is expected to

close
during March 2009. The net proceeds of the issue will be used to repay approximately $480 million of the interim credit facility. We expect to be able to repay the approximately
$270 million remaining balance on this short-term facility over the next two quarters from free cash flow and proceeds from the sale of non-core businesses.

Liquidity

We believe that existing cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2008 of $176 million, the consummation of the agreement with Goldman
Sachs Mezzanine Partners to issue $500 million of senior unsecured notes, availability under our $300 million revolving credit facility together with future generation of free cash flow
and proceeds from the sale of non-core businesses should be adequate to meet our cash needs for at least the next 12 months. These sources of liquidity should also be adequate to
finance full repayment of the interim
credit facility, current portions of our long-term debt and other contractual obligations and presently known operating needs.

Long-term
liquidity for debt service and other contractual obligations will be dependent on continued generation of free cash flow and, given favorable market conditions, future borrowings
or refinancing. However, our cash requirements could be materially affected by a deterioration in our results of operations, as well as various uncertainties discussed in this section and elsewhere,
which could require us to pursue other financing options, including, but not limited to, additional borrowings, debt refinancing, asset sales or other financing alternatives. With the current
tightening in the


credit
markets, the level, if any, of these financing sources cannot be assured.

We
continue to identify and implement further actions to control costs and enhance our operating performance, including cash flow. These actions include the rationalization of our cost base through
the 2008 expense review and our ongoing right-sizing initiatives to achieve best fit within the current environment.

On
November 1, 2007, the Board authorized a new share buyback program for $1 billion. This replaced our previous $1 billion buyback program and its remaining $308 million
authorization. In first quarter 2008, we repurchased 2.3 million shares at a cost of $75 million under the new authorization.

Over
time, following full repayment of the interim credit facility, and subject to limitations in our debt facilities, we also plan to repurchase the majority of the shares issued in connection with
the acquisition of HRH under our existing $1 billion buyback authorization.

Fiduciary funds

As an intermediary, we hold funds generally in a fiduciary capacity for the account of third parties, typically as the result of premiums received
from clients that are in transit to insurers and claims due to clients that are in transit from insurers. We report premiums, which are held on account of, or due from, clients as assets with a
corresponding liability due to the insurers. Claims held by, or due to, us which are due to clients are also shown as both assets and liabilities. All these balances due or payable are included in
accounts receivable and accounts payable on the balance sheet. We earn interest on these funds during the time between the receipt of the cash and the time the cash is paid out. Fiduciary cash must be
kept in certain regulated bank accounts subject to guidelines, which generally emphasize capital preservation and liquidity, and is not generally available to service our debt or for other corporate
purposes.

Own funds

As of December 31, 2008, we had cash and cash equivalents of $176 million, compared with $200 million at December 31,
2007, and all of

our
$300 million revolving credit facility remained available to draw.

Operating activities

Net cash provided by operations was $211 million in 2008 compared with $268 million in 2007 and $147 million in 2006. Net cash
provided by operations has been significantly impacted by the accelerated funding of our pensions schemes over the last three years, with additional contributions of $107 million in 2008,
$153 million in 2007 and $211 million in 2006.

Net
cash from operations in 2008 was $57 million lower than in 2007, mainly reflecting:

•

an $81 million decrease in net income before gains relating to investment activities; and

•

a $65 million increase in cash payments for interest reflecting higher average debt levels, particularly following
the funding of the HRH acquisition;

partly
offset by

•

a $46 million reduction in additional contributions to our UK and US defined benefit pension plans;

•

the benefit of a $14 million reduction in taxes paid; and

•

the timing of cash collections and other working capital movements.

Net
cash from operations in 2007 was $121 million higher than in 2006, mainly reflecting:

•

a $27 million increase in net income before gains relating to investment activities;

•

a $58 million reduction in additional contributions to our UK and US defined benefit pension plans; and

•

the benefit of a $13 million reduction in taxes paid.

Investing activities

Total net cash used in investing activities was $1,040 million in 2008 compared with $221 million in 2007 and an inflow of
$67 million in 2006.


The
net increase in cash used in investing activities of $819 million in 2008 compared with 2007 was attributable to:

•

an $896 million net increase in the cost of acquisitions, primarily reflecting $926 million attributable to
the HRH acquisition; and

•

a reduction in proceeds from disposals of operations, investments and other assets of $14 million;

partly
offset by

•

a reduction in fixed asset spend of $91 million, principally attributable to sharply reduced expenditure on our new
London and US headquarters buildings following their completion.

The
net increase in cash used in investing activities of $288 million in 2007 compared with 2006 was mainly attributable to:

•

a $130 million increased investment in fixed assets primarily relating to $106 million of expenditure on the
fit-outs of our new US and UK headquarters buildings; and

•

cash proceeds on disposal of fixed and intangible assets of $27 million in 2007 compared with $205 million
in 2006, primarily reflecting the $202 million proceeds on sale of our London headquarters in 2006.

In
2008 we completed the acquisition of HRH with approximately 55 percent of the total consideration being paid in cash, as described above. This payment for acquisitions of $926 million
was in addition to a payment of $31 million to acquire an additional 4 percent of voting rights in Gras Savoye & Cie, our French associate. We also acquired a further
5.5 percent of Gras Savoye & Cie effective fourth quarter 2008 for which the $41 million in cash was paid in January 2009. The Gras Savoye acquisitions were pursuant to put
arrangements, see "Contractual Obligations" below.

In
2007 we purchased an additional 17 percent of Coyle Hamilton Willis (since renamed Willis Risk Services Ireland Limited), our Irish subsidiary, for $33 million; and acquired
InsuranceNoodle, a US internet distributor of small business property-casualty insurance for $29 million.

Financing activities

Cash provided by financing activities amounted to $828 million in 2008 compared with outflows of $146 million in 2007 and
$129 million in 2006.

Long-term debt

In connection with the HRH acquisition on October 1, 2008, we drew down $1 billion from an interim credit facility and a further
$525 million from a 5-year term loan facility. During fourth quarter 2008, we subsequently repaid $250 million of the outstanding balance on the interim credit facility using
$175 million proceeds from an additional drawdown of the 5-year term loan facility together with $75 million from free cash flow.

As
at December 31, 2008, total short-term debt was $785 million and total long-term debt was $1,865 million.

In
February 2009, we entered into an agreement with Goldman Sachs Mezzanine Partners to issue 12.875 percent senior unsecured notes due 2016 in an aggregate principal amount of
$500 million. The transaction is subject to customary closing conditions and is expected to close during March 2009. We expect the net proceeds of the issue to be used to repay approximately a
further $480 million of the $750 million outstanding balance on the interim credit facility as at December 31, 2008.

In
addition, we repaid the outstanding balance on our previously existing revolving credit facility and replaced it with a new 5-year $300 million line of credit.

We
also repaid the previously existing HRH debt of $341 million assumed with the acquisition.

In
March 2007, we issued $600 million of 10 year senior notes at 6.20 percent. We used the proceeds of the notes to fund share buybacks and to repay a net $150 million on
our then existing revolving credit facility.

In
2006, we drew down $200 million on our then existing revolving credit facility primarily to fund our increased pension contributions.


Share buybacks

We repurchased 2.3 million shares for $75 million of cash in the first quarter of 2008 compared with 11.5 million shares for
$480 million of cash in 2007 and 5.4 million shares for $211 million of cash in 2006.

Dividends

Cash dividends paid in 2008 were $146 million compared with $143 million in 2007 and $145 million in 2006. In February 2009, we
declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.26 per share, an annual rate of $1.04 per share.

Debt financing

On October 1, 2008, we funded the HRH acquisition with $1 billion from an interim credit facility and $525 million from a
$700 million 5-year term loan facility. In addition, we repaid the outstanding balance on our existing revolving credit facility and replaced this with a new $300 million line of credit.
In fourth quarter 2008, we repaid $250 million of the interim credit facility and at the same time drew down a further $175 million under the 5-year term loan facility.

In
February 2009, the Company entered into an agreement with Goldman Sachs Mezzanine Partners to issue 12.875 percent senior unsecured notes due 2016 in an aggregate principal amount of
$500 million. The Company

anticipates
that approximately $480 million net proceeds of this issuance will be applied towards the balance of the interim credit facility. Consummation of the issuance, which is subject to
customary closing conditions, is expected to take place in March 2009.

Operating leases

We moved from Ten Trinity Square into our new London headquarters in Lime Street in April 2008. In November 2004, we entered into an agreement to
lease the Lime Street building and took control of the building in June 2007 under a 25 year operating lease. Annual rentals are $35 million per year and we have subleased approximately
30 percent of the premises under leases up to 15 years long. The outstanding


contractual
obligation for lease rentals at December 31, 2008 was $720 million and the amounts receivable from committed subleases was $106 million.

Pensions

Contractual obligations for our pension plans reflect the contributions we expect to make over the next five years into our US and UK plans. These
contributions are based on current funding positions and may increase or decrease dependent on the future performance of the two plans.

In
the UK, we are required to agree a funding strategy for our UK defined benefit plan with the plan's trustees. In February 2009, we agreed to make full year contributions to the UK plan of
$37 million for 2009 through 2012. However, if certain funding targets are not met at the beginning of 2010 and 2011, full year contributions for these years will increase to
$74 million.

For
the US plan, expected contributions are the contributions we will be required to make under US pension legislation based on our December 31, 2008 balance sheet position. We currently expect
to contribute $18 million in 2009 and between $45 and $50 million per year from 2010 to 2013.

Put options relating to subsidiaries and associates

In connection with many of our investments in less than wholly-owned subsidiaries and associates, we retain rights to increase our ownership
percentage over time, typically to a majority or 100 percent ownership position. In addition, in certain instances, the other owners have a right, typically at a price calculated pursuant to a
formula based on revenues or earnings, to put some or all of their shares to us.

As
part of the 1997 acquisition of our initial 33 percent shareholding of Gras Savoye, we entered into a put arrangement, whereby the other shareholders in Gras Savoye (primarily two families,
two insurance companies and Gras Savoye's executive management team) could put their shares to us. Until 2011, we will be obligated to buy the shares of certain

shareholders
to the extent those shareholders put their shares, potentially increasing our ownership from the 48 percent holding at December 31, 2008 to 90 percent if all
shareholders put their shares, at a price determined by a contractual formula based on earnings and revenue.

Management
shareholders of Gras Savoye (representing approximately 10 percent of shares) do not have general put rights before 2011, but have certain put rights on their death, disability or
retirement from which payments, at December 31, 2008 based on the formula would not have exceeded $67 million. The shareholders may put their shares individually at any time during the
put period.

We
believe that, should the aggregate amount of Gras Savoye shares be put to us, sufficient funds would be available to satisfy this obligation. In addition, we have a call option to move to majority
ownership under certain circumstances and in any event by December 2009. Upon exercising this call option, the remaining Gras Savoye shareholders have a put option.

We
recently received a notification from one of the shareholders of Gras Savoye, namely AXA Corporate Solutions, informing us of its intention to put its shares in Gras Savoye to us, subject to the
pre-emption provisions set out in bye-laws of Gras Savoye. The shares held by AXA represent approximately 4 percent of the share capital of Gras Savoye. Notwithstanding that we have received
this notice from AXA we believe that it is likely that we will not be required to acquire all of the AXA shares in the immediate future or, in some circumstances, at all. We believe that
either:-

•

Gras Savoye itself will buy back all the AXA shares on 23 March 2009 and as a result, we would not acquire any of
them; or

•

AXA will agree to extend the date for payment of the amount due in respect of the AXA shares and that Gras Savoye itself
will buy back all the AXA shares on the agreed date for payment. In these circumstances we believe that Gras Savoye will buy back all the AXA shares and would agree to pay the amount due in respect of
the shares into an


escrow
account to be paid to AXA upon completion of the acquisition of the shares. Again, as a result, we would not be required to acquire any of the shares; or

•

certain of the other shareholders of Gras Savoye will exercise their pre-emption rights to acquire a portion of the AXA
shares. In these circumstances we believe that AXA would withdraw its notification in respect of the remaining shares held by it although we believe that it would then exercise its right to put those
to us later in 2009.

In
the event that none of the above occurred or an alternative arrangement was agreed, we would be required to acquire the AXA shares on 23 March 2009. The amount payable by us for the AXA
shares would be approximately $25 million.

Off-balance sheet transactions

Apart from commitments, guarantees and contingencies, as disclosed in Note 17 of the Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company has no
off-balance sheet arrangements that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a material effect on the Company's financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.


Item 7A—Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk

Financial Risk Management

We are exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. In order to manage the risk arising from these
exposures, we enter into a variety of interest rate and foreign currency derivatives. We do not hold financial or derivative instruments for trading purposes.

A
discussion of our accounting policies for financial and derivative instruments is included in Note 2—Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies of Notes to the
Consolidated Financial Statements, and further disclosure is provided in Note 21—Financial Instruments of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Foreign exchange risk management

Because of the large number of countries and currencies we operate in, movements in currency exchange rates may affect our results.

We
report our operating results and financial condition in US dollars. Our US operations earn revenue and incur expenses primarily in US dollars. Outside the United States, we predominantly generate
revenues and expenses in the local currency with the exception of our London market operations which earns revenues in several currencies but incurs expenses predominantly in pounds sterling.

The
table below gives an approximate analysis of revenues and expenses by currency in 2008 and includes full year HRH results on a proforma basis.

Our principal exposures to foreign exchange risk arise from:

•

our London market operations; and

•

translation.

London market operations

In our London market operations, we earn revenue in a number of different currencies, principally US dollars, pounds sterling, euros and Japanese
yen, but incur expenses almost entirely in pounds sterling.

We
hedge this risk as follows:

•

to the extent that forecast pound sterling expenses exceed pound sterling revenues, we limit our exposure to this exchange
rate risk by the use of forward contracts matched to specific, clearly identified cash outflows arising in the ordinary course of business; and

•

to the extent our London market operations earn significant revenues in euros and Japanese Yen, we limit our exposure to
changes in the exchange rate between the US dollar and these currencies by the use of forward contracts matched to a percentage of forecast cash inflows in specific currencies and periods.

Generally,
it is our policy to hedge at least 25 percent of the next 12 months' exposure in significant currencies. We do not hedge exposures beyond three years.

In
addition, we are also exposed to foreign exchange risk on any net sterling asset or liability position in our London market operations. Where this risk relates to short-term cash flows, we hedge
all or part of the risk by forward purchases or sales.

However,
where the foreign exchange risk relates to any sterling pension assets benefit or liability for pensions benefit, we do not hedge the risk. Consequently, if our London market operations have
a significant pension asset or liability, we may be exposed to accounting gains and losses if the US dollar and pounds sterling exchange rate changes. We do, however, hedge the pounds sterling
contributions into the pension plan.

Translation risk

Outside our US and London market operations, we predominantly earn revenues and incur expenses in the local currency. When we


translate
the results and net assets of these operations into US dollars for reporting purposes, movements in exchange rates will affect reported results and net assets. For example,
if the US dollar strengthens against the euro, the reported results of our Eurozone operations in US dollar terms will be lower.

We
do not hedge translation risk.

The
table below provides information about our foreign currency forward exchange contracts, which are sensitive to exchange rate risk. The table summarizes the US dollar equivalent amounts of each
currency bought and sold forward and the weighted average contractual exchange rates. All forward exchange contracts mature within three years.

Income earned within foreign subsidiaries outside of the UK is generally offset by expenses in the same local currency but the Company does have exposure to
foreign exchange movements on the net income of these entities. The Company does not hedge net income earned within foreign subsidiaries outside of the UK.

Interest rate risk management

Our operations are financed principally by $1,200 million fixed rate senior notes issued by a subsidiary, which are split between
$250 million due 2010, $350 million due 2015 and $600 million due 2017 and by $1,450 million bank facilities which are split between $750 million due 2009 and
$700 million which matures in 2013. The 5-year term loan facility


amortizes
at the rate of $35 million per quarter commencing from December 31, 2009. As of December 31, 2008 we had access to, but had not drawn $300 million
under a revolving credit facility that expires in 2013. The interest rate applicable to the bank borrowing is variable according to the period of each individual drawdown.

We
are also subject to market risk from exposure to changes in interest rates based on our investing activities where our primary interest rate risk arises from changes in short-term
interest rates in both US dollars and pounds sterling.

As
a consequence of our insurance and reinsurance broking activities, there is a delay between the time we receive cash for premiums and claims and the time the cash needs to be paid. We earn interest
on this float, which is included in our consolidated financial statements as investment income.

This
float is regulated in terms of access and the instruments in which it may be invested, most of

which
are short-term in maturity. We manage the interest rate risk arising from this exposure primarily through the use of interest rate swaps. It is our policy that, for
currencies with significant balances, a minimum of 25 percent of forecast income arising is hedged for each of the next three years.

The
table below provides information about our derivative instruments and other financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest. For interest rate swaps, the table presents notional
principal amounts and average interest rates analyzed by expected maturity dates. Notional principal amounts are used to calculate the contractual payments to be exchanged under the contracts. The
duration of interest rate swaps varies between one and four years, with re-fixing periods of three months. Average fixed and variable rates are, respectively, the weighted-average actual
and market rates for the interest hedges in place. Market rates are the rates prevailing at December 31, 2008 or 2007, as appropriate.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Willis Group Holdings Limited

Hamilton, Bermuda

We
have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Willis Group Holdings Limited and subsidiaries (the "Company") as of December 31, 2008 and 2007, and the related consolidated
statements of operations, stockholders' equity and comprehensive income, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2008. Our audits also included the
consolidated financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15. These financial statements and financial statement schedule are the responsibility of Willis Group Holdings Limited
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the financial statements and financial statement schedule based on our audits.

We
conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the
financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In
our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Willis Group Holdings Limited and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2008
and 2007,
and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2008, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America. Also, in our opinion, such consolidated financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, present
fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein.

We
have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of
December 31, 2008, based on the criteria established in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 27, 2009 expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting.

WILLIS GROUP HOLDINGS LIMITED

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1.     NATURE OF OPERATIONS

Willis Group Holdings Limited ("Willis Group Holdings") and subsidiaries (collectively, the "Company") provide a broad range of insurance brokerage, reinsurance and risk management consulting services
to its worldwide clients, both directly and indirectly through its associates. The Company provides both specialized risk management advisory and consulting services on a global basis to clients
worldwide in specific industrial and commercial activities, and services to small, medium and major corporates through its retail operations.

In
its capacity as an advisor and insurance broker, the Company acts as an intermediary between clients and insurance carriers by advising clients on risk management requirements, helping clients
determine the best means of managing risk, and negotiating and placing insurance risk with insurance carriers through the Company's global distribution network.

2.     BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

These consolidated financial statements conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("US GAAP"). Presented below are summaries
of:

•

Recent accounting policy changes; and

•

Significant accounting policies followed in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements.

Recent Accounting Policy Changes

Fair value measurement—adoption of FAS 157

The Company adopted Financial Accounting Standards No. 157

Fair Value Measurement

("FAS 157") on January 1, 2008. FAS 157:

•

applies to certain assets and liabilities that are being measured and reported on a fair value basis;

•

defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles, and expands disclosure about fair value measurements; and

•

enables the reader of the financial statements to assess the inputs used to develop those measurements by establishing a
hierarchy for ranking the quality and reliability of the information used to determine fair values.

FAS 157
requires that assets and liabilities carried at fair value are classified and disclosed in one of the following three categories:

•

Level 1: Quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.

•

Level 2: Observable market based inputs or unobservable inputs that are corroborated by market data.

•

Level 3: Unobservable inputs that are not corroborated by market data.

The Company's fiduciary funds—restricted and short-term investments consist mainly of cash and time deposits. Fair values are based on
quoted market values.

The
fair value of the Company's derivative financial instruments is computed based on a market approach using information generated by market transactions involving comparable instruments.

Derivative
financial instruments are included within 'other assets' and 'other liabilities' on the balance sheet.

Other Income

Other income comprises gains on the disposals of intangible assets, which primarily arise on the disposal of books of business. Prior to
January 1, 2008, the Company reported these gains within "Commissions and fees". Comparatives have been adjusted accordingly.

Although
the Company is not in the business of selling intangible assets (mainly books of business), from time to time the Company will dispose of a book of business (a customer list) or other
intangible asset that does not produce adequate margins or fit with the Company's strategy.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

Business Combinations

In December 2007, the FASB issued Financial Accounting Standard No. 141 (revised 2007)

Business
Combinations

("FAS 141R"). FAS 141R makes substantial changes to how entities account for business combinations, establishing principles and requirements for how
the acquirer:

•

recognizes and measures the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed and any non-controlling
interest in the acquiree;

•

recognizes and measures goodwill acquired in the business combination; and

•

determines what information to disclose to enable users of financial statements to evaluate the nature and financial
effects of the business combination.


WILLIS GROUP HOLDINGS LIMITED

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

2.     BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)

FAS 141R
is effective for financial years beginning after December 15, 2008 and is effective for the Company from January 1, 2009. Adoption is prospective and early adoption is
not permitted. Assets and liabilities that arose from business combinations with acquisition dates prior to the effective date of FAS 141R are not adjusted upon adoption of FAS 141R with
certain exceptions for acquired deferred tax assets and acquired income tax positions.

The
income tax provisions of FAS 141R pertaining to changes in the valuation allowance of deferred tax assets and uncertain tax positions are applicable prospectively to business combinations
occurring prior to the effective date of FAS 141R. Reductions to the valuation allowance of acquired deferred tax assets and all changes to acquired uncertain tax positions occurring after the
measurement period are now recorded to the statement of operations.

Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements

In December 2007, the FASB issued FAS No. 160,

Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial
Statements—an amendment of ARB No. 51

, (SFAS No. 160). FAS No. 160 establishes accounting and reporting standards for the noncontrolling
interest in a subsidiary and for the retained interest and gain or loss when a subsidiary is deconsolidated. It clarifies that a noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary is an ownership interest in the
consolidated entity and should be reported as equity in the Consolidated Financial Statements. This statement is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning on or after
December 15, 2008. Upon the initial adoption of this statement on January 1, 2009, the Company will change the classification and presentation of Noncontrolling Interest in the financial
statements, which is currently referred to as Minority Interest to within stockholders' equity. At December 31, 2008, the Company reported minority interest of $50 million as a mezzanine
item on the balance sheet.

Significant Accounting Policies

Principles of Consolidation

The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Willis Group Holdings and its subsidiaries, all of which are controlled
through the ownership of a majority voting interest. Intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated on consolidation.

Foreign Currency Translation

Transactions in currencies other than the functional currency of the entity are recorded at the rates of exchange prevailing at the date of the
transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities in currencies other than the functional currency are translated at the rates of exchange prevailing at the balance sheet date and the related transaction
gains and losses are reported in the statements of operations. Certain intercompany loans are determined to be of a long-term investment nature. The Company records transaction gains and
losses from remeasuring such loans as a component of other comprehensive income.

Upon
consolidation, the results of operations of subsidiaries and associates whose functional currency is other than the US dollar are translated into US dollars at the average exchange rate and
assets and liabilities are translated at year-end exchange rates. Translation adjustments are presented as a separate


WILLIS GROUP HOLDINGS LIMITED

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

2.     BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)

component
of other comprehensive income in the financial statements and are included in net income only upon sale or liquidation of the underlying foreign subsidiary or associated company.

Use of Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with US GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities as of the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
year. In the preparation of these consolidated financial statements, estimates and assumptions have been made by management concerning: the valuation of intangible assets (including those acquired
through business combinations), the selection of useful lives of fixed and intangible assets; impairment testing; provisions necessary for accounts receivable, commitments and contingencies and
accrued liabilities; long-term asset returns, discount rates and mortality rates in order to estimate pension liabilities and pension expense; income tax valuation allowances; and other
similar evaluations. Actual results could differ from the estimates underlying these consolidated financial statements.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents primarily consist of time deposits with original maturities of three months or less.

Short-Term Investments

The Company classifies all short-term investments as available-for-sale. These securities are carried at fair
market value, with unrealized gains and losses reported in other comprehensive income. Realized gains and losses on investments sold are included in net income.

Fiduciary Funds—Restricted

Fiduciary funds—restricted represent unremitted premiums received from insureds and unremitted claims received from insurers. Fiduciary
funds are generally required to be kept in certain regulated bank accounts subject to guidelines which emphasize capital preservation and liquidity; such funds are not available to service the
Company's debt or for other
corporate purposes. Notwithstanding the legal relationships with clients and insurers, the Company is entitled to retain investment income earned on fiduciary funds in accordance with industry custom
and practice and, in some cases, as supported by agreements with insureds.

Included
in fiduciary funds—restricted are cash and cash equivalents consisting primarily of time deposits. The debt securities are classified as
available-for-sale. Accordingly, they are recorded at fair market value with unrealized holding gains and losses reported, net of tax, as a component of other comprehensive
income.

Accounts Receivable and Accounts Payable

In its capacity as an insurance agent or broker, the Company collects premiums from insureds and, after deducting its commissions, remits the
premiums to the respective insurers; the Company also collects claims or refunds from insurers on behalf of insureds. Uncollected premiums from insureds and


WILLIS GROUP HOLDINGS LIMITED

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

2.     BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)

uncollected
claims or refunds from insurers are recorded as accounts receivable on the Company's consolidated balance sheets. Unremitted insurance premiums and claims are held in a fiduciary capacity.
The obligation to remit these funds is recorded as accounts payable on the Company's consolidated balance sheets. The period for which the Company holds such funds is dependent upon the date the
insured remits the payment of the premium to the Company and the date the Company is required to forward such payment to the insurer. Balances arising from insurance brokerage transactions are
reported as separate assets or liabilities unless such balances are due to or from the same party and a right of offset exists, in which case the balances are recorded net.

Accounts
receivable are stated at estimated net realizable values. Allowances are recorded, when necessary, in an amount considered by management to be sufficient to meet probable future losses
related to uncollectible accounts.

Fixed Assets

Fixed assets are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Expenditures for improvements are capitalized; repairs and maintenance are charged to
expenses as incurred.
Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method based on the estimated useful lives of assets.

Depreciation
on buildings and long leaseholds is calculated over the lesser of 50 years or the lease term. Depreciation on leasehold improvements is calculated over the lesser of the useful
life of the assets or the lease term. Depreciation on furniture and equipment is calculated based on a range of 3 to 10 years.

Recoverability of Fixed Assets

Long-lived assets are tested for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstance indicate that their carrying amounts may not
be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount of a long-lived asset is not recoverable and exceeds its fair value. Recoverability is determined based on the
undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset or asset group. Long-lived assets and certain identifiable intangible assets to be disposed of
are reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell.

Operating leases

Rentals payable on operating leases are charged straight line to expense over the lease term as the rentals become payable.

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of businesses acquired over the fair market value of identifiable net assets at the dates of acquisition.
The Company reviews goodwill for impairment annually and whenever facts or circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable. As part of the evaluation the estimated future
discounted cash flows associated with the underlying business operation are compared to the carrying amount of goodwill to determine if a write-down is required. If such an assessment
indicates that the discounted future cash flows are not sufficient, the carrying amount is reduced to the estimated fair value. Acquired intangible assets are


WILLIS GROUP HOLDINGS LIMITED

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

2.     BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)

being
amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful life with the exception of customer relationships for HRH which are amortized in line with the underlying cash flows.

Investments in Associates

Investments are accounted for using the equity method of accounting if the Company has the ability to exercise significant influence, but not
control, over the investee. Significant influence is generally deemed to exist if the Company has an equity ownership in the voting stock of the investee between 20 and 50 percent, although
other factors, such as representation on the Board of Directors and the impact of commercial arrangements, are considered in determining whether the equity method of accounting is appropriate. Under
the equity method of accounting the investment is carried at cost of acquisition, plus the Company's equity in undistributed net income since acquisition, less any dividends received.

The
Company periodically reviews its investments in associates for which fair value is less than cost to determine if the decline in value is other than temporary. If the decline in value is judged to
be other than temporary, the cost basis of the investment is written down to fair value. The amount of any write-down is included in the statements of operations as a realized loss.

All
other equity investments where the Company does not have the ability to exercise significant influence are accounted for by the cost method. Such investments are not publicly traded.

Put and Call Options Relating to Subsidiaries and Associates

For certain subsidiaries and associates, the Company has the right to purchase shares (a call option) from co-shareholders at various
dates in the future. In addition, the co-shareholders of certain subsidiaries and associates have the right to sell their shares (a put option) to the Company at various dates in the
future. Generally, the exercise price of such puts and calls is formula-based (using revenues and earnings) and is designed to reflect fair value. These put and call options fall outside the scope of
FAS 133,

Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities

. Provision is made for any put options that are out of the money at the
balance sheet date.

Derivative Financial Instruments

The Company uses derivative financial instruments for other than trading purposes to alter the risk profile of an existing underlying exposure.
Interest rate swaps are used to manage interest risk exposures. Forward foreign currency exchange contracts are used to manage currency exposures arising from future income and expenses. The fair
values of derivative contracts are recorded in other assets and other liabilities. Changes in the fair value of derivatives that qualify for hedge accounting are recorded in other comprehensive
income. Amounts are reclassified from other comprehensive income into earnings when the hedged exposure affects earnings. Changes in fair value of derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting,
together with any hedge ineffectiveness, are recorded in other operating expenses or interest expense as appropriate.

Income Taxes

The Company recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for the estimated future tax consequences of events attributable to differences between
the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets


WILLIS GROUP HOLDINGS LIMITED

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

2.     BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)

and
liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating and capital loss and tax credit carry forwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted rates in effect for the year
in which the differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of changes in tax rates is recognized in the statement of operations in the period
in which the enactment date changes. Deferred tax assets are reduced through the establishment of a valuation
allowance at such time as, based on available evidence, it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will not be realized.

Positions
taken in the Company's tax returns may be subject to challenge by the taxing authorities upon examination. The Company recognizes the benefit of uncertain tax positions in the financial
statements when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on examination by the tax authorities. The benefit recognized is the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than
50 percent likely of being realized on settlement with the tax authority, assuming full knowledge of the position and all relevant facts. The Company adjusts its recognition of these uncertain
tax benefits in the period in which new information is available impacting either the recognition or measurement of its uncertain tax positions.

The
Company recognizes interest relating to unrecognized tax benefits and penalties within income taxes.

Pensions

The Company has two principal defined benefit pension plans which cover the majority of employees in the United States and United Kingdom. Both these
plans are now closed to new entrants. New entrants in the United Kingdom are offered the opportunity to join a defined contribution plan and in the United States are offered the opportunity to join a
401(k) plan. In addition, there are some smaller plans in Ireland, Germany, Denmark and the Netherlands. Elsewhere, pension benefits are typically provided through defined contribution plans.

Defined benefit plans

The net periodic cost of the Company's defined benefit plans are measured on an actuarial basis using the projected unit credit method and several
actuarial assumptions. The most significant of which are the discount rate and the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. Other material assumptions include rates of participant
mortality, the expected long-term rate of compensation and pension increases and rates of employee termination. Gains and losses occur when actual experience differs from actuarial
assumptions. If such gains or losses exceed ten percent of the greater of plan assets or plan liabilities the Company amortizes those gains or losses over the average remaining service period of the
employees.

In
accordance with FAS 158, the Company records on the balance sheet the funded status of its pension plans based on the projected benefit obligation.

Defined contribution plans

Contributions to the Company's defined contribution plans is recognized as they fall due. Differences between contributions payable in the year and
contributions actually paid are shown as either other assets or other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets.

The Company accounts for share-based compensation as follows:

•

the cost resulting from all equity awards is recognized in the financial statements at fair value estimated at the grant
date;

•

the fair value is recognized (generally as compensation cost) over the requisite service period for all awards that vest;
and

•

compensation cost is not recognized for awards that do not vest because service or performance conditions are not
satisfied.

Revenue Recognition

Revenue includes insurance commissions, fees for services rendered, certain commissions receivable from insurance carriers and investment income
earned on fiduciary balances.

Brokerage
income and fees negotiated instead of brokerage are recognised at the later of policy inception date or when the policy placement is complete. Commissions on additional premiums and
adjustments are recognized as and when advised.

Fees
for risk management and other services are recognized as the services are provided. Negotiated fee arrangements for an agreed period covering multiple insurance placements, the provision of risk
management and/or other services are determined, contract by contract, on the basis of the relative fair value of the services completed and the services yet to be rendered. The Company establishes
contract cancellation reserves where appropriate; at December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, such amounts were not material.

Investment
income is recognized as earned.

3.     SEVERANCE COSTS

As part of the Company's 2008 expense review, the Company incurred $24 million of severance costs in the year ended December 31, 2008 relating to approximately 350 positions that have
been eliminated. Severance costs for these employees were recognized pursuant to the terms of their existing benefit arrangements or employment agreements.

The
Company has also incurred or expects to incur severance expenses as it integrates HRH into its previously existing North America operations. Severance costs of $2 million relating to the
elimination of approximately 100 positions in the Company's previously existing operations were recognized through the consolidated statement of operations in 2008. In addition, $16 million of
severance expenses relating to 900 HRH positions that will be eliminated as part of the integration plan have been recognized as a liability on acquisition (see Note 9—Acquisition
of Hilb Rogal & Hobbs).

Severance
costs also arise in the normal course of business and these charges amounted to $2 million in the year ended December 31, 2008 (2007: $2 million, 2006:
$6 million).

4.     SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION

On December 31, 2008, the Company had three share-based compensation plans, under which options and other share based grants may be made to employees. All of the Company's
share-based compensation plans under which any options or other share-based grants are outstanding as at December 31, 2008 are described below. The compensation cost
that has been charged against income for those plans for the year ended December 31, 2008 was $40 million (2007: $33 million; 2006: $18 million). The total income tax
benefit recognized in the statement of operations for share-based compensation arrangements for the year ended December 31, 2008 was $12 million (2007: $10 million; 2006:
$6 million).

Stock Option Plans

The Company has adopted the plans described below, which provide for the grant of time-based options and performance-based options and
various other share-based grants to employees. The objectives of these plans include attracting and retaining the best personnel, motivating management personnel by means of growth-related incentives
to achieve long-range goals and providing employees with the opportunity to increase their share ownership in the Company.

Amended and Restated 1998 Share Purchase and Option Plan

This plan, which was established on December 18, 1998, provides for the granting of time-based and performance-based options to
employees of the Company. There are 30,000,000 shares available for grant under this plan, provided, however, that in no event shall the total number of shares subject to options and other equity for
current and future participants exceed 25 percent of the equity of Willis Group Holdings on a fully diluted basis. All options granted under this plan are exercisable at £2 per
share ($2.92 using the year-end exchange rate of £1 = $1.46) except for 111,111 time-based options which are exercisable at $13.50. No further grants are to
be made under this plan, which expired on December 18, 2008. Outstanding grants will not be affected.

Time-based
options are earned upon the fulfillment of vesting requirements. Options are generally exercisable in equal installments of 20 percent per year over a
five-year period commencing on or after December 18, 2000.

Performance-based
options became exercisable, subject to the fulfillment of vesting requirements with effect from January 1, 2003, upon the achievement of cash flow and EBITDA (as defined in
the plan agreements) targets of Willis Group Limited. Options are generally exercisable in equal installments of 25 percent per year over a four-year period commencing on or after
December 18, 2001.

Willis Award Plan

This plan, which was established on July 13, 2000, provides for the granting of time-based options to selected employees who have
been identified as superior
performers. There are 5,000,000 shares available for grant under this plan provided, however, that in no event may the total number of shares subject to options and other equity for current and future
participants exceed 25 percent of the equity of Willis Group Holdings on a fully diluted basis.

All
options granted under this plan are exercisable at £2 per share ($2.92 using the year-end exchange rate of £1 = $1.46). The options vest immediately on
the grant date and are exercisable any time up to July 13, 2010.

4.     SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION (Continued)

2001 Share Purchase and Option Plan

This plan, which was established on May 3, 2001, provides for the granting of time-based options and various other share-based
grants at fair market value to employees of the Company. There are 25,000,000 shares available for grant under this plan. Options are exercisable on a variety of dates, including from the first,
second, third, sixth or eighth anniversary
of grant, although for certain options the exercisable date may accelerate depending on the achievement of certain performance goals. Unless terminated sooner by the Board of Directors, the 2001 Plan
will expire 10 years after the date of its adoption. That termination will not affect the validity of any grant outstanding at that date.

2008 Share Purchase and Option Plan

This plan, which was established on April 23, 2008, provides for the granting of time and performance based options and various other
share-based grants at fair market value to employees of the Company. There are 8,000,000 shares available for grant under this plan. Options are exercisable on a variety of dates, including from the
third, fourth or fifth anniversary of grant. Unless terminated sooner by the Board of Directors, the 2008 Plan will expire 10 years after the date of its adoption. That termination will not
affect the validity of any grant outstanding at that date.

HRH Option Plans

Options granted under the Hilb, Rogal and Hamilton Company 2000 Stock Incentive Plan, the Hilb, Rogal & Hobbs Company 2007 Stock Incentive
Plan and the Hilb Rogal & Hobbs Company Non-Employee Directors Stock Incentive Plan were converted into options to acquire shares of Willis common stock. No further grants are to be
made under these plans.

Option Valuation Assumptions

The fair value of each option is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model that uses the assumptions noted in the
following table. Expected volatility is based on historical volatility of the Company's stock. With effect from January 1, 2006, the Company uses the simplified method set out in Staff
Accounting Bulletin No. 107 to derive the expected term of options granted. The risk-free rate for periods within the expected life of the option is based on the US Treasury
yield curve in effect at the time of grant.

5.     GAIN ON DISPOSAL OF LONDON HEADQUARTERS

On September 27, 2006 Willis Group Services Limited, a subsidiary of Willis Group Holdings Limited, completed the sale of Ten Trinity Square, the Company's London headquarters building. The
building
was then leased back at an annual rental of $13 million until the Company occupied its new London headquarters on Lime Street. The move was completed in April 2008. Gross proceeds were
$202 million of which 25 percent was received in cash on completion and 75 percent was received on November 27, 2006. Of the total pre-tax gain on disposal,
$102 million was recognized in 2006; $14 million in 2007 and $7 million in 2008.

6.     NET GAIN (LOSS) ON DISPOSAL OF OPERATIONS

Total proceeds for 2008 were $11 million, inclusive of $7 million relating to 2008 dispositions of subsidiaries and associates and $4 million of deferred proceeds relating to
prior years, with a gain on disposal of $nil recorded in the consolidated statements of operations.

Total
proceeds for 2007 were $2 million, inclusive of $nil relating to 2007 dispositions of subsidiaries and associates and $2 million of deferred proceeds relating to prior years, with
a gain on disposal of $2 million recorded in the consolidated statements of operations.

Total
proceeds for 2006 were $6 million, inclusive of $3 million relating to 2006 dispositions of subsidiaries and associates and $3 million of deferred proceeds relating to prior

At December 31, 2008, the Company had a valuation allowance of $85 million (2007: $69 million) to reduce its deferred tax assets to
estimated realizable value. The valuation allowances at December 31, 2008 and 2007 relate to the deferred tax assets arising from UK capital loss carryforwards ($51 million), which have
no expiration date and to the deferred tax assets arising from US State net operating losses ($34 million). Capital loss carryforwards can only be offset against future UK capital gains.

At
December 31, 2008, the Company had deferred tax assets of $277 million (2007: $115 million), net of the valuation allowance. Management believes, based upon the level of
historical taxable income and projections for future taxable income, it is more likely than not that the Company will realize the


WILLIS GROUP HOLDINGS LIMITED

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

7.     INCOME TAXES (Continued)

benefits
of these deductible differences, net of the valuation allowance. However, the amount of the deferred tax asset considered realizable could be adjusted in the future if estimates of taxable
income are revised.

The
Company recognizes deferred tax balances related to the undistributed earnings of subsidiaries when the Company expects that it will recover those undistributed earnings in a taxable manner, such
as through receipt of dividends or sale of the investments. The Company does not, however, provide for income taxes on the unremitted earnings of certain other subsidiaries where, in management's
opinion, such earnings have been indefinitely reinvested in those operations, or will be remitted either in a tax free liquidation or as dividends with taxes substantially offset by foreign tax
credits. It is not practical to determine the amount of unrecognized deferred tax liabilities for temporary differences related to these investments.

Unrecognized tax benefits

Total unrecognized tax benefits as at December 31, 2008 totaled $33 million. During the next 12 months it is reasonably possible
that the Company will recognize approximately $9 million of tax benefits related to the release of provisions no longer required due to either settlement through negotiation or closure of the
statute of limitations on assessment.

A
reconciliation of the beginning and ending amounts of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows:

The Company files tax returns in the various tax jurisdictions in which it operates. The 2004 US tax year closed in 2008 upon the expiration of the statute of
limitations on assessment. US tax returns have been timely filed. The Company has not received notice that the IRS will be conducting an audit of the open years. Texas and Wisconsin are the only
states with an active income tax audit. The Company has not extended the federal statute of limitations for assessment in the US.

All
UK tax returns have been timely filed and are in the normal process of being reviewed, with HM Revenue & Customs making enquiries to obtain additional information. There are no
material ongoing enquiries in relation to filed UK returns other than in relation to the quantification of foreign tax reliefs available on the remittance of foreign earnings.

8.     EARNINGS PER SHARE

Basic and diluted earnings per share are calculated by dividing net income by the average number of shares outstanding during each period. The computation of diluted earnings per share reflects the
potential dilution that could occur if dilutive securities and other contracts to issue shares were exercised or converted into shares or resulted in the issue of shares that then shared in the net
income of the Company.

For
the year ended December 31, 2008, time-based and performance-based options to purchase 16.9 million and 5.8 million (2007: 15.3 million and
0.2 million; 2006: 15.0 million and 0.4 million)
shares of Willis common stock, respectively, and 1.4 million restricted shares (2007: 1.6 million; 2006: 1.1 million), respectively, were outstanding.

9.     ACQUISITION OF HILB ROGAL & HOBBS COMPANY

On October 1, 2008, Willis completed the acquisition of HRH in a transaction involving both cash and stock consideration. The acquisition was effected by merging Willis HRH Inc, an
indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Willis, with and into HRH.

The
acquisition of HRH has been accounted for using the purchase method in accordance with FAS No. 141. Under the purchase method of accounting, the assets and liabilities of HRH are recorded
at their fair values at the acquisition date. The financial statements and reported results of the operations of Willis after the completion of the acquisition reflect these fair values. The results
of HRH are included within the consolidated statement of operations from October 1, 2008.

Prior
to the acquisition, the Company had targeted key US locations and practice areas where it wished to expand and had made a series of piecemeal acquisitions. The acquisition of HRH, the eighth
largest insurance and risk management intermediary in the United States, enabled the Company to achieve many of these targets and with a relatively low level of geographical and client overlap.

The
Company believes that the HRH acquisition will:

•

substantially improve Willis' position in important areas in North America including California, Florida, Texas, Illinois,
New York, Boston, New Jersey and Philadelphia, and in key business lines. In particular, the acquisition will more than double Willis' North America revenues in Employee Benefits, an already strong
area of expertise that Willis has targeted for further growth. In addition, it will further strengthen key practice areas including personal lines, real estate, health care, environmental,
construction, complex property and executive risk;

•

greatly strengthen Willis' leadership as a middle market broker and reinforce its large account presence. We also believe
that the acquisition will further expand the range of Willis' specialty expertise and complement Willis' substantial presence in the London market;


WILLIS GROUP HOLDINGS LIMITED

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

9.     ACQUISITION OF HILB ROGAL & HOBBS COMPANY (Continued)

•

enable the combined company to deliver greatly enhanced value to clients through a more robust and diversified platform;

•

boost the contribution of North America to Willis' overall revenues from 30 percent in 2007 to an estimated
45 percent on a pro forma basis, enhancing the mix among its North America, International and Global segments; and

•

positively rebalance Willis' business lines mix, with the Reinsurance businesses, which in 2007 accounted for
15 percent of Willis' revenues, going to 12 percent of the revenues of the combined company. Meanwhile, the Employee Benefits business will increase from 10 percent of Willis'
current revenues to 13 percent of the revenues of the combined company.

The
Company also expects to extract significant cost savings through synergies between the two companies.

Consideration

The consideration paid by Willis including amounts payable in respect of stock options and costs directly attributable to the business combination
was approximately $1.8 billion, as analyzed below:

Cash paid to HRH shareholders


Estimated fair value of 3,825,652 fully vested HRH stock options

Transaction costs


$

1,796

Willis funded the cash consideration, the repayment of $341 million of existing HRH debt and the transaction costs with $1 billion from an interim
credit facility and $525 million from a $700 million 5-year term loan facility. In addition, the Company repaid the $170 million outstanding at September 30,
2008 on its previously existing revolving credit facility and replaced this with a new $300 million facility, all of which remained available to draw at December 31, 2008. Over time the
company plans to repurchase the majority of the shares issued in connection with the merger under the existing $1 billion buy back authorization.

Purchase price allocation

Willis' cost of acquiring HRH of $1.8 billion has been allocated on a preliminary basis to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed
according to their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition. However, the Company is still in the process of finalizing the valuation of certain assets and liabilities, thus the allocation of
the purchase price is subject to refinement. The final determination of these fair values will be completed as soon as possible but no later than one year from the acquisition date.

Customer relationships were identified as the key intangible asset as approximately 95 percent of HRH's revenue has historically been generated by
existing customer relationships. The fair value of customer relationships has been estimated using the discounted cash flow income approach. This involves calculating the present value of future cash
flows arising from customer relationships existing at the acquisition date.


WILLIS GROUP HOLDINGS LIMITED

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

9.     ACQUISITION OF HILB ROGAL & HOBBS COMPANY (Continued)

Non
compete agreements have also been valued by estimating the present value of the cashflows protected by the non-compete arrangement over their expected enforcement period of
3 years.

Trade
names have been valued using the relief from royalty method, whereby the fair value of the trademark is estimated as the present value of the after tax royalty income stream that could be
derived by licensing out the trade names.

The
weighted average amortization period for the acquired intangible assets is 18.7 years.

Goodwill

The total amount of goodwill recognized on the purchase of HRH is $1.6 billion of which $1,551 million is attributable to our North
America operations and $52 million to our Global operations.

Among
the assets and liabilities acquired is tax deductible goodwill in HRH of $325 million that arose in a previous business combination by HRH. The tax basis in this historical goodwill of
HRH continues to have tax basis after the acquisition of HRH by Willis, and will continue to be amortized for tax purposes. At the transaction date there is no temporary difference relating to the
historical tax deductible goodwill, and therefore no deferred taxes. A temporary difference will arise in future periods as the tax deductible goodwill is amortized for tax purposes. Goodwill arising
on the transaction above the historical HRH goodwill is not deductible for tax purposes and will not generate a temporary difference currently or in the future.

Supplemental Disclosure of Pro Forma Information

The following unaudited pro forma consolidated results of operations have been prepared as if the acquisition of HRH occurred at January 1,
2007.

(iii)

(iv)

An
adjustment to increase amortization expense based on the estimated fair value of identifiable intangible assets from the purchase price allocation,
which are being amortized over their estimated useful lives over a range of 2 to 20 years, of $80 million and $83 million for the year to December 31, 2008 and 2007.

(v)

An
adjustment to the weighted average number of shares used in the pro forma EPS calculation to reflect the issuance of 24.4 million new shares of
Willis common stock on October 1, 2008 as if it took place on January 1, 2007.

(vi)

The
above adjustments have been tax effected where appropriate at a rate of 40%.

The
pro forma information is presented for informational purposes only and is not necessarily indicative of the results of operations that actually would have been consummated as of that time, nor is
it intended to be indicative of future results.

Integration costs

Once the proposed acquisition of HRH was announced, the Company worked with HRH management to develop a plan to integrate HRH and its previously
existing North America operations. This plan was substantially complete at the time of the acquisition. The plan seeks to centralize HRH's dispersed back office processes and integrate these with
Willis' existing service hubs and to close down HRH's Richmond Head Office. The plan also identified locations where office space was duplicated or could be rationalized. In implementing the
integration plan, the Company has incurred or expects to incur $34 million of severance expenses and vacant space provisions relating to HRH staff and premises. This has been recognized as a
liability assumed in the purchase business combination within Accounts payable and accrued expenses.

10.   FIDUCIARY FUNDS—RESTRICTED AND SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS

The Company's fiduciary funds—restricted and short-term investments consist mainly of cash and time deposits. Accrued interest on investments is recorded as other assets.

Debt
securities are classified as available-for-sale. Accordingly, they are recorded at fair market value with unrealized holding gains and losses reported, net of tax, as a
component of other comprehensive income. As of December 31, 2008 and 2007, the amortized cost of such securities approximated fair value.

Realized
gains and losses, net of tax, on debt securities are included in net income. During the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, sales of debt securities totaled
$15 million, $19 million and $10 million, respectively, on which realized gains and losses were not material to the consolidated results of the Company. Fiduciary
funds—restricted, consisting primarily of time deposits with original maturities of less than or equal to three months, were $1,854 million as of December 31, 2008 (2007:
$1,520 million).

Consolidation of fiduciary funds

In accordance with FASB Interpretation No. 46(R),

Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities an interpretation of ARB
No. 51

, the financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007 reflect the consolidation of one Variable Interest Entity ("VIE"), a UK
non-statutory trust that was established in January 2005 following the introduction of statutory regulation of insurance in the UK by the Financial Services Authority. The regulation
requires that all fiduciary funds collected by an insurance broker such as the Company be paid into a non-statutory trust designed to give additional credit protection to the clients and
insurance carriers of the Company. This trust restricts the financial instruments in which such funds may be invested and affects the timing of transferring commission from fiduciary funds to own
funds.

As
of December 31, 2008, the fair value of the assets in the VIE was approximately $931 million (2007: $912 million) and the fair value of the associated liabilities was
approximately $931 million (2007: $912 million). There are no assets of the Company that serve as collateral for the VIE.

The Company recognized a depreciation charge of $54 million, $52 million and $49 million in the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007
and 2006, respectively.

12.   GOODWILL

Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of businesses acquired over the fair market value of identifiable net assets at the dates of acquisition. Goodwill is not amortized but is subject to
impairment testing annually and whenever facts or circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable. As part of the evaluation the estimated future discounted cash flows
associated with the underlying business operation are compared to the carrying amount of goodwill to determine if a write-down is required. If such an assessment indicates that the
discounted future cash flows are not sufficient, the carrying amount is reduced to the estimated fair value.

The
Company's annual goodwill impairment test which was performed during the fourth quarter of 2008, did not result in an impairment charge (2007: $nil, 2006: $nil).

When
a business entity is sold, goodwill is allocated to the disposed entity based on the fair value of that entity compared to the fair value of the reporting unit in which it is included.

The
changes in the carrying amount of goodwill by operating segment for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007 are as follows:

14.   INVESTMENTS IN ASSOCIATES (Continued)

Of those listed above, the Company's principal investment as of December 31, 2008 and 2007 is Gras Savoye, France's leading insurance broker. Included in
the carrying amount of the Gras Savoye investment as of December 31, 2008 is goodwill of $141 million (2007: $93 million). Of this total, $21 million was recognized in
respect of an additional 4.3 percent purchased in January 2008 and $27 million was recognized in December 2008 in respect of an additional 5.5 percent. The additional acquisition
increases the Company's total voting interest to 48%.

As
of December 31, 2008 and 2007, the Company's other investments in associates individually and in the aggregate were not material to the Company's operations.

On
July 23, 1997, the Company entered into an agreement with Gras Savoye whereby, among other things, the co-shareholders of Gras Savoye (other than management) have the right to
sell "put option" their shares to the Company, possibly increasing the Company's ownership interest from 48 percent to 90 percent. Management shareholders of Gras Savoye, representing
approximately 10 percent of the outstanding shares, do not have general put rights before 2011, but have certain put rights on their death, disability or retirement. The option expires at the
end of 2011 and Gras Savoye's eligible co-shareholders may exercise their rights from January 1, 2001. In addition, the Company has the right to purchase (call option) at least
50.1 percent of Gras Savoye's shares from the co-shareholders. The call option is exercisable from December 1, 2009 until February 1, 2010. The exact amount payable by
the Company under the put option and call option is based on formula-based price contingent on Gras Savoye's future results.

Unaudited

15.   PENSION PLANS

The Company maintains two principal defined benefit pension plans that cover almost all our employees in the United States and United Kingdom. Both these plans are now closed to new entrants. New
entrants in the United Kingdom are offered the opportunity to join a defined contribution plan and in the United States are offered the opportunity to join a 401(k) plan. In addition to the Company's
UK and US defined benefit pension plans, the Company has several smaller defined benefit

2014-2018



Willis North America has a 401(k) plan covering all eligible employees of Willis North America and its subsidiaries. The plan allows participants to make
pre-tax contributions and the Company provides a matching contribution of 3 percent of employees' annual eligible compensation. All investment assets of the plan are held in a trust
account administered by independent trustees. The Company's 401(k) matching contributions for 2008 were $8 million (2007: $6 million; 2006: $5 million).

International defined benefit pension plans

In addition to the Company's UK and US defined benefit pension plans, the Company has several smaller defined benefit pension plans in Ireland,
Germany, Denmark and the Netherlands. In prior years, management determined that these International plans were not material to the Company's results of operations, financial condition or liquidity:
as at December 31, 2007 the net
pension liability in respect of these schemes was $2 million. Consequently such plans were not included in the Company's pension plan disclosures.

However,
as a result of the turmoil in worldwide equity markets in the latter half of 2008 and consequent declines in pension plan asset values, a $29 million pension benefit liability has been
recognized in respect of these schemes. Accordingly, the Company is now providing pension plan disclosures for these schemes.

HRH acquisition

On October 1, 2008, we funded the HRH acquisition with $1 billion from an interim credit facility and $525 million from a
$700 million 5-year term loan facility. In addition, we repaid the outstanding balance on our existing revolving credit facility and replaced this with a new $300 million
revolving credit facility. During fourth quarter 2008, we repaid $250 million of the interim credit facility and drew down an additional $175 million under the 5-year term loan.

The
$1 billion interim credit facility bears interest at LIBOR plus 2.250% and is repayable on September 30, 2009; the 5-year term loan facility and the revolving credit facility also
bear interest at LIBOR plus 2.250%. 1 month LIBOR at December 31, 2008 was 0.436%.

The
agreements relating to the new senior credit facilities and revolving credit facility contain numerous operating and financial covenants, including requirements to maintain minimum ratios of
consolidated adjusted EBITDA to consolidated fixed charges and maximum levels of consolidated funded indebtedness in relation to consolidated EBITDA, in each case subject to certain adjustments.

In
addition, the credit agreements include covenants relating to the delivery of financial statements, reports and notices, limitations on liens, limitations on sales and other disposals of assets,
limitations on indebtedness and other liabilities, limitations on sale and leaseback transactions, limitations on mergers and other fundamental changes, maintenance of property, maintenance of
insurance, nature of business, compliance with applicable laws, maintenance of corporate existence and rights, use of proceeds, payment of taxes and access to information and properties. At
December 31, 2008, the Company was in compliance with all covenants.

All
obligations of Willis North America Inc. ("Willis North America") (the borrower) under the credit agreements and under the senior notes listed above are guaranteed by Willis Group Holdings
Limited, Willis Investment UK Holdings Limited, Trinity Acquisition Limited, Willis Group Limited, TA I Limited, TA II Limited, TA III Limited and TA IV Limited.

In
February 2009, the Company entered into an agreement with Goldman Sachs Mezzanine Partners to issue notes in an aggregate principal amount of $500 million. The Company anticipates that the
net proceeds of this issuance of approximately $480 million will be applied towards the balance of the interim credit facility. Consummation of the issuance, which is subject to customary
closing conditions, is expected to take place in March 2009.

The Company leases certain land, buildings and equipment under various operating lease arrangements. Original non-cancellable lease terms
typically are between 10 and 20 years and may contain escalation clauses, along with options that permit early withdrawal. The total amount of the minimum rent is expensed on a
straight-line basis over the term of the lease.

As
of December 31, 2008, the aggregate future minimum rental commitments under all non-cancellable operating lease agreements are as follows:

We moved from Ten Trinity Square into our new London headquarters in Lime Street in April 2008. In November 2004, the Company entered into an agreement with
long time client British Land plc to lease the Lime Street building and took control of the building in June 2007 under a 25-year operating lease. The Company's contractual obligations in
relation to this commitment total $720 million and are included in the table above.

Rent
expense amounted to $151 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 (2007: $132 million; 2006: $93 million). The Company's rental income from subleases was
$22 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 (2007: $14 million; 2006: $11 million).

Guarantees

Guarantees issued by certain of Willis Group Holdings' subsidiaries with respect to the senior credit facility and the senior notes are discussed in
note 16—Debt in these consolidated financial statements.

Certain
of Willis Group Holdings' subsidiaries have given the landlords of some leasehold properties occupied by the Company in the United Kingdom and the United States guarantees in respect of the
performance of the lease obligations of the subsidiary holding the lease. The operating lease obligations subject to such guarantees amounted to $804 million and $1,035 million at
December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively.

In
addition, the Company has given guarantees to bankers and other third parties relating principally to letters of credit amounting to $4 million and $4 million at December 31,
2008 and 2007, respectively.

Put and Call Options Relating to Subsidiaries and Associates

For certain subsidiaries and associates, the Company has the right to purchase shares (a call option) from co-shareholders at various
dates in the future. In addition, the co-shareholders of certain subsidiaries and associates have the right to sell (a put option) their shares to the Company at various dates in the
future. Generally, the exercise price of such put options and call options is formula-based (using revenues and earnings) and is designed to reflect fair value. Based on current projections of
profitability and exchange rates, the potential amount payable from these options is not expected to exceed $434 million. Of this balance, $359 million relates to Gras Savoye.

Claims, Lawsuits and Other Proceedings

The Company is subject to various actual and potential claims, lawsuits and other proceedings relating principally to alleged errors and omissions in
connection with the placement of insurance and reinsurance in the ordinary course of business. Similar to other corporations, the Company is also subject to a variety of other claims, including those
relating to the Company's employment practices. Some of the claims, lawsuits and other proceedings seek damages in amounts which could, if assessed, be significant.

Errors
and omissions claims, lawsuits and other proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business are covered in part by professional indemnity or other appropriate insurance. The terms of this
insurance vary by policy year and self-insured risks have increased significantly in recent years. In respect of self-insured risks, the Company has established provisions
which are believed to be adequate in the light of current information and legal advice, and the Company adjusts such provisions from time to time according to developments.

On
the basis of current information, the Company does not expect that the actual claims, lawsuits and other proceedings, to which the Company is subject, or potential claims, lawsuits and other
proceedings relating to matters of which it is aware will ultimately have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. Nonetheless, given the
large or indeterminate amounts sought in certain of these actions, and the inherent unpredictability of litigation, it is possible that an adverse outcome in certain matters could, from time to time,
have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations or cash flows in particular quarterly or annual periods.

The
most significant actual or potential claims, lawsuits and other proceedings, of which we are currently aware are:

Inquiries and Investigations

In connection with the investigation commenced by the New York State Attorney General in April 2004 concerning, among other things, contingent
commissions paid by insurers to insurance brokers, in April 2005, the Company entered into an Assurance of Discontinuance ("NY AOD") with the New York State Attorney General and the Superintendent of
the New York Insurance Department and paid $50 million to eligible customers. As part of the NY AOD, the Company also agreed not to accept contingent compensation and to disclose to customers
any compensation the Company will receive in connection with providing policy placement services to the customer. The Company also resolved

similar
investigations commenced by the Minnesota Attorney General, the Florida Attorney General, the Florida Department of Financial Services and the Florida Office of Insurance Regulation for
amounts that were not material to the Company. Similarly, in August 2005 HRH entered into an agreement with the Attorney General of the State of Connecticut (the "CT Attorney General") and the
Insurance Commissioner of the State of Connecticut to resolve all issues related to their investigations into certain insurance brokerage and insurance agency practices and to settle a lawsuit brought
in August 2005 by the CT Attorney General alleging violations of the Connecticut Unfair Trade Practices Act and the Connecticut Unfair Insurance Practices Act. As part of this settlement, HRH agreed
to take certain actions including establishing a $30 million national fund for distribution to certain clients, enhancing disclosure practices for agency and broker clients, and declining
contingent compensation on brokerage business. The Company has co-operated fully with other similar investigations by the regulators and/or attorneys general of other jurisdictions, some
of which have been concluded with no indication of any finding of wrongdoing.

The
European Commission issued questionnaires pursuant to its Sector Inquiry or, in respect of Norway, the European Free Trade Association Surveillance Authority, related to insurance business
practices, including compensation arrangements for brokers, to at least 150 European brokers including our operations in nine European countries. The Company responded to the European
Commission questionnaires and has filed the European Free Trade Association Surveillance Authority for two of its Norwegian entities. The European Commission reported on a final basis on
September 25, 2007, expressing concerns over potential conflicts of interest in the industry relating to remuneration and binding authorities when assuming a dual role for clients and insurers
and also over the nature of the coinsurance market. The Company continues to co-operate with both the European Commission and the European Free Trade Association Surveillance Authority.

Since
August 2004, the Company and HRH (along with various other brokers and insurers) have been named as defendants in purported class actions in various courts across the country. All of these
actions have been consolidated or are in the process of being consolidated into a single action in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey ("MDL"). There are two amended
complaints within the MDL, one that addresses employee benefits ("EB Complaint") and one that addresses all other lines of insurance ("Commercial Complaint"). HRH was a named defendant in the EB
Complaint, but has since been voluntarily dismissed. HRH is a named defendant in the Commercial Complaint. The Company is a named defendant in both MDL Complaints. Each of the EB Complaint and the
Commercial Complaint seek monetary damages, including punitive damages, and equitable relief and make allegations regarding the practices and conduct that have been the subject of the investigation of
state attorneys general and insurance commissioners, including allegations that the brokers have breached their duties to their clients by entering into contingent compensation agreements with either
no disclosure or limited disclosure to clients and participated in other improper activities. The Complaints also allege the existence of a conspiracy among insurance carriers and brokers and allege
violations of federal antitrust laws, the federal RICO statute and the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 ("ERISA"). In separate decisions issued in August and September 2007, the
antitrust and RICO claims were dismissed with prejudice and the state claims were dismissed without prejudice from both Complaints. Plaintiffs have filed a notice of appeal regarding these dismissal
rulings and oral arguments on this appeal are scheduled to be heard in April 2009. In January 2008, the Judge dismissed the ERISA claims with prejudice from the EB Complaint. Additional actions could
be brought in the future by individual policyholders. The Company disputes the allegations in all of these suits and has been and intends to continue to defend itself vigorously against these actions.

outcomes
of these lawsuits, however, including any losses or other payments that may occur as a result, cannot be predicted at this time.

Reinsurance Market Dispute

Various legal proceedings are pending, have been concluded or may commence between reinsurers, reinsureds and in some cases their intermediaries,
including reinsurance brokers, relating to personal accident excess of loss reinsurance for the years 1993 to 1998. The proceedings principally concern allegations by reinsurers that they have
sustained substantial losses due to an alleged abnormal "spiral" in the market in which the reinsurance contracts were placed, the existence and nature of which, as well as other information, was not
disclosed to them by the reinsureds or their reinsurance broker. A "spiral" is a market term for a situation in which reinsureds and reinsurers reinsure each other with the effect that the same loss
or portion of that loss moves through the market multiple times.

The
reinsurers concerned have taken the position that, despite their decisions to underwrite risks or a group of risks, they are no longer bound by their reinsurance contracts. As a result, they have
stopped settling claims and are seeking to recover claims already paid. The Company also understands that
there have been at least two arbitration awards in relation to a spiral, among other things, in which the reinsurer successfully argued that it was no longer bound by parts of its reinsurance program.
Willis Limited, the Company's principal insurance brokerage subsidiary in the United Kingdom, acted as the reinsurance broker or otherwise as intermediary, but not as an underwriter, for numerous
personal accident reinsurance contracts, including two contracts that were involved in one of the arbitrations. Due to the small number of reinsurance brokers generally, Willis Limited was one of a
small number of brokers active in the market for this reinsurance during the relevant period. Willis Limited also utilized other brokers active in this market as sub-agents, including
brokers who are parties to the legal proceedings described above, for certain contracts and may be responsible for any errors and omissions they may have made. In July 2003, one of the reinsurers
received a judgment in the English High Court against certain parties, including a sub-broker Willis Limited used to place two of the contracts involved in this trial.

Although
neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries were a party to this proceeding or any arbitration, Willis Limited entered into tolling agreements with certain of the principals to the
reinsurance contracts tolling the statute of limitations pending the outcome of proceedings between the reinsureds and reinsurers.

Two
former clients of Willis Limited, American Reliable Insurance Company and one of its associated companies ("ARIC") and CNA Insurance Company Limited and two of its associated companies ("CNA")
have each terminated their respective tolling agreements with Willis Limited and commenced litigation in September 2007 and January 2008, respectively, in the English Commercial Court against Willis
Limited. ARIC has alleged conspiracy between a former Willis Limited employee and the ARIC underwriter as well as negligence and CNA has alleged deceit and negligence by the same Willis Limited
employee both in connection with placements of personal accident reinsurance in the excess of loss market in London and elsewhere. The Company disputes these allegations and is vigorously defending
itself in these actions. ARIC's asserted claim is approximately $257 million (plus unspecified interest and costs) and CNA's asserted claim is approximately $251 million (plus various
unspecified claims for exemplary damages, interest and costs). Pleadings have been exchanged in both actions and the parties have been and continue to be engaged in extensive discovery prior to the
trial which the Court has fixed on a preliminary basis for ten weeks commencing October 7, 2009. The Company


WILLIS GROUP HOLDINGS LIMITED

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

17.   COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES (Continued)

cannot
predict at this time what, if any, damages might result from these claims but has kept its errors and omissions insurance carrier fully informed of developments in the claims. The Company
believes that any amounts required to resolve the claims will be covered by errors and omissions insurance. Various arbitrations continue to be active and from time to time the principals request
co-operation from the Company and suggest that claims may be asserted against the Company. Such claims may be made against the Company if reinsurers do not pay claims on policies issued by
them. The Company cannot predict at this time whether any such claims will be made or the damages that may be alleged.

Gender Discrimination Class Action

In March 2008, the Company settled an action in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York commenced against the Company
in 2001 on behalf of an alleged nationwide class of present and former female officer and officer equivalent employees alleging that the Company discriminated against them on the basis of their gender
and seeking injunctive relief, money damages, attorneys' fees and costs. Although the Court had denied plaintiffs' motions to certify a nationwide class or to grant nationwide discovery, it did
certify a class of approximately 200 female officers and officer equivalent employees based in the Company's offices in New York, New Jersey and Massachusetts. The settlement agreement provides for
injunctive relief and a monetary payment, including the amount of attorney fees plaintiffs' counsel are entitled to receive, which was not material to the Company. In December 2006, a former female
employee, whose motion to intervene in the class action was denied, filed a purported class action in the United States District Court, Southern District of New York, with almost identical allegations
as those contained in the suit that was settled in 2008, except seeking a class period of 1998 to the time of trial (the class period in the settled suit was 1998 to the end of 2001). The Company's
motion to dismiss this suit was denied and the Court did not grant the Company permission to immediately file an appeal from the denial of its motion to dismiss. The suit was recently amended to
include two additional plaintiffs. The parties are in the discovery phase of the litigation. The Company cannot predict at this time what, if any, damages might result from this action.

World Trade Center

We acted as the insurance broker, but not as an underwriter, for the placement of both property and casualty insurance for a number of entities which
were directly impacted by the September 11, 2001 destruction of the World Trade Center complex, including Silverstein Properties LLC, which acquired a 99-year leasehold
interest in the twin towers and related facilities from the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey in July 2001. Although the World Trade Center complex insurance was bound at or before the July
2001 closing of the leasehold acquisition, consistent with standard industry practice, the final policy wording for the placements was still in the process of being finalized when the twin towers and
other buildings in the complex were destroyed on September 11, 2001. There have been a number of lawsuits in the United States between the insured parties and the insurers for several
placements and other disputes may arise in respect of insurance placed by us which could affect the Company including claims by one or more of the insureds that we made culpable errors or omissions in
connection with our brokerage activities. However, we do not believe that our role as broker will lead to liabilities which in the aggregate would have a material adverse effect on our results of
operations, financial condition or liquidity.

20.   SHARE BUYBACKS

On November 1, 2007, the Board authorized a new share buyback program for $1 billion. This replaced the previous $1 billion buyback program and its remaining $308 million
authorization. The program is an open-ended plan to repurchase the Company's shares from time to time in the open market or through negotiated sales with persons who are not affiliates of
the Company. In addition the board authorized in June 2008, the repurchase of up to the number of shares issued by the Company in connection with the acquisition of HRH.

During
the year ended December 31, 2008, the Company repurchased 2.3 million shares for a total consideration of $75 million at an average price of $33.12. Repurchased shares were
subsequently canceled. There was also a $1 million adjustment in 2008 relating to prior year price adjustments.

Accelerated Share Repurchase Programs

During the year ended December 31, 2007, the Company completed the $150 million November 2006 accelerated share repurchase program and
started and completed two further accelerated share repurchase programs, one for $50 million and one for $400 million.

retained earnings.

21.   FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

The Company's principal financial instruments, other than derivatives, comprise the fixed rate senior notes, the new 5-year term loan and interim credit facilities, a revolving credit facility, cash
deposits and short-term investments. The Company also enters into derivative transactions (principally interest rate swaps and forward foreign currency contracts) in order to manage
interest rate and currency risks arising from the Company's operations and its sources of finance. The Company does not hold financial or derivative instruments for trading purposes.

The
main risks arising from the Company's financial instruments are interest rate risk, liquidity risk, foreign currency risk and credit risk. The Company's board of directors reviews and agrees
policies for managing each of these risks as summarized below.

Interest Rate Risk

The Company's operations are financed principally by $1,200 million fixed rate senior notes, $700 million under a new
5-year term loan facility and $750 million under an interim credit facility that expires on September 30, 2009. Of the fixed rate senior notes $250 million are due
2010, $350 million are due 2015 and $600 million are due 2017. The Company also has a new 5-year $300 million revolving credit facility which was undrawn as of
December 31, 2008. All debt is issued by a subsidiary of the Company.

The
interest rate applicable to the borrowings under the new facilities varies according to LIBOR on the date of individual drawdowns. In addition, duration fees of $9 million are payable on
the interim credit facility.

As
a result of the Company's operating activities, the Company receives cash for premiums and claims which it deposits in short-term investments denominated in US dollars and other
currencies. The Company earns interest on these funds, which is included in the Company's financial statements as investment income. These funds are regulated in terms of access and the instruments in
which they may be invested, most of which are short-term in maturity. In order to manage interest rate risk arising from these financial assets, the Company enters into interest rate swaps
to receive a fixed rate of


WILLIS GROUP HOLDINGS LIMITED

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

21.   FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS (Continued)

interest
and pay a variable rate of interest fixed in the various currencies related to the short-term investments. The use of interest rate contracts essentially converts groups of
short-term variable rate investments to fixed rates.

The
fair value of these contracts is recorded in other assets and other liabilities. For contracts that qualify as accounting hedges, changes in fair value are recorded as a component of other
comprehensive income.

Amounts
are reclassified from other comprehensive income into earnings when the hedged exposure affects earnings. For contracts that do not qualify for hedge accounting, changes in fair value are
recorded in other operating expenses.

Liquidity Risk

The Company's objective is to ensure that it has the ability to generate sufficient cash either from internal or external sources, in a timely and
cost-effective manner, to meet its commitments as they fall due. The Company's management of liquidity risk is embedded within its overall risk management framework. Scenario analysis is
continually undertaken to ensure that the Company's resources can meet its liquidity requirements. These resources are supplemented by a $300 million revolving credit facility which expires on
October 1, 2013, all of which was available to draw as at December 31, 2008. As of the year end the Company had exposure of $750 million under an interim credit facility that
expires on September 30, 2009. In February 2009, the Company entered into an agreement to issue $500 million 12.875% senior unsecured notes due 2016.
The net proceeds of approximately $480 million will be applied towards the balance on the interim credit facility. The Company expects to repay the balance on the facility of approximately
$270 million out of free cash flow and from the sale of non-core businesses.

Foreign Currency Risk

The Company's primary foreign exchange risks arise:

•

from changes in the exchange rate between US dollars and pounds sterling as its London market operations earn the majority
of their revenues in US dollars and incur expenses predominantly in pounds sterling, and may also hold a significant net sterling asset or liability position on the balance sheet. In addition, the
London market operations earn significant revenues in euros and Japanese Yen; and

•

from the translation into US dollars of the net income and net assets of its foreign subsidiaries, excluding the London
market operations which are US dollar denominated.

The
foreign exchange risks in its London market operations are hedged as follows:

•

To the extent that forecast pound sterling expenses exceed pound sterling revenues, the Company limits its exposure to
this exchange rate risk by the use of forward contracts matched to specific, clearly identified cash outflows arising in the ordinary course of business;


WILLIS GROUP HOLDINGS LIMITED

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

21.   FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS (Continued)

•

To the extent the UK operations earn significant revenues in euros and Japanese Yen, the Company limits its exposure to
changes in the exchange rate between the US dollar and these currencies by the use of forward contracts matched to a percentage of forecast cash inflows in specific currencies and periods; and

•

To the extent that the net sterling asset or liability position in its London market operations relate to short term cash
flows, the Company limits its exposure by the use of forward purchases and sales. These forward purchases and sales are not effective hedges for accounting purposes.

The
Company does not hedge net income earned within foreign subsidiaries outside of the UK.

The
fair value of foreign currency contracts is recorded in other assets and other liabilities. For contracts that qualify as accounting hedges, changes in fair value resulting from movements in the
spot exchange rate are recorded as a component of other comprehensive income whilst changes resulting from a movement in the time value are recorded in interest expense. For contracts that do not
qualify for hedge accounting, the total change in fair value is recorded in interest expense. Amounts held in comprehensive income are reclassified into earnings when the hedged exposure affects
earnings.

Credit Risk and Concentrations of Credit Risk

Credit risk represents the loss that would be recognized at the reporting date if counterparties failed to perform as contracted and from movements
in interest rates and foreign exchange rates. The Company does not anticipate non-performance by counterparties. The Company generally does not require


WILLIS GROUP HOLDINGS LIMITED

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

21.   FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS (Continued)

collateral
or other security to support financial instruments with credit risk; however, it is the Company's policy to enter into master netting arrangements with counterparties as practical.

Concentrations
of credit risk that arise from financial instruments exist for groups of customers or counterparties when they have similar economic characteristics that would cause their ability to
meet contractual obligations to be similarly affected by changes in economic or other conditions. Financial instruments on the balance sheet that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of
credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, and derivatives which are recorded at fair value.

The
Company maintains a policy providing for the diversification of cash and cash equivalent investments and places such investments in an extensive number of financial institutions to limit the
amount of credit risk exposure. These financial institutions are monitored on an ongoing basis for credit quality predominantly using information provided by credit agencies.

Concentrations
of credit risk with respect to receivables are limited due to the large number of clients and markets in which the Company does business, as well as the dispersion across many
geographic areas. Management does not believe significant risk exists in connection with the Company's concentrations of credit as of December 31, 2008.

Fair Value

The estimated fair value of the Company's financial instruments held or issued to finance the Company's operations is summarized below. Certain
estimates and judgments were required to develop the fair value amounts. The fair value amounts shown below are not necessarily indicative of the amounts that the Company would realize upon
disposition nor do they indicate the Company's intent or ability to dispose of the financial instrument.

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

21.   FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS (Continued)

Fiduciary Funds—Restricted and Short-Term Investments—

Fair values are based on quoted market values.

Long-Term Debt—

Fair values are based on quoted market values.

Derivative Financial Instruments—

Market values have been used to determine the fair value of interest rate swaps and forward foreign
exchange contracts based on estimated amounts the Company would receive or have to pay to terminate the agreements, taking into account the current interest rate environment or current foreign
currency forward rates.

22.   SEGMENT INFORMATION

During the periods presented, the Company operated through three segments: Global; North America and International. Global provides specialist brokerage and consulting services to clients worldwide
for
specific industrial and commercial activities and is organized by specialism. North America and International predominantly comprise our retail operations which provide services to small, medium and
major corporates, accessing Global's specialist expertise when required.

The
Company evaluates the performance of its operating segments based on organic revenue growth and operating income. For internal reporting and segmental reporting, the following items for which
segmental management are not held accountable are excluded from segmental expenses:

i)

gains
and losses on the disposal of operations and major properties;

ii)

foreign
exchange hedging activities and foreign exchange movements on the UK pension plan asset or liability;

iii)

significant
legal and regulatory settlements which are managed centrally;

iv)

amortization
of intangible assets;

v)

Shaping
our Future expenditure for 2006;

vi)

expense review costs; and

vii)

integration
costs associated with the acquisition of HRH.

The
accounting policies of the operating segments are consistent with those described in Note 2—Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies. There are no
inter-segment revenues, with segments operating on a revenue-sharing basis equivalent to that used when sharing business with other third-party brokers.


WILLIS GROUP HOLDINGS LIMITED

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

22.     SEGMENT INFORMATION (Continued)

In 2008, the Company changed its basis of segmental allocation for central costs. All accounting adjustments for foreign exchange hedging activities and foreign exchange movements on the UK pension
plan asset or liability are held at the Corporate level, together with legal costs that are managed centrally. As a result of this change, $nil in 2007 and $2 million net operating loss for
full year 2006, previously allocated to the operating segments, has been reported within Corporate.

None.

Item 9A—Controls and Procedures

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

As of December 31, 2008, the Company carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of the Company's management,
including the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and the Group Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company's disclosure controls and procedures pursuant
to Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(e). Based upon that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and the Group Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Company's disclosure controls and
procedures are effective in ensuring that the information required to be included in the Company's periodic SEC filings is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods
specified in the SEC rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to them as appropriate to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in
Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

Under
the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness

of
our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2008, based on the criteria related to internal control over financial reporting described in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on our
evaluation, management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2008.

Our
assessment of the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2008, excludes Hilb Rogal & Hobbs Company (HRH), which was acquired by
the Company in a purchase transaction on October 1, 2008. HRH is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company whose total assets and total revenue represents less than 25 percent and
10 percent, respectively, of the related consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the year ended 31 December 2008. Under guidelines established by the Securities and
Exchange Commission, companies are allowed to exclude acquisitions from their assessment of internal control over financial reporting during the first year of an acquisition while integrating the
acquired company.

Our
independent registered public accountants, Deloitte LLP, who have audited and reported on our financial statements, have undertaken an assessment of the Company's internal control over
financial reporting. Deloitte's report is presented below.


REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Willis Group Holdings Limited

Hamilton, Bermuda

We
have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Willis Group Holdings Limited and subsidiaries (the "Company") as of December 31, 2008, based on criteria established in

Internal Control—Integrated
Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Willis Group Holdings
Limited's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting,
included in the accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting
based on our audit.

As
described in

Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

, management's assessment of the effectiveness of the Company's internal
control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2008 excludes Hilb Rogal & Hobbs Company (HRH), which was acquired by the Company in a purchase transaction on October 1, 2008.
HRH is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company whose total assets, total revenues and net income represent 21 percent, 6 percent and 9 percent, respectively, of the consolidated
financial statement amounts as of and for the year ended December 31, 2008.

We
conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over
financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the
assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A
company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the company's principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing
similar functions, and effected by the company's board of directors, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the
preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and
procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company;
(2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that
receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding
prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because
of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to
error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are
subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In
our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2008, based on the criteria established in

Internal Control—Integrated
Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

We
have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule as of
and for the year ended December 31, 2008 of the Company and our report dated February 27, 2009 expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements and financial statement
schedule.

As
a consequence of the completion of the acquisition of Hilb Rogal & Hobbs Company on October 1, 2008, outstanding options granted under the
HRH employee share plans were exchanged for options, in aggregate, over 3,375,244 Willis shares at a weighted average exercise price of $25.98. These are included in the above table under "Equity
compensation plans not approved by security holders".

The Amended and Restated 1998 Share Purchase and Option Plan for Key Employees (the "1998 Plan") and the Amended and Restated Willis Award Plan for Key
Employees (the "Willis Award Plan"), are not approved by the Company's shareholders. Each provides for the grant of time-based vesting options, performance-based vesting options and
various other share-based grants to our employees to purchase Shares. The 1998 Plan and the Willis Award Plan are intended to promote the Company's long-term financial interests and growth
by attracting and retaining management personnel with the training, experience and ability to enable them to make a substantial contribution to the success of our business; motivate management
personnel by means of growth-related incentives to achieve long range goals; and further the alignment of interests of participants with those of shareholders of the Company through opportunities for
increased share ownership in us.

As
of February 17, 2009, of the time and performance-based options granted, 90,084 remained unforfeited under the 1998 Plan and 3,810 remained unforfeited under the Willis Award Plan. No
further grants are to be made under the 1998 Plan. There are 4,851,270 shares available to be granted under the Willis Award Plan. Under the 1998 Plan, unless otherwise provided by our Board of
Directors, time-based options generally became exercisable in five equal annual
installments beginning on the second anniversary of the date of grant and performance-based options generally became exercisable in four equal annual installments, beginning on the third anniversary
of grant, subject to performance targets. Effective from January 1, 2003, it was determined that these financial performance targets had been achieved. The exercisability of the options may
accelerate or terminate based on the circumstances surrounding an optionee's termination of employment, and both time-based and performance-based options may (in the discretion of our
Board of Directors), fully accelerate upon a change in control of the Company.

Unless
sooner terminated by our Board of Directors, the 1998 Plan and Willis Award Plan will expire 10 years after its adoption. That termination will not affect the validity of any grant
outstanding on the date of the termination of either of the 1998 Plan or the Willis Award Plan.

Our
Board of Directors and its Compensation Committee administer the 1998 Plan and Willis Award Plan. Our Board of Directors may from time to time amend the terms of any grant, but, except for
adjustments made upon a change in our Shares by reason of a stock split, spin-off, stock dividend, stock combination or reclassification, recapitalization, reorganization, consolidation,
change of control or similar event, that action may not adversely affect the rights of any participant under the 1998 Plan or Willis Award Plan, as applicable, with respect to the options without at
least a majority of the


participants
approving such action. Our Board of Directors retains the right to amend, suspend or terminate the 1998 Plan and Willis Award Plan at any time.

Our
UK subsidiary, Willis Group Limited, maintains Employee Share Ownership Plans, which as of February 17, 2009, held 20,520 Shares for the benefit of Willis Group employees. These Shares were
acquired by the Plans at the time of the 1998 acquisition of Willis Group Limited by Profit Sharing (Overseas) in return for the employees forfeiting cash awards held by the Plans for their benefit.
As part of the forfeiture arrangements, certain employees were granted either restricted stock awards or options, under our Zero Cost Share Option Scheme, the value of which equaled on grant the cash
amount of forfeited cash awards. Those employees who forfeited cash awards but did not receive a zero cost option grant have their Shares vested under the Plans at the same time they would have
received the cash awards. All obligations under the Zero Cost Share Option Scheme and restricted stock awards have now been satisfied, and no further awards under the Zero Cost Option Scheme will be
made.

In
connection with the employee stock purchase agreements described above, a trust was established at the time of the 1998 acquisition of Willis Group Limited by Profit Sharing (Overseas), which
through its trustees, is a party to the Management and Employee Shareholders' and Subscription Agreement, which governed the Shares purchased by our employees at that time. Under this agreement, the
trust repurchased Shares and options owned by those employees whose employment with us terminated. Also, the trust has the power to sell Shares at fair market value to current employees which is
undertaken in connection with certain option grants under the 2001 Plan. As of February 17, 2009, the
trust had an interest in 55,718 Shares which can be purchased by employees or used to satisfy options grants made by us.
