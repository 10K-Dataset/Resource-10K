PART I

Item 1 — Business

History and Development of the Company

Willis Group Holdings is the ultimate holding company for the Group. We trace our history to 1828 and are one of the largest insurance brokers in the world.

Willis Group Holdings was incorporated in Ireland on September 24, 2009 to facilitate the change of the place of incorporation of the parent company of the Group from Bermuda to Ireland (the ‘Redomicile’). At December 31, 2009, the common shares of Willis-Bermuda were canceled, the Willis-Bermuda common shareholders received, on a one-for-one basis, new ordinary shares of Willis Group Holdings, and Willis Group Holdings became the ultimate parent company for the Group.

For administrative convenience, we utilize the offices of a subsidiary company as our principal executive offices. The address is:

Please call the SEC at 1-800-SEC-0330 for information on the Public Reference Room.

General

We provide a broad range of insurance brokerage, reinsurance and risk management consulting services to our clients worldwide. We have significant market positions in the United States, in the United Kingdom and, directly and through our associates, in many other countries. We are a recognized leader in providing specialized risk management advisory and other services on a global basis to clients in many industries including aerospace, marine, construction and energy.

In our capacity as an advisor and insurance broker, we act as an intermediary between our clients and insurance carriers by advising our clients on their risk management requirements, helping clients determine the best means of managing risk, and negotiating and placing insurance with insurance carriers through our global distribution network.



About Willis

We assist clients in the assessment of their risks, advise on the best ways of transferring suitable risk to the global insurance and reinsurance markets and then execute the transactions at the most appropriate available price, terms and conditions for our clients. Our global distribution network enables us to place the risk in the most appropriate insurance or reinsurance market worldwide.

We also offer clients a broad range of services to help them to identify and control their risks. These services range from strategic risk consulting (including providing actuarial analysis), to a variety of due diligence services, to the provision of practical on-site risk control services (such as health and safety or property loss control consulting) as well as analytical and advisory services (such as hazard modeling and reinsurance optimization studies). We assist clients in planning how to manage incidents or crises when they occur. These services include contingency planning, security audits and product tampering plans. We are not an insurance company and therefore we do not underwrite insurable risks for our own account.

We derive most of our revenues from commissions and fees for brokerage and consulting services and do not determine the insurance premiums on which our commissions are generally based. Commission levels generally follow the same trend as premium levels as they are derived from a percentage of the premiums paid by the insureds. Fluctuations in these premiums charged by the insurance carriers can therefore have a direct and potentially material impact on our results of operations.

We and our associates serve a diverse base of clients including major multinational and middle-market companies in a variety of industries, as well as public institutions and individual clients. Many of our client relationships span decades. We have approximately 22,100 employees around the world (including approximately 3,700 at our associate companies) and a network of in excess of 400 offices in nearly 120 countries.

We believe we are one of only a few insurance brokers in the world possessing the global operating presence, broad product expertise and extensive distribution network necessary to meet effectively the global risk management needs of many of our clients.

Business Strategy

Today we operate in attractive growth markets with a diversified platform across geographies, industries, segments and lines of business. We aim to become the risk advisor, insurance and reinsurance broker of choice globally.

We believe we can achieve this by focusing on:

•

Growing our existing business organically. We help clients of all sizes and in every segment when we form teams of the right people from across our business that can provide every risk and human capital and benefits service the client needs. We call this team-based way of working ‘Connecting Willis’.

In the Connecting Willis model, client advocates ensure that our teams deliver a seamless service of tailored capabilities to every client including:

•

Regional and local market expertise

•

Industry and product specialist capabilities

•

Global placement knowledge and data

•

Cutting-edge analytics to address evolving risks

•

Strategic mergers and acquisitions that add geographic reach, industry expertise, new product offerings, and analytic capabilities. Every company in our portfolio is home to people who want to work at Willis.

•

Operational improvement that underpins our growth. We are modernizing the way we run our business in order to serve our clients better, enable the skills of our staff, and to lower our costs of doing business. Our Operational Improvement Program is making changes to our processes, our IT, our real estate and the location of our workforce.  The Program is making us more effective and efficient, bringing us into line with other modern professional services firms.

•

Finally, we care as much about how we work as we do about the impact that we make. This means commitment to our values and behaviors, a framework that guides how we run our business and serve clients. Our values - integrity, advocacy, teamwork, respect, and development - help us to attract and retain the best and most diverse talent in our industry and beyond.



Willis Group Holdings plc

Through these strategies we aim to grow revenue with positive operating leverage, grow cash flows and generate compelling returns for investors.

About Willis

The services provided are focused according to the characteristics of each market and vary across offices, but generally include direct risk management and insurance brokerage, specialist and reinsurance brokerage and employee benefits consulting.

As part of our ongoing strategy, we continue to look for opportunities to strengthen our International market share through acquisitions and strategic investments. A list of significant subsidiaries is included in Exhibit 21.1 to this document.

We have also invested in associate companies; our significant associates at December 31, 2014 were GS & Cie Groupe ('Gras Savoye'), a French organization (30 percent holding) and Al-Futtaim Willis Co. LLC, organized under the laws of Dubai (49 percent holding). In connection with many of our investments we retain the right to increase our ownership over time, typically to a majority or 100 percent ownership position.

We believe the combined total revenues of our International subsidiaries and associates provide an indication of the spread and capability of our International network.

Management structure

During the first quarter 2015 we have reorganized our business from three reporting units (formerly known as Global, North America and International) into four reporting units: Willis Capital, Wholesale and Reinsurance, Willis North America, Willis International, and Willis Great Britain "Willis GB".

Willis North America and Willis International remain largely unchanged except for certain specialty teams previously included within Global are now included within the geographic regions in which they are located.

Willis Capital, Wholesale and Reinsurance includes Willis Re, Willis Capital Markets and Advisory and our wholesale businesses as well as a new unit called Willis Portfolio and Underwriting Services.

Willis GB includes our UK retail, facultative and London specialty businesses.

Customers

Our clients operate on a global and local scale in a multitude of businesses and industries throughout the world and generally range in size from major multinational corporations to middle-market companies. Further, many of our client relationships span decades, for instance our relationship with The Tokio Marine and Fire Insurance Company Limited dates back over 100 years. No one client accounted for more than 10 percent of revenues for fiscal year


. Additionally, we place insurance with approximately 2,500 insurance carriers, none of which individually accounted for more than 10 percent of the total premiums we placed on behalf of our clients in


.

Competition

We face competition in all fields in which we operate, based on global capability, product breadth, innovation, quality of service and price. We compete with Marsh & McLennan and Aon, the two other major providers of global risk management services, as well as with numerous specialist, regional and local firms. Competition for business is intense in all of our business lines and in every insurance market, and Marsh & McLennan and Aon have substantially greater market share than we do. Competition on premium rates has also exacerbated the pressures caused by a continuing reduction in demand in some classes of business. For example, rather than purchase additional insurance through brokers, some insureds have been retaining a greater proportion of their risk portfolios than previously. Industrial and commercial companies increasingly rely upon their own subsidiary insurance companies, known as captive insurance companies, self-insurance pools, risk retention groups, mutual insurance companies and other mechanisms for funding their risks, rather than buy insurance. Additional competitive pressures arise from the entry of new market participants, such as banks, accounting firms and insurance carriers themselves, offering risk management or transfer services.



Willis Group Holdings plc

Regulation

Our business activities are subject to legal requirements and governmental and quasi-governmental regulatory supervision in all countries in which we operate. Also, such regulations may require individual or company licensing to conduct our business activities. While these requirements may vary from location to location they are generally designed to protect our clients by establishing minimum standards of conduct and practice, particularly regarding the provision of advice and product information as well as financial criteria. Our three most significant regulatory regions are described below:

United States

Our activities in connection with insurance brokerage services within the United States are subject to regulation and supervision by state authorities. Although the scope of regulation and form of supervision may vary from state to state, insurance laws in the United States are often complex and generally grant broad discretion to supervisory authorities in adopting regulations and supervising regulated activities. That supervision generally includes the licensing of insurance brokers and agents and the regulation of the handling and investment of client funds held in a fiduciary capacity. Our continuing ability to provide insurance brokerage in the states in which we currently operate is dependent upon our compliance with the rules and regulations promulgated from time to time by the regulatory authorities in each of these states.

European Union

In 2005, the European Union Insurance Mediation Directive introduced rules to enable insurance and reinsurance intermediaries to operate and provide services within each member state of the European Union on a basis consistent with the EU single market and customer protection aims. Each EU member state in which we operate is required to ensure that the insurance and reinsurance intermediaries resident in their country are registered with a statutory body in that country and that each intermediary meets professional requirements in relation to their competence, good repute, professional indemnity cover and financial capacity.

United Kingdom

In the United Kingdom, our business is regulated by the Financial Conduct Auditory ('FCA'). The FCA has a wide range of rule-making, investigatory and enforcement powers, and conducts monitoring visits to assess our compliance with regulatory requirements.

The FCA has a sole strategic objective: to protect and enhance confidence in the UK financial system. Its operational objectives are to: secure an appropriate degree of protection for consumers; promote efficiency and choice in the market for financial services; and protect and enhance the integrity of the UK financial system. The FCA also has a duty to act in a way that promotes competition, and to minimize the extent to which regulated businesses may be used for a purpose connected with financial crime. Finally, the FCA has new powers in product intervention. For instance, it can instruct firms to withdraw or amend misleading financial promotions.

Other

Certain of our activities are governed by other regulatory bodies, such as investment and securities licensing authorities. In the United States, our Willis Capital Markets & Advisory business operates through our wholly-owned subsidiary Willis Securities, Inc., a US-registered broker-dealer and member FINRA/SIPC, primarily in connection with investment banking-related services and advising on alternative risk financing transactions. Willis Capital Markets provides advice on securities or investments in the European Union and Australia through our UK wholly-owned subsidiary Willis Capital Markets & Advisory Limited, which is authorized and regulated by the FCA. Willis Capital Markets, through our Hong Kong wholly-owned subsidiary Willis Capital Markets & Advisory (Hong Kong) Limited, is in the process of obtaining securities and advisory licenses through, and will be regulated by, the Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission.

Our failure, or that of our employees, to satisfy the regulators that we comply with their requirements or the legal requirements governing our activities, can result in disciplinary action, fines, reputational damage and financial harm.

All companies carrying on similar activities in a given jurisdiction are subject to regulations which are not dissimilar to the requirements for our operations in the United States and United Kingdom. We do not consider that these regulatory requirements adversely affect our competitive position.

See Part I, Item 1A-Risk Factors ‘Legal and Regulatory Risks’ for discussion of how actions by regulatory authorities or changes in legislation and regulation in the jurisdictions in which we operate may have an adverse effect on our business.

Risk Factors

Risks Relating to our Business and the Insurance Industry

This section describes material risks affecting the Group’s business. These risks could materially affect the Group’s business, reputation, revenues, operating income, net income, net assets, liquidity and capital resources and ability to achieve its financial targets and, accordingly should be read in conjunction with any forward-looking statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Competitive Risks

Worldwide economic conditions could have an adverse effect on our business, prospects, operating results, financial condition and cash flows.

Our business and operating results are materially affected by worldwide economic conditions. Current global economic conditions, including those associated with the Eurozone, coupled with low customer and business confidence may have a significant negative impact on the buying behavior of some of our clients as their businesses suffer from these conditions. Since 2008, many of our operations have been impacted by the weakened economic climate. A significant number of insolvencies associated with an economic downturn could adversely affect our brokerage business through the loss of clients or by hampering our ability to place insurance and reinsurance business. In addition, an increase in mergers and acquisitions can also result in the loss of clients. While it is difficult to predict the consequences of any further deterioration in global economic conditions on our business, any significant reduction or delay by our clients in purchasing insurance or making payment of premiums could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, the potential for a significant insurer to fail, be downgraded or withdraw from writing certain lines of insurance coverages that we offer our clients could negatively impact overall capacity in the industry, which could then reduce the placement of certain lines and types of insurance and reduce our revenues and profitability. The potential for an insurer to fail or be downgraded could also result in errors and omissions claims by clients.

The credit and economic conditions of certain European Union countries remain fragile and may contribute to instability in the global credit and financial markets. If credit conditions worsen or financial market volatility increases in the Eurozone, it is possible that it could have a negative effect on the global economy as a whole, and our business, operating results and financial condition. If the Eurozone continues to deteriorate, there will likely be a negative effect on our European business, as well as the businesses of our European clients. Further, were the Euro to be withdrawn entirely, or the Eurozone were to be dissolved as a common currency area, the legal and contractual consequences for holders of Euro-denominated obligations would be determined by laws in effect at such time. A significant devaluation of the Euro would cause the value of our financial assets that are denominated in Euros to be significantly reduced. Any of these conditions could ultimately harm our overall business, prospects, operating results, financial condition and cash flows.

We may not be able to fully realize the anticipated benefits of our growth strategy.

We have stated certain goals at our 2013 Investor Conference and our outlook for 2015. In order to achieve these goals, we are implementing certain revenue growth strategies and continue to strive to manage our cost base. For example, we announced a series of actions that include, among other things, our multi-year operational improvement program and initiatives to better connect Willis. In light of the potential operational risks associated with these new initiatives, we cannot be certain whether we will be able to realize benefits from current revenue-generating or cost-saving initiatives and ultimately realize our objectives. There can be no assurance that our actual results will meet these financial goals.

We do not control the premiums on which our commissions are based, and volatility or declines in premiums may seriously undermine our profitability.

We derive most of our revenues from commissions and fees for brokerage and consulting services and do not determine the insurance premiums on which our commissions are generally based. Commission levels generally follow the same trend as premium levels, as they are a percentage of the premiums paid by the insureds. Fluctuations in the premiums charged by the insurance carriers can therefore have a direct and potentially material impact on our results of operations. Due to the cyclical nature of the insurance market and the impact of other market conditions on insurance premiums, commission levels may vary widely between accounting periods. A period of low or declining premium rates, generally known as a 'soft' or 'softening' market, generally leads to downward pressure on commission revenues and can have a material adverse impact on our commission revenues and operating margin. A 'hard' or 'firming' market, during which premium rates rise, generally has a



Risk factors

favorable impact on our commission revenues and operating margin. Rates, however, vary by geography, industry and client segment. We have been and continue to be negatively impacted by soft market conditions across certain sectors and geographic regions. In addition, insurance carriers may seek to reduce their expenses by reducing the commission rates payable to insurance agents or brokers such as ourselves. The reduction of these commission rates, along with general volatility and/or declines in premiums, may significantly undermine our profitability.

Competition in our industry is intense, and if we are unable to compete effectively, we may suffer lower revenue, reduced operating margins and lose market share which could materially and adversely affect our business.

We face competition in all fields in which we operate, based on global capability, product breadth, innovation, quality of service and price. We compete with Marsh & McLennan and Aon, the two major global providers of global risk management services, as well as with numerous specialist, regional and local firms. Competition for business is intense in all of our business lines and in every insurance market, and Marsh & McLennan and Aon have substantially greater market share than we do. Competition on premium rates has also exacerbated the pressures caused by a continuing reduction in demand in some classes of business. For example, rather than purchase additional insurance through brokers, some insureds have been retaining a greater proportion of their risk portfolios than previously. Industrial and commercial companies increasingly rely upon their own subsidiary insurance companies, known as captive insurance companies, self-insurance pools, risk retention groups, mutual insurance companies and other mechanisms for funding their risks, rather than buy insurance. Additional competitive pressures arise from the entry of non-traditional market participants, such as banks, accounting firms and insurance carriers themselves, offering risk management or transfer services. If we are unable to compete effectively, we may suffer lower revenue, reduced operating margins and lose market share which could materially and adversely affect our business.

The loss of our Chief Executive Officer or a number of our senior management or a significant number of our brokers could significantly impede our financial plans, growth, marketing and other objectives.

The loss of our Chief Executive Officer, a number of our senior management or a significant number of our brokers could significantly impede our financial plans, growth, marketing and other objectives. Our success depends to a substantial extent not only on the ability and experience of our Chief Executive Officer, Dominic Casserley, and other members of our senior management, but also on the individual brokers and teams that service our clients and maintain client relationships. The insurance and reinsurance brokerage industry has in the past experienced intense competition for the services of leading individual brokers and brokerage teams, and we have lost key individuals and teams to competitors. We believe that our future success will depend in part on our ability to attract and retain additional highly skilled and qualified personnel and to expand, train and manage our employee base. We may not continue to be successful in doing so because the competition for qualified personnel in our industry is intense.

We face certain risks associated with the acquisition or disposition of businesses and lack of control over investments in associates.

In pursuing our corporate strategy, we may acquire or dispose of or exit businesses or reorganize existing investments. For example, we have a call option to acquire 100 percent of the capital of our associate, Gras Savoye. The success of our overall acquisition and disposition strategy is dependent upon our ability to identify appropriate opportunities, negotiate transactions on favorable terms and ultimately complete such transactions. Once we complete acquisitions or reorganizations there can be no assurance that we will realize the anticipated benefits of any transaction, including revenue growth, operational efficiencies or expected synergies. For example, if we fail to recognize some or all of the strategic benefits and synergies expected from a transaction, goodwill and intangible assets may be impaired in future periods.

In addition, we may not be able to integrate acquisitions successfully into our existing business, and we could incur or assume unknown or unanticipated liabilities or contingencies, which may impact our results of operations. If we dispose of or otherwise exit certain businesses, there can be no assurance that we will not incur certain disposition related charges, or that we will be able to reduce the overheads related to the divested assets.

We also own an interest in a number of associates where we do not exercise management control and we are therefore limited in our ability to direct or manage the business to realize the anticipated benefits that we can achieve if we had full ownership.

Investment in innovative product offerings may fail to yield sufficient return to cover their investment.

From time to time, we may enter new lines of business or offer new products and services within existing lines of business. There can be substantial risks and uncertainties associated with these efforts, including the investment of significant time and resources, the possibility that these efforts will be unprofitable, and the risk of additional liabilities associated with these efforts. Failure to successfully manage these risks in the development and implementation of new lines of business and new products



Willis Group Holdings plc

and services could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results for operations. External factors, such as compliance with regulations, competitive alternatives and shifting market preferences, may also impact the successful implementation of a new line of business. In addition, we can provide no assurance that the entry into new lines of business or development of new products and services will be successful.

We are continually developing and investing in new and innovative offerings that we believe will address needs that we identify in the market. Nevertheless, the ability of these efforts to produce meaningful value is dependent on a number of other factors, some of which are outside of our control. For example, we have invested substantial time and resources in launching The Willis Advantage under the belief that this exchange will serve a useful role to help corporations and individuals in the United States manage their growing health care expenses. But in order for The Willis Advantage to be successful, health care insurers and corporate and individual participants must deem it suitable to participate in, and such decisions are based on their own particular circumstances.

Our business performance and growth plans could be negatively affected if we are not able to effectively apply technology to drive value for our clients through technology-based solutions or gain internal efficiencies through the effective application of technology and related tools.

Our success depends, in part, on our ability to develop and implement technology solutions that anticipate and keep pace with rapid and continuing changes in technology, industry standards and client preferences. We may not be successful in anticipating or responding to these developments in a timely and cost-effective manner, and our ideas may not be accepted in the marketplace. Additionally, the effort to gain technological expertise and develop new technologies in our business requires us to incur significant cost. Our competitors are seeking to develop competing technologies, and their success in this space may impact our ability to differentiate our services to our clients through the use of unique technological solutions. If we cannot offer new technologies as quickly as our competitors or if our competitors develop more cost-effective technologies, it could have a material adverse effect on our ability to obtain and complete client engagements.

Legal and Regulatory Risks

Our compliance systems and controls cannot guarantee that we comply with all applicable federal and state or foreign laws and regulations, and actions by regulatory authorities or changes in applicable laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate may have an adverse effect on our business.

Our activities are subject to extensive regulation under the laws of the United States, the United Kingdom, the European Union and its member states, and the other jurisdictions around the world in which we operate. In addition, we own an interest in a number of associates where we do not exercise management control. Over the last few years, regulators across the world are increasingly seeking to regulate brokers who operate in their jurisdictions. Compliance with laws and regulations that apply to our operations is complex and increases our cost of doing business. These laws and regulations include insurance and financial industry regulations, economic and trade sanctions and laws against financial crimes, including client money and anti-money laundering, bribery or other corruption, such as the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the UK Bribery Act, anti-competition and data privacy legislation. In most jurisdictions, governmental and regulatory authorities have the ability to interpret and amend these laws and regulations and impose penalties for non-compliance, including sanctions, civil remedies, monetary fines, injunctions, revocation of licenses or approvals, suspension of individuals, limitations on business activities or redress to clients. While we believe that we have substantially increased our focus on the geographic breadth of regulations to which we are subject, maintain good relationships with our key regulators and our current systems and controls are adequate, we cannot assure that such systems and controls will prevent any violations of any applicable laws and regulations.

Our business, results of operations, financial condition or liquidity may be materially adversely affected by actual and potential claims, lawsuits, investigations and proceedings.

We are subject to various actual and potential claims, lawsuits, investigations and other proceedings relating principally to alleged errors and omissions in connection with the placement of insurance and reinsurance in the ordinary course of business. Because we often assist our clients with matters, including the placement of insurance coverage and the handling of related claims, involving substantial amounts of money, errors and omissions claims against us may arise which allege our potential liability for all or part of the amounts in question.

Claimants can seek large damage awards and these claims can involve potentially significant defense costs. Such claims, lawsuits and other proceedings could, for example, include allegations of damages for our employees or sub-agents improperly failing to place coverage or notify claims on behalf of clients, to provide insurance carriers with complete and accurate information relating to the risks being insured or to appropriately apply funds that we hold for our clients on a fiduciary basis.



Risk factors

Errors and omissions claims, lawsuits and other proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business are covered in part by professional indemnity or other appropriate insurance. The terms of this insurance vary by policy year and self-insured risks have increased significantly in recent years. In respect of self-insured risks, we have established provisions against these items which we believe to be adequate in the light of current information and legal advice, and we adjust such provisions from time to time according to developments. Our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity may be adversely affected if in the future our insurance coverage proves to be inadequate or unavailable or there is an increase in liabilities for which we self-insure. Our ability to obtain professional indemnity insurance in the amounts and with the deductibles we desire in the future may be adversely impacted by general developments in the market for such insurance or our own claims experience.

We are also subject to actual and potential claims, lawsuits, investigations and proceedings outside of errors and omissions claims. An example of material claims for which we are subject that are outside of the error and omissions claims context relate to those arising out of the collapse of The Stanford Financial Group, for which we acted as brokers of record on certain lines of insurance.

The ultimate outcome of these matters cannot be ascertained and liabilities in indeterminate amounts may be imposed on us. It is thus possible that future results of operations or cash flows for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by an unfavorable resolution of these matters. In addition, these matters continue to divert management and personnel resources away from operating our business. Even if we do not experience significant monetary costs, there may also be adverse publicity associated with these matters that could result in reputational harm to the insurance brokerage industry in general or to us in particular that may adversely affect our business, client or employee relationships.

Accepting market derived income (MDI) may cause regulatory or other scrutiny, which may have a material and adverse effect on our business.

Insurance intermediaries have traditionally been remunerated by commission or fees paid by clients. Intermediaries also obtain revenue from insurance carriers. This is commonly known as market derived income or 'MDI'. MDI takes a variety of forms, including volume- or profit-based contingent commissions, facilities administration charges, business development agreements, and fees for providing certain data to carriers.

MDI creates various risks. Intermediaries have a duty to act in the best interests of their clients and payments from carriers can incentivize intermediaries to put carriers’ interests ahead of their clients. Accordingly, MDI may be subject to scrutiny by various regulators under conflict of interest, anti-trust, unfair competition, and anti-bribery laws and regulations. While accepting MDI is a lawful and acceptable business practice, and while we have established systems and controls to manage these risks, we cannot predict whether our position will result in regulatory or other scrutiny.

IT and Operational Risks

Data security breaches or improper disclosure of confidential company or personal data could result in material financial loss, loss of human capital, regulatory actions, reputational harm or legal liability.

Computer viruses, hackers and other external hazards, as well as improper or inadvertent staff behavior could expose confidential company and personal data systems to security breaches. Additionally, one of our significant responsibilities is to maintain the security and privacy of our clients’ confidential and proprietary information and the personal data of their employees. These increased risks, and expanding regulatory requirements regarding data security, could expose us to data loss, monetary and reputational damages and significant increases in compliance costs.

With respect to our commercial arrangements with third-party vendors, we have processes designed to require third-party IT outsourcing, offsite storage and other vendors to agree to maintain certain standards with respect to the storage, protection and transfer of confidential, personal and proprietary information. However, we remain at risk of a data breach due to the intentional or unintentional non-compliance by a vendor’s employee or agent, the breakdown of a vendor’s data protection processes, or a cyber-attack on a vendor’s information systems.

We have experienced a number of data incidents, resulting from human error as well as attempts at unauthorized access to our systems, which to date have not had a material impact on our business, operations or clients.

We maintain policies, procedures and technological safeguards designed to protect the security and privacy of this information. However, we cannot entirely eliminate the risk of data security breaches, improper access to or disclosure of confidential company or personally identifiable information. Our technology may fail to adequately secure the private information we hold and protect it from theft, computer viruses, hackers or inadvertent loss. In such circumstances, we may be held liable to our clients, which could result in legal liability or impairment to our reputation resulting in increased costs or loss of revenue.



Willis Group Holdings plc

Further, data privacy, information security, identity theft, and related computer and internet issues are matters of growing public concern and are subject to frequently changing rules and regulations. Our failure to adhere to or successfully implement processes in response to changing regulatory requirements and customer expectations in this area could result in legal liability or impairment to our reputation.

Interruption to or loss of our information processing capabilities or failure to effectively maintain and upgrade our information processing hardware or systems could cause material financial loss, regulatory actions, reputational harm or legal liability.

Our business depends significantly on effective information systems. Our capacity to service our clients relies on effective storage, retrieval, processing and management of information. Our information systems also rely on the commitment of significant resources to maintain and enhance existing systems, develop and create new systems and products in order to keep pace with continuing changes in information processing technology or evolving industry and regulatory standards and to be at the forefront of a range of technology relevant to our business.

If the data we rely on to run our business were found to be inaccurate or unreliable or if we fail to maintain effective and efficient systems (including through a telecommunications failure, failure to replace or update redundant or obsolete computer hardware, applications or software systems or if we experience other disruptions), this could result in material financial loss, regulatory action, reputational harm or legal liability.

Our inability to successfully recover should we experience a natural disaster or other significant disruption to business continuity could have a material adverse effect on our operations.

Our ability to conduct business may be adversely affected, even in the short-term, by a disruption in the infrastructure that supports our business and the communities where we are located. This may include a disruption caused by restricted physical site access, terrorist activities, disease pandemics, or outages to electrical, communications or other services used by our company, our employees or third parties with whom we conduct business. Although we have business continuity and disaster recovery procedures in place and insurance to protect against such contingencies, such procedures may not be entirely effective and any insurance or recovery procedures may not continue to be available at reasonable prices and may not address all such losses or compensate us for the possible loss of clients occurring during any period that we are unable to provide services. Our inability to successfully recover should we experience a natural disaster or other significant disruption to business continuity could have a material adverse effect on our operations.

Certain of our businesses pose underwriting, advisory or reputational risks and can have a significant adverse impact on our financial results.

We provide a broad range of brokerage, reinsurance and risk management consulting services to our clients worldwide. In addition, our Willis Capital Markets & Advisory business provides advice to insurance and reinsurance companies on a broad array of merger and acquisition transactions as well as capital markets products, including acting as underwriter or agent for primary issuances, operating a secondary insurance-linked securities trading desk and engaging in general capital markets and strategic advisory work. These operations may pose certain underwriting, advisory or reputational risks to our business.

Financial Risks

Our outstanding debt could adversely affect our cash flows and financial flexibility.

We had total consolidated debt outstanding of approximately

$2.3 billion

as of December 31, 2014 and our


interest expense was

$135 million

. Although management believes that our cash flows will be sufficient to service this debt, there may be circumstances in which required payments of principal and/or interest on this debt could adversely affect our cash flows and this level of indebtedness may:

require us to dedicate a significant portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our debt, thereby reducing the availability of cash flow to fund capital expenditures, to pursue other acquisitions or investments, to pay dividends and for general corporate purposes;

•

increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic conditions, including if we borrow at variable interest rates, which makes us vulnerable to increases in interest rates generally;

•

limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes or challenges relating to our business and industry; and

•

put us at a competitive disadvantage against competitors who have less indebtedness or are in a more favorable



Risk factors

•

position to access additional capital resources.

The terms of our current financings also include certain limitations. For example, the agreements relating to the debt arrangements and credit facilities contain numerous operating and financial covenants, including requirements to maintain minimum ratios of consolidated EBITDA to consolidated cash interest expense and maximum levels of consolidated funded indebtedness in relation to consolidated EBITDA, in each case subject to certain adjustments.

A failure to comply with the restrictions under our credit facilities and outstanding notes could result in a default under the financing obligations or could require us to obtain waivers from our lenders for failure to comply with these restrictions. The occurrence of a default that remains uncured or the inability to secure a necessary consent or waiver could cause our obligations with respect to our debt to be accelerated and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.

Our pension liabilities may increase which could require us to make additional cash contributions to our pension plans reducing the cash available for other uses.

We have two principal defined benefit plans: one in the United Kingdom and the other in the United States, and in addition, we have several smaller defined benefit pension plans in certain other countries in which we operate.

In 2012, we agreed a revised funding strategy with the UK plan's trustee under which we are committed to make additional cash contributions in the event that our adjusted EBITDA exceeds certain thresholds, or we make exceptional returns for our shareholders, including share buybacks or special dividends. As a result, we may be committed to make additional contributions through to 2017 based on the prior year's performance. During 2015, we will be required to negotiate a new funding arrangement which may change the contributions we are required to make during 2015 and beyond.

Total cash contributions, excluding employees’ salary sacrifice contributions, to these defined benefit pension plans in 2014 were $112 million. In 2015, the Company currently expects to make cash contributions of approximately $116 million, including exceptional returns, to these pension plans, although we may elect to contribute more. Future estimates are based on certain assumptions, including discount rates, interest rates, mortality, fair value of assets and expected return on plan assets.

We have taken actions to manage our pension liabilities, including closing our UK and US plans to new participants and restricting final pensionable salaries. Future benefit accruals in the US pension plan were also stopped, or frozen, on May 15, 2009. Nevertheless, the determination of pension expense and pension funding is based on a variety of rules and regulations. Changes in these rules and regulations could impact the calculation of pension plan liabilities and the valuation of pension plan assets. They may also result in higher pension costs, additional financial statement disclosure, and accelerate and increase the need to fully fund our pension plans through increased cash contributions. Further, a significant decline in the value of investments that fund our pension plan, if not offset or mitigated by a decline in our liabilities, may significantly alter the values and actuarial assumptions used to calculate our future pension expense and we could be required to fund our plan with significant additional amounts of cash. In addition to the critical assumptions described above, our plans use certain assumptions about the life expectancy of plan participants and surviving spouses. Periodic revision of those assumptions can materially change the present value of future benefits and therefore the funded status of the plans and the resulting periodic pension expense. Changes in our pension benefit obligations, the related net periodic costs or credits, and the required level of future cash contributions, may occur in the future due to any variance of actual results from our assumptions and changes in the number of participating employees. The need to make additional cash contributions may reduce our financial flexibility and increase liquidity risk by reducing the cash available to meet our other obligations, including the payment obligations under our credit facilities and other long-term debt, or other needs of our business.

We could incur substantial losses, including with respect to our own cash and fiduciary cash held on behalf of insurance companies and clients, if one of the financial institutions we use in our operations failed.

We maintain significant cash balances at various US depository institutions that are significantly in excess of the US Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation insurance limits. We also maintain significant cash balances in foreign financial institutions. A significant portion of this cash is fiduciary cash held on behalf of insurance companies or clients. If one or more of the institutions in which we maintain significant cash balances were to fail, our ability to access these funds might be temporarily or permanently limited, and we could face a material liquidity problem and potentially material financial losses. We would also be liable to claims made by the insurance companies or our clients regarding the fiduciary cash held on their behalf.



Willis Group Holdings plc

A downgrade to our corporate credit rating and the credit ratings of our outstanding debt may adversely affect our borrowing costs and financial flexibility and, under certain circumstances, may require us to offer to buy back some of our outstanding debt.

A downgrade in our corporate credit rating or the credit ratings of our debt would increase our borrowing costs including those under our credit facilities, and reduce our financial flexibility. In addition, certain downgrades would trigger a step-up in interest rates under the indentures for our 6.200% senior notes due 2017 and our 7.000% senior notes due 2019, which would increase our interest expense. If we need to raise capital in the future, any credit rating downgrade could negatively affect our financing costs or access to financing sources. This may in turn impact the assumptions when performing our goodwill impairment testing which may reduce the excess of fair value over carrying value of the reporting units.

In addition, under the indenture for our 4.625% senior notes due 2023 and our 6.125% senior notes due 2043, if we experience a ratings decline together with a change of control event, we would be required to offer to purchase our 4.625% senior notes due 2023 and our 6.125% senior notes due 2043 from holders unless we had previously redeemed those notes. We may not have sufficient funds available or access to funding to repurchase tendered notes in that event, which could result in a default under the notes. Any future debt that we incur may contain covenants regarding repurchases in the event of a change of control triggering event.

We are a holding company and, therefore, may not be able to receive dividends or other distributions in needed amounts from our subsidiaries.

Willis Group Holdings is a holding company that conducts no business of its own. We are dependent upon dividends and other payments from our operating subsidiaries to meet our obligations for paying principal and interest on outstanding debt obligations, for paying dividends to shareholders and for corporate expenses. Legal and regulatory restrictions, foreign exchange controls, as well as operating requirements of our subsidiaries, may limit our ability to obtain cash from these subsidiaries. For example, Willis Limited, our UK brokerage subsidiary regulated by the FCA, is currently required to maintain $126 million in unencumbered and available funds, of which at least $79 million must be in cash, for regulatory purposes. In the event our operating subsidiaries are unable to pay dividends and make other payments to Willis Group Holdings, we may not be able to service debt, pay obligations or pay dividends on ordinary shares.

If our goodwill becomes impaired, we may be required to record significant charges to earnings, which could have a significant adverse impact on our reported earnings.

We have a substantial amount of goodwill on our balance sheet as a result of acquisitions we have completed. We review goodwill for impairment annually or whenever events or circumstances indicate impairment may have occurred. Application of the impairment test requires judgment, including the identification of reporting units, assignment of assets, liabilities and goodwill to reporting units and determination of fair value of each reporting unit. Notwithstanding the fact that we recognized an impairment charge in fiscal year 2012 for our North American reporting unit, the risk remains that a significant deterioration in a key estimate or assumption or a less significant deterioration to a combination of assumptions or the sale of a part of a reporting unit could result in an impairment charge in the future, which could have a significant adverse impact on our reported earnings.

For further information on our testing for goodwill impairment, see ‘Critical Accounting Estimates’ under Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.

International Risks

Our significant non-US operations, particularly our London market operations, expose us to exchange rate fluctuations and various risks that could impact our business.

A significant portion of our operations is conducted outside the United States. Accordingly, we are subject to legal, economic and market risks associated with operating in foreign countries, including devaluations and fluctuations in currency exchange rates; imposition of limitations on conversion of foreign currencies into pounds sterling or dollars or remittance of dividends and other payments by foreign subsidiaries; hyperinflation in certain foreign countries; imposition or increase of investment and other restrictions by foreign governments; and the requirement of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws.

We report our operating results and financial condition in US dollars. Our US operations earn revenue and incur expenses primarily in US dollars. In our London market operations, however, we earn revenue in a number of different currencies, but expenses are almost entirely incurred in pounds sterling. Outside the United States and our London market operations, we



Risk factors

predominantly generate revenue and expenses in the local currency. The table gives an approximate analysis of revenues and expenses by currency in 2014.

Because of devaluations and fluctuations in currency exchange rates or the imposition of limitations on conversion of foreign currencies into US dollars, we are subject to currency translation exposure on the profits of our operations, in addition to economic exposure. Furthermore, the mismatch between pounds sterling revenues and expenses, together with any net sterling balance sheet position we hold in our US dollar denominated London market operations, creates an exchange exposure.

For example, as the pound sterling strengthens, the US dollars required to be translated into pounds sterling to cover the net sterling expenses increase, which then causes our results to be negatively impacted. However, any net sterling asset we are holding will be more valuable when translated into US dollars. Given these facts, the strength of the pound sterling relative to the US dollar has in the past had a material negative impact on our reported results. This risk could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, cash flow and results of operations in the future.

Additionally, as at December 31, 2014, we are using the SICAD I rate of approximately 12 Venezuelan Bolivars per US Dollar to report our Venezuelan financial position, following devaluation from the official rate of approximately six Bolivars per US dollar. We cannot predict whether there will be a further devaluation of the Venezuelan currency or whether the use of the SICAD I rate will continue to be supported. As at December 31, 2014 we have approximately $22 million of net monetary assets that are denominated in the Venezuela Bolivar.

Where needed, we deploy a hedging strategy to mitigate part of our operating exposure to exchange rate movements, but such mitigating attempts may not be successful. For more information on this strategy, see Part II Item 8 - 'Note 24 Derivative Financial Instruments and Hedging Activities'.

In conducting our businesses around the world, we are subject to political, economic, legal, market, nationalization, operational and other risks that are inherent in operating in many countries.

In conducting our businesses and maintaining and supporting our global operations, we are subject to political, economic, legal, market, nationalization, operational and other risks. Our businesses and operations continue to expand into new regions throughout the world, including emerging markets. The possible effects of economic and financial disruptions throughout the world could have an adverse impact on our businesses. These risks include:

•

the general economic and political conditions in foreign countries,

•

the imposition of controls or limitations on the conversion of foreign currencies or remittance of dividends and other payments by foreign subsidiaries;

•

the imposition of sanctions by both the United States and foreign governments;

•

imposition of withholding and other taxes on remittances and other payments from subsidiaries;

•

imposition or increase of investment and other restrictions by foreign governments;

•

the price of commodities, such as oil;

•

fluctuations in our tax rate;

•

Legislative and regulatory action could materially and adversely affect us and our effective tax rate may increase.

There is uncertainty regarding the tax policies of the jurisdictions where we operate (which include the potential legislative actions described below), and our tax rate may increase and any such increase may be material. Additionally, the tax laws of Ireland and other jurisdictions could change in the future, and such changes could cause a material change in our effective tax rate. For example, legislative action may be taken by the US Congress which, if ultimately enacted, could override tax treaties upon which we rely or could broaden the circumstances under which we would be considered a US resident, each of which could materially and adversely affect our effective tax rate and cash tax position. We cannot predict the outcome of any specific legislative proposals. However, if proposals were enacted that had the effect of limiting our ability to take advantage of tax treaties between Ireland and other jurisdictions (including the United States), we could be subjected to increased taxation. In addition, any future amendments to the current income tax treaties between Ireland and other jurisdictions could subject us to increased taxation.

Irish law differs from the laws in effect in the United States and may afford less protection to holders of our securities.

It may not be possible to enforce court judgments obtained in the United States against us in Ireland based on the civil liability provisions of the US federal or state securities laws. In addition, there is some uncertainty as to whether the courts of Ireland would recognize or enforce judgments of US courts obtained against us or our directors or officers based on the civil liabilities provisions of the US federal or state securities laws or hear actions against us or those persons based on those laws. We have been advised that the United States currently does not have a treaty with Ireland providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters. Therefore, a final judgment for the payment of money rendered by any US federal or state court based on civil liability, whether or not based solely on US federal or state securities laws, would not be directly enforceable in Ireland. While not directly enforceable, it is possible for a final judgment for the payment of money rendered by any US federal or state court based on civil liability to be enforced in Ireland through common law rules. However, this process is subject to numerous established principles and would involve the commencement of a new set of proceedings in Ireland to enforce the judgment.

As an Irish company, Willis Group Holdings is currently governed by the Irish Companies Acts 1963-2013. In late 2014, a new Companies Act (the “2014 Act”) was passed by both houses of the Irish parliament and is expected to apply to all companies including Willis Group Holdings from June 1, 2015. In addition to introducing new provisions, the 2014 Act carries over many of the existing rules applicable to Irish companies which differ in some material respects from laws generally applicable to US corporations and shareholders, including, among others, differences relating to interested director and officer transactions and shareholder lawsuits. Likewise, under the current regime and the 2014 Act, the duties of directors and officers of an Irish company generally are owed to the company only. Shareholders of Irish companies generally do not have a personal right of action against directors or officers of the company and may exercise such rights of action on behalf of the Company only in limited circumstances. Accordingly, holders of Willis Group Holdings securities may have more difficulty protecting their interests than would holders of securities of a corporation incorporated in a jurisdiction of the United States.

Item 3 — Legal Proceedings

In the ordinary course of business, the Company is subject to various actual and potential claims, lawsuits, and other proceedings relating principally to alleged errors and omissions in connection with the placement of insurance and reinsurance. Similar to other corporations, the Company is also subject to a variety of other claims, including those relating to the Company’s employment practices. Some of the claims, lawsuits and other proceedings seek damages in amounts which could, if assessed, be significant.

Errors and omissions claims, lawsuits, and other proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business are covered in part by professional indemnity or other appropriate insurance. The terms of this insurance vary by policy year and self-insured risks have increased significantly in recent years. Regarding self-insured risks, the Company has established provisions which are believed to be adequate in the light of current information and legal advice, and the Company adjusts such provisions from time to time according to developments.

On the basis of current information, the Company does not expect that the actual claims, lawsuits and other proceedings to which the Company is subject, or potential claims, lawsuits, and other proceedings relating to matters of which it is aware, will ultimately have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. Nonetheless, given the large or indeterminate amounts sought in certain of these actions, and the inherent unpredictability of litigation and



Willis Group Holdings plc

disputes with insurance companies, it is possible that an adverse outcome in certain matters could, from time to time, have a material adverse effect on the Company’s results of operations or cash flows in particular quarterly or annual periods.

The material actual or potential claims, lawsuits, and other proceedings, of which the Company is currently aware, are as follows:

Stanford Financial Group Litigation

The Company has been named as a defendant in 13 similar lawsuits relating to the collapse of The Stanford Financial Group (‘Stanford’), for which Willis of Colorado, Inc. acted as broker of record on certain lines of insurance. The complaints in these actions generally allege that the defendants actively and materially aided Stanford’s alleged fraud by providing Stanford with certain letters regarding coverage that they knew would be used to help retain or attract actual or prospective Stanford client investors. The complaints further allege that these letters, which contain statements about Stanford and the insurance policies that the defendants placed for Stanford, contained untruths and omitted material facts and were drafted in this manner to help Stanford promote and sell its allegedly fraudulent certificates of deposit.

The 13 actions are as follows:

•

Troice, et al. v. Willis of Colorado, Inc., et al.

, C.A. No. 3:9-CV-1274-N, was filed on July 2, 2009 in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas against Willis Group Holdings plc, Willis of Colorado, Inc. and a Willis associate, among others. On April 1, 2011, plaintiffs filed the operative Third Amended Class Action Complaint individually and on behalf of a putative, worldwide class of Stanford investors, adding Willis Limited as a defendant and alleging claims under Texas statutory and common law and seeking damages in excess of

$1 billion

, punitive damages and costs. On May 2, 2011, the defendants filed motions to dismiss the Third Amended Class Action Complaint, arguing,

inter alia

, that the plaintiffs’ claims are precluded by the Securities Litigation Uniform Standards Act of 1998 (‘SLUSA’).

On May 10, 2011, the court presiding over the Stanford-related actions in the Northern District of Texas entered an order providing that it would consider the applicability of SLUSA to the Stanford-related actions based on the decision in a separate Stanford action not involving a Willis entity,

Roland v. Green

, Civil Action No. 3:10-CV-0224-N. On August 31, 2011, the court issued its decision in

Roland

, dismissing that action with prejudice under SLUSA.

On October 27, 2011, the court in

Troice

entered an order (i) dismissing with prejudice those claims asserted in the Third Amended Class Action Complaint on a class basis on the grounds set forth in the

Roland

decision discussed above and (ii) dismissing without prejudice those claims asserted in the Third Amended Class Action Complaint on an individual basis. Also on October 27, 2011, the court entered a final judgment in the action.

On October 28, 2011, the plaintiffs in

Troice

filed a notice of appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. Subsequently,

Troice, Roland

and a third action captioned

Troice, et al. v. Proskauer Rose LLP

, Civil Action No. 3:09-CV-01600-N, which also was dismissed on the grounds set forth in the

Roland

decision discussed above and on appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, were consolidated for purposes of briefing and oral argument. Following the completion of briefing and oral argument, on March 19, 2012, the Fifth Circuit reversed and remanded the actions. On April 2, 2012, the defendants-appellees filed petitions for rehearing en banc. On April 19, 2012, the petitions for rehearing en banc were denied. On July 18, 2012, defendants-appellees filed a petition for writ of certiorari with the United States Supreme Court regarding the Fifth Circuit's reversal in Troice. On January 18, 2013, the Supreme Court granted our petition. Opening briefs were filed on May 3, 2013 and the Supreme Court heard oral argument on October 7, 2013. On February 26, 2014, the Supreme Court affirmed the Fifth Circuit’s decision.

On March 19, 2014, the plaintiffs in

Troice

filed a Motion to Defer Resolution of Motions to Dismiss, to Compel Rule 26(f) Conference and For Entry of Scheduling Order. That motion has now been fully briefed by the parties and awaits disposition by the court.

On March 25, 2014, the parties in

Troice

and the

Janvey, et al. v. Willis of Colorado, Inc., et al

. action discussed below stipulated to the consolidation of the two actions for pre-trial purposes under Rule 42(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. On March 28, 2014, the Court “so ordered” that stipulation and, thus, consolidated

Troice

and

Janvey

for pre-trial purposes under Rule 42(a).

On September 16, 2014, the court (a) denied the plaintiffs’ request to defer resolution of the defendants’ motions to dismiss, but granted the plaintiffs’ request to enter a scheduling order; (b) requested the submission of supplemental briefing by all parties on the defendants’ motions to dismiss, which the parties submitted on September 30, 2014; and (c) entered an order



Legal proceedings

setting a schedule for briefing and discovery regarding plaintiffs’ motion for class certification, which schedule, among other things, provides for the submission of the plaintiffs’ motion for class certification (following the completion of briefing and discovery) on April 20, 2015.

On December 15, 2014, the court granted in part and denied in part the defendants’ motions to dismiss. On January 30, 2015, the defendants answered the Third Amended Class Action Complaint.

•

Ranni v. Willis of Colorado, Inc., et al.

, C.A. No. 9-22085, was filed on July 17, 2009 against Willis Group Holdings plc and Willis of Colorado, Inc. in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida. The complaint was filed on behalf of a putative class of Venezuelan and other South American Stanford investors and alleges claims under Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (and Rule 10b-5 thereunder) and Florida statutory and common law and seeks damages in an amount to be determined at trial. On October 6, 2009,

Ranni

was transferred, for consolidation or coordination with other Stanford-related actions (including

Troice

), to the Northern District of Texas by the U.S. Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation (the ‘JPML’). The defendants have not yet responded to the complaint in

Ranni

. On August 26, 2014, the plaintiff filed a notice of voluntary dismissal of the action without prejudice.

Troice

, among others, also in the Northern District of Texas. The complaint was filed individually and on behalf of a putative class of Venezuelan Stanford investors, alleged claims under Texas statutory and common law and sought damages in excess of

$1 billion

, punitive damages, attorneys’ fees and costs. On December 18, 2009, the parties in

Troice

and

Canabal

stipulated to the consolidation of those actions (under the

Troice

civil action number), and, on December 31, 2009, the plaintiffs in

Canabal

filed a notice of dismissal, dismissing the action without prejudice.

Rupert, et al. v. Winter, et al.

, Case No. 2009C115137, was filed on September 14, 2009 on behalf of 97 Stanford investors against Willis Group Holdings plc, Willis of Colorado, Inc. and the same Willis associate, among others, in Texas state court (Bexar County). The complaint alleges claims under the Securities Act of 1933, Texas and Colorado statutory law and Texas common law and seeks special, consequential and treble damages of more than

$300 million

, attorneys’ fees and costs. On October 20, 2009, certain defendants, including Willis of Colorado, Inc., (i) removed

Rupert

to the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas, (ii) notified the JPML of the pendency of this related action and (iii) moved to stay the action pending a determination by the JPML as to whether it should be transferred to the Northern District of Texas for consolidation or coordination with the other Stanford-related actions. On April 1, 2010, the JPML issued a final transfer order for the transfer of

Rupert

to the Northern District of Texas. On January 24, 2012, the court remanded

Rupert

to Texas state court (Bexar County), but stayed the action until further order of the court. On August 13, 2012, the plaintiffs filed a motion to lift the stay, which motion was denied by the court on September 16, 2014. On October 10, 2014, the plaintiffs appealed the court’s denial of their motion to lift the stay to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. On January 5, 2015, the Fifth Circuit consolidated the appeal with the appeal in the

; and (5)

Zacarias, et al. v. Willis Group Holdings Public Limited Company, et al.

, Case No. 13-05678CA11, filed on behalf of 10 Stanford investors seeking compensatory damages in excess of

$12.5 million

. On June 3, 2013, Willis of Colorado, Inc. removed all five cases to the Southern District of Florida and, on June 4, 2013, notified the JPML of the pendency of these related actions. On June 10, 2013, the court in

Tisminesky

issued an order

sua sponte

staying and administratively closing that action pending a determination by the JPML as to whether it should be transferred to the Northern District of Texas for consolidation and coordination with the other Stanford-related actions. On June 11, 2013, Willis of Colorado, Inc. moved to stay the other four actions pending the JPML's transfer decision. On June 20, 2013, the JPML issued a conditional transfer order for the transfer of the five actions to the Northern District of Texas, the transmittal of which was stayed for seven days to allow for any opposition to be filed. On June 28, 2013, with no opposition having been filed, the JPML lifted the stay, enabling the transfer to go forward. On September 30, 2014, the court denied the plaintiffs’ motion to remand in

Zacarias

, and, on October 3, 2014, the court denied the plaintiffs’ motions to remand in

Tisminesky

and

. The defendants have not yet responded to the complaints in these actions.

•

Janvey, et al. v. Willis of Colorado, Inc., et al.

, Case No. 3:13-CV-03980-D, was filed on October 1, 2013 also in the Northern District of Texas against Willis Group Holdings plc, Willis Limited, Willis North America Inc., Willis of Colorado, Inc. and the same Willis associate. The complaint was filed (i) by Ralph S. Janvey, in his capacity as Court-Appointed Receiver for the Stanford Receivership Estate, and the Official Stanford Investors Committee (the ‘OSIC’) against all defendants and (ii) on behalf of a putative, worldwide class of Stanford investors against Willis North America Inc. Plaintiffs Janvey and the OSIC allege claims under Texas common law and the court’s Amended Order Appointing Receiver, and the putative class plaintiffs allege claims under Texas statutory and common law. Plaintiffs seek actual damages in excess of

$1 billion

, punitive damages and costs. On November 15, 2013, plaintiffs filed the operative First Amended Complaint, which added certain defendants unaffiliated with Willis. On February 28, 2014, the defendants filed motions to dismiss the First Amended Complaint, which motions were granted in part and denied in part by the court on December 5, 2014. On December 22, 2014, Willis filed a motion to amend the court’s December 5 order to certify an interlocutory appeal to the Fifth Circuit, and, on December 23, 2014, Willis filed a motion to amend and, to the extent necessary, reconsider the court’s December 5 order. On January 16, 2015, the defendants answered the First Amended Complaint. On January 28, 2015, the court denied Willis’s motion to amend the court’s December 5 order to certify an interlocutory appeal to the Fifth Circuit. Willis’s motion to amend and, to the extent necessary, reconsider the December 5 order remains pending.



Legal proceedings

As discussed above, on March 25, 2014, the parties in

Troice

and

Janvey

stipulated to the consolidation of the two actions for pre-trial purposes under Rule 42(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. On March 28, 2014, the Court “so ordered” that stipulation and, thus, consolidated

Troice

and

Janvey

for pre-trial purposes under Rule 42(a).

Additional actions could be brought in the future by other investors in certificates of deposit issued by Stanford and its affiliates. The Company disputes these allegations and intends to defend itself vigorously against these actions. The outcomes of these actions, however, including any losses or other payments that may occur as a result, cannot be predicted at this time.

Share Data

Our shares have been traded on the New York Stock Exchange (‘NYSE’) under the symbol ‘WSH’ since June 11, 2001. The high and low sale prices of our shares, as reported by the NYSE, are set forth below for the periods indicated.

On February 20, 2015, the last reported sale price of our shares as reported by the NYSE was $47.75 per share. As of February 20, 2015 there were approximately 1,192 shareholders on record of our shares.

Dividends

We normally pay dividends on a quarterly basis to shareholders of record on March 31, June 30, September 30 and December 31. The dividend payment dates and amounts are as follows:

There are no governmental laws, decrees or regulations in Ireland which will restrict the remittance of dividends or other payments to non-resident holders of the Company’s shares.



Share data and dividends

In circumstances where one of Ireland’s many exemptions from dividend withholding tax (‘DWT’) does not apply, dividends paid by the Company will be subject to Irish DWT (currently 20 percent). Residents of the United States should be exempt from Irish DWT provided relevant documentation supporting the exemption has been put in place. While the US-Ireland Double Tax Treaty contains provisions reducing the rate of Irish DWT in prescribed circumstances, it should generally be unnecessary for US residents to rely on the provisions of this treaty due to the wide scope of exemptions from Irish DWT available under Irish domestic law. Irish income tax may also arise in respect of dividends paid by the Company. However, US residents entitled to an exemption from Irish DWT generally have no Irish income tax liability on dividends.

With respect to non-corporate US shareholders, certain dividends from a qualified foreign corporation may be subject to reduced rates of taxation. A foreign corporation is treated as a qualified foreign corporation with respect to dividends received from that corporation on shares that are readily tradable on an established securities market in the United States, such as our shares. Non-corporate US shareholders that do not meet a minimum holding period requirement for our shares during which they are not protected from the risk of loss or that elect to treat the dividend income as ‘investment income’ pursuant to section 163(d)(4) of the Code will not be eligible for the reduced rates of taxation regardless of our status as a qualified foreign corporation. In addition, the rate reduction will not apply to dividends if the recipient of a dividend is obligated to make related payments with respect to positions in substantially similar or related property. This disallowance applies even if the minimum holding period has been met. US shareholders should consult their own tax advisors regarding the application of these rules given their particular circumstances.

Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds

During the quarter ended

December 31, 2014

, no shares were issued by the Company without registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.

Purchases of Equity Securities by the Issuer and Affiliated Purchasers

The Company is authorized to buy back its ordinary shares, by way of redemption, and will consider whether to do so from time to time based on many factors including market conditions. The Company is authorized to purchase up to one billion shares from time to time in the open market (such open market purchases would be effected as redemptions under Irish law) and it may also redeem its shares through negotiated trades with persons who are not affiliated with the Company as long as the cost of the acquisition of the Company's shares does not exceed $611 million.

In the fourth quarter 2014, the Company bought back 244,300 shares at an average price of $40.86 for a total cost of approximately $10 million, on a trade date basis. The Company intends to buy back approximately $175 million in shares in 2015 to offset the increase in shares outstanding resulting from the exercise of employee stock options. The buybacks will be made in the open market or through privately-negotiated transactions, from time to time, depending on market conditions. The share buy back program may be modified, extended or terminated at any time by the Board of Directors.

Item 7 —

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

This discussion includes references to non-GAAP financial measures as defined in Regulation G of the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission (‘SEC’). We present such non-GAAP financial measures, specifically underlying and organic non-GAAP financial measures, as we believe such information is of interest to the investment community because it provides additional meaningful methods of evaluating certain aspects of the Company’s operating performance from period to period on a basis that may not be otherwise apparent on a GAAP basis, and these provide a measure against which our businesses may be assessed in the future.

Underlying total revenues, underlying total expenses, underlying salaries and benefits, underlying other operating expenses, underlying operating income, underlying operating margin, underlying EBITDA, underlying net income and underlying earnings per diluted share (hereinafter referred to collectively as the "underlying measures") are calculated by excluding the impact of certain items and period over period movements in foreign currency, from the most directly comparable GAAP measures.

Organic commissions and fees, total revenues, organic total expenses, organic salaries and benefits, organic other operating expenses, organic operating income, organic operating margin and organic EBITDA (hereinafter referred to collectively as the "organic measures") further adjust underlying measures to exclude the twelve month impact from acquisitions and disposals from the most directly comparable GAAP measures.

Our methods of calculating these measures may differ from those used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited. These financial measures

should be viewed in addition to, not in lieu of, the consolidated financial

statements for the year ended

December 31, 2014

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Business Overview

We provide a broad range of insurance broking, risk management, and consulting services to our clients worldwide and during the period organized our business into three segments: Global, North America, and International.

For additional information regarding our business, see the more detailed discussion under Part I, Item 1 - 'Business' of this Form 10-K.

Market Conditions

Due to the cyclical nature of the insurance market and the impact of other market conditions on insurance premiums, commission revenues may vary widely between accounting periods. A period of low or declining premium rates, generally known as a ‘soft’ or ‘softening’ market, generally leads to downward pressure on commission revenues and can have a material adverse impact on our commission revenues and operating margin. A ‘hard’ or ‘firming’ market, during which premium rates rise, generally has a favorable impact on our commission revenues and operating margin. Rates, however, vary by geography, industry and client segment. As a result and due to the global and diverse nature of our business, we view rates in the aggregate.

Market conditions in our industry are generally defined by factors such as the strength of the economies in the various geographic regions in which we serve around the world, insurance rate movements, and insurance and reinsurance buying patterns of our clients.

Early in 2013, the reinsurance market was generally flat; however, as the year progressed we saw changing market sentiment driven by changes in the sources of capital and increases in capital supply in the reinsurance market, most notably within the North American catastrophe-exposed property market. The influx of third-party capital coupled with changes to reinsurance buying patterns and regulatory complexity is leading to growing complexity in the reinsurance market and a softening of prices.



Business discussion

In 2014 we noted a continuation of this trend, and signs of acceleration, towards softening reinsurance rates across almost all classes of business and geographies as positive 2013 results for traditional reinsurers exacerbated the growing supply of capital from third-party investors. In addition, for primary insurance companies, the ability to recognize primary rate increases may be coming to an end and consequently, rate flattening and even rate reductions are seen in many territories on primary insurance classes.

In the face of this challenging environment, we have adopted a strategy to: (1) invest selectively in growth areas, defined by geography, industry sector, and client segment and (2) better coordinate our business so as to bring our clients greater access to the Company's specialty areas and analytical capabilities, among other things. Our growth strategy also involves increasing our investment in, and deployment of, our analytical capabilities.

Financial Performance

The following is a summary of our 2014 GAAP financial results:

•

Total revenues of

$3,802 million

increased by

$147 million

, or

4.0 percent

over the prior year. This growth included

$134 million

increase in commissions and fees, led by our International segment which reported high single digit growth, and a net $26 million increase from the impact of acquisitions and disposals. Foreign exchange negatively impacted total revenues by $30 million.

•

Total operating expenses of

$3,155 million

increased by

$163 million

, or

5.4 percent

over the prior year. This growth included $36 million of restructuring costs related to the Operational Improvement Program, a $34 million net increase in expenses from acquisitions and disposals, and $6 million adverse foreign currency movements. The remaining increase was primarily due to higher salaries and benefits expense driven by increased headcount, pay reviews, and higher incentive charges, along with increased travel, accommodation and entertainment expenses, and systems costs.

•

Operating margin decreased 110 basis points to

17.0 percent

from

18.1 percent

in the prior year.

•

Net income attributable to Willis Group Holdings was

$362 million

, or

$2.00

per diluted share, a decrease of $

3 million

, or

0.8 percent

, from

$365 million

, or

$2.04

per diluted share, in


.

•

Cash flows from operating activities were $

477 million

in


, a decrease of $

84 million

, or

15.0 percent

from

$561 million

in


.

Our non-GAAP financial measures were as follows:

•

Underlying total revenues of

$3,802 million

increased

$177 million

, or

4.9 percent

, over the prior year. Excluding the net

$26 million

increase from acquisitions and disposals, organic total revenues increased

$151 million

, or

4.2 percent

over the prior year. This growth was driven by high commissions and fees growth in our International segment, supported by growth in Willis North America and Global. In addition to this, Other income increased

$12 million

primarily due to a settlement related to a specialty book of business within Global.

•

Underlying total expenses of

$3,119 million

increased

$168 million

, or

5.7 percent

, over the prior year. Excluding the net

$34 million

increase from acquisitions and disposals, organic total operating expenses of

$3,066 million

increased

$134 million

, or

4.6 percent

, over the prior year. This was primarily due to higher salaries and benefits expense, driven by increased headcount, pay reviews, and higher incentive charges, along with increased travel, accommodation and entertainment expenses, and systems costs.

•

The resultant organic operating margin decreased by 20 basis points to

18.2 percent

from

18.4 percent

in the prior year.

Operational improvement program

In April 2014, the Company announced an operational improvement program that would allow the Company to continue to strengthen its client service, realize operational efficiencies, and invest in new capabilities for growth.



Willis Group Holdings plc

The main elements of the program include the following:

•

movement of more than 3,500 support roles from higher cost locations to Willis facilities in lower cost locations, bringing the ratio of employees in higher cost versus lower cost near-shore and off-shore centers from approximately 80:20 to approximately 60:40;

•

net workforce reductions in support positions;

•

lease consolidation in real estate and reductions in ratios of seats per employee and square footage of floor space per employee; and

•

information technology systems simplification and rationalization.

The program began in the second quarter of 2014 and is expected to be complete by the end of 2017. The program is expecting to deliver cumulative cost savings of at least $420 million through 2017 and annual cost savings of approximately $300 million starting in 2018.

Actual cost savings of approximately $11 million were achieved in 2014, the estimated phasing of future cost savings is as follows: at least $60 million in 2015, approximately $135 million in 2016, and approximately $235 million in 2017. The estimated cost savings are before any potential reinvestment for future growth.

To achieve these savings, the Company expects to incur cumulative spend, including capital expenditure, amounting to approximately $410 million through the end of 2017. Program spend in 2014 was $36 million, with approximately $130 million expected for 2015 and the balance of approximately $240 million expected to be incurred in 2016 and 2017.

Total spend, actual savings, and timing may vary positively or negatively from these estimates due to changes in the scope, underlying assumptions, or execution risk of the restructuring plan throughout its duration.

The Company expects that about 70 percent of the annualized 2018 savings would come from role relocation and reduction, and about 30 percent of the savings from real estate, information technology and other areas.

To assist with the analysis of the effectiveness of the program the Company will provide the following metrics annually:

•

ratio of full time employees (FTEs) in higher cost geographies to lower cost near-shore and off-shore centers as at December 31, 2014 was 78:22 (March 31, 2014 ratio was 80:20);

•

indexed ratio of square footage of real estate per FTE as at December 31, 2014 was 98 (March 31, 2014 ratio of square footage of real estate per FTE = 100); and

•

indexed ratio of desks per FTE as at December 31, 2014 was 99 (March 31, 2014 ratio of desks per FTE = 100).

The restructuring costs of $36 million related to the Operational Improvement Program incurred in 2014 included:

•

$3 million of termination benefits in the North America segment relating to the elimination of 51 positions across a number of North America retail locations;

•

$5 million in the International segment, of which approximately $3 million was termination benefits related to the elimination of 81 positions across the International network and approximately $2 million spent on professional services to support the program;

•

$11 million in the Global segment, including $10 million of termination benefits related to the elimination of approximately 181 positions from the Willis Insurance UK and UK Reinsurance divisions, in addition to approximately $1 million of professional fees related to a study on process improvement; and

•

$17 million in Corporate and other, including approximately $16 million of professional fees, primarily related to advisory services, and approximately $1 million related to system implementation and other core resources supporting the program.

Acquisitions and Disposals

In January, 2015 the Company reached an agreement to acquire a majority interest in Miller Insurance Services LLP, a leading London-based wholesale specialist. The transaction is subject to customary closing conditions and regulatory approval and is expected to close in the second quarter of 2015.

During the year ended December 31, 2014 we made the following material acquisitions in line with our strategy to invest in targeted acquisitions with a focus on earnings accretion, competitive position, and fit.



Business discussion

In the fourth quarter of 2014, the Company acquired 75.8 percent of Max Matthiessen Holding AB and subsidiaries (collectively referred to as Max Matthiessen), a leading employee benefits adviser in Sweden, for cash consideration of

$204 million

.

In the second quarter of 2014, the Company acquired

100 percent

of Charles Monat Limited and its subsidiaries (collectively referred to as Charles Monat), a life insurance solutions adviser to high net worth clients based in Hong Kong, for cash consideration of

$59 million

. Additional consideration estimated at

$29 million

is payable in annual installments over the next five years, based on a multiple of EBITDA of the entities acquired, during the period from

May 25, 2014

until

September 2, 2019

. This consideration has been assessed to have a fair value of

$12 million

at the date of acquisition.

During 2014 we have also disposed of a number of low growth offices and business from our North America reporting unit that no longer align strategically with the rest of the North America segment.

Non-GAAP financial measures

During 2014, we made changes to the non-GAAP financial measures that we use to provide additional meaningful methods of evaluating the Company’s operating performance replacing our adjusted measures with new underlying measures and introduced new organic non-GAAP financial measures.

Previously we excluded certain specified items from total expenses, salaries and benefits, other operating expenses, operating margin, operating income, net income (loss) and earnings per share to calculate adjusted total expenses, adjusted salaries and benefits, adjusted other operating expenses, adjusted operating margin, adjusted operating income, adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per share.

In addition to these certain specified items, we exclude the period-over-period foreign currency movements to calculate our underlying non-GAAP financial measures and further exclude the twelve month impact from acquisitions and disposals to calculate our organic non-GAAP financial measures.

We believe that the understanding of the Company's performance and comparative analysis of our results is enhanced by our disclosure of the following non-GAAP financial measures. We use these and other measures to establish Group performance targets and evaluate the performance of our operations.

Our method for calculating these measures may differ from those used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited.

Underlying measures

Our underlying non-GAAP measures are calculated by excluding certain items (as detailed below) from total revenues, total expenses, salaries and benefits, other operating expenses, operating income, net income (loss), and earnings per diluted share, respectively, the most directly comparable GAAP measures.

Additionally, prior year total revenues, total expenses and net income (loss) and diluted earnings per share have been rebased to current period exchange rates to eliminate the impact of year over year foreign exchange movements.

The following items have been excluded from total revenues, total expenses, salaries and benefits, other operating expenses, operating income and net income (loss) as applicable:

(i)

restructuring charges relating the Operational Improvement Program;

(ii)

costs associated with the 2013 Expense Reduction Initiative;

(iii)

fees related to the extinguishment of debt;

(iv)

the additional incentive accrual recognized following the replacement of annual cash retention awards with annual cash bonuses which do not feature a repayment requirement;

(v)

write-off of unamortized cash retention awards following the decision to eliminate the repayment requirement on past awards;

(vi)

India joint venture settlement;

(vii)

goodwill impairment charge;



Willis Group Holdings plc

(viii)

valuation allowance against deferred tax assets;

(ix)

write-off of uncollectible accounts receivable balance and associated legal fees arising in Chicago due to fraudulent overstatement of commissions and fees;

(x)

insurance recoveries related to the fraudulent overstatement of commissions and fees;

(xi)

foreign exchange loss from the devaluation of the Venezuelan currency; and

(xii)

gains and losses on the disposal of operations.

Organic measures

Our organic non-GAAP measures are calculated by excluding the twelve month impact from acquisitions and disposals, together with the impact of certain items, including foreign currency, that are discussed above, from total revenues, total expenses, salaries and benefits, other operating expenses, operating income, respectively, the most directly comparable GAAP measures.

A reconciliation of reported total expenses, salaries and benefits and other operating expense, the most directly comparable GAAP measures, to underlying and organic total expenses, underlying and organic salaries and benefits and underlying and organic other operating expenses is as follows (in millions, except percentages):

Consolidated Results for


compared to


Revenues

Total revenues by segment for


and


are shown below (millions, except percentages):

_________________

(a)

Organic commissions and fees growth excludes: (i) the impact of foreign currency translation; (ii) the first twelve months of net commission and fee revenues generated from acquisitions; and (iii) the net commission and fee revenues related to operations disposed of in each period presented. Our methods of calculating this measures may differ from those used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited.

Total revenues of

$3,802 million

increased by

$147 million

, or

4.0 percent

, in


compared to


. This was primarily due to

3.7 percent

growth in commissions and fees.

Total commissions and fees in


were

$3,767 million

, up

$134 million

, or

3.7 percent

, from

$3,633 million

in


. This increase was comprised of organic growth of $134 million, or

3.8 percent

, and growth through acquisitions and disposals of $28 million, or

0.8 percent

, partially offset by negative foreign currency movements of $30 million or

0.9 percent

.

The foreign currency impact was as a result of the strengthening of the US dollar against a number of currencies that our commissions and fees are earned in, most significantly the Euro, Australian dollar and Brazilian real, partially offset by the year-on-year weakening of the US dollar against the Pound Sterling.

The Global segment reported

2.1 percent

growth in commissions and fees, comprising

1.4 percent

organic growth and a

0.9 percent

positive impact from foreign currency translation. This growth was partially offset by a net

0.2 percent

decline from acquisitions and disposals primarily due to a disposal in third quarter 2013.

Organic commissions and fees growth of

1.4 percent

was driven by strong new business growth and higher client retention levels compared with the year ago period, partially offset by the negative impact from declining insurance and reinsurance rates and significant construction projects in 2013 that did not recur in 2014.

The North America segment reported

1.2 percent

growth in commissions and fees compared to


including organic growth of

2.8 percent

partially offset by

1.5 percent

negative impact from the disposal of non-strategic low growth offices, and a negative

0.1 percent

impact from foreign currency translation.

The International segment reported

9.7 percent

growth in commissions and fees compared with


, comprising

9.0 percent

organic growth and

5.8 percent

positive impact from the acquisitions of Max Matthiessen and Charles Monat. This was partially offset by a

5.1 percent

negative impact from foreign currency translation.

Organic commissions and fees growth by segment is discussed further in 'Review of Segmental Results', below.

Other income reported an increase of

$12 million

compared to


. This increase was primarily due to a $12 million settlement related to a specialty book of business within the Global segment.

Salaries and Benefits

Salaries and benefits were $

107 million

, or

4.8 percent

, higher in


compared with


and includes a net $20 million increase from acquisitions and disposals, $3 million of adverse foreign currency movements, and $29 million benefit from the



Business discussion

non-recurrence of 2013 expense reduction initiative costs. The remaining increase of $113 million was driven by increased headcount, pay reviews, and higher incentives.

Other Expenses

Other operating expenses

were $

23 million

, or

3.6 percent

, higher in


compared with


. This growth included a net $9 million increase from acquisitions and disposals, $2 million of adverse foreign currency movements, $12 million benefit from the non-recurrence of 2013 expense reduction initiative costs and marketing costs. The remaining increase of $25 million was primarily due to higher travel, accommodation and entertainment expenses, along with increased systems costs.

Depreciation expense

was

$92 million

in


, compared with

$94 million

in


. The decrease of

$2 million

included $5 million benefit from non-recurrence of 2013 expense reduction initiative costs offset by $1 million of adverse foreign currency movements.

Amortization of intangible assets

was

$54 million

in


, a reduction of

$1 million

compared to


. The decrease primarily reflects the ongoing reduction in the HRH acquisition amortization partially offset by the increased charge relating to the acquisition of Charles Monat and Max Matthiessen.

Restructuring costs

related to our operational improvement program were $36 million in


, compared with $nil in


. This is discussed in further detail in the 'Operational improvement program' section in the executive summary section above.

Income Taxes

The tax rate for 2014 was 31 percent, compared with 24 percent for 2013. Both years were impacted by certain items and the continuing requirement to retain a valuation allowance against our US deferred tax assets. The increase in tax rate over the prior year is partly attributable to the US returning to a tax paying position for the 2014 tax year.

After adjusting for certain items, as listed below, the tax rate for 2014 was 25 percent:

•

a tax benefit of $1 million associated with the $14 million pre-tax expense arising in relation to the Venezuela currency devaluation;

•

a tax benefit of $9 million associated with charges incurred in relation to the Operational Improvement Program;

•

a tax expense of $10 million associated with pre-tax gains of $12 million related to business disposals;

•

an expense of $21 million relating to an increase in US valuation allowance. The increase is attributable to a change in the US deferred tax position following resolution of uncertain tax positions from prior periods.

Interest in Earnings of Associates, net of Tax

The majority of our interest in earnings of associates relates to our share of ownership of Gras Savoye, the leading broker in France. Interest in earnings of associates, net of tax, in


was

$14 million

compared to $

nil

in


. The increase was primarily due to the non-recurrence of charges relating to the 2013 reorganization program and other non-recurring items, with improved underlying financial performance, in Gras Savoye.

Revenues

Total revenues by segment for


and


are shown below (millions, except percentages):

_________________

(a)

Organic commissions and fees growth excludes: (i) the impact of foreign currency translation; (ii) the first twelve months of net commission and fee revenues generated from acquisitions; and (iii) the net commission and fee revenues related to operations disposed of in each period presented.

Our methods of calculating these measures may differ from those used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited.

Total revenues increased by

$175 million

, or

5.0 percent

, in


compared to


. This was primarily due to

4.9 percent

growth in organic commissions and fees, partially offset by a

0.3 percent

negative impact from foreign exchange and a

$3 million

decrease in investment income due to continued falling yields on deposits.

Total commissions and fees in


were

$3,633 million

, up

$175 million

, or

5.1 percent

, from

$3,458 million

in


. This increase was due to organic growth of

4.9 percent

and growth through acquisitions and disposals of 0.5 percent partially offset by negative foreign currency movements of $13 million or

0.3 percent

.

Organic growth of

4.9 percent

was driven by low double-digit new business growth tempered by lost business.

Commissions and fees were reduced by a net $9 million impact of two revenue recognition adjustments in the North America and International segments discussed below.

The Global segment reported

4.2 percent

growth in commissions and fees, comprising

4.3 percent

organic growth, a

0.8 percent

positive impact from acquisitions and disposals, and a

0.9 percent

negative impact from foreign currency translation. Organic commissions and fees growth of

4.3 percent

was led by high single-digit growth in Reinsurance, where all the divisions reported positive growth. Global Specialties reported mid single-digit growth primarily due to strong growth from Financial and Executive Risk, and P&C and Construction.

The North America segment reported a

5.3 percent

growth in organic commissions and fees, compared to


, comprising

4.8 percent

organic commissions and fees growth, a

0.6 percent

positive impact from acquisition of Avalon Actuarial Inc., and a

0.1 percent

negative impact from foreign currency translation. Organic growth in commissions and fees was positively impacted by a $5 million adjustment to align the recognition of revenue in the North America Personal Lines business with the rest of the Group.

The International segment reported

5.9 percent

growth in commissions and fees compared with 2012, comprising

5.8 percent

organic commissions and fees growth and a

0.1 percent

positive impact from foreign currency translation. Organic growth in commissions and fees included the negative impact of a $15 million adjustment to align the recognition of revenue in China with the rest of the Group.

Investment income in


at

$15 million

was

$3 million

lower than in


. Organic commissions and fees growth by segment is discussed further in 'Review of Segmental Results', below.

Salaries and Benefits

Salaries and benefits increased by

$268 million

, or

10.8 percent

, in


compared with


. Foreign currency movements lowered salaries and benefits by $9 million, or 0.4 percent.



Business discussion

In 2012 we recorded a $452 million charge as a result of the change in remuneration policy for future incentive awards and the elimination of the repayment requirement on past awards. Excluding the impact of this change and foreign currency movements, salaries and benefits were up by $193 million or 9.5 percent. This increase is primarily due to annual salary reviews, increased headcount from targeted investments, increased incentives from the change in remuneration policy and growth in commissions and fees, and an additional charge to increase the 401(k) match in North America. It also includes $29 million relating to the Expense Reduction Initiative that was undertaken in first quarter 2013.

Other Expenses

Other operating expenses

were

$36 million

, or

6.0 percent

, higher in


compared with


. The

$36 million

increase includes $12 million of costs that were incurred in first quarter 2013 as part of our Expense Reduction Initiative.

The remaining $24 million increase was primarily due to higher business development costs, consulting and professional fees to assist us in our growth initiatives, and marketing costs.

Depreciation expense

was

$94 million

in


, compared with

$79 million

in


. The increase of $15 million includes $5 million which was incurred in first quarter 2013 relating to the rationalization of property and systems as part of our Expense Reduction Initiative. The remaining $10 million increase is primarily due to a number of significant information technology related projects becoming operational during the year and the write-off of replaced systems and other assets

Amortization of intangible assets

was

$55 million

in


, a reduction of $4 million compared to


. The decrease primarily reflects the ongoing reduction in the HRH acquisition amortization.

Goodwill impairment

charge was $nil in 2013 (2012: $492 million). This was a non-cash charge recognized related to the impairment of the carrying value of the North America reporting unit's goodwill. For further information on our testing for goodwill impairment, see 'Critical Accounting Estimates', below.

Loss on Extinguishment of Debt

The Company incurred total losses on extinguishment of debt of

$60 million

during the year ended December 31, 2013. This was made up of a tender premium of

$65 million

, the write-off of unamortized debt issuance costs of

$2 million

and a credit for the reduction of the fair value adjustment on 5.625% senior notes due 2015 of

$7 million

.

Income Taxes

The effective tax rate on ordinary income for 2013 was 20 percent, compared with 25 percent for 2012. The effective tax rate on ordinary income is calculated before the impact of certain discrete items. Discrete items occurring in 2013 with a significant impact on the tax rate were:

•

an incremental US tax expense of $9 million recorded after the taking into account the impact of adjustments to the valuation allowance placed against US deferred tax assets, US costs of $16 million associated with the Expense Reduction Initiative, and US costs of $61 million associated with the extinguishment of debt;

•

further non-US costs of $30 million associated with the Expense Reduction Initiative that are generally relieved at a rate higher than the underlying rate;

•

a net benefit of $4 million associated with a reduction in the corporation tax rate being applied to temporary tax differences in the UK;

•

a net benefit of $7 million associated with a change in the recognition of unrecognized tax benefits outside of the US; and

•

a net expense of $1 million associated with tax on profits of prior periods to bring in line the Company’s tax provision to filed tax positions.

Including the impact of discrete items, the tax rate for 2013 was 24 percent. This compares to a tax charge of $101 million recorded on the net loss from continuing operations of $337 million in 2012.



Willis Group Holdings plc

Interest in Earnings of Associates, net of Tax

The majority of our interest in earnings of associates relates to our share of ownership of Gras Savoye, the leading broker in France. Interest in earnings of associates, net of tax, in


was $

nil

compared to

$5 million

in


. The decline was mainly driven by lower net income recorded in Gras Savoye due to the costs recognized in relation to a reorganization program undertaken in the year designed to drive growth in revenues and operational efficiencies.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

Liquidity

We believe that our balance sheet and strong cash flow provide us with the platform and flexibility to remain committed to our cash allocation strategy of:

•

investing in the business for growth;

•

value-creating merger and acquisition activity;

•

generating a steadily rising dividend; and

•

the repurchase of shares.

Our principal sources of liquidity are cash from operations, available cash and cash equivalents and amounts available under our revolving credit facilities, excluding the UK facility which is solely for use by our main regulated UK entity in certain exceptional circumstances, and the Willis Securities facility, which is solely used for regulatory capital and securities underwriting purposes only.

Our principal short-term uses of liquidity and capital resources are operating expenses, capital expenditures, dividends and repurchase of shares, funding defined benefit pension plans, and servicing of debt.

Our long-term liquidity requirements consist of the repayment of the principal amount of outstanding notes; borrowings under our 7-year term loan; and funding defined benefit pension plans as discussed below.

As at

December 31, 2014

cash and cash equivalents were

$635 million

, a decrease of $161 million compared to

December 31, 2013

. Included within cash and cash equivalents is $545 million available for corporate purposes and $90 million held within our regulated UK entities for regulatory capital adequacy requirements.

Cash flows from operating activities fell to

, we made five drawings totaling $1,175 million and five repayments of $1,175 million on the Willis Securities facility.

The primary uses of funds during


included $401 million cash payments of 2013 incentive awards, $210 million related to payments of dividends, $122 million cash contributions, including employees' salary sacrifice contributions, to our defined benefit pension schemes, capital expenditures of $113 million related to leasehold improvements, information technology and transformation projects, $241 million related to acquisitions, primarily Max Matthiessen Holding AB and Charles Monat Limited, and a $4 million deferred cash payment related to the partial acquisition of the remaining noncontrolling interest in our China operation in a prior period.

The Company is authorized to buy back its ordinary shares by way of redemption, and will consider whether to do so from time

to time based on many factors including market conditions. During 2014, the Company bought back 5,050,000 shares for a total cost of $213 million. In February 2015, Willis announced that it intends to buy back approximately $175 million in shares in 2015 to offset the increase in shares outstanding resulting from the exercise of employee stock options.

Based on current market conditions and information available to us at this time, we believe that we have sufficient liquidity to meet our cash needs for the next twelve months.

Operating Activities

Net cash provided by operating activities in


decreased by $84 million to $477 million compared with 2013.

The

$477 million

cash from operations comprises net income of

$373 million

, net

$257 million

of non-cash adjustments to reconcile net income to cash provided by operating activities and $150 million of negative working capital movements.

The non-cash adjustments included depreciation, amortization of intangible assets, share-based compensation and provisions for deferred income taxes.

Movements in working capital included

$401 million

of incentive payments and

$122 million

cash contributions (including $10 million for employees’ salary sacrifice) to our defined benefit pension schemes. Additionally, there was a

$66 million

increase in accounts receivable, as revenue recognized in 2014 was greater than cash collection, and

$432 million

positive movement in other liabilities which included incentives accrued during 2014 that will be paid in 2015.



Willis Group Holdings plc

The $84 million decrease in cash provided by operating activities in 2014 compared to 2013 was primarily driven by lower reported operating income, the non-recurrence of closed-out derivative contracts in the prior year, increased working capital and higher cash taxes paid.

Investing Activities

Net cash used in investing activities in


was

$276 million

. This included capital expenditure of

$113 million

, cash used to purchase subsidiaries, intangible assets and other investments of $255 million partly offset by

$6 million

cash received from the sale of fixed and intangible assets and $86 million of proceeds from the disposal of operations.

Financing Activities

Net cash used in financing activities in


was $323 million primarily due to dividends paid, including dividends paid to noncontrolling interests, of $227 million, $213 million to repurchase approximately five million shares and $15 million of mandatory repayments against the term loan offset by cash receipts of $134 million from the issue of shares.

Consolidated Cash Flow for 2013 compared to 2012

Net cash provided by operating activities in 2013 increased by $36 million to $561 million compared with 2012.

The $561 million cash from operations comprises net income of $377 million, net $313 million of non-cash adjustments to reconcile net income to cash provided by operating activities and working capital movements.

The non-cash adjustments included depreciation, amortization of intangible assets, share-based compensation, gain on derivative instruments, provision for deferred income taxes and the tender premium on early redemption of our debt, which is presented as a financing cash item.

Movements in working capital included $346 million of incentive payments and $150 million cash contributions (including $12 million for employees’ salary sacrifice) to our defined benefit pension schemes. Additionally, there was a $116 million increase in accounts receivable, as revenue recognized in 2013 was greater than cash collection, and $445 million positive movement in other liabilities which included incentives accrued during 2013 that will be paid in 2014.

The $36 million increase in cash provided by operating activities in 2013 compared to 2012 was primarily driven by favorable movements in working capital versus the prior year.

Investing Activities

Net cash used in investing activities in 2013 was $120 million including, capital expenditure of $112 million, cash used to purchase subsidiaries, intangible assets and other investments of $44 million partly offset by $6 million cash received from the sale of fixed and intangible assets and $24 million of proceeds from the disposal of operations and the sale of the Company’s holding in a Spanish associate company.

Financing Activities

Net cash used in financing activities in 2013 was $137 million primarily due to total dividends paid, including dividends paid to noncontrolling interests, of $203 million, a net $72 million outflow in relation to the refinancing in the third quarter 2013, discussed below, and $15 million of mandatory repayments against the term loan offset by cash receipts of $155 million from the issue of shares.

The refinancing during 2013 resulted in a net cash outflow of $72 million which included: $521 million cash paid to repurchase $202 million of 5.625% senior notes due 2015, $206 million of 6.200% senior notes due 2017 and $113 million of 7.000% senior notes due 2019, the tender premium of $65 million and debt issuance costs of $8 million; this was primarily funded by $522 million cash inflow from senior notes issued, discussed earlier, and free operating cash flows.

Fiduciary funds

As an intermediary, we hold funds generally in a fiduciary capacity for the account of third parties, typically as the result of premiums received from clients that are in transit to insurers and claims due to clients that are in transit from insurers. We report premiums, which are held on account of, or due from, clients as assets with a corresponding liability due to the insurers. Claims held by, or due to, us which are due to clients are also shown as both assets and liabilities.

Fiduciary funds are generally required to be kept in certain regulated bank accounts subject to guidelines which emphasize capital preservation and liquidity; such funds are not available to service the Company’s debt or for other corporate purposes. Notwithstanding the legal relationships with clients and insurers, the Company is entitled to retain investment income earned on fiduciary funds in accordance with industry custom and practice and, in some cases, as supported by agreements with insureds.

As of

December 31, 2014

, we had fiduciary funds of $1.9 billion, compared with $1.7 billion at

December 31, 2013

.

Share buybacks

The Company is authorized to buy back shares, by way of redemption, and will consider whether to do so from time to time, based on many factors, including market conditions. The Company is authorized to purchase up to one billion shares from time to time in the open market (such open market purchases would be effected as redemptions under Irish law) and it may also redeem its shares through negotiated trades with persons who are not affiliated with the Company as long as the cost of the acquisition of the Company's shares does not exceed a certain authorized limit.

In February 2015, the Company announced that, during the year, it intended to buyback approximately $175 million of shares under this authorization, from time to time, depending on many factors including market conditions to offset the increase in shares outstanding resulting from the exercise of employee stock options. The buybacks would be made in the open market or through privately-negotiated transactions, from time to time, depending on market conditions.

As of February 20,


there remains approximately $611 million available to purchase ordinary shares under the current authorization.

The share buy back program may be modified, extended or terminated at any time by the Board of Directors.

REVIEW OF SEGMENTAL RESULTS

During 2014, we organized our business into three segments: Global, North America and International. Our Global business provided specialist brokerage and consulting services to clients worldwide for risks arising from specific industries and activities. North America and International comprised our retail operations and provide services to small, medium and major corporations.

The following table is a summary of our operating results by segment for the three years ended

December 31, 2014

Global

Our Global operations comprised Willis Re, Willis Insurance UK, Facultative, Risk, and Willis Capital Markets & Advisory (WCMA).

The following table sets out revenues, operating income, organic commissions and fees growth and operating margin for the three years ended

December 31, 2014

(in millions, except percentages):

_________________

(a)

Other income comprises gains on disposal of intangible assets, which primarily arise from settlements through enforcing non-compete agreements in the event of losing accounts through producer defection or the disposal of books of business.

(b)

Organic commissions and fees growth excludes: (i) the impact of foreign currency translation; (ii) the first twelve months of net commission and fee revenues generated from acquisitions; and (iii) the net commission and fee revenues related to operations disposed of in each period presented.

compared with


. The increase includes organic growth of

1.4 percent

, a positive

0.9 percent

impact from foreign currency movements, partially offset by a net

0.2 percent

decline due to acquisitions and disposals.

The

1.4 percent

organic growth in commissions and fees was driven by strong new business growth and higher client retention levels compared with the year ago period, partially offset by the negative impact of rates and the non-recurrence of significant construction projects in 2013.

The

0.2 percent

decline from acquisitions and disposals was related to the disposal of a small commercial business from the UK Retail division in fourth quarter 2013 partially offset by the acquisition of Prime Professions in second quarter 2013.



Business discussion

Willis Re reported mid single-digit organic commissions and fees growth, with its North America business leading the way with high single-digit results. New business was strong across all three divisions and we reported increased client retention levels compared to the prior year. Growth however was tempered by the negative impact of premium rate movements.

Willis Insurance UK reported a low single-digit decline, primarily due to poor performance in the Insolvency and Willis Commercial Network businesses, the non-recurrence of large construction projects in 2013 in the Construction, Property & Casualty business, and the negative impact from the acquisitions and disposals noted above.

Willis Capital Markets & Advisory performed solidly in the year and reported significant growth on last year as a result of significant new business wins.

Client retention levels improved to

, higher for


compared with


. Excluding the $25 million, or 2.7 percent, impact of adverse foreign currency movements, total operating expenses increased $45 million or 4.4 percent.

The $45 million growth in expenses was due to higher salaries and benefits as a result of the increase in headcount relative to the prior year, annual salary reviews and higher incentives which were linked to commissions and fees performance. This increase was offset by the decline in Other operating expenses primarily due to lower allocation of corporate costs and an E&O provision release partially offset by a legal claim settlement and higher systems and premises costs.

In addition, the year-on-year growth included $11 million restructuring costs relating the Operational Improvement Program.

Operating margin

Full year operating margin was

25.0 percent

in


and

27.6 percent

The 4.3 percent organic growth in commissions and fees was driven by strong new business growth and higher client retention levels compared with the year ago period, partially offset by lost business. Rates had no material impact on commissions and fees.

Willis Re reported high single-digit growth, with North America leading the way with double-digit results. New business was strong across all three divisions and we reported increased client retention levels compared to the prior year.

Willis Insurance UK reported mid single-digit growth, with solid performance in our Financial and Executive Risk, and P&C and Construction. Growth from new business was solid and we saw increased client retention levels compared to 2012.

Willis Capital Markets & Advisory performed solidly but was down compared to the very strong result it recorded in 2012 relating to meaningfully higher volumes of advisory fees and catastrophe bond deals.

Operating margin

Operating margin was

27.6 percent

in


and

30.5 percent

in


. The decline was driven additional expenses due to higher salaries and benefits, as a result of increased incentives from the change in remuneration policy and growth in commissions and fees. In addition, this increase also included the impact of the increase in headcount relative to the prior year, annual salary reviews and higher charges for share-based compensation. This was partially offset by solid commissions and fees growth.

North America

Our North America business provides risk management, insurance brokerage, related risk services and employee benefits brokerage and consulting to a wide array of industry and client segments in the United States, Canada and Mexico.

This increase was primarily due to organic growth of

2.8 percent

partially offset by a

1.5 percent

negative impact from acquisitions and disposals and a

0.1 percent

negative impact from foreign currency movements.

The acquisitions and disposals impact was primarily due to the disposal of non-strategic low growth offices in the second and fourth quarters of 2014 partially offset by the acquisition of the employee benefits consulting division of Capital Strategies in fourth quarter 2013.

The

2.8 percent

organic growth in commissions and fees was driven by strong new business growth compared with the year ago period, partially offset by lost business and the non-recurrence of a positive $5 million adjustment in 2013 to align the recognition of revenue in the North America Personal Lines business with the rest of the Group. Rates had a small negative impact on the full year's commissions and fees.

Growth was achieved across most of our North America regions, led by the South, Atlantic and Northeast regions as a result of new business growth.

Similarly, most of the major practice groups recorded positive growth. Our two largest practices, Human Capital and Construction, recorded mid single and low single-digit growth respectively. In our other practices we recorded double-digit growth in Mergers & Acquisitions, Financial & Executive Risks and Service Industry.

Growth was achieved across all our North America regions, led by the Metro, Midwest, Canada and CAPPPS regions. This was attributed to new business growth as well as increased client retention rates in almost all regions.

Similarly, most of the major practice groups recorded positive growth. Our two largest practices, Human Capital and Construction, recorded mid single-digit growth and in our other practices we recorded high single-digit growth in Real Estate and low single-digit growth in Financial & Executive Risks, Healthcare and Manufacturing.

negative impact from foreign currency movements which was driven by the weakening of a basket of currencies versus the US dollar.

Organic growth included double-digit new business growth and a positive impact from rates, partly offset by lost business. Growth was positively impacted by the non-recurrence of an adjustment recorded in 2013 to align the recognition of revenue in China with the rest of the Group.

Western Europe reported mid single-digit growth driven by Iberia, Germany and Ireland.

Latin America reported double-digit growth arising primarily from Brazil and Venezuela which was partially offset by decline in Colombia.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES

Our accounting policies are described in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Management considers that the following accounting estimates or assumptions are the most important to the presentation of our financial condition or operating performance:

•

pension expense (discount rates, expected asset returns and mortality);

•

intangible assets and goodwill impairment (determination of reporting units, fair value of reporting units and annual goodwill impairment analysis);

•

income taxes; and

•

commitments, contingencies and accrued liabilities.

Management has discussed its critical accounting estimates and associated disclosures with our Audit Committee.

Pension expense

We maintain defined benefit pension plans for employees in the US and UK. Both of these plans are now closed to new entrants and, with effect from May 15, 2009 we closed our US defined benefit plan to future accrual. New employees in the UK are offered the opportunity to join a defined contribution plan and in the US are offered the opportunity to join a 401(k) plan. We also have smaller defined benefit plans in Ireland, Germany, Norway and the Netherlands, a non-qualified plan in the US and an unfunded plan in the UK. These smaller defined benefit plans have combined total assets of

$171 million

and a combined net liability for pension benefits of

$39 million

as of

December 31, 2014

. Elsewhere, pension benefits are typically provided through defined contribution plans.

We recorded a

$13 million

and an

$8 million

net periodic benefit income on our UK and US defined benefit pension schemes respectively in


, compared with a net periodic benefit income of $5 million on the UK scheme and a net periodic benefit income of $4 million on the US scheme in


. On our international defined benefit pension plans, US non-qualified plan and UK unfunded plan, we recorded a net periodic benefit cost of

$4 million

in


, compared with

$5 million

in


.

Based on

December 31, 2014

assumptions, we expect the net pension credit in


will increase $31 million for the UK plan. The net pension credit will decrease by $2 million for the US plan and the net pension charge will remain unchanged at $4 million for the other plans.

We make a number of assumptions when determining our pension liabilities and pension expense which are reviewed annually by senior management and changed where appropriate. The discount rate will be changed annually if underlying rates have moved whereas the expected long-term return on assets will be changed less frequently as longer term trends in asset returns emerge or long term target asset allocations are revised. Other material assumptions include rates of participant mortality, the expected long-term rate of compensation and pension increases and rates of employee termination. Our approach to determining appropriate assumptions for our UK and US pension plans is set out below.

With all other assumptions held constant.

Discount rate

During 2014 we continued to use a duration-based approach, which more closely matches the actual timing of expected cash flows to the applicable discount rate. The selected rate used to discount UK plan liabilities in 2014 was

3.60%

a decrease of 80 basis points from the discount rate of

4.40%

used at

December 31, 2013

. During 2014, sterling high-quality corporate bond yields fell significantly at all durations. Consequently, the rate consistent with the expected maturity of the plan's liabilities has also decreased.

Expected and actual asset returns

Expected long-term rates of return on plan assets are developed from the expected future returns of the various asset classes using the target asset allocations. The expected long-term rate of return used for determining the net UK pension expense in


was

7.00%

(

of $213 million (


: $191 million). There have been no further changes to the strategic target asset allocation therefore, management considers that 7.00% continues to be an appropriate long-term rate of return assumption.

The expected and actual returns on UK plan assets for the three years ended

December 31, 2014

were as follows:

Mortality

The mortality assumption chosen should reflect the long term life expectancy of pension scheme members and represent the best estimate assumptions used as opposed to more prudent assumption used by pension scheme trustees for funding purposes.

At December 31, 2014 we have updated the mortality base tables to use the more recent 80%/98% S1NA tables for male and females however, we have adjusted the base tables to reflect our scheme experiences and consequently the liabilities are broadly unchanged.

As an indication of the longevity assumed, our calculations assume that a UK male retiree aged 65 at

December 31, 2014

would have a life expectancy of 24 years.

Discount rate

The discount rate at

was

3.90%

, an decrease of 86 basis points from the discount rate of

4.76%

at December 31,


. The decrease in the discount rate reflects the decrease in high-quality corporate bond yields during 2014.

The impact of the lower discount rate in


increased the projected benefit obligation by approximately $103 million.

Expected and actual asset returns

The expected long-term rate of return used for determining the net US pension scheme expense in


was

7.25%

(2013: 7.25%)

The expected and actual returns on US plan assets for the three years ended

December 31, 2014

were as follows:

Mortality

During 2014, the US Society of Actuaries released updated mortality tables to reflect improvements in longevity reflecting the results of their multi-year mortality study of participants in uninsured pension plans in the US. They also published details of mortality improvements. In summary, these tables showed that people are living longer, especially at older ages.

Consequently, in line with market practice, we have adopted at December 31, 2014 the RP 2014 Mortality Table projected using MP-2014 improvements scale on a fully generational basis (December 31, 2013: RP-2000 Mortality Table (blended for annuitants and non-annuitants), projected by Scale AA to 2021 for annuitants and 2029 for non-annuitants).

The impact of this change increase the projected benefit obligation by approximately $80 million.

As an indication of the longevity assumed, our calculations assume that a US male retiree aged 65 at

December 31, 2014

, would have a life expectancy of 22 years.

Goodwill impairment review

We test goodwill for impairment annually or whenever events or circumstances indicate impairment may have occurred.

Application of the impairment test involves the use of discounted cash flow models and requires significant judgment, including:

•

the identification of reporting units;

•

projections of commission and fee and expense growth rates;

•

discount and terminal growth rates;

•

assignment of assets, liabilities and goodwill to reporting units; and

•

determination of fair value of each reporting unit.

We use comparable market earnings multiple data and our Company's market capitalization to corroborate our reporting unit valuations.

Our annual goodwill impairment analysis is performed each year at October 1. At October 1, 2014 our analysis showed the estimate fair value of each reporting unit was significantly in excess of carrying value, and therefore did not result in an impairment charge (


: $nil;


: $492 million).

Income taxes

We recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the estimated future tax consequences of events attributable to differences between the financial statements carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating and capital loss and tax credit carry-forwards. We estimate deferred tax assets and liabilities and assess the need for any valuation allowances using tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to be recovered or settled taking into account our business plans and tax planning strategies.



Willis Group Holdings plc

At

December 31, 2014

, we had gross deferred tax assets of

$426 million

(


:

$383 million

) against which a valuation allowance of

$280 million

(


:

$196 million

) had been recognized. To the extent that:

•

the actual future taxable income in the periods during which the temporary differences are expected to reverse differs from current projections;

•

assumed prudent and feasible tax planning strategies fail to materialize;

•

new tax planning strategies are developed; or

•

material changes occur in actual tax rates or loss carry-forward time limits,

we may adjust the deferred tax asset considered realizable in future periods. Such adjustments could result in a significant increase or decrease in the effective tax rate and have a material impact on our net income.

Considering our recent US earnings experience and projections of future income, a possibility exists that we may release a portion of the valuation allowance against our US deferred tax assets in the next twelve months. Release of the US valuation allowance would result in the recognition of deferred tax assets and a decrease to income tax expense for the period the release is recorded. Our US valuation allowance, excluding that related to state separate taxes, is $160 million as at December 31, 2014. The exact timing and amount of future valuation release is subject to change on the basis of the level of profitability we are able to achieve.

Positions taken in our tax returns may be subject to challenge by the taxing authorities upon examination. We recognize the benefit of uncertain tax positions in the financial statements when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on examination by the tax authorities. The benefit recognized is the largest amount of tax benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized on settlement with the tax authority, assuming full knowledge of the position and all relevant facts.

The Company adjusts its recognition of these uncertain tax benefits in the period in which new information is available impacting either the recognition or measurement of its uncertain tax positions. In


, there was a net decrease in uncertain tax positions of

$22 million

compared to a net increase of

$4 million

in


. The Company recognizes interest relating to unrecognized tax benefits and penalties within income taxes. Accrued interest and penalties are included within the related tax liability line in the consolidated balance sheet.

Commitments, contingencies and accrued liabilities

We have established provisions against various actual and potential claims, lawsuits and other proceedings relating principally to alleged errors and omissions in connection with the placement of insurance and reinsurance in the ordinary course of business. Such provisions cover claims that have been reported but not paid and also claims that have been incurred but not reported. These provisions are established based on actuarial estimates together with individual case reviews and are believed to be adequate in the light of current information and legal advice.

Mandatory repayments of debt over the next 12 months include expiration of the 3-year term loan facility expiring 2015, maturity of the 5.625% senior notes due 2015 and the scheduled repayment of the current portion of the Company’s 7-year term loan. The Company also has the right, at its option, to prepay indebtedness under the credit facility without further penalty and to redeem the senior notes by paying a ‘make-whole’ premium as provided under the applicable debt instrument.

Operating leases

The Company leases certain land, buildings and equipment under various operating lease arrangements. Original non-cancellable lease terms typically are between 10 and 20 years and may contain escalation clauses, along with options that permit early withdrawal. The total amount of the minimum rent is expensed on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.

Information regarding these operating leases and their impact on the financial statements is set forth in Note 20 - ‘Commitments and Contingencies’ to the Consolidated Financial Statements appearing under Part II, Item 8 of this report and incorporated herein by reference.

Pensions

Contractual obligations for our pension plans reflect the contributions we expect to make over the next five years into our US, UK and Other defined benefit plans. These contributions are based on current funding positions and may increase or decrease dependent on the future performance of the plans.

Total contributions made in 2014 and 2013, and the contributions we expect to make in 2015, in respect of our UK, US and Other defined benefit pension schemes are as follows:

Additionally, during 2014 $10 million (2013: $12 million) was paid into the UK plan in respect of employees' salary sacrifice contributions.

UK plan

In March 2012, the Company agreed to a schedule of contributions towards on-going accrual of benefits and deficit funding contributions the Company will make to the UK plan over the six years ended December 31, 2017. Based on this agreement, contributions in each of the next three years would total approximately

$75 million

, of which approximately

$19 million

relates to on-going contributions calculated as 15.9 percent of active plan members' pensionable salary and approximately

$56 million

that relates to contributions towards the funding deficit.

In addition, based on this agreement, further contributions would be payable based on a profit share calculation (equal to 20 percent of EBITDA in excess of $900 million per annum as defined by the revised schedule of contributions) and an exceptional return calculation (equal to 10 percent of any exceptional returns made to shareholders, for example, share buybacks, and special dividends). We expect to make an exceptional return contribution of $21 million during 2015 as a result of share buyback activity during 2014. Aggregate contributions under the deficit funding contribution and the profit share calculation are capped at

£312 million

(

$486 million

) over the six years ended December 31, 2017.

We are currently negotiating a new funding arrangement, which we are required to do every three years, which may further change the contributions we are required to make in the future.

Item 7A —

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk

Financial Risk Management

We are exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. In order to manage the risk arising from these exposures, we enter into a variety of interest rate and foreign currency derivatives. We do not hold financial or derivative instruments for trading purposes.

A discussion of our accounting policies for financial and derivative instruments is included in Note 2 — 'Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies' of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, and further disclosure is provided in Note 24 — 'Derivative Financial Instruments and Hedging Activities'.

Foreign Exchange Risk Management

Because of the large number of countries and currencies we operate in, movements in currency exchange rates may affect our results.

We report our operating results and financial condition in US dollars. Our US operations earn revenue and incur expenses primarily in US dollars. Outside the United States, we predominantly generate revenues and expenses in the local currency with the exception of our London market operations which earns revenues in several currencies but incurs expenses predominantly in pounds sterling.

The table below gives an approximate analysis of revenues and expenses by currency in


.

Our principal exposures to foreign exchange risk arise from:

•

our London market operations; and

•

translation.

London market operations

In our London market operations, we earn revenue in a number of different currencies, principally US dollars, pounds sterling, Euros and Japanese yen, but incur expenses almost entirely in pounds sterling.

We hedge this risk as follows:

•

to the extent that forecast pounds sterling expenses exceed pound sterling revenues, we limit our exposure to this exchange rate risk by the use of forward contracts matched to specific, clearly identified cash outflows arising in the ordinary course of business; and



Willis Group Holdings plc

•

to the extent our UK operations earn significant revenues in Euros and Japanese yen, we limit our exposure to changes in the exchange rate between the US dollar and these currencies by the use of forward contracts matched to a percentage of forecast cash inflows in specific currencies and periods. In addition, we are also exposed to foreign exchange risk on any net sterling asset or liability position in our London market operations.

However, where the foreign exchange risk relates to any sterling pension assets benefit or liability for pensions benefit, we do not hedge the risk. Consequently, if our London market operations have a significant pension asset or liability, we may be exposed to accounting gains and losses if the US dollar and pounds sterling exchange rate changes. We do, however, hedge the pounds sterling contributions into the pension plan.

Translation risk

Outside our US and London market operations, we predominantly earn revenues and incur expenses in the local currency. When we translate the results and net assets of these operations into US dollars for reporting purposes, movements in exchange rates will affect reported results and net assets. For example, if the US dollar strengthens against the Euro, the reported results of our Eurozone operations in US dollar terms will be lower.

With the exception of foreign currency hedges for certain intercompany loans that are not designated as hedging instruments, we do not hedge translation risk.

The table below provides information about our foreign currency forward exchange contracts, which are sensitive to exchange rate risk. The table summarizes the US dollar equivalent amounts of each currency bought and sold forward and the weighted average contractual exchange rates. All forward exchange contracts mature within three years.

_________________

(i)

Represents the difference between the contract amount and the cash flow in US dollars which would have been receivable had the foreign currency forward exchange contracts been entered into on

December 31, 2014

or


at the forward exchange rates prevailing at that date.

Income earned within foreign subsidiaries outside of the United Kingdom is generally offset by expenses in the same local currency but the Company does have exposure to foreign exchange movements on the net income of these entities.



Market risk

Interest rate risk management

Our operations are financed principally by $2,054 million fixed rate senior notes issued by the Group and $259 million under a 7-year term loan facility. Of the fixed rate senior notes, $148 million are due 2015, $300 million are due 2016, $394 million are due 2017, $187 million are due 2019, $500 million are due 2021, $250 million are due 2023, and $275 million are due 2043. The 7-year term loan facility is repayable in quarterly installments and a final repayment of $186 million is due in the second quarter of 2018. As of

December 31, 2014

we had access to $1,122 million under four revolving credit facilities, of which $798 million is available for general corporate purposes, and, as at this date, no amount was outstanding under those facilities. The interest rate applicable to the bank borrowing is variable according to the period of each individual drawdown.

We are also subject to market risk from exposure to changes in interest rates based on our investing activities where our primary interest rate risk arises from changes in short-term interest rates in both US dollars and pounds sterling.

As a result of our operating activities, we receive cash for premiums and claims which we deposit in short-term investments denominated in US dollars and other currencies. We earn interest on these funds, which is included in our consolidated financial statements as investment income. These funds are regulated in terms of access and the instruments in which they may be invested, most of which are short-term in maturity. In order to manage interest rate risk arising from these financial assets, we entered into interest rate swaps to receive a fixed rate of interest and pay a variable rate of interest in the various currencies related to the short-term investments. The use of interest rate contracts essentially converted groups of short-term variable rate investments to fixed rates. However, in the fourth quarter of 2011, we stopped renewing hedged positions on their maturity given the flat yield curve environment. Further to this, during second quarter 2012, the Company closed out its legacy position for these interest rate swap contracts.

During the year ended December 31, 2010, the Company entered into a series of interest rate swaps for a total notional amount of $350 million to receive a fixed rate and pay a variable rate on a semi-annual basis, with a maturity date of July 15, 2015. The Company had previously designated these instruments as fair value hedges against its $350 million 5.625% senior notes due 2015 and had accounted for them accordingly until the first quarter of 2013 at which point these swaps, although remaining as economic hedges, no longer qualified for hedge accounting. During the three months ended September 30, 2013 the Company closed out the above interest rate swaps and received a cash settlement of $13 million on termination.

The table below provides information about our derivative instruments and other financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates. For interest rate swaps, the table presents notional principal amounts and average interest rates analyzed by expected maturity dates. Notional principal amounts are used to calculate the contractual payments to be exchanged under the contracts. The duration of interest rate swaps varied between one and five years, with re-fixing periods of three to six months. Average fixed and variable rates are, respectively, the weighted-average actual and market rates for the interest rate hedges in place. Market rates are the rates prevailing at

December 31, 2014

or


, as appropriate.



Willis Group Holdings plc

Represents the net present value of the expected cash flows discounted at current market rates of interest or quoted market rates as appropriate.

Liquidity Risk

Our objective is to ensure we have the ability to generate sufficient cash either from internal or external sources, in a timely and cost-effective manner, to meet our commitments as they fall due. Our management of liquidity risk is embedded within our overall risk management framework. Scenario analysis is continually undertaken to ensure that our resources can meet our liquidity requirements. These resources are supplemented by access to $1,122 million under four revolving credit facilities, of which $798 million is available for general corporate purposes. We undertake short-term foreign exchange swaps for liquidity purposes.

See ‘Liquidity and Capital Resources’ section under Item 7, 'Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations'.

Credit Risk and Concentrations of Credit Risk

Credit risk represents the loss that would be recognized at the reporting date if counterparties failed to perform as contracted and from movements in interest rates and foreign exchange rates. The Company currently does not anticipate non-performance by its counterparties. The Company generally does not require collateral or other security to support financial instruments with credit risk.

Concentrations of credit risk that arise from financial instruments exist for groups of customers or counterparties when they have similar economic characteristics that would cause their ability to meet contractual obligations to be similarly affected by changes in economic or other conditions. Financial instruments on the balance sheet that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents, fiduciary funds, accounts receivable and derivatives which are recorded at fair value.

The Company maintains a policy providing for the diversification of cash and cash equivalent investments and places such investments in an extensive number of financial institutions to limit the amount of credit risk exposure. These financial institutions are monitored on an ongoing basis for credit quality predominantly using information provided by credit agencies.

Concentrations of credit risk with respect to receivables are limited due to the large number of clients and markets in which the Company does business, as well as the dispersion across many geographic areas. Management does not believe significant risk exists in connection with the Company's concentrations of credit as of December 31,

BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Recent Accounting Pronouncements to be Adopted in Future Periods

In April 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ('FASB') issued Accounting Standards Update ('ASU') No. 2014-08, 'Reporting Discontinued Operations and Disclosures of Disposals of Components of an Entity'. This guidance changes the criteria for reporting discontinued operations and enhances the related disclosures around discontinued operations. The new guidance requires a disposal of a component of an entity or a group of components of an entity to be reported in discontinued operations if the disposal represents a strategic shift that has, or will have, a major effect on an entity’s operations and financial results. This guidance is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2014.

In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, 'Revenue From Contracts With Customers'. The new standard supersedes most current revenue recognition guidance and eliminates industry-specific guidance. The ASU is based on the principle that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The ASU also requires additional disclosure about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from customer contracts, including significant judgments and changes in judgments and assets recognized from costs incurred to fulfill a contract. The ASU becomes effective for the Company at the beginning of its 2017 fiscal year; early adoption is not permitted. Entities have the option of using either a full retrospective or a modified retrospective approach for the adoption of the new standard. The Company is currently assessing the impact that this standard will have on its consolidated financial statements.

In June 2014, the FASB issued guidance on the accounting for stock compensation where share-based payment awards granted to employees required specific performance targets to be achieved in order for employees to become eligible to vest in the awards and such performance targets could be achieved after an employee completes the requisite service period. The amendment in this update requires a performance target that affects vesting and that could be achieved after the requisite service period to be treated as a performance condition. The guidance is applicable to the Company for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015, although earlier adoption is permitted. The Company is currently assessing the impact that this standard will have on its consolidated financial statements.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements Adopted During the Period

In July 2013, the FASB issued ASU No. 2013-11, 'Presentation of an Unrecognized Tax Benefit When a Net Operating Loss Carryforward, a Similar Tax Loss, or a Tax Credit Carryforward Exists', a consensus of the FASB Emerging Issues Task Force which provides guidance on financial statement presentation of an unrecognized tax benefit when a net operating loss carryforward ('NOL'), or similar tax loss, or a tax credit carryforward exists. Such unrecognized tax benefits are required to be presented as a reduction of a deferred tax asset for a NOL or other tax credit carryforward whenever the NOL or tax credit carryforward would be available to reduce the additional taxable income or tax due if the tax position is disallowed.

The Company adopted this guidance prospectively from

January 1, 2014

and has not applied the amendments to the prior years. Upon adoption in the first quarter of 2014, other non-current liabilities and deferred tax assets were reduced by

$21 million

.



Notes to the financial statements

2.    BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)

Significant Accounting Policies

These consolidated financial statements conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (‘US GAAP’). Presented below are summaries of significant accounting policies followed in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements.

Certain reclassifications have been made to prior year amounts to conform to current year presentation. In particular, effective from

January 1, 2014

, the Company has made changes to the presentation of certain items within the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Foreign exchange gains and losses, primarily from balance sheet revaluation, and gains and losses from the disposal of operations, previously reported within 'Total operating expenses', are now reported in a new Statement of Operations line item, 'Other income (expense), net', which is reported below the 'Operating income (loss)' line item. Prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to this presentation.

Principles of Consolidation

The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Willis Group Holdings and its subsidiaries, which are controlled through the ownership of a majority voting interest. Intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated on consolidation.

Foreign Currency Translation

Transactions in currencies other than the functional currency of the entity are recorded at the rates of exchange prevailing at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities in currencies other than the functional currency are translated at the rates of exchange prevailing at the balance sheet date and the related transaction gains and losses are reported in the statements of operations. Certain intercompany loans are determined to be of a long-term investment nature. The Company records transaction gains and losses from remeasuring such loans as a component of other comprehensive income.

Upon consolidation, the results of operations of subsidiaries and associates whose functional currency is other than the US dollar are translated into US dollars at the average exchange rate and assets and liabilities are translated at year-end exchange rates. Translation adjustments are presented as a separate component of other comprehensive income in the financial statements and are included in net income only upon sale or liquidation of the underlying foreign subsidiary or associated company.

Use of Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with US GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities as of the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the year. In the preparation of these consolidated financial statements, estimates and assumptions have been made by management concerning: the valuation of intangible assets and goodwill (including those acquired through business combinations); the selection of useful lives of fixed and intangible assets; impairment testing; provisions necessary for accounts receivable, commitments and contingencies and accrued liabilities; long-term asset returns, discount rates and mortality rates in order to estimate pension liabilities and pension expense; income tax valuation allowances; and other similar evaluations. Actual results could differ from the estimates underlying these consolidated financial statements.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents primarily consist of time deposits with original maturities of three months or less.

Fiduciary Assets and Fiduciary Liabilities

In its capacity as an insurance agent or broker, the Company collects premiums from insureds and, after deducting its commissions, remits the premiums to the respective insurers; the Company also collects claims or refunds from insurers which it then remits to insureds.

Fiduciary Assets

Fiduciary assets comprise Fiduciary Receivables and Fiduciary Funds.



Willis Group Holdings plc

2.    BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)

Fiduciary Receivables

Fiduciary receivables represent uncollected premiums from insureds and uncollected claims or refunds from insurers.

Fiduciary Funds

Fiduciary funds represent unremitted premiums received from insureds and unremitted claims or refunds received from insurers. Fiduciary funds are generally required to be kept in certain regulated bank accounts subject to guidelines which emphasize capital preservation and liquidity. Such funds are not available to service the Company’s debt or for other corporate purposes. Notwithstanding the legal relationships with insureds and insurers, the Company is entitled to retain investment income earned on fiduciary funds in accordance with industry custom and practice and, in some cases, as supported by agreements with insureds.

The period for which the Company holds such funds is dependent upon the date the insured remits the payment of the premium to the Company, or the date the Company receives refunds from the insurers, and the date the Company is required to forward such payment to the insurer, or insured, respectively.

In certain instances, the Company advances premiums, refunds or claims to insurance underwriters or insureds prior to collection. Such advances are made from fiduciary funds and are reflected in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as fiduciary assets.

Fiduciary Liabilities

Fiduciary liabilities represent the obligations to remit fiduciary funds and fiduciary receivables to insurers or insureds.

Accounts Receivable

Accounts receivable are stated at estimated net realizable values. Allowances are recorded, when necessary, in an amount considered by management to be sufficient to meet probable future losses related to uncollectible accounts.

Fixed Assets

Fixed assets are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Expenditures for improvements are capitalized; repairs and maintenance are charged to expenses as incurred. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method based on the estimated useful lives of assets.

Depreciation on buildings and long leaseholds is

calculated over the lesser of 50 years or the lease term.

Depreciation on leasehold improvements is calculated over the lesser of the useful life of the assets or the remaining lease term. Depreciation on furniture and equipment is

calculated based on a range of 3 to 10 years.

Freehold land is not depreciated.

Recoverability of Fixed Assets

Long-lived assets are tested for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstance indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount of a long-lived asset is not recoverable and exceeds its fair value. Recoverability is determined based on the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset or asset group. Long-lived assets and certain identifiable intangible assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell.

Operating Leases

Rentals payable on operating leases are charged straight line to expenses over the lease term as the rentals become payable.

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of businesses acquired over the fair value of identifiable net assets at the dates of acquisition. The Company reviews goodwill for impairment annually and whenever facts or circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable. In testing for impairment, the fair value of each reporting unit is compared with its carrying value, including goodwill. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the amount of an



Notes to the financial statements

2.    BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)

impairment loss, if any, is calculated by comparing the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill.

Acquired intangible assets are amortized over the following periods:

Amortizable intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable.

Investments in Associates

Investments are accounted for using the equity method of accounting if the Company has the ability to exercise significant influence, but not control, over the investee. Significant influence is generally deemed to exist if the

Company has an equity ownership in the voting stock of the investee between 20 and 50 percent

, although other factors, such as representation on the Board of Directors and the impact of commercial arrangements, are considered in determining whether the equity method of accounting is appropriate. Under the equity method of accounting the investment is carried at cost of acquisition, plus the Company’s equity in undistributed net income since acquisition, less any dividends received since acquisition.

The Company periodically reviews its investments in associates for which fair value is less than cost to determine if the decline in value is other than temporary. If the decline in value is judged to be other than temporary, the cost basis of the investment is written down to fair value. The amount of any write-down is included in the statements of operations as a realized loss.

All other equity investments where the Company does not have the ability to exercise significant influence are accounted for by the cost method. Such investments are not publicly traded.

GS & Cie Groupe ('Gras Savoye') is the principal associate of the Company. It is France's leading insurance broker. The Company has a call option to purchase 100 percent of the capital of Gras Savoye, a decision on whether to exercise this or not will be taken by April 30, 2015, for exercise during 2016.

The carrying amount of the Gras Savoye investment as of

December 31, 2014

includes interest bearing vendor loans and convertible bonds issued by Gras Savoye of

$41 million

and

$106 million

respectively (


:

$46 million

and

$110 million

, respectively).

Derivative Financial Instruments

The Company uses derivative financial instruments for other than trading purposes to alter the risk profile of an existing underlying exposure. Interest rate swaps have been used to manage interest risk exposures. Forward foreign currency exchange contracts are used to manage currency exposures arising from future income and expenses. The fair values of derivative contracts are recorded in other assets and other liabilities. The effective portions of changes in the fair value of derivatives that qualify for hedge accounting as cash flow hedges are recorded in other comprehensive income. Amounts are reclassified from other comprehensive income into earnings when the hedged exposure affects earnings. If the derivative is designated as, and qualifies as, an effective fair value hedge, the changes in the fair value of the derivative and of the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk are both recognized in earnings. The amount of hedge ineffectiveness recognized in earnings is based on the extent to which an offset between the fair value of the derivative and hedged item is not achieved. Changes in fair value of derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting, together with any hedge ineffectiveness on those that do qualify, are recorded in other operating expenses or interest expense as appropriate.

The Company evaluates whether its contracts include clauses or conditions which would be required to be separately accounted for at fair value as embedded derivatives.

Income Taxes

The Company recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for the estimated future tax consequences of events attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating and capital loss and tax credit carry forwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of changes in tax rates is recognized in the statement of operations in the period in which the change is enacted. Deferred tax assets are reduced through the establishment of a valuation allowance at such time as, based on available evidence, it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The Company adjusts valuation allowances to measure deferred tax assets at the amount considered realizable in future periods if the Company’s facts and assumptions change. In making such determination, the Company considers all available positive and negative evidence, including future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, projected future taxable income, tax planning strategies and recent financial operations.

Positions taken in the Company’s tax returns may be subject to challenge by the taxing authorities upon examination. The Company recognizes the benefit of uncertain tax positions in the financial statements when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on examination by the tax authorities upon lapse of the relevant statute of limitations, or when positions are effectively settled. The benefit recognized is the largest amount of tax benefit that is

greater than 50 percent likely to be realized on settlement with the tax authority, assuming full knowledge of the position and all relevant facts.

The Company adjusts its recognition of these uncertain tax benefits in the period in which new information is available impacting either the recognition or measurement of its uncertain tax positions. Such adjustments are reflected as increases or decreases to income taxes in the period in which they are determined.

The Company recognizes interest and penalties relating to unrecognized tax benefits within income taxes.

Provisions for Liabilities

The Company is subject to various actual and potential claims, lawsuits and other proceedings. The Company records liabilities for such contingencies including legal costs when it is probable that a liability has been incurred before the balance sheet date and the amount can be reasonably estimated. To the extent such losses can be recovered under the Company’s insurance programs, estimated recoveries are recorded when losses for insured events are realized. Significant management judgment is required to estimate the amounts of such contingent liabilities and the related insurance recoveries. The Company analyzes its litigation exposure based on available information, including consultation with outside counsel handling the defense of these matters, to assess its potential liability. Contingent liabilities are not discounted.

Pensions

The Company has two principal defined benefit pension plans which cover approximately half of employees in the United States and United Kingdom. Both these plans are now closed to new entrants. New employees in the United Kingdom are offered the opportunity to join a defined contribution plan and in the United States are offered the opportunity to join a 401(k) plan. In addition to the Company’s UK and US defined benefit pension plans, the Company has several smaller defined benefit pension plans in certain other countries in which it operates including a US non-qualified plan and an unfunded plan in the UK.. Elsewhere, pension benefits are typically provided through defined contribution plans.

Defined benefit plans

The net periodic cost of the Company’s defined benefit plans are measured on an actuarial basis using the projected unit credit method and several actuarial assumptions the most significant of which are the discount rate and the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. Other material assumptions include rates of participant mortality, the expected long-term rate of compensation and pension increases and rates of employee termination. Gains and losses occur when actual experience differs from actuarial assumptions.

If such gains or losses exceed ten percent of the greater of plan assets or plan liabilities

the Company amortizes those gains or losses over the average remaining service period or average remaining life expectancy as appropriate of the plan participants.

In accordance with US GAAP the Company records on the balance sheet the funded status of its pension plans based on the projected benefit obligation.



Notes to the financial statements

2.    BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)

Defined contribution plans

Contributions to the Company’s defined contribution plans are recognized as they fall due. Differences between contributions payable in the year and contributions actually paid are shown as either other assets or other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets.

Share-Based Compensation

The Company has equity-based compensation plans that provide for grants of restricted stock units and stock options

to employees and non-employee directors of the Company who perform services for the Company.

The Company expenses all equity-based compensation on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period based upon the fair value of the award on the date of grant, the estimated achievement of any performance targets and anticipated staff retention. The awards under equity-based compensation are classified as equity and included as a component of equity on the Company’s consolidated balance sheets, as the ultimate payment of such awards will not be achieved through use of the Company’s cash or other assets.

Revenue Recognition

Revenue includes insurance commissions, fees for services rendered, certain commissions receivable from insurance carriers, investment income and other income.

Brokerage income and fees negotiated in lieu of brokerage are recognized at the later of the policy inception date or when the policy placement is complete. Commissions on additional premiums and adjustments are recognized when approved by or agreed between the parties and collectability is reasonably assured.

Fees for risk management and other services are recognized as the services are provided. Consideration for negotiated fee arrangements for an agreed period covering multiple insurance placements, the provision of risk management and/or other services are allocated to all deliverables on the basis of their relative selling prices. The Company establishes contract cancellation reserves where appropriate: at

December 31, 2014

and


, such amounts were not material.

Investment income is recognized as earned.

Other income comprises gains on disposal of intangible assets, which primarily arise from settlements through enforcing non-compete agreements in the event of losing accounts through producer defection or the disposal of books of business.

2012 Equity Incentive Plan

This plan, which was established on

April 25, 2012

, provides for the granting of incentive stock options, time-based or performance-based non-statutory stock options, share appreciation rights, restricted shares, time-based or performance-based restricted share units ('RSUs'), performance-based awards and other share-based grants or any combination thereof (collectively referred to as 'Awards') to employees, officers, directors and consultants ('Eligible Individuals') of the Company. The Board of Directors also adopted a sub-plan under the 2012 plan to provide an employee sharesave scheme in the United Kingdom.

There are

13,776,935

shares available for grant under this plan. In addition, shares subject to awards that were granted under the Willis Group Holdings 2008 Share Purchase and Option Plan, that terminate, expire or lapse for any reason will be made available for future Awards under this Plan. Options are exercisable on a variety of dates, including from the second, third, fourth or fifth anniversary of grant. Unless terminated sooner by the Board of Directors, the 2012 Plan will expire 10 years after the date of its adoption. That termination will not affect the validity of any grants outstanding at that date.

Employee Stock Purchase Plans

The Company adopted the Willis Group Holdings 2001 North America Employee Share Purchase Plan, which expired on

May 31, 2011

and the Willis Group Holdings 2010 North America Employee Stock Purchase Plan, which expires on

May 31, 2020

. These plans provide certain eligible employees in the United States and Canada the ability to contribute payroll deductions to the purchase of Willis Group Holdings plc shares at the end of each offering period.

Option Valuation Assumptions

The fair value of each option is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model that uses the assumptions noted in the following table. Expected volatility is based on historical volatility of the Company’s stock. The Company uses the simplified method set out in Accounting Standard Codification (‘ASC’) 718-10-S99 to derive the expected term of options granted as it does not have sufficient historical exercise data to provide a reasonable basis upon which to

estimate the expected term. The risk-free rate for periods within the expected life of the option is based on the US Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant.

RESTRUCTURING COSTS

In April 2014, the Company announced a multi-year operational improvement program designed to strengthen the Company’s client service capabilities and to deliver future cost savings (hereinafter referred to as the Operational Improvement Program). The main elements of the program, which is expected to be completed by the end of 2017, include the following:

•

movement of more than 3,500 support roles from higher cost locations to Willis facilities in lower cost locations, bringing the ratio of employees in higher cost versus lower cost near-shore and off-shore centers from approximately 80:20 to approximately 60:40;

•

net workforce reductions in support positions;

•

lease consolidation in real estate and reductions in ratios of seats per employee and square footage of floor space per employee; and

•

information technology systems simplification and rationalization.

The program is expected to deliver cost savings of at least

$420 million

through 2017 and annual cost savings of

$300 million

starting 2018. To achieve these cost savings, the company is expecting to incur cumulative costs, including capital expenditure, of approximately

$410 million

through the end of 2017.

The Company recognized restructuring costs of

$36 million

in the year ended

December 31, 2014

, related to its Operational Improvement Program.

The significant components of deferred income tax assets and liabilities and their balance sheet classifications are as follows:

As a result of certain realization requirements of ASC 718 Compensation - Stock Compensation, the Company recognized

$8 million

of previously unrecognized deferred tax assets that arose directly from tax deductions related to equity compensation greater than compensation recognized for financial reporting. Equity was increased by this

as of

December 31, 2014

.



Willis Group Holdings plc

8.    INCOME TAXES (Continued)

At

December 31, 2014

, the Company had valuation allowances of

$280 million

(


:

$196 million

) to reduce its deferred tax assets to estimated realizable value. The valuation allowances at

December 31, 2014

, relate to deferred tax assets arising from UK capital loss carryforwards (

$39 million

) and other net operating losses (

$10 million

), which have no expiration date, and to the deferred tax assets in the United States (

$231 million

). Included within US deferred tax assets are assets of

$76 million

in respect of US state net operating losses. These losses will expire as follows:

$8 million

from 2015 to 2018,

$17 million

from 2019 to 2023 and

$51 million

from 2024 to 2034. Capital loss carryforwards can only be offset against future UK capital gains.

The amount charged to tax expense in the table above differs from the effect of

$7 million

disclosed in the rate reconciliation primarily because the movement in this table includes effects of state taxes, which are disclosed separately in the rate reconciliation. The impact of Other movements is primarily recorded in other comprehensive income.

At

December 31, 2014

the Company had deferred tax assets of

$146 million

(


:

$187 million

), net of the valuation allowance. Management believes, based upon the level of historical taxable income and projections for future taxable income, it is more likely than not that the Company will realize the benefits of these deductible differences, net of the valuation allowance. However, the amount of the deferred tax asset considered realizable could be adjusted in the future if estimates of taxable income are revised.

The Company recognizes deferred tax balances related to the undistributed earnings of subsidiaries when the Company expects that it will recover those undistributed earnings in a taxable manner, such as through receipt of dividends or sale of the investments. The Company does not, however, provide for income taxes on the unremitted earnings of certain other subsidiaries where, in management’s opinion, such earnings have been indefinitely reinvested in those operations, or will be remitted either in a tax free liquidation or as dividends with taxes substantially offset by foreign tax credits. It is not practical to determine the amount of unrecognized deferred tax liabilities for temporary differences related to these investments.

Unrecognized tax benefits

Total unrecognized tax benefits as at

December 31, 2014

, totaled

$19 million

. During the next 12 months it is reasonably possible that the Company will recognize approximately

$1 million

of tax benefits related to the release of provisions for potential inter company pricing adjustments no longer required due to either settlement through negotiation or closure of the statute of limitations on assessment.

A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amounts of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows:



Notes to the financial statements

8.    INCOME TAXES (Continued)

$19 million

of the unrecognized tax benefits at

December 31, 2014

would, if recognized, favorably affect the effective tax rate in future periods.

The Company files tax returns in the various tax jurisdictions in which it operates. US tax returns have been filed timely. Although tax years 2008 and 2009 are closed, the IRS could make adjustments (but not assess additional tax) up to the amount of the net operating losses carried forward from those years. The Company extended the federal statute of limitations for assessment in the United States for the 2010 year until March 15, 2015.

All UK tax returns have been filed timely and are in the normal process of being reviewed, by HM Revenue & Customs. There are no material ongoing inquiries in relation to filed UK returns. In other tax jurisdictions the Company is currently not subject to any examinations for any year prior to 2004.

EARNINGS PER SHARE

Basic and diluted earnings per share are calculated by dividing net income (loss) attributable to Willis Group Holdings by the average number of shares outstanding during each period. The computation of diluted earnings per share reflects the potential dilution that could occur if dilutive securities and other contracts to issue shares were exercised or converted into shares or resulted in the issue of shares that then shared in the net income of the Company.

In periods where losses are reported the weighted average shares outstanding excludes potentially issuable shares described above, because their inclusion would be anti-dilutive.

GOODWILL

Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of businesses acquired over the fair value of identifiable net assets at the dates of acquisition. Goodwill is not amortized but is subject to impairment testing annually and whenever facts or circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable.

The Company has determined that its reporting units are consistent with its operating segments: North America; International and Global. Goodwill is allocated to these reporting units based on the original purchase price allocation for acquisitions within the reporting units. When a business entity is sold, goodwill is allocated to the disposed entity based on the fair value of that entity compared to the fair value of the reporting unit in which it is included.

The changes in the carrying amount of goodwill by reporting unit for the years ended

December 31, 2014

and


, are as follows:

Effective

As a consequence of these changes goodwill has been reallocated between reporting units using the relative fair value allocation approach.

Impairment Review

The Company reviews goodwill for impairment annually, or whenever events of circumstances indicate impairment may have occurred. In the first step of the impairment test, the fair value of each reporting unit is compared with its carrying value, including goodwill. If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the amount of an impairment loss, if any, is

).

In 2012, as a consequence of the Company's annual goodwill impairment test performed as of October 1, 2012, the Company concluded that a pre-tax impairment charge of

$492 million

was required to reduce the carrying value of the goodwill associated with the Company's North America reporting unit from

$1,782 million

to its implied fair value of

$1,290 million

. The Company used the income approach to measure the fair value of the North America reporting unit, which involved calculating the fair value of the reporting unit based on the present value of the estimated future cash flows. Cash flow projections were based on management's estimates of revenue growth rates and operating margins, taking into consideration industry and market conditions and the uncertainty related to the business's ability to execute on the projected cash flows. The discount rate used was based on the weighted-average cost of capital adjusted for the relevant risk associated with market participant expectations of characteristics of the reporting unit. The unobservable inputs included projected revenue growth rates, profitability and the market participant assumptions within the discount rate. The decline in the estimated fair value of the reporting unit resulted from lower projected revenue growth rates and profitability levels as well as an increase in the discount rate used to calculate discounted cash flows. As a consequence of the significance of unobservable inputs developed using company-specific information, the re-measurement of goodwill for this reporting unit is classified as a non-recurring level 3 fair value assessment.

Both of these plans are now closed to new entrants and with effect from May 15, 2009, the Company closed the US defined benefit plan to future accrual. New employees in the United Kingdom are offered the opportunity to join a defined contribution plan and in the United States are offered the opportunity to join a 401(k) plan. In addition to the Company’s UK and US defined benefit pension plans, the Company has several smaller defined benefit pension plans in certain other countries in which it operates including a US non-qualified plan and an unfunded plan in the UK. Elsewhere, pension benefits are typically provided through defined contribution plans. It is the Company’s policy to fund pension costs as required by applicable laws and regulations.

In the United Kingdom, the pension trustees, in consultation with the Company, maintain a diversified asset portfolio and this together with contributions made by the Company is expected to meet the pension scheme’s liabilities as they become due. The UK plan’s assets are divided into


separate portfolios according to asset class and managed by


investment managers. The broad target allocations are UK and foreign equities (

36.5 percent

), debt securities (

43.5 percent

), hedge funds (

15 percent

) and real estate (

5 percent

). In the United States, the Company’s investment policy is to maintain a diversified asset portfolio, which together with contributions made by the Company is expected to meet the pension scheme’s liabilities as they become due. The US plan’s assets are currently invested in


funds representing most standard equity and debt security classes. The broad target allocations are US and foreign equities (

Fair Value Hierarchy

The fair value hierarchy has three levels based on the reliability of the inputs used to determine fair value:

•

Level 1: refers to fair values determined based on quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets;

•

Level 2: refers to fair values estimated using observable market based inputs or unobservable inputs that are corroborated by market data; and

•

Level 3: includes fair values estimated using unobservable inputs that are not corroborated by market data.

The UK plan’s real estate investment comprises UK property and infrastructure investments which are valued by the fund manager taking into account cost, independent appraisals and market based comparable data. The UK plan’s hedge fund investments are primarily invested in various ‘fund of funds’ and are valued based on net asset values calculated by the fund and are not publicly available. Liquidity is typically monthly and is subject to liquidity of the underlying funds. The UK plan’s Other Government Bonds investments are primarily invested in investment-grade emerging and developed market government bonds. Funds are valued on a net asset value basis, with the underlying bond instruments being valued using bid-side, clean pricing from approved pricing vendors. Prices are not publicly available.

Pensions

Contractual obligations for the Company's pension plans reflect the contributions the Company expects to make over the next five years into the US, UK and Other defined benefit plans. These contributions are based on current funding positions and may increase or decrease dependent on the future performance of the plans.

In the United Kingdom, the Company is required to agree a funding strategy for the UK defined benefit plan with the plan's trustees. In March 2012, the Company agreed to a revised schedule of contributions towards on-going accrual of benefits and deficit funding contributions the Company will make to the UK plan over the six years ended December 31, 2017. Contributions in each of the next three years would total approximately

$75 million

, of which approximately

$19 million

relates to on-going contributions calculated as

15.9 percent

of active plan members' pensionable salary and approximately

$56 million

that relates to contributions towards the funding deficit.

In addition, based on this agreement, further contributions would be payable based on a profit share calculation (equal to

20 percent

of EBITDA in excess of

$900 million

per annum as defined by the revised schedule of contributions) and an exceptional return calculation (equal to

10 percent

of any exceptional returns made to shareholders, for example, share buybacks, and special dividends). The Company expects to make an exceptional return contribution of

$21 million

during 2015 as a result of share buyback activity during 2014. Aggregate contributions under the deficit funding contribution and the profit share calculation are capped at

£312 million

(

$486 million

) over the six years ended December 31, 2017.

We are currently negotiating a new funding arrangement which we are required to do every three years, which may further change the contributions we are required to make during 2015 and beyond.

An additional amount of approximately

$10 million

will be paid annually into the UK defined benefit plan related to employee's salary sacrifice contributions.

The total contracted contributions for all plans in 2015 are expected to be approximately

$116 million

, excluding approximately

$10 million

in respect of the salary sacrifice contributions.

Certain of Willis Group Holdings’ subsidiaries have given the landlords of some leasehold properties occupied by the Company in the United Kingdom and the United States guarantees in respect of the performance of the lease obligations of the subsidiary holding the lease. The operating lease obligations subject to such guarantees amounted to

$756 million

and

$828 million

Other contractual obligations

For certain subsidiaries and associates, the Company has the right to purchase shares (a call option) from co-shareholders at various dates in the future. In addition, the co-shareholders of certain subsidiaries and associates have the right to sell their shares (a put option) to the Company at various dates in the future. Generally, the exercise price of such put options and call options is formula-based (using revenues and earnings) and is designed to reflect fair value. Based on current projections of profitability and exchange rates and assuming the put options are exercised, the potential amount payable from these options is not expected to exceed

$72 million

(


:

$12 million

).

In July 2010, the Company made a capital commitment of

$25 million

to Trident V Parallel Fund, LP, an investment fund managed by Stone Point Capital. This replaced a capital commitment of

$25 million

that had been made to Trident V, LP in December 2009. As at

Claims, Lawsuits and Other Proceedings

In the ordinary course of business, the Company is subject to various actual and potential claims, lawsuits, and other

proceedings relating principally to alleged errors and omissions in connection with the placement of insurance and reinsurance.

Similar to other corporations, the Company is also subject to a variety of other claims, including those relating to the

Company’s employment practices. Some of the claims, lawsuits and other proceedings seek damages in amounts which could,

if assessed, be significant.

The material actual or potential claims, lawsuits, and other proceedings, of which the Company is currently aware, are as follows:

Stanford Financial Group Litigation

The Company has been named as a defendant in 13 similar lawsuits relating to the collapse of The Stanford Financial Group (‘Stanford’), for which Willis of Colorado, Inc. acted as broker of record on certain lines of insurance. The complaints in these actions generally allege that the defendants actively and materially aided Stanford’s alleged fraud by providing Stanford with certain letters regarding coverage that they knew would be used to help retain or attract actual or prospective Stanford client investors. The complaints further allege that these letters, which contain statements about Stanford and the insurance policies that the defendants placed for Stanford, contained untruths and omitted material facts and were drafted in this manner to help Stanford promote and sell its allegedly fraudulent certificates of deposit.

Errors and omissions claims, lawsuits, and other proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business are covered in part by

professional indemnity or other appropriate insurance. The terms of this insurance vary by policy year and self-insured risks

have increased significantly in recent years. Regarding self-insured risks, the Company has established provisions which are



Willis Group Holdings plc

20.    COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES (Continued)

believed to be adequate in the light of current information and legal advice, and the Company adjusts such provisions from time

to time according to developments. These provisions have been recognized in other operating expenses to the extent that losses are deemed probable and reasonably estimable. Matters that are not probable or reasonably estimable have not been provided for and the Company does not believe a reasonable possible range of losses, for these matters, can be estimated.

On the basis of current information, the Company does not expect that the actual claims, lawsuits and other proceedings to

which the Company is subject, or potential claims, lawsuits, and other proceedings relating to matters of which it is aware, will

ultimately have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. Nonetheless,

given the large or indeterminate amounts sought in certain of these actions, and the inherent unpredictability of litigation and

disputes with insurance companies, it is possible that an adverse outcome in certain matters could, from time to time, have a

material adverse effect on the Company’s results of operations or cash flows in particular quarterly or annual periods.

DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES

Fair value of derivative financial instruments

In addition to the note below, see Note 25 - Fair Value Measurements for information about the fair value hierarchy of derivatives.

Primary risks managed by derivative financial instruments

The main risks managed by derivative financial instruments are interest rate risk and foreign currency risk. The Company’s Board of Directors reviews and approves policies for managing each of these risks as summarized below.

The Company enters into derivative transactions (principally interest rate swaps and forward foreign currency contracts) in order to manage interest rate and foreign currency risks arising from the Company’s operations and its sources of finance. The Company does not hold financial or derivative instruments for trading purposes.

Interest Rate Risk — Investment Income

As a result of the Company’s operating activities, the Company holds Fiduciary funds. The Company earns interest on these funds, which is included in the Company’s financial statements as investment income. These funds are regulated in terms of access and the instruments in which they may be invested, most of which are short-term in maturity.

Through the fourth quarter of 2011, in order to manage interest rate risk relating to Fiduciary funds, the Company entered into interest rate swaps to receive a fixed rate of interest and pay a variable rate of interest denominated in the various currencies related to the short-term investments. During the second quarter 2012, the Company closed out its legacy position relating to such instruments. The fair value of these swaps at the close out date was

$16 million

, representing a cash settlement amount on termination. In connection with the terminated swaps, the Company retained a gain of

$15 million

in accumulated other comprehensive income. This gain is being reclassified into earnings in line with the forecasted swap transactions. The Company expects approximately

$1 million

of the gain to be recognized in the consolidated statement of operations in


.



Notes to the financial statements

24.    DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES (Continued

)

At

December 31, 2014

and


, the Company had no derivative financial instruments that were designated as cash flow hedges of interest rate risk in investments.

Interest Rate Risk — Interest Expense

The Company's operations are financed principally by

$2,054 million

fixed rate senior notes maturing through 2043 and

$259 million

under a


-year term loan facility. The Company has access to (i)

$800 million

under a revolving credit facility expiring July 23, 2018, (ii)

$400 million

under a revolving credit facility expiring April 28, 2015, which will be available for regulatory capital purposes related to securities underwriting only, and (iii)

$22 million

under

two

further revolving credit facilities, of which

$20 million

is also only available for specific regulatory purposes. As of

December 31, 2014

$nil

(2013: $

nil

) was drawn on these facilities.

The


-year term loan facility bears interest at

LIBOR

plus

1.50%

and drawings under the revolving credit facility bear interest at

LIBOR

plus

1.50%

. These margins apply while the Company’s debt rating remains BBB-/Baa3. Should the Company’s debt rating change, then the margin will change in accordance with the credit facilities agreements. The fixed rate senior notes bear interest at various rates as detailed in Note 18 — ‘Debt’.

During the year ended December 31, 2010, the Company entered into a series of interest rate swaps for a total notional amount of

$350 million

to receive a fixed rate and pay a variable rate on a semi-annual basis, with a maturity date of

July 15, 2015

. The Company had previously designated these instruments as fair value hedges against its

$350 million

5.625%

senior notes due 2015 and had accounted for them accordingly until the first quarter of 2013 at which point these swaps, although remaining as economic hedges, no longer qualified for hedge accounting.

During the year ended December 31, 2013, the Company closed out the above interest rate swaps and received a cash settlement of

$13 million

on termination.

To hedge against the potential variability in benchmark interest rates in advance of the anticipated debt issuance, the Company entered into two short-term treasury locks during the three months ended June 30, 2013. These were closed out during the three months ended September 30, 2013 following the issue of the new senior notes described in Note 18 - 'Debt'. The fair value of these treasury locks at the close out date was

$21 million

, received as a cash settlement on termination.

The Company had designated the Treasury locks as effective hedges of the anticipated transaction and had recognized a gain of

$19 million

in other comprehensive income in relation to the effective element that qualified for hedge accounting at that date. This amount will be reclassified into earnings consistent with the recognition of interest expense on the

4.625%

senior notes due 2023 and the

6.125%

senior notes due 2043. In addition, the Company recognized a

$2 million

gain in interest expense in the year ended December 31, 2013 for the portion of the treasury locks determined as ineffective.

Foreign Currency Risk

The Company’s primary foreign exchange risks arise:

•

from changes in the exchange rate between US dollars and pounds sterling as its London market operations earn the majority of their revenues in US dollars and incur expenses predominantly in Pounds sterling, and may also hold a significant net sterling asset or liability position on the balance sheet. In addition, the London market operations earn significant revenues in Euros and Japanese yen; and

•

from the translation into US dollars of the net income and net assets of its foreign subsidiaries, excluding the London market operations which are US dollar denominated.

The foreign exchange risks in its London market operations are hedged as follows:

•

to the extent that forecast Pound sterling expenses exceed Pound sterling revenues, the Company limits its exposure to this exchange rate risk by the use of forward contracts matched to specific, clearly identified cash outflows arising in the ordinary course of business; and

•

to the extent the UK operations earn significant revenues in Euros and Japanese yen, the Company limits its exposure to changes in the exchange rate between the US dollar and these currencies by the use of forward contracts matched to a



Willis Group Holdings plc

24.    DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES (Continued

)

percentage of forecast cash inflows in specific currencies and periods. In addition, we are also exposed to foreign exchange risk on any net sterling asset or liability position in our London market operations.

The fair value of foreign currency contracts is recorded in other assets and other liabilities. For contracts that qualify as accounting hedges, changes in fair value resulting from movements in the spot exchange rate are recorded as a component of other comprehensive income whilst changes resulting from a movement in the time value are recorded in interest expense. For contracts that do not qualify for hedge accounting, the total change in fair value is recorded in interest expense. Amounts held in comprehensive income are reclassified into earnings when the hedged exposure affects earnings.

At

December 31, 2014

and


, the Company’s foreign currency contracts were all designated as hedging instruments except for those relating to short-term cash flows and hedges of certain intercompany loans.

The table below summarizes by major currency the contractual amounts of the Company’s forward contracts to exchange foreign currencies for Pounds sterling in the case of US dollars and US dollars for euro and Japanese yen. Foreign currency notional amounts are reported in US dollars translated at contracted exchange rates.

_________________________________

(i)

Forward exchange contracts range in maturity from 2015 to 2017.

In addition to forward exchange contracts, we undertake short-term foreign exchange swaps for liquidity purposes. These are not designated as hedges and do not qualify for hedge accounting. The fair values at

December 31, 2014

and


were immaterial.

During the year ended

December 31, 2014

, the Company entered into a number of foreign currency transactions in order to hedge certain intercompany loans. These derivatives were not designated as hedging instruments and were for a total notional amount of

$352 million

(

December 31, 2013

:

$228 million

). In respect of these transactions, an immaterial amount has been recognized as an asset within other current assets and an equivalent gain has been recognized in other income (expense), net, for the period.

In addition during the year ended

December 31, 2014

, in order to hedge the Company's exposure relating to the purchase price consideration for acquiring a 75.8 percent holding in Max Matthiessen AB, the Company entered into a series of forward exchange contracts. As a result of these transactions the Company recognized a

$14 million

expense in other income (expense), net, and an equivalent reduction to cash and cash equivalents in the year.

For interest rate swaps all components of each derivative’s gain or loss were included in the assessment of hedge effectiveness. For foreign exchange contracts, only the changes in fair value resulting from movements in the spot exchange rate are included in this assessment. In instances where the timing of expected cash flows can be matched exactly to the maturity of the foreign exchange contract, then changes in fair value attributable to movement in the forward points are also included.



Willis Group Holdings plc

At

December 31, 2014

the Company estimates there will be

$7 million

of net derivative gains reclassified from accumulated comprehensive income into earnings within the next twelve months as the forecasted transactions affect earnings.

Credit Risk and Concentrations of Credit Risk

Credit risk represents the loss that would be recognized at the reporting date if counterparties failed to perform as contracted and from movements in interest rates and foreign exchange rates. The Company currently does not anticipate non-performance by its counterparties. The Company generally does not require collateral or other security to support financial instruments with credit risk.

Concentrations of credit risk that arise from financial instruments exist for groups of customers or counterparties when they have similar economic characteristics that would cause their ability to meet contractual obligations to be similarly affected by changes in economic or other conditions. Financial instruments on the balance sheet that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents, fiduciary funds, accounts receivable and derivatives which are recorded at fair value.

The Company maintains a policy providing for the diversification of cash and cash equivalent investments and places such investments in an extensive number of financial institutions to limit the amount of credit risk exposure. These financial institutions are monitored on an ongoing basis for credit quality predominantly using information provided by credit agencies.

Concentrations of credit risk with respect to receivables are limited due to the large number of clients and markets in which the Company does business, as well as the dispersion across many geographic areas. Management does not believe significant risk exists in connection with the Company's concentrations of credit as of December 31, 2014.

25.

FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS

The Company has categorized its assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring and non-recurring basis into a three-level fair value hierarchy, based on the reliability of the inputs used to determine fair value as follows:

•

Level 1: refers to fair values determined based on quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets;

•

Level 2: refers to fair values estimated using observable market based inputs or unobservable inputs that are corroborated by market data; and

•

Level 3: includes fair values estimated using unobservable inputs that are not corroborated by market data.

The following methods and assumptions were used by the Company in estimating its fair value disclosure for financial instruments:

Long-term debt (excluding related fair value hedges)-Fair values are based on quoted market values and so classified as Level 1 measurements.

Derivative financial instruments-Market values have been used to determine the fair value of interest rate swaps and forward foreign exchange contracts based on estimated amounts the Company would receive or have to pay to terminate the agreements, taking into account the current interest rate environment or current foreign currency forward rates. Such financial instruments are classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy.

The following table presents, for each of the fair-value hierarchy levels, the Company's assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis.

Fair value information about financial instruments not measured at fair value

The following table presents the carrying values and estimated fair values of the Company's financial instruments not measured at fair value. The fair value amounts shown below are not necessarily indicative of the amounts that the Company would realize upon disposition nor do they indicate the Company’s intent or ability to dispose of the financial instrument.



Willis Group Holdings plc

25.    FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS (Continued)

Financial instruments measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis

The remeasurement of goodwill is classified as non-recurring level 3 fair value assessment due to the significance of unobservable inputs developed using company-specific information, see Note 12 - Goodwill.

SEGMENT INFORMATION

During the periods presented, the Company operated through three reporting segments: Global, North America and International. Global provides specialist brokerage and consulting services to clients worldwide for specific industrial and commercial activities and is organized by specialism. North America and International predominantly comprise our retail operations which provide services to small, medium and large corporations, accessing Global’s specialist expertise when required.

The Company uses segment operating income (loss) to measure segment performance. The Company does not allocate all expenses that form part of total expenses in the consolidated statements of operations to its operating segments because management does not include this information in its measurement of the performance of those segments. Because of this unallocated expense, the operating income (loss) of each reporting segment does not reflect the operating income (loss) reporting segment would report as a stand-alone business.

The accounting policies of the segments are consistent with those described in Note 2 — 'Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies'.

There are no inter-segment revenues, with segments operating on a revenue-sharing basis equivalent to that used when sharing business with other third-party brokers.

Selected information regarding the Company’s segments is as follows:

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the company’s principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the company’s board of directors, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of

December 31, 2014

, based on the criteria established in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework (1992)

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended

December 31, 2014

of the Company and our report dated

February 24, 2015

expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements.
