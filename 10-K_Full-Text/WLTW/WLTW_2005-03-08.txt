History and Development of the Company

Willis Group Holdings is the ultimate holding company for the Group. We trace our history to 1828 and are one of the largest insurance brokers in the world.

Willis
Group Holdings was incorporated in Bermuda on February 8, 2001 as an exempted company under the Companies Act, for the sole purpose of redomiciling the ultimate parent
company of the Willis Group (comprised of TA I Limited and subsidiaries) from the United Kingdom to Bermuda. On incorporation Willis Group Holdings was wholly-owned by Profit Sharing (Overseas),
Limited Partnership, an affiliate of KKR and one of the existing shareholders of TA I Limited ("TA I").

Effective
May 8, 2001, Willis Group Holdings exchanged its Shares for all the issued and outstanding ordinary shares of TA I. On April 10, 2001, Willis Group Holdings made
an offer to exchange one of its non-voting management common shares for each outstanding non-voting management ordinary share of TA I. The non-voting management
shares issued by Willis Group Holdings automatically converted into voting shares on consummation of the Willis Group Holdings' initial public offering. In addition, all management ordinary stock
options of TA I were rolled over into identical stock options of Willis Group Holdings. As a consequence of these transactions, Willis Group Holdings is the beneficial owner of 100% of TA I's issued
and outstanding share capital.

Willis
Group Holdings completed an initial public offering of approximately 16% of its Shares in June 2001. In November 2001, May 2002, April 2003 and
February 2004 approximately 12%, 15%, 16% and 15% respectively, of the Shares were publicly sold through secondary public offerings.

For
administrative convenience, we utilize the offices of a subsidiary company as our principal executive offices. The address is:

Willis
Group Holdings Limited

c/o Willis Group Limited

Ten Trinity Square

London EC3P 3AX

England

Tel: +44-20-7488-8111

For
several years, we have focussed on our core retail broking operations and part of this overall strategy includes divesting our third party claims administration businesses, and other
non-core business interests. In recent years, we have made a number of acquisitions around the world and have increased our ownership in several of our associates which were not wholly-
owned where doing so strengthened our retail network and our specialty businesses. In 2004, our acquisitions included a 50% interest in Shanghai Pudong Insurance Brokers Limited (since renamed Willis
Pudong Insurance Brokers Co. Limited), China's leading insurance broker; a 56% interest in Coyle Hamilton, Ireland's largest privately owned insurance broker, with the remaining interests to be
acquired in 2007 and 2009; Opus Holdings Limited, an insurance broking business based in the United Kingdom, together with acquisitions in Denmark, Hong Kong and Mexico. In January 2005, we
acquired the business of Essence Insurance Broker., Ltd, an insurance broker based in Taiwan; and C R King and Partners Limited, an insurance broker based in England. In February 2005 we
announced that American Wholesale Insurance Group, Inc. would acquire our US wholesale unit, the Stewart Smith Group. The transaction is expected to close at the end of the first quarter of
2005. We also announced in February 2005, the acquisition of CGI Consulting, Inc., a US employee benefits firm.

General

We provide a broad range of insurance brokerage and risk management consulting services to our worldwide clients. We have significant market positions in the
United States, in the United Kingdom and, directly and through our associates, in many other countries. We are one of three recognized leaders in providing specialized risk management advisory and
other services on a global basis to clients in various industries including the aerospace, marine, construction and energy industries.

In
our capacity as an advisor and insurance broker, we act as an intermediary between our clients and insurance carriers by advising our clients on their risk management requirements,
helping clients determine the best means of managing risk, and negotiating and placing insurance risk with insurance carriers through our global distribution network.

We
assist clients in the assessment of their risks, advise on the best ways of transferring suitable risk to the global insurance and reinsurance markets and then execute the
transactions at the most appropriate available price, terms and conditions for our clients. Our global distribution network enables us to place the risk in the most appropriate insurance or
reinsurance market worldwide. We also offer clients a broad range of services to help them to identify and control their risks. These services range from strategic risk consulting (including providing
actuarial analyses), to a variety of due diligence services to the provision of practical on-site risk control services (such as health and safety or property loss control consulting). We
also assist clients in planning how to manage incidents or crises when they occur. These services include contingency planning, security audits and product tampering
plans. We are not an insurance company and therefore we do not underwrite insurance risks for our own account.

We
and our associates serve a diverse base of clients located in more than 180 countries. These clients include major multinational and middle-market companies in a variety of
industries, as well as public institutions and individual clients. Many of our client relationships span decades. With approximately 15,800 employees around the world and a network of about 300
offices in some 80 countries, in each case including our associates, we believe we are one of only three insurance brokers in the world possessing the global operating presence, broad product
expertise and extensive


distribution
network necessary to meet effectively the global risk management needs of many of our clients.

Business Strategy

Our strategic objectives are to continue to grow revenues, cash flow and earnings and to enhance our position as one of the largest global providers of risk
management services. We will build on our areas of strength and eliminate areas in which we do not see the opportunities for strong profitable growth. The key elements of this strategy are to
capitalize on a strong, global franchise, emphasize our value-added services, focus on cross-selling our services, increase operating efficiencies, implement global best practices and create a single
company culture. We also pursue strategic acquisitions and investments to strengthen our global franchise

.

Our Business

Insurance is a global business, and its participants are affected by global trends in capacity and pricing. Accordingly, we operate as one global business which
ensures all clients' interests are handled efficiently and comprehensively, whatever their initial point of contact. We organize our business into three main areas: Global, North America and
International. For information regarding revenues by geographic locations, see Note 15 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements contained herein.

Global

Our Global business provides specialist brokerage and consulting services to clients worldwide for the risks arising from specific industrial and commercial
activities. In these operations, we have extensive specialized experience handling diverse lines of coverage, including complex insurance programs, and acting as an intermediary between retail brokers
and insurers. We increasingly provide consulting services on risk management with the objective of assisting clients to reduce the overall cost of risk. Our Global business serves clients in around
180 countries, primarily from United Kingdom offices, although we also serve clients from offices in the United States, Continental Europe and Asia.

The
Global business is divided into Global Specialties, Global Markets, Willis Reinsurance and Willis UK and Ireland.

Global
Specialties has strong global positions in aerospace, marine, energy, construction and several niche businesses. In aerospace we are highly experienced in the provision of
insurance and reinsurance brokerage and risk management services to aerospace clients, including aircraft manufacturers, air cargo handlers and shippers, airport managers and other general aviation
companies. Advisory services provided by aerospace include claims recovery, contract and leasing risk management, safety services and market information. Aerospace's clients are spread throughout the
world and include over 290 airlines and nearly 40% of the world's leading insured non-American airports by passenger movement. Aerospace is also prominent in supplying the space industry
through providing insurance and risk management services to over 40 companies. Other clients include those introduced from other intermediaries as well as insurers seeking reinsurance.

The
energy practice provides insurance brokerage services including property damage, liability, control of well and pollution insurance to the energy industry.

We
provide marine insurance and reinsurance brokerage services, including hull, cargo and general marine liabilities. Marine's clients include direct buyers, other insurance
intermediaries and insurance and reinsurance companies. Marine insurance brokerage is our oldest line of business dating back to our establishment in 1828. Other services of marine include claims
collection and recoveries.


The
construction practice provides risk management advice and places cover for a wide range of UK and international construction activities. Our expertise has encompassed the Channel
Tunnel Rail Link and the construction of LNG Production Facilities in Equatorial New Guinea.

We
have three niche business areas: Fine Art, Jewelry and Specie; Special Contingency Risks and Hughes-Gibb.

The
Fine Art, Jewelry and Specie unit provides specialist risk management and insurance services to fine art, diamond and jewelry businesses and operators of armored cars. Coverage is
also obtained for vault and bullion risks. The Special Contingency Risks unit specializes in producing packages to protect corporations, groups and individuals against special contingencies such as
kidnap and ransom, extortion, detention and political repatriation. The Hughes-Gibb unit principally services the insurance needs of the horse racing and horse breeding industry and also
arranges the reinsurance of horse racing and horse breeding-related business for insurers worldwide.

Global
Markets comprises Global Markets North America, Global Markets International, Global Markets Financial and Professional Risks and Carrier Relations. Global Markets North America
develops global solutions and marketing capability for all our businesses based in North America and Bermuda. The core areas of focus are property, casualty and management liability risks. Global
Markets International works closely with the Willis UK and International retail networks to further develop access to global markets, and provide structuring and placing skills in the relevant areas
of property and casualty liability. Global Markets Financial and Professional Risks specializes in broking directors' and officers' insurance as well as professional indemnity insurance for
corporations and professional firms. It also places structured crime and specialist liability insurance for clients across the broad spectrum of financial solutions as well as specializing in
strategic risk assessment and transactional risk transfer solutions. It also incorporates our political risk unit, as well as structured finance and credit teams. Finally, Carrier Relations analyzes,
oversees and coordinates our Group activities and relationships with underwriting markets globally.

Stewart
Smith is a wholesale unit within North America, which, through 13 offices, provides specialist insurance broking services. In February 2005, we announced the sale of
Stewart Smith to the American Wholesale Insurance Group, Inc. and this sale is expected to close by March 31, 2005.

We
are one of the world's largest intermediaries for reinsurance and have a significant market share in many of the major markets, particularly marine and aviation. In the reinsurance
area, we provide clients, both insurance and reinsurance companies, with a complete range of transactional capabilities as well as analytical and advisory services such as hazard modeling, financial
and balance sheet analysis and reinsurance optimization studies. We also have a consulting unit, which markets its capabilities in actuarial and hazard modeling, as well as knowledge of the financial
implications of catastrophe losses.

Willis
UK and Ireland offers risk management and brokering services to corporate clients and individuals through approximately 28 offices. This unit also includes Coyle Hamilton, the
Republic of Ireland's largest privately-owned insurance broker, in which we acquired a 56% interest on October 1, 2004. This company has since been renamed Coyle Hamilton Willis. Each office
services its own clients accessing the Group's global resources as appropriate to suit the clients' requirements. This unit also includes Corporate Risk Solutions, which arranges tailored solutions
for major companies, including several constituents of the UK FTSE 250 and the Willis Commercial Network which comprises franchise partnerships with nearly 70 privately-owned local UK insurance
brokers and is designed to enable these brokers to meet the insurance requirements of small companies and individuals.


North America

Our North America business provides risk management, insurance brokerage, employee benefits, and related risk management services to a wide variety of clients in
the United States and Canada. In addition, we supply specialist consulting and brokerage services, including construction; environmental; healthcare; and captive management. Our North America business
operates through a network of approximately 80 offices located in 36 states in the United States and six offices in Canada. Certain parts of our Global business also have operations in the United
States.

The
North America business focuses on four customer segments; large account, middle market, small commercial and private client, which enables us to service our clients, and present
ourselves to prospects in a consistent manner, with tailor-made solutions depending on the size, geography or other characteristics of the audience.

The
construction division specializes in providing risk management, insurance and surety bonding services to the construction industry. This division provides services to around
one-quarter of the Engineering New Record Top 400 contractors (a listing of the largest 400 North American contractors based on revenue), as well as numerous other contracting clients. In
addition, it has specialties in major construction project placements, and has many of the largest US homebuilders as clients.

The
employee benefits practice provides industry leading brokerage and consulting expertise and resources for our clients in all areas of human resources, with a special focus on three
areas: controlling employee benefit plan costs, reducing the amount of time and work the client spends on their plans, and educating and training their employees on corporate, HR and benefit plan
issues. The Human Resources Outsourcing component of this practice recently has been strengthened with the acquisition of PRIMARY Worldwide Corporation in California and CGI Consulting Inc.
headquartered in Pennsylvania.

Healthcare
provides insurance and consulting services to healthcare professionals, working with clients to identify malpractice risks and find solutions that minimize or eliminate the
cost of these risks. We also provide insurance and risk management services to healthcare companies and HMOs.

The
executive risk practice provides our clients with management liability solutions addressing a variety of exposures. Our environmental practice focuses on helping clients manage
environmental risks and potential liabilities and also provides risk management and insurance brokerage services to the environmental services industry.

The
Captive Management, Actuarial and Pooling unit provides consulting and services to develop, design and manage our large clients self funded, risk retention, pooling and captive
insurance businesses. We also have offices in Bermuda, Cayman, Barbados and Hawaii.

In
addition, we provide specialist expertise to clients and insurance underwriters through other practices operating through expert staff located throughout the North American network.
These practices include utility, energy, mergers and acquisitions, financial institutions, real estate, consumer goods, hospitality and gaming.

International

Our International unit consists of a network of subsidiaries and associates other than those in North America, the United Kingdom and Republic of Ireland. This
operation is located in 71 countries worldwide, including 24 countries in Europe, 12 in the Asia/Pacific region and 35 elsewhere in the world. The services provided are focused according to the
characteristics of each market and are not identical in every office, but generally include direct risk management and insurance brokerage, specialist and reinsurance brokerage and employee benefits
consulting.


We
believe the combined total revenues of our International subsidiaries and associates provide an indication of the spread and capability of our International network. In 2004, combined
total revenues of our International subsidiaries and our associates were $827 million compared to $714 million in 2003. Our consolidated total revenues for 2004 only include the revenues
of our International subsidiaries of $433 million and do not include the revenues of our associates of $394 million.

As
part of our on-going strategy, we have significantly strengthened International's market share and operations through a number of acquisitions and strategic investments.
The most significant of these is the 33% interest in Gras Savoye, France's leading insurance broker.

In
2003, we increased our investment in Willis GmbH to 100% and increased the ownership in Willis Iberia to 77% with our French associate, Gras Savoye, owning the remaining 23%.

In
2004, we acquired Ital Re S.p.A., a major Italian reinsurance broker, and Kirecon A/S, a leader in providing reinsurance brokerage services in Denmark. We also completed several
transactions consistent with our strategy to increase ownership in our associates where doing so strengthened our retail network and our speciality businesses. These included the acquisition of the
remaining 70% interest in Willis A/S, Denmark's largest insurance broker; an additional 20% stake in Herzfeld & Levy S.A., now named Herzfeld Willis S.A., our retail operation in Argentina,
taking our ownership to 60%; an additional 10% interest in Willis South Africa (Pty) Limited, taking our ownership to 80%; an additional 10% interest in our Swedish operation Willis Global Financial
Executive Risks AB, taking our ownership to 92%. We also purchased an interest of 50% in Willis Pudong Insurance Brokers Co. Limited, which is engaged in insurance and reinsurance brokerage activities
throughout the People's Republic of China. Willis Pudong has ten branch offices in China. In January 2005, we acquired Essence Insurance Broker., Limited, an insurance broker based in Taiwan.

We
have a 50.1% interest in the company.

Customers

Our customers operate on a global and local scale in a multitude of businesses and industries throughout the world and generally range in size from major
multinational corporations to middle market companies. Further, many of our client relationships span decades, for instance our relationship


with
The Tokio Marine and Fire Insurance Company, Limited dates back over 100 years. No one client accounted for more than 10% of revenues for fiscal year 2004. Additionally, we place insurance
with over 5,000 insurance carriers, none of which individually accounted for more than 11% of the total premiums we placed on behalf of our clients in 2004.

Competition

We face competition in all fields in which we operate. According to the July 2004 edition of Business Insurance, the 162 largest commercial insurance
brokers globally reported brokerage revenues totalling $30.2 billion in 2003. The insurance brokerage industry is led by three global participants: Marsh & McLennan
Companies, Inc., with approximately 31% of the worldwide market in 2003 referred to above; Aon Corporation, with approximately 22% of the worldwide market in 2003; and us, with approximately 7%
of the worldwide market in 2003. The industry is highly fragmented beyond these three brokers, with the next largest broker having approximately 4% of the worldwide market.

Competition
in the insurance brokerage and risk management businesses in general is based on global capability, product breadth, innovation, quality of service and price. Our global
capability and product breadth is similar to those of the two other global brokers, and thus we compete with them primarily based on innovation, quality of service and price. In addition, we compete
with numerous specialist, regional and local firms. Insurance companies also compete with our brokers by directly soliciting insureds without the assistance of an independent broker or agent.
Competition for premiums is intense in all our business lines and in every insurance market. Competition on premium rates has also exacerbated the pressures caused by a continuing reduction in demand
in some classes of business. For example, insurers are currently retaining a greater proportion of their risk portfolios than previously. Industrial and commercial companies are increasingly relying
upon captive insurance companies, self-insurance pools, risk retention groups, mutual insurance companies and other mechanisms for funding their risks, rather than buying insurance. We and
our competitors provide management and similar services for those alternative risk transfer programs. Additional competitive pressures arise from the entry of new market participants, such as banks,
accounting firms and insurance carriers themselves, offering risk management or transfer services. Our market share has been stable in recent years. We believe that our strategies of building on our
strong global franchise, expanding on our employee benefit capabilities, increasing our operating efficiencies and creating a
single company culture will allow us to retain and gain clients in the competitive marketplace. We also believe that our market position will provide us with opportunities to acquire smaller companies
with strong regional presence or specialized expertise.

Regulation

The manner in which we conduct our business is subject to legal requirements and governmental and quasi-governmental regulatory supervision in virtually all
countries in which we operate. These requirements are generally designed to protect our clients by establishing minimum standards of conduct and practice, particularly regarding the provision of
advice and product information as well as financial criteria.

Throughout
2004, our business activities in the United Kingdom were regulated by the General Insurance Standards Council, as well as by the Financial Services Authority.

All
European Union member states were required to implement the European Union Insurance Mediation Directive by January 2005. The Directive introduced rules to enable insurance
and reinsurance intermediaries to operate and provide services within each member state of the EU on a basis consistent with the EU single market and customer protection aims. Each EU member state was
required to ensure that the insurance and reinsurance intermediaries resident in their country were registered with a statutory body in that country and that each intermediary met professional
requirements in relation to their competence, good repute, professional indemnity cover and financial


capacity.
In the United Kingdom the statutory body is the Financial Services Authority. From January 14, 2005, The Financial Services Authority became the sole regulator of insurance and
reinsurance intermediary businesses in the United Kingdom.

The
Financial Services Authority has prescribed the methods by which our insurance and reinsurance operations are to conduct business. The Financial Services Authority generally conduct
their regulatory functions through the establishment of net worth and other financial criteria. They also require the submission of reports and have investigative and disciplinary powers. Monitoring
visits are carried out to assess our compliance with regulatory requirements.

Further,
our clients have the right to file complaints with our regulators about our services, and the regulators may conduct an investigation or require us to conduct an investigation
into these complaints. Our failure, or that of our employees, to satisfy the regulators that we are in compliance with their
requirements or the legal requirements governing our activities, can result in disciplinary action, fines, reputational damage and financial harm.

Our
activities in connection with insurance brokerage services within the United States are subject to regulation and supervision by state authorities. Although the scope of regulation
and form of supervision may vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, insurance laws in the United States are often complex and generally grant broad discretion to supervisory authorities in adopting
regulations and supervising regulated activities. That supervision generally includes the licensing of insurance brokers and agents and the regulation of the handling and investment of client funds
held in a fiduciary capacity. Our continuing ability to provide insurance brokerage in the jurisdictions in which we currently operate is dependent upon our compliance with the rules and regulations
promulgated from time to time by the regulatory authorities in each of these jurisdictions.

All
companies carrying on similar activities in a given jurisdiction are subject to that regulation which are not dissimilar to the requirements for our operations in the United Kingdom
and United States. We do not consider that these regulatory requirements adversely affect our competitive position.

Employees

As of December 31, 2004 we had approximately 12,400 employees worldwide of whom approximately 4,000 were employed in each of the United Kingdom and the
United States, with the balance being employed across the rest of the world. In addition, our associates had approximately 3,400 employees, all of whom were located outside the United Kingdom and the
United States.

Risks Relating to our Business

This section describes the material risks affecting the Group's business. These risks could materially affect the Group's business, its revenues, operating
income, net income, net assets and liquidity and capital resources and, accordingly should be read in conjunction with any forward-looking statements in this Annual Report on
Form 10-K.

Premiums and Commissions—We do not control the premiums on which our commissions are based, and volatility or declines in premiums may seriously undermine our
profitability.

We
derive most of our revenues from commissions and fees for brokering and consulting services. We do not determine insurance premiums on which commissions are generally based. Premiums
are cyclical in nature and may vary widely based on market conditions. From the late 1980s through late 2000, insurance premium rates generally declined as a result of a number of factors, including
the expanded underwriting capacity of insurance carriers; consolidation of both insurance intermediaries and insurance carriers; and increased competition among insurance carriers.

In
addition, as traditional risk-bearing insurance carriers continue to outsource the production of premium revenue to non-affiliated agents or brokers such as
ourselves, those insurance carriers may


seek
to reduce further their expenses by reducing the commission rates payable to those insurance agents or brokers. The reduction of these commission rates, along with general volatility and/or
declines in premiums, may significantly undermine our profitability.

Claims, Lawsuits and Other Proceedings—Our business, results of operations, financial condition or liquidity may be materially adversely affected by errors and
omissions and the outcome of certain actual and potential claims, lawsuits and proceedings.

We
are subject to various actual and potential claims, lawsuits and other proceedings relating principally to alleged errors and omissions in connection with the placement of insurance
and reinsurance in the ordinary course of business. Because we often assist our clients with matters, including the placement of insurance coverage and the handling of related claims, involving
substantial amounts of money, errors and omissions claims against us may arise which allege our potential liability for all or part of the amounts in question. Claimants can seek large damage awards
and these claims can involve potentially significant defense costs. Such claims, lawsuits and other proceedings could, for example, include allegations of damages for our employees or
sub-agents improperly failing to place coverage or notify claims on behalf of clients, to provide insurance carriers with complete and accurate information relating to the risks being
insured or to appropriately apply funds that we hold for our clients on a fiduciary basis. We have established provisions against these items which we believe to be adequate in the light of current
information and legal advice, and we adjust such provisions from time to time according to developments.

While
most of the errors and omissions claims made against us have, subject to our self-insured deductibles, been covered by our professional indemnity insurance, our
business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity may be adversely affected if in the future our insurance coverage proves to be inadequate or unavailable or there is an increase in
liabilities for which we self-insure. In addition, claims, lawsuits and other proceedings may harm our reputation or divert management resources away from operating our business.

The
principal actual or potential claims, lawsuits and proceedings to which we are currently subject are (i) claims relating to services provided by one of our UK subsidiaries,
Willis Faber (Underwriting Management) Limited, to another subsidiary, Sovereign, that was engaged in insurance underwriting prior to 1991 as well as certain third party insurance companies;
(ii) potential claims which could be asserted with respect to our placement of property and casualty insurance for a number of entities which were directly impacted by the September 11,
2001 destruction of New York's World Trade Center complex; (iii) potential regulatory and other proceedings relating to contingent compensation arrangements; (iv) potential claims
arising out of various legal proceedings between reinsurers, reinsureds and their reinsurance brokers relating to personal accident excess of loss reinsurance placements for the years 1993 to 1998;
and (v) potential claims arising out of legal proceedings by Cable & Wireless Plc and Pender Insurance Limited, its captive insurer, against the Company and others in respect of the
provision of captive management services to Pender. See Item 3 "Legal Proceedings".

Regulation—We are subject to insurance industry regulation worldwide. If we fail to comply with regulatory requirements, we may not be able to conduct our
business.

Many
of our activities are subject to regulatory supervision in virtually all the countries in which we are based or our activities are undertaken. Failure to comply with some of these
regulations could lead to disciplinary action, including requiring clients to be compensated for loss, the imposition of penalties and the revocation of our authorization to operate. In addition,
changes in legislation or regulations and actions by regulators, including changes in administration and enforcement policies, could from time to time require operational improvements or modifications
at various locations which could result in higher costs or hinder our ability to operate our business. See Item 1 "Business—Regulation".


Put and Call Arrangements—We have entered into significant put and call arrangements which may require us to pay substantial amounts to purchase shares in one of
our associates. Those payments would reduce our cash flow and the funds available to grow our business.

In
connection with many of our investments in our associates, we retain rights to increase our ownership percentages over time and, in some cases, the existing owners also have a right
to put their shares to us. The put arrangement in place for shares of our associate, Gras Savoye, may require us to pay substantial amounts to purchase those shares, which could decrease our liquidity
and the funds available to grow our business. See Item 7 "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations".

The
rights under the put arrangement may be exercised through 2011. If fully exercised, we would be required to buy shares of Gras Savoye, other than those held by its management,
possibly increasing
our ownership interest from 33% to 90%. Management shareholders of Gras Savoye, representing approximately 10% of the outstanding shares, do not have general put rights before 2011, but have certain
put rights on their death, disability or retirement. Payments in connection with management put rights would not have exceeded $65 million if those rights had been fully exercised at
December 31, 2004.

During
2005, the incremental 57% of Gras Savoye may be put to us at a price equal to the greater of approximately 800 million French francs ($166 million at
December 31, 2004 exchange rates) or a price determined by a contractual formula based on earnings and revenue, which at December 31, 2004 would have amounted to approximately
$368 million. After 2005, the put price is determined solely by the formula. The shareholders may put their shares individually at any time during the put period. The amounts we may have to pay
in connection with the put arrangements may significantly exceed these estimates.

Competition—Competition in our industry is intense, and if we are unable to compete effectively, we may lose market share and our business may be materially
adversely affected.

We
face competition in all fields in which we operate, based on global capability, product breadth, innovation, quality of service and price. We compete with Marsh & McLennan and
Aon, the two other providers of global risk management services, as well as with numerous specialist, regional and local firms. If we are unable to compete effectively against these competitors, we
will suffer lower revenue, reduced operating margins and loss of market share.

Competition
for business is intense in all our business lines and in every insurance market, and the other two providers of global risk management services have substantially greater
market share than we do. Competition on premium rates has also exacerbated the pressures caused by a continuing reduction in demand in some classes of business. For example, insureds have been
retaining a greater proportion of their risk portfolios than previously. Industrial and commercial companies have been increasingly relying upon their own subsidiary insurance companies, known as
captive insurance companies, self-insurance pools, risk retention groups, mutual insurance companies and other mechanisms for funding their risks, rather than buying insurance. Additional
competitive pressures arise from the entry of new market participants, such as banks, accounting firms and insurance carriers themselves, offering risk management or transfer services. See Item 1
"Business—Competition".

Dependence on Key Personnel—The loss of any member of our senior management, particularly our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, or a significant number of our
brokers could negatively affect our financial plans, marketing and other objectives.

The
loss of or failure to attract key personnel could significantly impede our financial plans, growth, marketing and other objectives. Our success depends to a substantial extent not
only on the ability and experience of our senior management, particularly our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Joseph J. Plumeri, but also on the individual brokers and teams that service our
clients and maintain client relationships. The insurance brokerage industry has in the past experienced intense


competition
for the services of leading individual brokers and brokerage teams, and we have lost key individuals and teams to competitors in the past. We believe that our future success will depend in
large part on our ability to attract and retain additional highly skilled and qualified personnel and to expand, train and manage our employee base. We may not continue to be successful in doing so,
because the competition for qualified personnel in our industry is intense.

International Operations—Our significant non-US operations, particularly those in the United Kingdom, expose us to exchange rate fluctuations and
various risks that could impact our business.

A
significant portion of our operations is conducted outside the United States. Accordingly, we are subject to legal, economic and market risks associated with operating in foreign
countries, including devaluations and fluctuations in currency exchange rates; imposition of limitations on conversion of foreign currencies into pounds sterling or dollars or remittance of dividends
and other payments by foreign subsidiaries; hyperinflation in certain foreign countries; imposition or increase of investment and other restrictions by foreign governments; and the requirement of
complying with a wide variety of foreign laws.

We
report our operating results and financial condition in US dollars. Our US operations earn revenue and incur expenses primarily in dollars. In the United Kingdom, however, we earn
revenue in a number of different currencies, but expenses are almost entirely incurred in pounds sterling. Outside the United States and the United Kingdom, we predominantly generate revenue and
expenses in the local currency. The table gives an approximate analysis of revenues and expenses by currency in 2004.

Pounds

Sterling

US Dollars

Other

Currencies

Revenues

15%

56%

29%

Expenses

32%

46%

22%

Because of devaluations and fluctuations in currency exchange rates or the imposition of limitations on conversion of foreign currencies into
dollars, we are subject to currency translation exposure on the profits of our operations, in addition to economic exposure. Furthermore, the mismatch between sterling revenues and expenses creates an
exchange exposure. As the pound sterling strengthens, the dollars required to be translated into pounds sterling to cover the net sterling expenses increase, which then causes our results to be
negatively impacted. Given these facts, the strength of the pound sterling relative to the US dollar has in the past had a material negative impact on our reported results. This risk could have a
material adverse effect on our business financial condition, cash flow and results of operations in the future.

Our
policy is to convert into pounds sterling all revenues arising in currencies other than US dollars together with sufficient US dollar revenues to fund the remaining pounds sterling
expenses. Outside the United Kingdom, only those cash flows necessary to fund mismatches between revenues and expenses are converted into local currency; amounts remitted to the United Kingdom are
generally converted into pounds sterling. These transactional currency exposures are generally managed by entering into forward exchange contracts. It is our policy to hedge at least 25% of the next
12 months' exposure in significant currencies. We generally do not hedge exposures beyond three years.

Item 2—Properties

We own and lease a number of properties for use as offices throughout the world and believe that our properties are generally suitable and adequate for the
purposes for which they are used. The principal properties are located in the United Kingdom and the United States. Our principal office at Ten Trinity Square in London is a landmark building which we
own. In November 2004 we entered into an Agreement for Lease with long-time client British Land plc relating to our new UK headquarters in


London.
Construction is scheduled to commence in early 2005 and Willis occupancy is targeted for late 2007.

Item 3—Legal Proceedings

General.

We are subject to various actual and potential claims, lawsuits and other proceedings relating principally to
alleged errors and omissions in connection with the placement of insurance and reinsurance in the ordinary course of business. Similar to other corporations, we are also subject to a variety of other
claims, including those relating to our employment practices. Some of those claims, lawsuits and other proceedings seek damages in amounts which could, if assessed, be significant. Most of the claims,
lawsuits and other proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business are covered by professional indemnity or other appropriate insurance. In respect of self-insured deductibles, we
have established provisions against these items which are believed to be adequate in the light of current information and legal advice, and we adjust such provisions from time to time according to
developments. On the basis of current information, we do not expect that the actual claims, lawsuits and other proceedings to which we are subject or potential claims, lawsuits and other proceedings
relating to matters discussed below will ultimately have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. Nonetheless, given the large or indeterminate amounts
sought in certain of these actions, and the inherent unpredictability of litigation, it is possible that an adverse outcome in certain matters could, from time to time, have a material adverse effect
on the Company's results of operations or cash flows in particular quarterly or annual periods.

The
most significant actual or potential claims, lawsuits and other proceedings, of which we are currently aware are:

Sovereign/WFUM.

Sovereign, a wholly owned subsidiary of ours, operated as an insurance company in the United Kingdom and from
1972 Sovereign's underwriting activities were managed by another wholly owned subsidiary of ours, Willis Faber (Underwriting Management) Limited, or WFUM. WFUM also provided underwriting agency and
other services to third-party insurance companies, which we refer to as the stamp companies, some of which are long-standing clients of ours. As part of its services as agent, WFUM
arranged insurance and reinsurance business on behalf of Sovereign and the stamp companies and arranged reinsurance on their behalf. In 1991, Sovereign and the stamp companies ceased underwriting new
business. Sovereign entered provisional liquidation in 1997.

On
January 5, 2000, a scheme of arrangement proposed by Sovereign to its creditors became effective. The stated purpose of the scheme of arrangement is to resolve Sovereign's
liabilities and provide that Sovereign's business is run off in as orderly a manner as possible. The scheme administrators have announced payments to creditors at a payment percentage of 40% payable
out of Sovereign's assets. Sovereign's assets are separate and distinct from ours, and any payment from Sovereign will have no effect on our results of operations, financial condition or liquidity.

Sovereign
and certain of the stamp companies have also expressed concern about the enforceability of certain reinsurance put in place by WFUM on behalf of Sovereign and the stamp
companies. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that there will be no arbitration, judicial decisions or settlements arising in the future that result in shortfalls in reinsurance recoveries for
Sovereign or the stamp companies. The failure of Sovereign or the stamp companies to collect reinsurance following any adverse arbitration awards would increase the likelihood of them pursuing claims
against WFUM.

Sovereign
and the stamp companies have reserved their rights generally in respect of such potential claims, and WFUM, Willis Group and certain of our brokerage subsidiaries have entered
into standstill agreements which preserve the rights of potential claimants with respect to their potential claims.

In
2004 the solvent stamp companies entered into a settlement agreement whereby Willis Group Limited and all its subsidiaries received certain immediate releases and other releases
staged in return for certain staged payments. The full details of the agreement are confidential but once the final staged


payment
is made, Willis and its subsidiaries will be released from further potential liabilities to the stamp companies arising out of the WFUM pools. Meanwhile there remains the possibility that new
matters may arise and the later staged releases will not become activated, although we are not aware of any current reason why that might occur.

World Trade Center.

We acted as the insurance broker, but not as an underwriter, for the placement of both property and
casualty insurance for a number of entities which were directly impacted by the
September 11, 2001 destruction of the World Trade Center complex, including Silverstein Properties LLC, which acquired a 99-year leasehold interest in the twin towers and related
facilities from the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey in July 2001. Although the World Trade Center complex insurance was bound at or before the July 2001 closing of the
leasehold acquisition, consistent with standard industry practice, the final policy wording for the placements was still in the process of being finalized when the twin towers and other buildings in
the complex were destroyed on September 11, 2001. There are a number of lawsuits pending in the United States between the insured parties and the insurers for several placements, including the
Silverstein property placement, but we are not a party to any of these lawsuits. The principal issue in dispute in the Silverstein property litigation is whether the September 11 events
constituted one or more occurrences for the purposes of the relevant insurance policies, and the outcome of this issue will significantly impact the amount that the insurers ultimately pay on the
property policies. Other disputes may also arise in respect of the World Trade Center insurance placed by us which could affect the Company, including claims by one or more of the insureds that we
made culpable errors or omissions in connection with our brokerage activities. However, we do not believe that our role as broker will lead to liabilities which in the aggregate would have a material
adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition or liquidity.

Contingent Compensation Arrangements.

Beginning in April 2004, the New York Attorney General issued subpoenas to a
number of insurance carriers and insurance broking firms, including the Company. These subpoenas requested information regarding, among other things, arrangements pursuant to which insurers
compensated insurance brokers for distribution and other services provided to insurers. The New York Department of Insurance also requested information concerning these compensation arrangements. In
October 2004, the New York Attorney General filed suit against one of the insurance brokers, accusing that broker of steering clients to insurers with which it has these compensation
arrangements and of soliciting false or fictitious quotes from insurers (the "NY AG Complaint"). The New York Attorney General has stated publicly that he has broadened his investigation of the
insurance industry to cover other practices and other possible violations of law, including violations of fiduciary duty, securities laws, and antitrust laws. The New York Attorney General has also
publicly stated that civil and criminal charges may be filed against both individuals and other industry participants. After the New York Attorney General commenced his investigation, insurance
commissioners and attorneys general of other states announced that they are conducting similar investigations and have issued subpoenas to a number of insurance carriers and insurance brokerage firms,
including the Company. The Company has received requests for documents and information from eighteen other states and the District of Columbia. The Company is co-operating fully with these
investigations and is producing documents and other information in response to these subpoenas. The Company has engaged in discussions with representatives of the New York Attorney General's office
and of other states' insurance commissioners and attorneys general about their investigations. The Company cannot predict at this time how or when those investigations will be resolved.

In
August 2004, a state court proceeding was commenced against the Company in California by an organization purporting to act in a representative capacity on behalf of the
California general public. The complaint alleges that the compensation arrangements between the Company and insurance carriers constitute deceptive trade practices, and it seeks both injunctive and
equitable relief, including restitution. This action was dismissed in December 2004. A purported class action also was filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New
York naming various insurance carriers


and
insurance brokerage firms, including the Company, as defendants. The complaint alleges conduct by the defendants similar to the conduct alleged in the NY AG Complaint and also alleges, among other
things, the existence of a conspiracy among the insurance carriers and brokers whereby they have engaged in violations of the federal RICO statute. Similar purported class actions also have been filed
against various insurance carriers and insurance brokerage firms, including the Company, in the United States District Courts for the Northern District of Illinois and the Northern District of
California and in the Florida state court, and it is expected that further lawsuits may be filed. The actions filed in federal court will be transferred to the United States District Court for the
District of New Jersey for co-ordinated pre-trial proceedings. The Company disputes these allegations and intends to defend itself vigorously against these actions.

The
compensation arrangements, which were initially the subject of the investigation by the New York Attorney General, are a longstanding and general practice within the insurance
industry and have been disclosed by the Company for many years. On October 21, 2004, the Company announced that it was voluntarily abolishing these compensation arrangements immediately in
North America and by December 31, 2004 outside North America. It is not possible at this time to predict what the outcome or the timing of any resolution of these proceedings or any possible
future proceedings may be.

Insurance Market Dispute.

Various legal proceedings are pending, have been concluded or may commence between reinsurers,
reinsureds and in some cases their intermediaries, including reinsurance brokers, relating to personal accident excess of loss reinsurance for the years 1993 to 1998. The proceedings principally
concern allegations by reinsurers that they have sustained substantial losses due to an alleged abnormal "spiral" in the market in which the reinsurance contracts were placed, the existence and nature
of which, as well as other information, was not disclosed to them by the reinsureds or their reinsurance broker. A "spiral" is a market term for a situation in which reinsureds and reinsurers reinsure
each other with the effect that the same loss or portion of that loss moves through the market multiple times.

The
reinsurers concerned have taken the position that, despite their decisions to underwrite risks or a group of risks, they are no longer bound by their reinsurance contracts. As a
result, they have stopped settling claims and are seeking to recover claims already paid. We acted as the reinsurance broker or otherwise as intermediary, but not as an underwriter, for numerous
personal accident reinsurance contracts, including for two contracts that were involved in one of the arbitrations. Due to the small number of reinsurance brokers generally, we were one of a small
number of brokers active in the market for this reinsurance during the relevant period. We also utilized other brokers active in this market as sub-agents, including brokers who are
parties to the legal proceedings
described above, for certain contracts and may be responsible for any errors and omissions they may have made. In July 2003, one of the reinsurers received a judgment in the English High Court
against certain parties, including a sub-broker we used to place two of the contracts involved in this trial. Although neither we nor any of our subsidiaries were a party to this or any
other proceeding or arbitration, we entered into standstill agreements with certain of the principals to the reinsurance contracts tolling the statute of limitations pending the outcome of proceedings
between the reinsureds and reinsurers.

Although
at this time no claims are pending against us and we have not joined any settlement effort, claims may be made against us if reinsurers do not pay claims on policies issued by
them. It is too early to know what amount of underwriting losses will be alleged to be attributable to an abnormal spiral or the other issues that may be raised, or what amount, if any, reinsureds or
reinsurers or other intermediaries may seek to recover from us.

Pender Insurance Limited/Captive Insurance Management

Legal proceedings have been commenced in the English Commercial Court
by Cable & Wireless Plc and Pender Insurance Limited, its captive insurer, against six of their former employees and certain other individuals and entities, and more recently two of our
subsidiaries and one of our former employees. We acted through one of our subsidiaries as an independent captive manager for Pender from 1990 to 2003. The plaintiffs allege a


fraudulent
conspiracy involving the manner in which Pender was managed, operated or advised by the defendants, which allegedly resulted in substantial damages to the plaintiffs and, in a second claim,
negligence with respect to certain reinsurance policies. We intend to defend ourselves vigorously at the trial, which is scheduled to commence in October 2005. We are unable at this time to
ascertain the total amount of damages suffered by the claimants or what portion, if any, of those damages the court might ultimately determine to be the responsibility of the Willis defendants.

There
are no governmental laws, decrees or regulations in Bermuda which will restrict the remittance of dividends or other payments to non-resident holders of the Company's
common stock.


On
the date of this document there is no Bermuda income, corporation or profits tax, withholding tax, capital gains tax, capital transfer tax, estate duty or inheritance tax payable by
us or our shareholders, other than shareholders ordinarily resident in Bermuda.

Pursuant
to the Exempted Undertakings Tax Protection Act 1966, as amended, we have received an undertaking from the Bermuda Ministry of Finance, that, in the event of there being enacted
in Bermuda any legislation imposing withholding or other tax computed on profits or income, or computed on any capital assets, gain or appreciation or any tax in the nature of estate duty or
inheritance tax, such tax shall not until March 28, 2016 be applicable to us or to any of our operations, or to our Shares, debentures or other obligations except and so far as such tax applies
to persons ordinarily resident in Bermuda and holding such shares, debentures or other obligations or any land leased or let to us in Bermuda.

The
gross amount of dividends paid to US shareholders will be treated as dividend income to such holders, to the extent paid out of current or accumulated earnings and profits, as
determined under United States federal income tax principles. This income will be includable in the gross income of a US shareholder as ordinary income on the day received by the US shareholder. These
dividends will not be eligible for the dividends received deduction allowed to corporations under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.

With
respect to non-corporate US shareholders, certain dividends received before January 1, 2009 from a qualified foreign corporation may be subject to reduced rates
of taxation. A foreign corporation is treated as a qualified foreign corporation with respect to dividends received from that corporation on shares that are readily tradable on an established
securities market in the United States, such as our shares. Non-corporate US shareholders that do not meet a minimum holding period requirement for our Shares during which they are not
protected from the risk of loss or that elect to treat the dividend income as "investment income" pursuant to section 163(d)(4) of the Code will not be eligible for the reduced rates of
taxation regardless of our status as a qualified foreign corporation. In addition, the rate reduction will not apply to dividends if the recipient of a dividend is obligated to make related payments
with respect to positions in substantially similar or related property. This disallowance applies even if the minimum holding period has been met. Non-corporate US shareholders should
consult their own tax advisors regarding the application of these rules given their particular circumstances.

Unusual
items consist of the following:

•

restructuring
charges relating to implementation of changes to our North American business processes, which were $11 million for the year ended December 31,
2000, representing excess operating lease obligations; and

•

restructuring
charges relating to the exit from certain US business lines for the year ended December 31, 2000 of $7 million. These consisted of
$4 million of employee termination


benefits,
$1 million relating to excess operating lease obligations and $2 million relating to other costs.

(b)

As
an intermediary, we hold funds in a fiduciary capacity for the account of third parties, typically as a result of premiums received from clients that are in transit to insurance
carriers and claims due to clients that are in transit from insurance carriers. We report premiums, which are held on account of, or due from policyholders, as assets with a corresponding liability
due to the insurance carriers. Claims held by, or due to, us which are due to clients are also shown as both assets and liabilities of ours. All those balances due or payable are included in insurance
and reinsurance balances receivable and payable on the balance sheet. We earn interest on those funds during the time between the receipt of the cash and the time the cash is paid out. Fiduciary cash
must be kept in certain regulated bank accounts subject to guidelines, which vary according to legal jurisdiction. These guidelines generally emphasize capital protection and liquidity. Fiduciary cash
is not available to service our debt or for other corporate purposes.


Item 7—Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

2004 was a challenging year for the insurance industry: rates declined as the market softened and regulatory investigations, in particular by the New York
Attorney General, led to a reassessment of market practices.

Results and dividend

Against this background, we reported a 10 percent increase in revenues of which 2 percent was attributable to the net impact of foreign currency
translation and 4 percent to acquisitions and disposals. Organic revenue growth of 4 percent reflected net new business growth of 6 percent offset by a negative 2 percent
impact from declining insurance premium rates.

Our
operating margin, operating income as a percentage of revenues, decreased to 29 percent in 2004 from 30 percent in 2003 reflecting the impact of higher expenses related
to legal, investigative and regulatory compliance and incremental salaries and benefits expense for recruiting and retention.

Net
income at $427 million in 2004 was $13 million or 3 percent higher than 2003 and net income per diluted share increased by 4 percent to $2.54 from $2.45
in 2003.

The
Board has approved a 15 percent increase in the quarterly cash dividend to $0.86 per share annually with effect from April 2005.

Cash and financing

Cash generated from operations was $490 million which, together with an $80 million increase in our long-term borrowings and other
smaller cash inflows, was used to support our share buyback program, $339 million, dividends, $115 million, and acquisitions, $147 million.

In
February 2004, we redeemed all $370 million of the outstanding 9% senior subordinated notes and at the same time drew down $300 million of a new
$600 million credit facility. A further $150 million was drawn down in June 2004 in accordance with our credit facility arrangements. We have now repaid or refinanced all the debt
relating to our 1998 leveraged buy-out.

Acquisitions

During the year we completed several acquisitions with annualized revenues of approximately $155 million at a total cost of $195 million, including
shares issued. Acquisitions included Coyle Hamilton, the Republic of Ireland's largest privately owned insurance broker; CH Jeffries and Opus in the United Kingdom which strengthened our middle
market and large account capabilities; and a controlling interest in Willis A/S Denmark.

Impact of abolishing volume and profit-based contingent commissions and future outlook

In October 2004, we announced that we were abolishing volume and profit-based contingent commissions. In North America, we discontinued these commissions
as of October 21, 2004 and in other markets where we operate we unwound these commission arrangements by December 31, 2004. Globally, we earned $71 million from volume and
profit-based contingent commissions in 2004 and $70 million in 2003. We do not expect to earn any of these contingent commissions in 2005 and future years although immaterial amounts may be
received in relation to the winding-up of contracts from prior years.

In
addition to volume and profit-based contingent commissions, we earned market service and other fees in 2004 of $77 million compared to $63 million in 2003. This market
derived income includes fees received for product and market research and development we carry out on behalf of insurers and


income
related to administration and other services we provide to the market. We are working with the market to restructure these contracts, which may impact the level of fees earned.

However,
in the rapidly changing industry environment, we see new opportunities to enhance our global market share, especially with middle market and large accounts. Our efforts to grow
market share will include increased marketing, aggressive targeting of new accounts, an emphasis on retaining existing accounts, cross-selling and continued hiring of new business producers and other
staff. In addition, we continue to look for acquisition opportunities globally and we expect the pace of acquisitions will continue at the rate we experienced in 2004.

Disposal of Stewart Smith

On February 15, 2005, we announced an agreement in principle to sell our wholesale unit, Stewart Smith. This disposal is part of our overall strategy of
focusing on our core broking operations and divesting non-core business interests. Stewart Smith contributed $77 million of revenues in 2004.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES

The Company's accounting policies are described in Note 2 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Management considers that the following
accounting estimates or assumptions are the most important to the presentation of the Company's financial condition or operating performance.

Pension expense

We maintain defined benefit pension plans that cover almost all our employees in the United States and United Kingdom. Elsewhere, pension benefits are typically
provided through defined contribution plans. The key assumptions in determining pension expense for the defined benefit plans are the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, the
expected long-term rate of compensation increase and the discount rate applicable to the plan liabilities.

The
expected long-term rates of return on plan assets were developed from the expected future returns of the various asset classes using the target asset allocations. The
expected long-term rates of return used for determining the net pension expense in 2004 were 7.25 percent for the UK plan, unchanged from 2003, and 8.0 percent for the US
plan, a reduction of 0.5 percent from the rate used in 2003. A 0.25 percent change in the long-term rate of return for both plans would impact 2005 net pension expense by
approximately $5 million.

The
rates used to discount pension plan liabilities at December 31, 2004 were based on the yields prevailing at that date of high quality corporate bonds of appropriate maturity.
The selected discount rates were 5.3 percent, a reduction of 0.2 percent from 2003, for the UK plan liabilities and 5.75 percent, a reduction of 0.25 percent from 2003, for
the US plan liabilities. A 0.25 percent change in the discount rate for both plans would, in the absence of any other factors, impact 2005 net pension expense by approximately
$10 million.

Net
pension expense for our defined benefit pension plans in 2004 was $28 million, an increase of $10 million compared with 2003 arising mainly from lower discount rates
and increased longevity. We expect our net pension expense in 2005 will increase by approximately $25 million over 2004 reflecting a further fall in discount rates and a further increase in
longevity as well as higher amortization charges for losses arising in prior years.

Deferred tax

We recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the estimated future tax consequences of events attributable to differences between the financial statement
carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating and capital loss and tax credit carryforwards. We


estimate
deferred tax assets and liabilities and assess the need for any valuation allowances using enacted rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to be recovered or
settled taking into account our business plans and tax planning strategies.

At
December 31, 2004, the Company had gross deferred tax assets of $377 million (2003: $308 million) against which a valuation allowance of $123 million
(2003: $114 million) had been recognized. To the extent that the actual future taxable income in the periods during which the temporary differences are expected to reverse differs from current
projections, or assumed prudent and feasible tax planning strategies fail to materialize, or new tax planning strategies are developed, or material changes occur in actual tax rates or loss carry
forward time limits, the Company may adjust the deferred tax asset
considered realizable in future periods. Such adjustments could result in a significant increase or decrease in the effective tax rate and have a material impact on our net income, although management
does not believe that this is likely.

Commitments, contingencies and accrued liabilities

The Company has established provisions against various actual and potential claims, lawsuits and other proceedings relating principally to alleged errors and
omissions in connection with the placement of insurance and reinsurance in the ordinary course of business. Such provisions cover claims that have been reported but not paid and also claims that have
been incurred but not reported. These provisions are established based on advice received from qualified professionals, including external legal advisors, and are developed using actuarial principles
and assumptions, including historical claims experience. A significant increase in the frequency or severity of claims for errors and omissions could have a material effect on the Company's results of
operations.

As
a consequence of the increasing cost of purchasing professional indemnity insurance for errors and omissions claims, we raised our self-insured retentions in 2004 and
reduced the amount of coverage purchased from our insurers. Accordingly, our provisions for claims at December 31, 2004, including provisions for claims incurred but not reported, reflect the
higher level of risk being retained.

There
was no significant impact on our operating results in 2004 when compared to 2003 from all expenses associated with these issues (insurance premiums payable, claims paid and
insurance recoveries received, together with adjustments to provisions held).

ACCOUNTING CHANGES AND RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004)

Share-Based
Payment

("SFAS 123R"). SFAS 123R replaces SFAS 123 and supersedes Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25,

Accounting for
Stock Issued to Employees

("APB 25"). SFAS 123R requires that the cost resulting from all share-based payment transactions be recognized in the financial
statements at fair value and that excess tax benefits be reported as a financing cash inflow rather than as a reduction of taxes paid. SFAS 123R is effective for the Company from July 1,
2005.

SFAS 123R
permits public companies to account for share-based payments using one of two methods: modified-prospective method or modified-retrospective method. Under the
modified-prospective method, from the effective date, compensation cost is recognized based on the requirements of SFAS 123R for all new share-based awards and based on the requirements of
SFAS 123 for all awards granted prior to the effective date of SFAS 123R that remain unvested on the effective date.

The
requirements of the modified-retrospective method are as above, with the exception that companies are permitted to restate, based on the amounts previously recognized under
SFAS 123 for pro forma disclosure purposes, either all prior periods presented or prior interim periods in the year of adoption.


The
SFAS 123 pro forma disclosures given in Note 2 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements show the impact of the Company adopting SFAS 123R in prior
periods. The Company has not yet determined which transition method to use.

BUSINESS AND MARKET OVERVIEW

We provide a broad range of insurance brokerage and risk management consulting services to our worldwide clients. In our capacity as an advisor and insurance
broker, we act as an intermediary between our clients and insurance carriers by advising our clients on their risk management requirements, assisting clients to determine the best means of managing
risk, and negotiating and placing insurance risk with insurance carriers through our global distribution network.

We
generate revenue from commissions and fees on insurance placements and fees from consulting and other services. We also earn interest on premiums held before remittance to the insurer
and on claims held before payment to the insured.

The
majority of our revenue is commission based and varies based upon the premiums on the policies we place on behalf of our clients. As such, when premium rates in the insurance market
rise we tend to benefit and, when premium rates decline, we tend to experience pressure on our revenues, although in both cases there are many conflicting factors, including changes in buying and
selling behavior. We manage expenses to moderate the impact on earnings.

From
the late 1980s through late 2000, insurance premium rates generally trended downwards as a result of a number of factors. However, following several years of underwriting losses,
the declines in world equity markets and lower interest rates, many insurance carriers began to increase premium rates in 2000. The tragic events of September 11, 2001 acted as a catalyst,
especially in areas such as aerospace, and rates generally continued to rise through 2003.

During
2004, we have seen a rapid transition from a hard market, with premium rates stable or increasing, to a soft market, with premium rates falling in most markets. Premium rates had
a neutral impact on revenue growth in the first quarter 2004 but by the fourth quarter there was a negative 4 percent year on year impact. In the Property and Casualty market, rates have fallen
between 10 to 30 percent, falling sharply in the third quarter and continuing to fall in the fourth quarter. However, conditions were not uniform across all classes of business: in some areas
premium rates have stabilized and certain market segments may begin to see rate increases. Overall, we expect the soft market to continue in 2005.

OPERATING RESULTS

Revenues

2004 compared with 2003

During 2004, all our businesses reported growth in their 2004 revenues compared with 2003 despite the declining rate environment.

Our
International business earns revenues in currencies other than the US dollar. In 2004, reported revenues in our International division benefited significantly from the impact of
foreign currency translation, largely as a result of the euro strengthening against the dollar. This benefit was partly offset by the strength of the dollar relative to Latin American currencies
throughout 2004.

Net
acquisitions and disposals led to a 14 percent increase in International's 2004 revenues compared with the prior year. The increase was mainly attributable to the acquisition
of a controlling interest in Willis A/S, our Danish subsidiary, which was consolidated from January 1, 2004.


Organic
revenue growth in 2004 was 4 percent comprised of approximately 6 percent net new business growth partly offset by a 2 percent reduction due to declining
insurance premium rates. The following table sets out revenue growth by business.

Organic
revenue growth excludes the impact of foreign currency translation and acquisitions and disposals from reported revenues. We use organic growth as a measure of business growth
generated by operations that were part of the Group at the end of the period. Our method of calculating this measure may differ from that used by other companies and therefore comparability may be
limited.

(ii)

Following
a change to our reporting structure effective July 1, 2004, $72 million of revenues previously reported as North America for the year ended
December 31, 2003 have been reclassified as Global revenues.

Global:

Organic revenue growth in our Global business of 3 percent reflected good performances by most
business units despite noticeable downward pressure on premium rates. Global Markets grew by 5 percent reflecting new business activity particularly within the International and Financial and
Professional Risk operations. Global Specialties revenue grew marginally in 2004 with new business activity largely offset by the impact of falling rates and lower volume and profit-based contingent
commissions. Reinsurance revenues grew in 2004 due to a strong new business performance, particularly from the US reinsurance unit. Premium rates were a negative factor on reinsurance revenues from
the second quarter of 2004 and for full year 2004 had an adverse impact of 3 percent when compared with 2003. In addition, reinsurance brokerage was adversely affected by increased self-
insurance by clients.

North America:

Organic revenue growth in our North America business was 3 percent in 2004 despite the elimination of
volume and profit-based contingent commissions in the fourth quarter and a softening insurance market place. As we moved through 2004, declining premium rates had an increasingly negative effect.

In
2004, revenues included $27 million of volume and profit-based contingent commissions. Due to the abolition of these commissions in October 2004, there were no volume
and profit-based contingent commissions in the fourth quarter 2004. In 2003, revenues included $30 million of volume and profit-based contingent commissions of which $10 million was
recognized in the fourth quarter.

International:

Organic revenue growth in our International business of 9 percent in 2004 was driven by good
performances in Europe, notably the Netherlands and Iberia, Asia and Latin America. There was a modest negative impact from premium rates on average, although the effect varied by country and by line
of business.

2003 compared with 2002

Total revenues increased by 20 percent to $2,076 million in 2003. Reported revenues included a 6 percent benefit due to the impact of foreign
currency translation largely due to the strengthening of both the euro and sterling against the dollar.

Net
acquisitions and disposals, mainly reflecting the disposal of third-party administration units in North America in 2002, had a small negative impact on revenue growth.


We
estimate that organic revenue growth of 15 percent in 2003 comprised approximately 12 percent due to net new business growth and approximately 3 percent from the
impact of higher premium rates.

Global:

All business units, contributed to organic revenue growth of 17 percent, and continued to work
closely with North America and International business units to leverage UK-based capabilities and resources throughout the distribution network.

North America:

Organic revenue growth of 13 percent in 2003 was mainly attributable to solid contributions from our
middle market, large account and specialty practices (notably executive risk, employee benefits and construction) through new business development and recruitment.

International:

Organic revenue growth of 15 percent in 2003 was led by good performances in Continental Europe,
notably Italy and Iberia, Latin America, Australia and South Africa. Many new business wins were the result of teamwork with Global Markets and Global Specialties.

2004 compared with 2003

General and administrative expenses, including non-cash compensation charges, at $1,573 million in 2004 were $145 million or
10 percent higher than in 2003.

The
non-cash compensation charge for performance-based stock options in 2004 was $11 million. As of December 31, 2004, we have recognized 100 percent of
the $270 million non-cash compensation charge for performance-based stock options granted to management as part of the 1998 leveraged buy-out arrangement for meeting or
exceeding 2001 and 2002 targets.


Excluding
non-cash compensation charges for performance-based stock options, there was an underlying increase of $154 million, or 11 percent, of which
2 percent was attributable to foreign currency translation and 4 percent to acquisitions and disposals.

Salaries
and benefits, excluding non-cash compensation charges for performance-based stock options, were 52 percent of revenues in 2004 compared to 50 percent
of revenues in 2003, reflecting increased expenditure on recruitment and retention of staff. We have been recruiting steadily over the last three years as the Company has grown and we continue to
build the sales culture. The pace of this recruitment accelerated in the fourth quarter and at December 31, 2004 the number of revenue earning staff was 5 percent higher than a year ago.
In 2005, the ratio of salary and benefits to revenues may increase slightly, depending in particular on our chosen rate of hiring new staff.

Other
expenses included some $10 million of incremental legal, investigative and other costs incurred in fourth quarter 2004 primarily relating to the New York Attorney General's
investigation. We expect this, and other compliance expenditure such as Sarbanes-Oxley, to continue into 2005 but at a lower level.

2003 compared with 2002

General and administrative expenses were $1,428 million in 2003 compared with $1,294 million in 2002.

Non-cash
compensation charges for performance-based stock options were $20 million in 2003 compared with $80 million in 2002. These performance-based stock
options are accounted for under the variable plan method with the charges based on the difference between the price of our stock at the end of the performance period, December 31, 2002, and the
exercise price spread in accordance with the vesting schedule. The higher charge in 2002 reflected both an increase in the total estimated charge as a result of increases in our stock price up to the
end of the performance period and a higher number of unvested options outstanding during 2002 than during 2003.

Excluding
the non-cash compensation charge for performance-based stock options, general and administrative expenses were 16 percent higher in 2003 than in 2002.
Approximately 6 percent of this increase was attributable to the impact of foreign currency translation and approximately (3) percent was attributable to the effect of acquisitions and
disposals.

Excluding
the impact of foreign currency translation and acquisitions and disposals, general and administrative expenses grew by 13 percent in 2003 compared with 2002. Most of
this increase was attributable to salaries and benefits, including incentive-based compensation, and reflects the increased number of employees. Salaries and benefits, including incentive-based
compensation, amounted to 50 percent of revenues in 2003, the same proportion as in 2002.

We
earn revenue in an uneven fashion during the year, primarily due to the timing of insurance policy renewals. As many policies incept and renew as of December 31 or
January 1, we generate the majority of our revenues in the first and fourth calendar quarters. General and administrative expenses, however, are incurred on a relatively even basis throughout
the year. As a result, we have historically earned the majority of our operating income in the first and fourth quarters. Operating income in 2004 was $234 million, $153 million,
$109 million and $170 million for the first, second, third and fourth


quarters,
respectively. Volume and profit-based contingent commissions contributed $21 million, $15 million, $10 million and $25 million respectively to operating income by
quarter.

Operating
margin, or operating income as a percentage of revenues, was 29.3 percent in 2004 compared with 29.9 percent in 2003 and 24.1 percent in 2002. An
$80 million non-cash compensation charge for performance-based stock options significantly impacted operating margin in 2002. Excluding non-cash compensation charges and
the net impact of acquisitions and disposals from all years, operating margin was 29.3 percent in 2004, 30.3 percent in 2003 and 28.0 percent in 2002. The decrease in 2004
compared with 2003 reflects the increase in recruitment and retention costs and higher legal, regulatory and compliance expenses.

Premium on redemption of subordinated notes

In February 2004, we paid a call premium of $17 million on the early redemption of all $370 million of our 9% senior subordinated notes.

Interest expense

Interest expense in 2004 was $22 million, significantly lower than in 2003, $53 million, and 2002, $65 million. This decrease reflects the
benefit of lower average levels of debt, together with lower interest rates on our new credit facilities.

Income tax expense for 2004 amounted to $208 million, an effective rate of 33 percent. The effects on taxation of the amortization
of intangible assets, disposals of operations and performance-based stock options had a net neutral impact on the 2004 tax rate.

Income
tax expense for 2003 amounted to $159 million, an effective rate of 28 percent. In the third quarter of 2003, certain changes to UK tax legislation were enacted
regarding the taxation of employee stock options. With effect from July 1, 2003 we obtain a corporate tax deduction equal to the market price of our shares on the date of exercise less the
option exercise price paid by the employee. Non-cash compensation amounting to $116 million in respect of UK performance options had been expensed in periods prior to
January 1, 2003 without any income tax benefit being recognized. Accordingly, following the change in UK tax legislation, a one-time income tax benefit of $35 million, and a
corresponding deferred asset, was recognized in 2003.

Adjusting
for the one-time income tax benefit arising from the change in UK tax legislation, that part of the non-cash performance option charge which is not tax
deductible and the net gain on disposal of operations, the underlying tax rate for 2003 was 34 percent.

Income
tax expense for 2002 amounted to $141 million, an effective rate of 40 percent. Adjusting for the non-cash compensation charge for performance options,
for which approximately 60 percent of the total charge was non-deductible, and acquisitions and disposals, the underlying tax rate for 2002 was 35 percent.

Net

premium paid on the early redemption of the 9% senior subordinated notes ($10 million net of tax), while 2003 benefited from a one-time tax benefit of $35 million following a
change to UK tax legislation regarding the taxation of employee stock options.

Excluding
these items, net income increased by 13 percent to $437 million in 2004 ($2.60 per diluted share) and by 43 percent to $386 million in 2003 ($2.28
per diluted share) from $270 million in 2002 ($1.62 per diluted share). There was no impact of foreign currency translation on earnings in 2004 compared with 2003 and an approximate $0.07 per
share benefit to 2003 earnings compared with 2002.

The
average number of diluted shares outstanding for the year was 168 million as calculated under the treasury stock method.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

On February 2, 2004, we redeemed all the $370 million then outstanding of our 9% senior subordinated notes. To finance the repayment, we drew down
$300 million of bank loans under our senior credit facility with the remaining balance of $70 million and call premium of $17 million being financed using cash from operations. On
June 1, 2004, we drew down the remaining $150 million of bank loans in accordance with our credit facility arrangements.

During
2004, we began a program of share buybacks. Total repurchases under the program at December 31, 2004 were 9.3 million shares of common stock at a cost of
$339 million out of the Company's authorization limit of $500 million. Buyback activity in fourth quarter 2004 was modest at 0.3 million shares for $12 million.

Operating activities

As an intermediary, we hold funds generally in a fiduciary capacity for the account of third parties, typically as the result of premiums received from clients
that are in transit to insurers and claims due to clients that are in transit from insurers. We report premiums, which are held on account of, or due from, clients as assets with a corresponding
liability due to the insurers. Claims held by, or due to, us which are due to clients are also shown as both assets and liabilities. All these balances due or payable are included in accounts
receivable and accounts payable on the balance sheet. We earn interest on these funds during the time between the receipt of the cash and the time the cash is paid out. Fiduciary cash must be kept in
certain regulated bank accounts subject to guidelines, which generally emphasize capital preservation and liquidity, and is not generally available to service our debt or for other corporate purposes.

We
became subject to new regulations in the United Kingdom in January 2005 regarding fiduciary funds held by insurance intermediaries. These regulations require fiduciary funds to
be held in designated trust accounts, restrict the financial instruments in which such funds may be invested and affect the timing of transferring commissions from fiduciary funds to own funds.

The
new regulations change the basis for the withdrawal of commissions from fiduciary funds from an earned to a receipts basis with a consequential increase in the balances held in
fiduciary funds. As a


result,
on January 15, 2005, the date the new regulations came into force in the United Kingdom, fiduciary funds were increased by $134 million with a corresponding decrease in own
funds. On a full-year basis, we do not expect these regulations to have any further significant impact on the cash flow from operating activities.

Net
cash provided by operations, which excludes fiduciary cash movements, was $490 million in 2004, having increased to $493 million in 2003 from $343 million in
2002. Net cash provided by operations was flat in 2004 compared with 2003 reflecting the impact of recruitment and retention strategies employed by the group at the end of 2004 and higher expenses
related to legal, investigative and regulatory compliance. The increase in 2003 compared with 2002 was due mainly to increasing revenue and widening operating margins over that period.

Net
cash in 2005 will be adversely impacted by the abolition of volume and profit-based contingent commissions. However, we expect to mitigate this impact by the steps we are taking to
grow our market share and by continuing to control expenses tightly.

Investing activities

Total net cash used in investing activities increased to $183 million in 2004 from $135 million in 2003 and $50 million in 2002.

We
stepped up the pace of acquisitions in 2004 as part of our growth strategy to secure leadership positions in key markets and strengthen our middle and large market capabilities. We
used $147 million (net of cash acquired) primarily for the acquisitions of: Coyle Hamilton, the Republic of Ireland's largest privately owned insurance broker; the controlling interest in
Willis A/S, Denmark's largest insurance broker; two reinsurance brokers in Italy and Denmark; and Opus, a regional insurance broking business in the United Kingdom.

Cash
used for acquisitions in 2003 amounted to $91 million (net of cash acquired), primarily incurred in acquiring further interests in Willis GmbH, Willis Iberia and Willis
Italia as we continued our policy of acquiring controlling interests in most major associate companies and other remaining minority interests. Cash used for acquisitions in 2002 amounted to
$13 million (net of cash acquired), primarily incurred in acquiring Richard N. Goldman and further interests in Willis GmbH.

We
have historically funded acquisitions with cash or a combination of cash and equity. Depending on the acquisition and the economics of the transaction, we would expect this pattern to
continue.

Capital
expenditures for 2004, 2003 and 2002 were $49 million, $57 million and $47 million, respectively. We have funded our requirements for capital expenditures by
cash generated internally from operations and expect to continue to do so in the future.

Financing activities

Cash used in financing activities amounted to $333 million in 2004 compared with $222 million in 2003 and $218 million in 2002. In
December 2003, we replaced our existing senior credit facilities with a new $600 million facility, consisting of a $450 million amortizing five-year term loan and a
$150 million revolving credit facility. These new facilities are unsecured. Both the term loan and the revolving credit facility now bear interest at a rate of LIBOR plus 85 basis points
(reduced from 95 basis points prior to December 4, 2004), subject to adjustment based on future changes in interest coverage, leverage and credit ratings. On June 4, 2004, the Company
entered into a series of interest swap agreements in order to fix our interest payment obligations until 2006.

On
February 2, 2004, we redeemed all the $370 million then outstanding of 9% senior subordinated notes. To finance the repayment, we drew down $300 million of our
new term loan facility with the remaining balance of $70 million and call premium of $17 million being financed using cash from operations.


During
2003, debt repayments amounted to $198 million following repayments of $221 million in 2002.

During
2004, we began a program of share buybacks, repurchasing and subsequently canceling 9,288,100 shares of common stock at a cost of $339 million. On September 8, 2004,
the Board of Directors approved an increase in the authorization limit of the program to $500 million.

In
February 2003, we declared an initial quarterly cash dividend of $0.125 per share; this was increased in July 2003 by 30 percent to $0.1625 per share, an annual
rate of $0.65 per share. The cash dividends paid during 2003 amounted to $63 million. The quarterly cash dividend was increased in February 2004 by a further 15 percent to $0.1875
per share, an annual rate of $0.75 per share. The cash dividends paid during 2004 amounted to $115 million. In February 2005, the quarterly cash dividend was increased by a further
15 percent to $0.215 per share, an annual rate of $0.86 per share. At this rate, the expected annual cost of dividends payable in 2005 will be approximately $138 million. We have funded
dividends from cash generated internally by operations and expect to continue to do so in the future.

As
of December 31, 2004, we had cash and cash equivalents of $351 million, down from $364 million at December 31, 2003. We expect that internally generated
funds will be sufficient to meet our foreseeable operating cash requirements, capital expenditures and dividend payments. In addition we have an undrawn $150 million revolving credit facility.

Under the terms of the senior credit facility, $150 million of the term loans mature in each of December 2006, December 2007
and December 2008.

In
November 2004, we entered into a 25 year agreement with British Land plc relating to our new UK headquarters in London. Construction is scheduled to commence in early
2005 and our occupancy is targeted for late 2007. Our contractual obligations in relation to this commitment totalling $893 million are included in the table above, but are contingent upon the
successful completion of construction.

In
connection with many of our investments in less than wholly-owned subsidiaries and associates, we retain rights to increase our ownership percentage over time, typically to a majority
or 100 percent ownership position. In addition, in certain instances, the other owners have a right, typically at a price calculated pursuant to a formula based on revenues or earnings, to put
some or all of their shares to us.

As
part of our acquisition of 33 percent of Gras Savoye, we entered into a put arrangement, whereby the other shareholders in Gras Savoye (primarily two families, two insurance
companies and Gras Savoye's executive management team) could put their shares to us. Until 2011, we will be


obligated
to buy the shares of certain shareholders to the extent those shareholders put their shares, potentially increasing our ownership from 33 percent to 90 percent if all
shareholders put their shares, at a price determined by a contractual formula based on earnings and revenue. Management shareholders of Gras Savoye (representing approximately 10 percent of
shares) do not have general put rights before 2011, but have certain put rights on their death, disability or retirement from which payments, at December 31, 2004 based on the formula would not
have exceeded $65 million. During 2005, the incremental 57 percent of Gras Savoye may be put to us at a price equal to the greater of approximately 800 million French francs
($166 million at December 31, 2004 exchange rates), or a price based on the formula, which at December 31, 2004 amounted to approximately $368 million. From 2006, the put
price is determined solely by the formula. The shareholders may put their shares individually at any time during the put period.

While
neither we nor the management of Gras Savoye expect significant exercises of the puts, on a separate or aggregate basis, in the near to medium term, we nevertheless believe that,
should the aggregate amount of shares be put to us, sufficient funds would be available to satisfy this obligation. In addition, we have a call option to move to majority ownership under certain
circumstances and in any event by 2009. Upon exercising this call option, the remaining Gras Savoye shareholders have a put option.

Off-balance sheet transactions

Apart from commitments, guarantees and contingencies, as disclosed in Note 14 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company has no
off-balance sheet arrangements that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a material effect on the Company's financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.

Item 7A—Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk

Financial Risk Management

We are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. In order to manage the risk arising from these exposures, we
enter into a variety of interest rate and foreign currency derivatives. We do not hold derivative or financial instruments for trading purposes.

A
discussion of our accounting policies for financial and derivative instruments is included in Note 2 of the consolidated financial statements and further disclosure is provided
in Note 11 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Foreign exchange risk management

We conduct our business in over 100 currencies. Accordingly, movements in currency exchange rates may affect our results.

We
report our operating results and financial condition in US dollars. Our US operations earn revenue and incur expenses primarily in US dollars. In the United Kingdom, however, we earn
revenue in a number of different currencies, but expenses are almost entirely incurred in pounds sterling. Outside the United States and the United Kingdom, we predominantly generate revenue and
expenses in the local currency. The table below gives an approximate analysis of revenues and expenses by currency in 2004.

Our
operations are exposed to foreign exchange risk arising from cash flows and financial instruments that are denominated in currencies other than the US dollar. Our primary foreign
exchange risk arises from changes in the exchange rates between US dollars and pounds sterling. Our objective is to maximize our cash flow in US dollars. Our policy is to convert into pounds sterling
all revenue arising in currencies other than US dollars together with sufficient US dollar revenues to fund the remaining pound sterling expenses. Outside the United Kingdom only those cash flows
necessary to fund mismatches between revenues and expenses are converted into local currency; amounts remitted to the United Kingdom are generally converted into pounds sterling. These transactional
currency exposures are generally managed by entering into forward exchange contracts. It is our policy to hedge at least 25 percent of the next 12 months' exposure in significant
currencies. We do not generally hedge exposures beyond three years.

The
table below provides information about our foreign currency forward exchange contracts, which are sensitive to exchange rate risk. The table summarizes the US dollar equivalent
amounts of each currency bought and sold forward and the weighted average contractual exchange rates. All forward exchange contracts mature within three years.

the difference between the contract amount and the cash flow in US dollars which would have been receivable had the foreign currency forward exchange contracts been entered
into on December 31, 2004 or 2003 at the forward exchange rates prevailing at that date.

Interest rate risk management

We are subject to market risk from exposure to changes in interest rates based on our financing and investing activities. Our primary interest rate risk arises
from changes in short-term interest rates in both US dollars and pounds sterling.


Our
operations are financed principally by variable rate bank borrowings issued by a subsidiary. This debt amortises evenly over three years beginning December 4, 2006. Our policy
is to minimise our exposure to increases in the interest rates on our variable rate borrowings. Accordingly, our exposure to rising interest rates is fully hedged up to the time of the first debt
amortisation.

As
a consequence of our insurance and reinsurance broking activities, there is a delay between the time we receive cash for premiums and claims and the time the cash needs to be paid. We
earn interest on
this float, which is included in our consolidated financial statements as interest income. This float is regulated in terms of access and the instruments in which it may be invested, most of which are
short-term in maturity. We manage the interest rate risk arising from this exposure primarily through the use of interest rate swaps. It is our policy that, for currencies with significant
balances, a minimum of 25 percent of forecast income arising is hedged for each of the next three years.

The
table below provides information about our derivative instruments and other financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest. For interest rate swaps, the table
presents notional principal amounts and average interest rates analyzed by expected maturity dates. Notional principal amounts are used to calculate the contractual payments to be exchanged under the
contracts. The duration of interest rate swaps varies between one and four years, with an average re-fixing period of three months. Average fixed and variable rates are, respectively, the
weighted-average actual and market rates for the interest hedges in place. Market rates are the rates prevailing at December 31, 2004 or 2003, as appropriate.

WILLIS GROUP HOLDINGS LIMITED

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To
the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Willis Group Holdings Limited, Hamilton, Bermuda

We
have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Willis Group Holdings Limited and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2004 and 2003, and the related consolidated
statements of operations, stockholders' equity, comprehensive income and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2004. Our audits also included the financial
statement schedule listed in the index at Item 15. These financial statements and financial statement schedule are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.

We
conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An
audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In
our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Willis Group Holdings Limited and subsidiaries as of
December 31, 2004 and 2003, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2004, in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also, in our opinion, such financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial statements taken
as a whole, presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein.

We
have also audited in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial
reporting as of December 31, 2004, based on the criteria established in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee
of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated March 8, 2005 expressed an unqualified opinion on management's assessment of the effectiveness of the Company's
internal control over financial reporting and an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting.

WILLIS GROUP HOLDINGS LIMITED

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM ON

INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Willis Group Holdings Limited, Hamilton, Bermuda

We
have audited management's assessment, included in the accompanying Management Report on Internal Controls, that Willis Group Holdings Limited and its subsidiaries (collectively, the
"Company") maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2004, based on the criteria established in

Internal
Control—Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. The Company's management is responsible for maintaining
effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on
management's assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We
conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control
over financial reporting, evaluating management's assessment, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing such other procedures as we considered
necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinions.

A
company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the company's principal executive and principal financial officers, or
persons performing similar functions, and effected by the company's board of directors, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting
and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those
policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company;
(2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that
receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding
prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because
of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material
misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to
future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In
our opinion, management's assessment that the Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2004, is fairly stated, in all material
respects, based on the criteria established in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of
the Treadway Commission. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2004, based on the
criteria established in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission.


We
have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated financial statements and financial statement
schedules as of and for the year ended December 31, 2004 of the Company and our report dated March 8, 2005 expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements and financial
statement schedule.

WILLIS GROUP HOLDINGS LIMITED

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1.     THE COMPANY AND ITS OPERATIONS

Business

—Willis Group Holdings Limited ("Willis Group Holdings") and subsidiaries (collectively, the
"Company") provide a broad range of value-added risk management consulting and insurance brokerage services, both directly and indirectly through its associates, to a diverse base of clients
internationally. The Company provides specialized risk management advisory and other services on a global basis to clients in various industries, including aerospace, marine, energy and construction
industries. In its capacity as an advisor and insurance broker, the Company acts as an intermediary between clients and insurance carriers by advising clients on risk management requirements, helping
clients determine the best means of managing risk, and negotiating and placing insurance risk with insurance carriers through the Company's global distribution network. The Company also provides other
value-added services.

2.     BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

A summary of the major accounting policies followed in the preparation of the accompanying consolidated financial statements, which conform to accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("US GAAP"), is presented below.

Principles of Consolidation

—The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Willis Group Holdings
and its subsidiaries, all of which are controlled through the ownership of a majority voting interest. Intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated on consolidation.

Foreign Currency Translation

—Transactions in currencies other than the functional currency of the entity are recorded at the
rates of exchange prevailing at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities in currencies other than the functional currency are translated at the rates of exchange prevailing at the
balance sheet date and the related transaction gains and losses are reported in the statements of operations. Certain intercompany loans are determined to be of a long-term investment
nature. The Company records transaction gains and losses from remeasuring such loans as a component of other comprehensive income.

Upon
consolidation, the results of operations of subsidiaries and associates whose functional currency is other than the US dollar are translated into US dollars at the average exchange
rate and assets and liabilities are translated at year-end exchange rates. Translation adjustments are presented as a separate component of other comprehensive income in the financial
statements and are included in net income only upon sale or liquidation of the underlying foreign subsidiary or associated company.

Use of Estimates

—The preparation of financial statements in conformity with US GAAP requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities as of the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of
revenues and expenses during the year. In the preparation of these consolidated financial statements, estimates and assumptions have been made by management concerning the selection of useful lives of
fixed assets and intangible assets, provisions necessary for trade receivables and liabilities, the carrying value of investments, income tax valuation allowances and other similar evaluations. Actual
results could differ from those estimates.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

—Cash and cash equivalents primarily consist of time deposits and certificates of deposit with
original maturities of three months or less.


Fiduciary Funds—Restricted

—Fiduciary funds-restricted represent unremitted premiums received from insureds and
unremitted claims received from insurers. Fiduciary funds are generally required to be kept in certain regulated bank accounts subject to guidelines which emphasize capital preservation and liquidity;
such funds are not available to service the Company's debt or for other corporate purposes. Notwithstanding the legal relationships with clients and insurers, the Company is entitled to retain
interest income earned on fiduciary funds in accordance with industry custom and practice and, in some cases, as supported by agreements with insureds.

Included
in fiduciary funds-restricted are cash and cash equivalents, time deposits, certificates of deposit and debt securities. These securities are classified as
available-for-sale, and as such are carried at fair market value, with
unrealized gains and losses reported in other comprehensive income. Realized gains and losses on investments sold are included in net income and are derived using the specific identification method
for determining the cost of securities.

Short-Term Investments

—The Company classifies all short-term investments as
available-for-sale in accordance with the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standard ("SFAS") No. 115,

Accounting for Certain
Investments in Debt and Equity Securities

. These securities are carried at fair market value, with unrealized gains and losses reported in other comprehensive income. Realized
gains and losses on investments sold are included in net income and are derived using the specific identification method for determining the cost of securities.

Accounts Receivable and Accounts Payable

—In its capacity as an insurance agent or broker, the Company collects premiums from
insureds and, after deducting its commissions, remits the premiums to the respective insurers; the Company also collects claims or refunds from insurers on behalf of insureds. Unremitted insurance
premiums and claims are held in a fiduciary capacity. The obligation to remit these funds is recorded as accounts payable on the Company's consolidated balance sheets. The period for which the Company
holds such funds is dependent upon the date the insured remits the payment of the premium to the Company and the date the Company is required to forward such payment to the insurer. Balances arising
from insurance brokerage transactions are reported as separate assets or liabilities unless such balances are due to or from the same party and a right of offset exists, in which case the balances are
recorded net.

Accounts
receivable are stated at estimated net realizable values. Allowances are recorded, when necessary, in an amount considered by management to be sufficient to meet probable future
losses related to uncollectible accounts. The write-off of accounts receivable was $5 million, $2 million and $2 million in the years ended December 31, 2004,
2003 and 2002, respectively.

Fixed Assets

—Fixed assets are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Expenditures for improvements are capitalized;
repairs and maintenance are charged to expenses as incurred. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method based on the estimated useful lives of assets.

Depreciation
on buildings and long leaseholds is calculated over 50 years. Depreciation on leasehold improvements is calculated over the lesser of the useful life of the assets or
the lease term. Depreciation on furniture and equipment is calculated based on a range of 3 to 25 years.


The
components of fixed assets are as follows:

Recoverability of Fixed Assets

—In accordance with SFAS No. 144,

Accounting for the Impairment or
Disposal of Long-Lived Assets

, long-lived assets and certain identifiable intangible assets
held and used by a company are required to be reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. In performing
the review for recoverability, the Company estimates the future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition. If the undiscounted future cash flow is less than
the carrying amount of the asset, the asset is deemed impaired. The amount of the impairment is measured as the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the asset. Generally,
long-lived assets and certain identifiable intangible assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell.

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

—Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of businesses acquired over the fair market
value of identifiable net assets at the dates of acquisition. The Company reviews goodwill for impairment annually and whenever facts or circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be
recoverable. As part of the evaluation the estimated future undiscounted cash flows associated with the underlying business operation are compared to the carrying amount of goodwill to determine if a
write-down is required. If such an assessment indicates that the undiscounted future cash flows will not be recovered, the carrying amount is reduced to the estimated fair value. Acquired
intangible assets are being amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful life.

Investments in Associates

—Investments in entities less than 50% owned in which the Company has the ability to exercise
significant influence are accounted for by the equity method of accounting whereby the investment is carried at cost of acquisition, plus the Company's equity in undistributed net income since
acquisition, less dividends received. Investments in entities less than 20% owned are accounted for by the cost method. Such investments are not publicly traded. The Company periodically reviews its
investments in associates for which fair value is less than cost to determine if the decline in value is other than temporary. If the decline in value is judged to be other than temporary, the cost
basis of the investment is written down to fair value. The amount of any write-down is included in the statement of operations as a realized loss.

Put and Call Options Relating to Subsidiaries and Associates

—

For certain subsidiaries and associates,
the Company has the right to purchase shares (a call option) from co-shareholders at various dates in the future. In addition, the co-shareholders of certain subsidiaries and
associates have the right to sell their shares (a put option) to the Company at various dates in the future. Generally, the exercise price


of
such puts and calls is formula-based (using revenues and earnings) and is designed to reflect fair value. On inception of an option agreement, the Company records the puts and calls at fair value.
The put and call options are subsequently marked to market at each reporting period with changes in value being recognized in the statements of operations.

Derivative Financial Instruments

—The Company uses derivative financial instruments for other than trading purposes to alter
the risk profile of an existing underlying exposure. Interest rate swaps are used to manage interest risk exposures. Forward foreign currency exchange contracts are used to manage currency exposures
arising from future income. The fair values of derivative contracts are recorded in other assets and other liabilities with changes in fair value of derivatives that qualify for hedge accounting
recorded in other comprehensive income and changes in fair value of derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting recorded in general and administrative expenses. Amounts are reclassified from
other comprehensive income into earnings when the hedged exposure affects earnings.

Income Taxes

—The Company accounts for income taxes under the provisions of SFAS No. 109,

Accounting for Income Taxes

("SFAS 109"). SFAS 109
requires recognition of deferred tax assets
and liabilities for the estimated future tax consequences of events attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective
tax bases and operating and capital loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected
to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of changes in tax rates is recognized in the statement of operations in the period in which the enactment date changes.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are reduced through the establishment of a valuation allowance at such time as, based on available evidence, it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets
will not be realized.

Pensions

—The Company accounts for pension expense in accordance with SFAS No. 87,

Employers'
Accounting for Pensions

. Pension information is presented in accordance with SFAS No. 132 (Revised 2003),

Employers' Disclosures About Pensions
and Other Post Retirement Benefits

.

Stock-Based Compensation

—The Company accounts for its stock option and stock-based compensation plans using the
intrinsic-value method prescribed in Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25,

Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees

("APB 25").
Accordingly, the Company computes compensation costs for each employee stock option granted as the amount by which the quoted market price (or estimated fair value for options granted before the
initial public offering) of the Company's shares on the date of the grant exceeds the amount the employee must pay to acquire the shares.

Had
compensation expense for such plans been determined consistent with the fair value method prescribed by SFAS 123,

Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation

("SFAS 123") using the


Black-Scholes
option-pricing model, the Company's pro forma net income and net income per share would have been:

Revenue Recognition

—Revenue includes insurance commissions, fees for services
rendered, certain commissions receivable from insurance carriers and interest income.

The
Company takes credit for commissions (or fees negotiated in lieu of commission) in respect of insurance placements at the date when the insured is billed or at the inception date of
the policy, whichever is later. Commissions on additional premiums and adjustments are recognized as and when advised. Fees for risk management and other services are recognized as the services are
provided. Negotiated fee arrangements for an agreed period covering multiple insurance placements, the provision of risk management and/or other services are determined, contract by contract, on the
basis of the relative fair value of the services completed and the services yet to be rendered. The Company establishes contract cancellation reserves where appropriate. At December 31, 2004,
2003 and 2002, such amounts were not material.

In
October 2004, the Company announced that it was abolishing volume and profit-based contingent commissions by the end of December 2004. Such commissions were recognized at the earlier
of the date when cash was received, or when formal, written notification of the actual amount due was received from the insurance carrier. If some of the commissions received were potentially subject
to full or partial repayment to the carrier, then recognition was deferred until the conditions for repayment had passed.

Interest
income is recognized as earned.


Accounting Changes and Recent Accounting Pronouncements

—In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
issued SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004),

Share-Based Payment

("SFAS 123R"). SFAS 123R replaces SFAS 123 and supersedes APB 25.
SFAS 123R requires that the cost resulting from all share-based payment transactions be recognized in the financial statements at fair value and that excess tax benefits be reported as a
financing cash inflow rather than as a reduction of taxes paid. SFAS 123R is effective for the Company from July 1, 2005.

SFAS 123R
permits public companies to account for share-based payments using one of two methods: modified-prospective method or modified-retrospective method. Under the
modified-prospective method, from the effective date, compensation cost is recognized based on the requirements of SFAS 123R for all new share-based awards and based on the requirements of
SFAS 123 for all awards granted prior to the effective date of SFAS 123R that remain unvested on the effective date.

The
requirements of the modified-retrospective method are as above, with the exception that companies are permitted to restate, based on the amounts previously recognized under
SFAS 123 for pro forma disclosure purposes, either all prior periods presented or prior interim periods in the year of adoption.

The
SFAS 123 pro forma disclosures given in Note 2 show the impact of the Company adopting SFAS 123R in prior periods. The Company has not yet determined which
transition method to use.

3.     ACQUISITIONS AND DISPOSITIONS

Acquisitions

—During 2004, the Company acquired the following 9 entities for $192 million, which
includes the cost of issuing 1.1 million shares with a fair value at the date of issuance of $40 million:

•

Ital
Re S.p.A, based in Rome and Milan, Italy, a major reinsurance broker;

•

Kirecon
A/S, based in Copenhagen, Denmark, a leading Danish reinsurance broker;

•

Willis
A/S, based in Copenhagen, Denmark, being Denmark's largest insurance broker;

•

Herzfeld &
Levy S.A., an insurance broker, headquartered in Buenos Aires, Argentina;

•

Coyle
Hamilton Holdings Limited, the Republic of Ireland's largest privately owned insurance broker;

•

C.H.
Jeffries (Insurance Brokers) Limited, a privately owned insurance broker based in the United Kingdom;

•

The
Grande Insurance Brokers Limited, Hong-Kong based general insurance broker serving middle market corporate clients, particularly in the financial and
professional risk sectors;

•

Maisterenna
Asesores, a general insurance broker based in Monterrey, Mexico; and

•

Opus
Holdings Limited, a regional insurance broking business in the United Kingdom.

The
Company also acquired additional interests in several of its existing subsidiaries for $12 million, including $5 million for the issuance of 0.2 million shares.

Deferred
payments relating to prior year acquisitions totaled $19 million including $3 million for the issue of 0.1 million shares.


During
2003 and 2002, the Company acquired or increased its investments in a number of other businesses. The aggregate purchase price of all acquisitions completed in 2003 and 2002
approximated $94 million and $32 million respectively, inclusive of deferred payments amounting to $4 million and shares of $12 million in 2003 and deferred payments
amounting to $9 million in 2002.

All
of these transactions were recorded using the purchase method of accounting. Accordingly, the results of the acquired businesses and the Company's increased share of the
undistributed net income of associates have been included in the Company's consolidated results from their respective acquisition dates. The assets and liabilities assumed were recorded at estimated
fair values. Pro forma results from these acquisitions would not have been materially different from the amounts reported.

Goodwill
and other intangible assets recognized on these transactions amounted to $212 million (2003: $87 million) of which $3 million (2003: $27 million) is
expected to be deductible for tax purposes. Additional consideration of up to $40 million (2003: $11 million) is payable in future periods contingent on the results of the acquired businesses
reaching specified thresholds.

Dispositions

—Total proceeds relating to 2004 dispositions of subsidiaries and associates amounted to $10 million,
inclusive of deferred proceeds amounting to $2 million, with a gain of $11 million recorded in the consolidated statement of operations.

Total
proceeds relating to 2003 dispositions of subsidiaries and associates amounted to $16 million, inclusive of deferred proceeds amounting to $2 million, with a gain of
$11 million recorded in the consolidated statement of operations.

In
2002, the Company completed the sale of its Life and Health third-party administration business. The gain on disposal of $14 million included a goodwill write off of
$3 million and has been recorded in the statement of operations. Total proceeds relating to other disposals in 2002 were not material.

In
2003, certain changes to UK tax legislation were enacted regarding the taxation of employee stock options. When UK-based employees exercise their stock
options, the Company now obtains a corporate tax deduction equal to the market price of the Company's shares on the date of exercise less the option exercise price paid by the employee.

Non-cash
compensation amounting to $116 million in respect of UK performance options was expensed in periods prior to January 1, 2003 without any income tax benefit being
recognized. Accordingly, following the change in UK tax legislation, an income tax benefit of $35 million, and a corresponding deferred asset, was recognized in 2003.


Under current Bermuda law, the Company is not required to pay any taxes in Bermuda on its income, profits or capital gains. The following table
reconciles the income tax expense in these financial statements to that which would be expected at the US federal statutory income tax rate:

At December 31, 2004, the Company had a valuation allowance of $123 million (2003: $114 million) to reduce its deferred tax
assets to estimated realizable value. The valuation allowance relates to the deferred tax assets arising from UK tax operating loss carryforwards and UK capital loss carryforwards, both of which have
no expiration date. UK tax operating loss carryforwards can only be used against
income arising in certain UK subsidiaries. In addition, the capital loss carryforwards can only be offset against future UK capital gains.

At
December 31, 2004, the Company had deferred tax assets of $254 million (2003: $194 million), net of the valuation allowance. Management believes, based upon the
level of historical taxable income and projections for future taxable income over the periods in which the temporary differences are anticipated to reverse, and prudent and feasible
tax-planning strategies, it is more likely than not that the Company will realize the benefits of these deductible differences, net of the valuation allowance. However, the amount of the
deferred tax asset considered realizable could be adjusted in the future if estimates of taxable income are revised. In the event that the valuation allowance of $123 million at
December 31, 2004 (2003: $114 million) is reduced in future years to recognize deferred tax assets, an amount of up to $87 million (2003: $81 million) will be allocated to
reduce goodwill.


The
Company recognizes a deferred tax liability related to the undistributed earnings of subsidiaries when the Company expects that it will recover those undistributed earnings in a
taxable manner, such as through receipt of dividends or sale of the investments. The Company does not, however, provide for income taxes on the unremitted earnings of certain other subsidiaries where,
in management's opinion, such earnings have been indefinitely reinvested in those operations, or will be remitted either in a tax free liquidation or as dividends with taxes substantially offset by
foreign tax credits. It is not practical to determine the amount of unrecognized deferred tax liabilities for temporary differences related to these investments.

5.     INVESTMENTS IN ASSOCIATES

The Company holds a number of investments which it accounts for using the equity method. The Company's interest in the outstanding stock of the more significant
associates is as follows:

2004 and 2003. As of December 31, 2004 and 2003, the Company's other investments in associates individually and in the aggregate were not material to the Company's operations.

On
July 23, 1997, the Company entered into an agreement with Gras Savoye whereby, among other things, the co-shareholders of Gras Savoye (other than management) have
the right to sell (put option) their shares to the Company possibly increasing the Company's ownership interest from 33 percent to 90 percent. The option expires in 2011 and Gras
Savoye's eligible co-shareholders may exercise their rights from January 1, 2001. In addition, the Company has the right to purchase (call option) at least 50.1 percent of
Gras Savoye's shares from the co-shareholders. The call option is exercisable from December 1, 2009. The exact amount payable by the Company under the put and call is based on the
greater of a price per Gras Savoye share defined contractually or a formula-based price contingent on Gras Savoye's future results.

6.     NET INCOME PER SHARE

Basic and diluted net income per share is calculated by dividing net income by the average number of shares outstanding during each period. The computation of
diluted net income per share reflects the potential dilution that could occur if dilutive securities and other contracts to issue shares were exercised or converted into shares or resulted in the
issue of shares that then shared in the net income of the Company.

For
the year ended December 31, 2004, time-based and performance-based options to purchase 14.0 million and 3.0 million (2003: 15.1 million and
7.3 million; 2002: 19.5 million and 11.1 million) shares, respectively, and 0.4 million restricted shares (2003: 0.3 million and 2002: 0.2 million),
respectively, were outstanding. Basic and diluted net income per share are as follows:

During the third quarter of 2002, the reported results for the nine months ended September 30, 2002 exceeded the performance criteria
(based on the twelve months' results ending December 31, 2002) necessary to trigger the vesting of the performance options. In accordance with SFAS No. 128,

Earnings per Share

, such
potentially issuable shares have been included in the calculation of the average number of diluted shares from the beginning of
the third quarter of 2002.


Options
to purchase 5.0 million shares for the year ended December 31, 2004 were not included in the computation of the dilutive effect of stock options because the effect
was antidilutive (2003 and 2002: nil).

7.     FIDUCIARY FUNDS—RESTRICTED AND SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS

The Company's fiduciary funds-restricted and short-term investments consist of cash, time deposits, certificates of deposit and debt securities.
Accrued interest on investments is recorded as other assets.

The
debt securities are classified as available-for-sale. Accordingly, they are recorded at fair market value with unrealized holding gains and losses reported,
net of tax, as a
component of other comprehensive income. As of December 31, 2004 and 2003, the amortized cost of such securities approximated fair value.

Realized
gains and losses, net of tax, on debt securities are included in net income. During years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, sales of debt securities totaled
$79 million, $59 million and $36 million, respectively, on which realized gains and losses were not material to the consolidated results of the Company.

Senior Credit Facility (entered into December 4, 2003)

—On December 4,
2003 ("the effective date"), the Company entered into a new credit agreement providing up to $450 million in term loans and $150 million in revolving credit facilities.

On
February 2, 2004, the Company redeemed all the outstanding 9% senior subordinated notes (see below). On the same day, the Company drew down $300 million of term loans
under the Senior Credit Facility. The remaining $150 million under the Senior Credit Facility was drawn down on June 1, 2004.

Under
the new credit agreement, the Company is due to make loan repayments of $150 million on the third, fourth and fifth anniversary of the effective date. Loans under this
credit agreement bear interest at a rate per annum equal to either adjusted LIBOR or adjusted EURIBOR depending on their underlying currency plus a margin of 0.75 percent to 1.50 percent
determined by reference to future changes in the Company's interest coverage, leverage and credit ratings. The minimum applicable margin was 0.95 percent until December 4, 2004 and
changed to 0.85 percent from this date to the year end.

For
the year ended December 31, 2004, the weighted-average interest rate relating to the Senior Credit Facility was 2.46 percent (2003: ranged from 2.16 percent to
3.10 percent); net of an interest rate swap, the weighted-average interest rate was 3.68 percent (2003: ranged from 5.95 percent to 6.90 percent).

The
revolving credit facility is available for working capital requirements and general corporate purposes, subject to certain limitations, until December 4, 2008. The revolving
credit facility is available for loans denominated in US dollars, pounds sterling and certain other currencies.

The
credit agreement contains numerous operating and financial covenants, including requirements to maintain minimum ratios of consolidated EBITDA to consolidated net interest expense
and maximum levels of net indebtedness in relation to consolidated EBITDA, in each case subject to certain adjustments. In addition, the credit agreement includes covenants relating to the delivery of
financial statements, reports and notices, limitations on liens, limitations on sales and other disposals of assets, limitations on indebtedness and other liabilities, limitations on sale and
leaseback transactions, limitations on mergers and other fundamental changes, maintenance of property, maintenance of insurance, nature of business, compliance with applicable laws, maintenance of
corporate existence and rights, use of proceeds, payment of taxes and access to information and properties. At December 31, 2004, the Company was in compliance with all covenants.


All
obligations of Willis North America Inc. ("Willis North America") (the borrower) under the credit agreement are guaranteed by Willis Group Holdings Limited, Trinity
Acquisition Limited, Willis Group Limited, TA I Limited, TA II Limited, TA III Limited and TA IV Limited.

9% Senior Subordinated Notes

—In February 1999, Willis North America refinanced a short-term loan by issuing
9% senior subordinated notes due 2009 (the "Notes") in the aggregate principal amount of $550 million. The interest on the Notes was payable semi-annually on February 1 and
August 1. During 2003, Willis North America bought back and canceled Notes totaling $40 million. The difference between the market price paid and the book value was not material.

On
February 2, 2004, Willis North America redeemed the Notes, in whole, at a redemption price of 104.5 percent of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes being
redeemed, resulting in a premium of $17 million, plus accrued and unpaid interest.

The
indenture for the Notes contained covenants that, among other things, limited the ability of Willis North America, Willis Group Limited and some of their subsidiaries to incur
additional indebtedness and issue preferred stock; pay dividends or make other distributions; repurchase capital stock or subordinated indebtedness; create liens; enter into some transactions with
associates; sell assets and assets of subsidiaries; issue or sell capital stock of some subsidiaries; and enter into some mergers and acquisitions.

Scheduled Debt Repayments

—The Notes were due to mature in 2009, however, as noted above, the Company redeemed the Notes in
full on February 2, 2004. Under the new credit agreement, the Company is due to make loan repayments of $150 million on the third, fourth and fifth anniversary of the effective date.

Lines of Credit

—The Company also has available $5 million (2003: $2 million) in lines of credit, of which $nil
(2003: $nil) was drawn as of December 31, 2004 (excluding the $150 million revolving credit facility).

9.     PENSION PLANS

2010–2014



Willis North America has a 401(k) plan covering all eligible employees of Willis North America and its subsidiaries. The plan allows participants
to make pre-tax contributions and the Company provides a matching contribution of 3 percent of employees' annual eligible compensation. All investment assets of the plan are held in
a trust account administered by independent trustees. The Company's 401(k) mandatory matching contributions for 2004, 2003 and 2002 were approximately $1 million, $5 million and
$5 million, respectively.


10.   STOCK BENEFIT PLANS

The Company has adopted the plans described below providing for the grant of time-based options and performance-based options and various other
share-based grants to employees. The objectives of these plans include attracting and retaining the best personnel, motivating management personnel by means of growth-related incentives to achieve
long-range goals and providing employees with the opportunity to increase their share ownership in the Company.

Amended and Restated 1998 Share Purchase and Option Plan

—This plan, which was established on December 18, 1998,
provides for the granting of time-based and performance-based options to employees of the Company. There are 30,000,000 shares available for grant under this plan provided, however, that
in no event the total number of shares subject to options and other equity for current and future participants exceed 25 percent of the equity of Willis Group Holdings on a fully diluted basis.
All options granted under this plan are exercisable at £2 per share ($3.84 using the year-end exchange rate of £1 = $1.92) except for 111,111
time-based options which are exercisable at $13.50. No further grants are to be made under this plan.

Time-based
options are earned upon the fulfilment of vesting requirements. Options are generally exercisable in equal instalments of 20 percent per year over a
five-year period commencing on or after December 18, 2000.

Performance-based
options became exercisable, subject to the fulfilment of vesting requirements with effect from January 1, 2003, upon the achievement of cash flow and EBITDA (as
defined in the plan agreements) targets of Willis Group Limited. Options are generally exercisable in equal instalments of 25 percent per year over a four-year period commencing on
or after December 18, 2001.

Willis Award Plan

—This plan, which was established on July 13, 2000, provides for the granting of
time-based options to selected employees who have been identified as
superior performers. There are 5,000,000 shares available for grant under this plan provided, however, that in no event the total number of shares subject to options and other equity for current and
future participants exceed 25 percent of the equity of Willis Group Holdings on a fully diluted basis. All options granted under this plan are exercisable at £2 per share ($3.84
using the year-end exchange rate of £1 = $1.92). The options vest immediately on the grant date and are exercisable any time up to July 13, 2010.

2001 Share Purchase and Option Plan

—This plan, which was established on May 3, 2001, provides for the granting of
time-based options and various other share-based grants at fair market value to employees of the Company. There are 15,000,000 shares available for grant under this plan. Options are
exercisable on a variety of dates, including from the first, third, sixth or eighth anniversary of grant, although for certain options the exercisable date may accelerate depending on the achievement
of certain performance goals. Unless terminated sooner by the Board of Directors, the 2001 Plan will expire 10 years after its adoption. That termination will not affect the validity of any
grant outstanding at that date.

Compensation Expense

—Willis Group Holdings applies the intrinsic value method allowed by APB 25 in accounting for its
stock option plans. Under APB 25, compensation expense resulting from awards under fixed plans (time-based options, options granted pursuant to the Willis Award Plan and various
other share-based grants to employees) are measured as the difference between the quoted (or best estimate of) market price, and the exercise price on the measurement date. All fixed plan options have
been granted by Willis Group Holdings at an exercise price equal to the quoted market price at the measurement date, or management's best estimate of market price prior to the initial public


offering.
Accordingly, pursuant to APB 25 no compensation expense has been recognized for fixed option plans in the statements of operations.

Compensation
expense resulting from awards under variable plans (performance-based options) is measured as the difference between the quoted market price and the exercise price at the
date when the number of shares is known (the date the performance conditions are satisfied). The cost is recognized over the period the employee performs related services. Estimates of compensation
expense were recorded before the measurement date based on the quoted market price of the shares at the intervening dates in situations where it was probable that the performance conditions would be
attained.

Management
determined in the third quarter of 2001 that it was probable that the maximum performance condition would be attained. The measurement date under APB 25 was
December 31, 2002. Accordingly, compensation expense for the year ended December 31, 2004 of $11 million ($8 million, net of tax) (2003: $20 million
($16 million, net of tax)) (2002: $80 million ($67 million, net of tax)); was recognized based on the 10.9 million (2003: 10.9 million; 2002: 11.1 million)
unforfeited performance
options outstanding at that date, a quoted market price of $28.67 (2003: $28.67, 2002: $28.67) and an average elapsed performance period of 100 percent (2003: 95 percent; 2002:
85 percent).

The
pro forma disclosures required by SFAS 123R in Note 2 were estimated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following weighted-average assumptions:

The
compensation expense as generated by the Black-Scholes model may not be indicative of the future benefit, if any, that may be received by the option holder.

The
Black-Scholes model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options which have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable. In addition, option valuation
models require the input of highly subjective assumptions. Because Willis Group Holdings employee stock options have characteristics significantly different from those of traded options, and because
changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate, in management's opinion, the existing models do not necessarily provide a reliable single measure of the fair
value of its employee stock options.

11.   FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

The Company's principal financial instruments, other than derivatives, comprise bank loans, the new Senior Credit Facility, cash deposits and
short-term investments. The Company also enters into derivative transactions (principally interest rate swaps and forward foreign currency contracts) in order to manage interest rate and
currency risks arising from the Company's operations and its sources of finance. The Company does not hold financial instruments for trading purposes.

The
main risks arising from the Company's financial instruments are interest rate risk, liquidity risk, foreign currency risk and credit risk. The Company's board of directors reviews
and agrees policies for managing each of these risks as summarized below. The Company has applied SFAS No. 133,

Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging
Activities

, as amended by SFAS No. 149, in accounting for these financial instruments.

Interest Rate Risk

—In 2004, the Company's operations were financed principally through the Senior Credit Facility
(Note 8). As of December 31, 2004, $450 million was drawn down under the new Senior Credit Facility. Interest rate swaps were used to generate the desired interest rate profile
and to manage the Company's exposure to interest rate fluctuations. Willis North America entered into a series of interest rate swap agreements on June 4, 2004 under which the LIBOR-based
variable rate interest payment obligations on the full amount of the term loans were swapped for fixed rate interest payment obligations until 2006.

The
Company designated these interest rate swap agreements as a cash flow hedge as defined by SFAS 133 with the fair value recorded in other liabilities on the balance sheet.
Changes in fair value were recorded as a component of other comprehensive income, as shown in the table below. Amounts were reclassified from other comprehensive income into earnings when the hedged
exposure affected earnings. The differential paid or received was recognized as an adjustment to interest expense as incurred.

As
a result of the Company's operating activities, the Company receives cash for premiums and claims which it deposits in short-term investments denominated in US dollars and
other currencies. The Company earns interest on these funds, which is included in the Company's financial statements as interest income. These funds are regulated in terms of access and the
instruments in which they may be invested, most of which are short-term in maturity. In order to manage interest rate risk arising from these financial assets, the Company enters into
interest rate swaps to receive a fixed rate of interest and pay a variable rate of interest fixed in the various currencies related to the short-term investments. The use of interest rate
contracts essentially converts groups of short-term investments to fixed rates.

The
fair value of these contracts is recorded in other assets and other liabilities. For contracts that are qualifying cash flow hedges as defined by SFAS 133, changes in fair
value are recorded as a component of other comprehensive income. Amounts are reclassified from other comprehensive income into earnings when the hedged exposure affects earnings. For contracts that do
not qualify for hedge accounting as defined by SFAS 133, changes in fair value are recorded in general and administrative expenses.


The
changes in fair value of derivative financial instruments have been recorded as follows:

Liquidity Risk

—The Company's objective is to ensure that it has the ability to
generate sufficient cash either from internal or external sources, in a timely and cost-effective manner, to meet its commitments as they fall due. The Company's management of liquidity
risk is embedded within its overall risk management framework. Scenario analysis is continually undertaken to ensure that the Company's resources can meet its liquidity requirements. These resources
are supplemented by a $150 million revolving credit facility which expires on December 4, 2008, of which no amount is currently drawn.

Foreign Currency Risk

—The Company's objective is to maximize its cash flow in US dollars. In all locations with the exception
of the United Kingdom, the Company predominantly generates revenues and expenses in the local currency. In the United Kingdom, however, the Company earns revenues in a number of different currencies
but expenses are almost entirely in pounds sterling. This mismatch creates a currency exposure.


The
Company's policy within the United Kingdom is to convert into sterling all revenues arising in currencies other than US dollars together with sufficient US dollar revenues to fund
the remaining sterling expenses. Outside the United Kingdom, only those cash flows necessary to fund mismatches between revenues and expenses are converted into local currency; amounts remitted to the
United Kingdom are generally converted into sterling. These transactional currency exposures are principally managed by entering into forward foreign exchange contracts.

The
fair value of these contracts is recorded in other assets and other liabilities. For contracts that are qualifying cash flow hedges as defined by SFAS 133, changes in fair
value are recorded as a component of other comprehensive income. Amounts are reclassified from other comprehensive income into earnings when the hedged exposure affects earnings. For contracts that do
not qualify for hedge accounting as defined by SFAS 133, changes in fair value are recorded in general and administrative expenses (see table above on previous page).

The
table below summarizes by major currency the contractual amounts of the Company's forward contracts to exchange foreign currencies for pounds sterling. Foreign currency notional
amounts are reported in US dollars translated at spot rates at December 31.

Credit Risk and Concentrations of Credit Risk

—Credit risk represents the accounting
loss that would be recognized at the reporting date if counterparties failed to perform as contracted and from movements in interest rates and foreign exchange rates. The Company does not anticipate
non-performance by counterparties. The Company generally does not require collateral or other security to support financial instruments with credit risk; however, it is the Company's
policy to enter into master netting arrangements with counterparties as practical.

Concentrations
of credit risk that arise from financial instruments exist for groups of customers or counterparties when they have similar economic characteristics that would cause their
ability to meet contractual obligations to be similarly affected by changes in economic or other conditions. Financial instruments on the balance sheet that potentially subject the Company to
concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, and derivatives which are recorded at fair value. The Company maintains a policy providing for the
diversification of cash and cash equivalent investments and places such investments in an extensive number of high quality financial institutions to limit the amount of credit risk exposure.
Concentrations of credit risk with respect to receivables are limited due to the large number of clients and markets in which the Company does business, as well as the dispersion across many
geographic areas. Management does not believe significant risk exists in connection with the Company's concentrations of credit as of December 31, 2004.


Fair Value

—The estimated fair value of the Company's financial instruments held or issued to finance the Company's operations
is summarized below. Certain estimates and judgments were required to develop the fair value amounts. The fair value amounts shown below are not necessarily indicative of the amounts that the Company
would realize upon disposition nor do they indicate the Company's intent or ability to dispose of the financial instrument.

The
following methods and assumptions were used by the Company in estimating its fair value disclosure for financial instruments:

Cash and Cash Equivalents

—The estimated fair value of these financial instruments approximates their carrying values due to
their short maturities.

Fiduciary Funds—Restricted and Short-Term Investments

—Fair values are based on quoted market values.

Long-Term Debt

—The estimated fair values of the Company's long-term debt are based on current interest
rates available to the Company for debt instruments with similar terms and remaining maturities.

Derivative Financial Instruments

—Market values have been used to determine the fair value of interest rate swaps and forward
foreign exchange contracts based on estimated amounts the Company would receive or have to pay to terminate the agreements, taking into account the current interest rate environment or current foreign
currency forward rates.

In
November 2004, the Company entered into a 25 year agreement with long time client British Land plc relating to its new UK headquarters in London. Construction is
scheduled to commence in early 2005 and the Company's occupancy is targeted for late 2007. The Company's contractual obligations in relation to this commitment total $893 million and are included in
the table above, but remain contingent upon the successful completion of construction.

Rent
expense amounted to $87 million, $70 million and $71 million for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The Company's rental
income from subleases was $9 million, $8 million and $9 million for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively.


Guarantees

—Guarantees issued by certain of Willis Group Holdings' subsidiaries with respect to the Senior Credit Facility are
discussed elsewhere in these consolidated financial statements.

Certain
of Willis Group Holdings' subsidiaries have given the landlords of some leasehold properties occupied by the Company in the United Kingdom and the United States guarantees in
respect of the performance of the lease obligations of the subsidiary holding the lease. The operating lease obligations subject to such guarantees amounted to $1,050 million and
$158 million at December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively.

In
addition, the Company has given guarantees to bankers and other third parties relating principally to letters of credit amounting to $9 million and $9 million at
December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively.

Put and Call Options Relating to Subsidiaries and Associates

—For certain subsidiaries and associates, the Company has the
right to purchase shares (a call option) from co-shareholders at various dates in the future. In addition, the co-shareholders of certain subsidiaries and associates have the
right to sell (a put option) their shares to the Company at various dates in the future. Generally, the exercise price of such puts and calls is formula-based (using revenues and earnings) and is
designed to reflect fair value. Based on current projections of profitability and exchange rates, the potential amount payable in 2005 from these options is not expected to exceed $376 million.
Of this balance, $368 million relates to Gras Savoye, as disclosed in Note 5.

Claims, Lawsuits and Other Proceedings

—The Company is subject to various actual and potential claims, lawsuits and other
proceedings relating principally to alleged errors and omissions in connection with the placement of insurance and reinsurance in the ordinary course of business. Similar to other corporations, the
Company is also subject to a variety of other claims, including those relating to the Company's employment practices. Some of those claims, lawsuits and other proceedings seek damages in amounts which
could, if assessed, be significant.

Most
of these claims, lawsuits and other proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business are covered by professional indemnity or other appropriate insurance. In respect of
self-insured deductibles, the Company has established provisions against these items which are believed to be adequate in the light of current information and legal advice, and the Company
adjusts such provisions from time to time according to developments. On the basis of current information, the Company does not expect that the actual claims, lawsuits and other proceedings, including
the proceedings relating to contingent compensation arrangements referred to below, to which the Company is subject or of which it is aware will ultimately have a material adverse effect on the
Company's financial condition, results of operations or cash flow. Nonetheless, given the large or indeterminate amounts sought in certain of these actions, and the inherent unpredictability of
litigation, it is possible that an adverse outcome in certain matters could, from time to time, have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations or cash flows in particular
quarterly or annual periods.

Proceedings Relating to Contingent Compensation Arrangements

—Beginning in April 2004, the New York Attorney General
issued subpoenas to a number of insurance carriers and insurance brokerage firms, including the Company. These subpoenas requested information regarding, among other things, arrangements pursuant to
which insurers compensated insurance brokers for distribution and other services provided to insurers. The New York Department of Insurance also requested information concerning these compensation
arrangements. In October 2004, the New York Attorney General filed


suit
against one of the insurance brokers, accusing that broker of steering clients to insurers with which it has these compensation agreements and of soliciting false or fictitious quotes from
insurers (the "NY AG Complaint"). The New York Attorney General has stated publicly that he has broadened his investigation of the insurance industry to cover other practices and other possible
violations of law, including violations of fiduciary duty, securities laws, and antitrust laws. The New York Attorney General has also publicly stated that civil and criminal charges may be filed
against both individuals and other industry participants. After the New York Attorney General commenced his investigation, insurance commissioners and attorneys general of other states announced that
they are conducting similar investigations and have issued subpoenas to a number of insurance carriers and insurance brokerage firms, including the Company. The Company has received requests for
documents and information from eighteen other states and the District of Columbia. The Company is co-operating fully with these investigations and is producing documents and other
information in response to these subpoenas. The Company has engaged in discussions with representatives of the New York Attorney General's Office and of other states' insurance commissioners and
attorneys general about their investigations. The Company cannot predict at this time how or when those investigations will be resolved.

In
August 2004, a state court proceeding was commenced against the Company in California by an organization purporting to act in a representative capacity on behalf of the
California general public. The complaint alleges that the compensation arrangements between the Company and insurance carriers constitute deceptive trade practices, and it seeks both injunctive and
equitable relief, including restitution. That action was dismissed in December 2004. A purported class action also was filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New
York naming various insurance carriers
and insurance brokerage firms, including the Company, as defendants. The complaint alleges conduct by the defendants similar to the conduct alleged in the NY AG Complaint and also alleges, among other
things, the existence of a conspiracy among the insurance carriers and brokers whereby they have engaged in violations of the federal RICO statute. Similar purported class actions also have been filed
against various insurance carriers and insurance brokerage firms, including the Company, in the United States District Courts for the Northern District of Illinois and the Northern District of
California, and in the Florida state court, and it is expected that further lawsuits may be filed. The actions filed in federal court will be transferred to the United States District Court for the
District of New Jersey for co-ordinated pre-trial proceedings. The Company disputes these allegations and intends to defend itself vigorously against these actions.

The
compensation arrangements, which were initially the subject of the investigation by the New York Attorney General, are a longstanding and common practice within the insurance
industry and have been disclosed by the Company for many years. On October 21, 2004, the Company announced that it was voluntarily abolishing these compensation arrangements immediately in
North America and by December 31, 2004 outside North America. It is not possible at this time to predict or reasonably estimate what the outcome or the timing of any resolution of these
proceedings or any possible future proceedings may be.

15.   SEGMENT INFORMATION

SFAS No. 131,

Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information

("SFAS 131")
establishes standards for reporting information about operating segments and related disclosures, products and services, geographic areas and major customers. Operating segments are components of


an
enterprise about which separate financial information is available that is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision-maker in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing
performance.

The
Company conducts its worldwide insurance brokerage activities through three operating segments: Global, North America and International. Each operating segment exhibits similar
economic characteristics, provides similar products and services and distributes same through common distribution channels to a common type or class of customer. In addition, the regulatory
environment in each region is similar. Consequently, for financial reporting purposes the Company has aggregated these three operating segments into one reportable segment.

None
of the Company's customers represented more than 10 percent of the Company's consolidated commissions and fees for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002.

long-lived assets exceed 10 percent of consolidated commissions and fees and/or long-lived assets, respectively.

The Company has not reported revenues from external customers for each product and service or each group of similar products and services as the
Company's internal systems do not allow for the generation of such information.

16.   RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS

The Company has an Employee Stock Ownership Plan (the "ESOP") which holds Willis Group Holdings' shares. The trustee of the ESOP transferred 608,521 and 85,467
shares during the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. At December 31, 2004 and 2003, the ESOP shares outstanding were 87,606 and 696,127, respectively. No dividends
have been distributed on the shares held by the ESOP.


Kohlberg
Kravis Roberts & Co. L.P. ("KKR"), with which Messrs. P. Golkin and S.C. Nuttall, both Directors of the Company, are affiliated, and Fisher Capital Corp. L.L.C.
("Fisher"), with which Mr. J.R. Fisher, also a Director of the Company, is affiliated, rendered in 2002 and 2003 management, consulting and certain other services to the Company for annual fees
of $1,000,000 and $350,000, respectively, payable quarterly in arrears. These arrangements were terminated as of December 31, 2003. Messrs. Golkin and Nuttall disclaim any beneficial
interest in these fees.

In
addition, the Company and Fisher entered into a share option agreement dated January 27, 1999, whereby the Company granted to Fisher 422,501 options to purchase an equivalent
number of shares. The options vest upon grant date and are exercisable any time up to January 27, 2014. During 2004, options over 174,462 shares (2003: 153,001 shares) were exercised; at
December 31, 2004, 56,697 options remained unexercised. The fair value of the options, computed on grant date using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model and assuming a dividend yield of 0%,
expected volatility of 30%, a risk-free interest rate of 6.42% and a weighted-average expected life of three years, amounts to $334,905. This cost may not be indicative of the future
benefit to be received by Fisher. Mr. J.R. Fisher, as the managing member and majority owner of Fisher may be deemed to share beneficial ownership of any options owned by Fisher but
disclaims such beneficial ownership.

Concurrently
with the secondary public offering by certain of its shareholders of 20 million Shares in February 2004, the Company purchased 3,974,154 of its Shares from
Profit Sharing (Overseas), Limited Partnership, an affiliate of KKR, and 25,846 of its Shares from Fisher Capital Corp. L.L.C. at a price of $37.026 per Share, the net public offering price in the
secondary offering, in a private non-underwritten transaction.
