PART I

Item 1 — Business

History and
    Development of the Company

Willis Group Holdings is the ultimate holding company for the
    Group. We trace our history to 1828 and are one of the largest
    insurance brokers in the world.

Willis Group Holdings was incorporated in Ireland on
    September 24, 2009 to facilitate the change of the place of
    incorporation of the parent company of the Group from Bermuda to
    Ireland (the ‘Redomicile’). At December 31, 2009,
    the common shares of Willis-Bermuda were canceled, the
    Willis-Bermuda common shareholders received, on a

one-for-one

basis, new ordinary shares of Willis Group Holdings, and Willis
    Group Holdings became the ultimate parent company for the Group.

For administrative convenience, we utilize the offices of a
    subsidiary company as our principal executive offices. The
    address is:

Willis Group Holdings Public Limited Company

c/o Willis

Group Limited

The Willis Building

51 Lime Street

London EC3M 7DQ

England

Tel: +44 203 124 6000

For several years, we have focused on our core retail and
    specialist broking operations. In 2008, we acquired HRH, at the
    time the eighth largest insurance and risk management
    intermediary in the United States. The acquisition almost
    doubled our North America revenues and created critical mass in
    key markets including California, Florida, Texas, Illinois,
    New York, Boston, New Jersey and Philadelphia. In addition,
    we have made a number of smaller acquisitions around the world
    and increased our ownership in several of our associates and
    existing subsidiaries, which were not wholly-owned, where doing
    so strengthened our retail network and our specialty businesses.

About
    Willis

General

We provide a broad range of insurance brokerage, reinsurance and
    risk management consulting services to our clients worldwide. We
    have significant market positions in the United States, in the
    United Kingdom and, directly and through our associates, in many
    other countries. We are a recognized leader in providing
    specialized risk management advisory and other services on a
    global basis to clients in various industries including
    aerospace, marine, construction and energy.

In our capacity as an advisor and insurance broker, we act as an
    intermediary between our clients and insurance carriers by
    advising our clients on their risk management requirements,
    helping clients determine the best means of managing risk, and
    negotiating and placing insurance with insurance carriers
    through our global distribution network.

We assist clients in the assessment of their risks, advise on
    the best ways of transferring suitable risk to the global
    insurance and reinsurance markets and then execute the
    transactions at the most appropriate available price, terms and
    conditions for our clients. Our global distribution network
    enables us to place the risk in the most appropriate insurance
    or reinsurance market worldwide.

We also offer clients a broad range of services to help them to
    identify and control their risks. These services range from
    strategic risk consulting (including providing actuarial
    analyses), to a variety of due diligence services, to the
    provision of practical

on-site

risk
    control services (such as health and safety or property loss
    control consulting) as well as analytical and advisory services
    (such as hazard modeling and reinsurance optimization studies).
    We assist clients in planning how to manage incidents or crises
    when they occur. These services include contingency planning,
    security audits and product tampering plans. We are not an
    insurance company and therefore we do not underwrite insurable
    risks for our own account.

We and our associates serve a diverse base of clients including
    major multinational and middle-market companies in a variety of
    industries, as well as public institutions and individual
    clients. Many of our client relationships span decades. We have
    approximately 20,000 employees around the world (including
    approximately 3,300 at our associate companies) and a network of
    in excess of 400 offices in nearly 120 countries.

We believe we are one of only a few insurance brokers in the
    world possessing the global operating presence, broad product
    expertise and extensive distribution network necessary to meet
    effectively the global risk management needs of many of our
    clients.

Business
    Strategy

Our aim is to be the insurance broker and risk adviser of choice
    globally.

Our business model is aligned to the needs of each client
    segment:

•

Insurer — platform-neutral capital management and
    advisory services;

•

Large Accounts — delivering Willis’s global
    capabilities through client advocacy;

•

Mid-Market — mass-customization through our Sales 2.0
    model;

•

Commercial — providing product and services to
    networks of retail brokers; and

•

Personal — focused on affinity models and High Net
    Worth segments.

Our business model has three elements:

•

Organic growth;

•

Recruitment of teams and individuals; and

•

Strategic acquisitions.



Willis
    Group Holdings plc

To meet the needs of our clients, we realigned our business
    model in 2011 to further grow the company and position us to
    deliver the Willis Cause:

•

we thoroughly understand our clients’ needs and their
    industries;

•

we develop client solutions with the best markets, price and
    terms;

•

we relentlessly deliver quality client service; and

•

we get claims paid quickly

...With Integrity

Our
    Business

Insurance and reinsurance is a global business, and its
    participants are affected by global trends in capacity and
    pricing. Accordingly, we operate as one global business which
    ensures all clients’ interests are handled efficiently and
    comprehensively, whatever their initial point of contact. We
    organize our business into three segments: North America and
    International, which together comprise our principal retail
    operations, and Global. In 2011 and 2010, approximately
    50 percent of our total revenue was generated from within
    the US, with no other country contributing in excess of
    20 percent. For information regarding revenues, operating
    income and total assets per segment, see Note 27 of the
    Consolidated Financial Statements contained herein.

Global

Our Global business provides specialist brokerage and consulting
    services to clients worldwide for the risks arising from
    specific industrial and commercial activities. In these
    operations, we have extensive specialized experience handling
    diverse lines of coverage, including complex insurance programs,
    and acting as an intermediary between retail brokers and
    insurers. We increasingly provide consulting services on risk
    management with the objective of assisting clients to reduce the
    overall cost of risk. Our Global business serves clients in over
    150 countries, primarily from offices in the United Kingdom,
    although we also serve clients from offices in the United
    States, Continental Europe and Asia.

    100 percent ownership position. In addition, in certain
    instances our co-shareholders have a right, typically based on
    some price formula of revenues or earnings, to put some or all
    of their shares to us. On December 17, 2009 as part of a
    reorganization of the share capital of Gras Savoye our interest
    in that company reduced from 48 percent to 31 percent.
    In 2011 our ownership reduced further to 30 percent following
    issuance of additional share capital as part of an employee
    share incentive scheme. In addition, we have the option to
    acquire a 100 percent interest in the capital of Gras
    Savoye in 2015. For further information on the Gras Savoye
    capital reorganization see ‘Item 8—Financial
    Statements and Supplementary Data —
    Note 14 — Investments in Associates’.

We believe the combined total revenues of our International
    subsidiaries and associates provide an indication of the spread
    and capability of our International network. The team generated
    over 30 percent of the Group’s total consolidated
    commissions and fees in 2011.

Customers

Our clients operate on a global and local scale in a multitude
    of businesses and industries throughout the world and generally
    range in size from major multinational corporations to
    middle-market companies. Further, many of our client
    relationships span decades, for instance our relationship with
    The Tokio Marine and Fire Insurance Company Limited dates back
    over 100 years. No one client accounted for more than
    10 percent of revenues for fiscal year 2011. Additionally,
    we place insurance with approximately 5,000 insurance carriers,
    none of which individually accounted for more than
    10 percent of the total premiums we placed on behalf of our
    clients in 2011.

Competition

We face competition in all fields in which we operate based on
    global capability, product breadth, innovation, quality of
    service and price. According to the Directory of Agents and
    Brokers published by Business Insurance in July 2011, the 140
    largest commercial insurance brokers globally reported brokerage
    revenues totaling $42 billion in 2010, of which



Willis
    Group Holdings plc

Marsh & McLennan Companies Inc. had approximately
    25 percent, Aon Corporation had approximately
    25 percent and Willis had approximately 8 percent.

We compete with Marsh & McLennan and Aon, the two
    other providers of global risk management services, as well as
    with numerous specialist, regional and local firms. Competition
    for business is intense in all of our business lines and in
    every insurance market, and the other two providers of global
    risk management services have substantially greater market share
    than we do. Competition on premium rates has also exacerbated
    the pressures caused by a continuing reduction in demand in some
    classes of business. For example, rather than purchase
    additional insurance through brokers, many insureds have been
    retaining a greater proportion of their risk portfolios than
    previously. Industrial and commercial companies increasingly
    rely upon their own subsidiary insurance companies, known as
    captive insurance companies, self-insurance pools, risk
    retention groups, mutual insurance companies and other
    mechanisms for funding their risks, rather than buy insurance.
    Additional competitive pressures arise from the entry of new
    market participants, such as banks, accounting firms and
    insurance carriers themselves, offering risk management or
    transfer services.

In 2005, we, along with Marsh & McLennan and Aon,
    agreed with New York State and other regulators through an
    Assurance of Discontinuance, to implement certain business
    reforms which included codification of our October 2004
    voluntary termination of contingent commission arrangements with
    insurers. Most other special, regional, and local insurance
    brokers, however, continued to accept contingent compensation
    and did not disclose the compensation received in connection
    with providing policy placement services to its customers. In
    February 2010, we entered into an Amended and Restated Assurance
    of Discontinuance with the Attorney General of the State of New
    York and the Amended and Restated Stipulation with the
    Superintendent of Insurance of the State of New York which ended
    many of the requirements previously imposed upon us. The new
    agreement no longer limited the type of compensation we could
    receive and simplified our compensation disclosure requirements.

Following the introduction of health care reform legislation in
    2010, some major health insurance carriers in North America
    began to change their compensation practices in particular lines
    of business in certain locations. In response to market
    pressures those changes caused, we announced in July 2011 that
    in order to remain competitive, we would begin accepting
    standard compensation based on volume, but would continue to
    resist traditional contingent commissions and bonus payments
    because, while legal, we believe these forms of compensation
    create conflicts with our clients. After several months of
    review under changing market conditions, we have concluded that
    we cannot be fully competitive on Employee Benefits business if
    we continue to refuse these legal forms of compensation.
    Consequently, we will begin to accept all forms of compensation
    from Employee Benefits providers effective April 1, 2012.
    While accepting contingent compensation is legal, and while we
    will only accept them in full compliance with all applicable
    laws and regulations and consistent with ethical business
    practices, in the past it has been the subject of regulatory
    action and civil litigation and we cannot predict whether our
    position will cause regulatory or other scrutiny.

We will continue to refuse to accept contingent commissions from
    carriers in the non-Employee Benefit areas of our retail
    brokerage business unless similar external factors such as
    legislative change make our position untenable. However, we do
    not believe such a change is likely. To our knowledge, we are
    the only insurance broker that takes this stance. We seek to
    increase revenue through higher commissions and fees that we
    disclose to our clients, and to generate profitable revenue
    growth by focusing on the provision of value-added risk advisory
    services beyond traditional brokerage activities. Although we
    continue to believe in the success of our strategy, we cannot be
    certain that such steps will help us to continue to generate
    profitable organic commissions and fees growth. If we are unable
    to compete effectively against our competitors who are accepting
    or may accept contingent commissions, we may suffer lower
    revenue, reduced operating margins, and loss of market share
    which could materially and adversely affect our business.

Regulation

Our business activities are subject to legal requirements and
    governmental and quasi-governmental regulatory supervision in
    virtually all countries in which we operate. Also, such
    regulations may require individual or company licensing to
    conduct our business activities. While these requirements may
    vary from location to location they are generally designed to
    protect our clients by establishing minimum standards of conduct
    and practice, particularly regarding the provision of advice and
    product information as well as financial criteria. Our three
    most significant regulatory regions are described below:



About
    Willis

United
    States

Our activities in connection with insurance brokerage services
    within the United States are subject to regulation and
    supervision by state authorities. Although the scope of
    regulation and form of supervision may vary from jurisdiction to
    jurisdiction, insurance laws in the United States are often
    complex and generally grant broad discretion to supervisory
    authorities in adopting regulations and supervising regulated
    activities. That supervision generally includes the licensing of
    insurance brokers and agents and the regulation of the handling
    and investment of client funds held in a fiduciary capacity. Our
    continuing ability to provide insurance brokerage in the
    jurisdictions in which we currently operate is dependent upon
    our compliance with the rules and regulations promulgated from
    time to time by the regulatory authorities in each of these
    jurisdictions.

European
    Union

The European Union Insurance Mediation Directive introduced
    rules to enable insurance and reinsurance intermediaries to
    operate and provide services within each member state of the EU
    on a basis consistent with the EU single market and customer
    protection aims. Each EU member state in which we operate is
    required to ensure that the insurance and reinsurance
    intermediaries resident in their country are registered with a
    statutory body in that country and that each intermediary meets
    professional requirements in relation to their competence, good
    repute, professional indemnity cover and financial capacity.

United
    Kingdom

In the United Kingdom, the statutory body is the Financial
    Services Authority (‘FSA’). The FSA has prescribed the
    methods by which our insurance and reinsurance operations are to
    conduct business, and has a wide range of rule-making,
    investigatory and enforcement powers aimed at meeting its
    overall aim of promoting efficient, orderly and fair markets and
    helping retail consumers achieve a fair deal. The FSA conducts
    monitoring visits to assess our compliance with regulatory
    requirements.

Certain of our activities are governed by other regulatory
    bodies, such as investment and securities licensing authorities.
    In the United States, our Willis Capital Markets &
    Advisory business operates through our wholly-owned subsidiary
    Willis Securities, Inc., a US-registered broker-dealer and
    investment advisor, member FINRA/SIPC, primarily in connection
    with investment banking-related services and advising on
    alternative risk financing transactions. Willis Capital Markets
    provides advice on securities or investments in the EU through
    our wholly-owned subsidiary Willis Capital Markets &
    Advisory Limited, which is authorized and regulated by the FSA.

Our failure, or that of our employees, to satisfy the regulators
    that we comply with their requirements or the legal requirements
    governing our activities, can result in disciplinary action,
    fines, reputational damage and financial harm.

All companies carrying on similar activities in a given
    jurisdiction are subject to regulations which are not dissimilar
    to the requirements for our operations in the United States and
    United Kingdom. We do not consider that these regulatory
    requirements adversely affect our competitive position.

See Part I,

Item 1A-Risk

Factors ‘Legal and Regulatory Risks’ for discussion of
    how actions by regulatory authorities or changes in legislation
    and regulation in the jurisdictions in which we operate may have
    an adverse effect on our business.

Employees

As of December 31, 2011 we had approximately
    17,000 employees worldwide of whom approximately 3,400 were
    employed in the United Kingdom and 6,200 in the United States,
    with the balance being employed across the rest of the world. In
    addition, our associates had approximately 3,300 employees,
    all of whom were located outside the United Kingdom and the
    United States.

    Factors

Risks Relating to
    our Business and the Insurance Industry

This section describes material risks affecting the Group’s
    business. These risks could materially affect the Group’s
    business, its revenues, operating income, net income, net
    assets, liquidity and capital resources and ability to achieve
    its financial targets and, accordingly should be read in
    conjunction with any forward-looking statements in this Annual
    Report on

Form 10-K.

Competitive
    Risks

Worldwide
    economic conditions, including those associated with the current
    Eurozone sovereign debt crisis, could have an adverse effect on
    our business, prospects, operating results, financial condition
    and cash flows.

Our business and operating results are materially affected by
    worldwide economic conditions. Current global economic
    conditions, including those associated with the current Eurozone
    sovereign debt crisis, coupled with declining customer and
    business confidence, increasing energy prices, and other
    challenges, may have a significant negative impact on the buying
    behavior of some of our clients as their businesses suffer from
    these conditions. For example, our employee benefits practice
    may be adversely affected as businesses continue to downsize
    during this period of economic turmoil and our construction
    business may be adversely affected by the lack of new
    construction. Our North American and UK and Irish retail
    operations have been particularly impacted by the weakened
    economic climate and continued soft market from 2009 through
    2011 with no material improvement in rates across most sectors.
    The global economic downturn is negatively affecting some of the
    international economies that have supported the strong growth in
    our International operations.

A growing number of insolvencies associated with an economic
    downturn could adversely affect our brokerage business through
    the loss of clients or by hampering our ability to place
    insurance and reinsurance business. While it is difficult to
    predict consequences of any further deterioration in global
    economic conditions on our business, any significant reduction
    or delay by our clients in purchasing insurance or making
    payment of premiums could have a material adverse impact on our
    financial condition and results of operations. In addition, the
    potential for a significant insurer to fail, be downgraded or
    withdraw from writing certain lines of insurance coverages that
    we offer our clients could negatively impact overall capacity in
    the industry, which could then reduce the placement of certain
    lines and types of insurance and reduce our revenues and
    profitability. The potential for an insurer to fail or be
    downgraded could also result in errors and omissions claims by
    clients.

The credit and economic conditions within certain European Union
    countries, in particular, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Portugal and
    Spain, have continued to deteriorate and have contributed to the
    instability in the global credit and financial markets. While
    the outcome of these events cannot be predicted, it is possible
    that such events could have a negative effect on the global
    economy as a whole, and our business, operating results and
    financial condition. If the European debt crisis continues or
    further deteriorates, there will likely be a negative effect on
    our European business (which constitutes approximately
    40 percent of our business in terms of revenue), as well as
    the businesses of our European clients. If the euro dissolved
    entirely, the legal and contractual consequences for holders of
    euro-denominated obligations would be determined by laws in
    effect at such time. A significant devaluation of the euro would
    cause the value of our financial assets that are denominated in
    Euros to be significantly reduced. Any of these conditions could
    ultimately harm our overall business, prospects, operating
    results, financial condition and cash flows.

In light of the current global economic uncertainty, we strive
    to vigorously manage our cost base in order to fund further
    growth initiatives. While we completed an operational review and
    commenced certain revenue generating initiatives in 2011 (such
    as Sales 2.0, WillPlace and Global Solutions), we cannot be
    certain whether we will be able to realize benefits from these
    initiatives or any new initiatives that we may implement.



Risk factors

We do not control
    the premiums on which our commissions are based, and volatility
    or declines in premiums may seriously undermine our
    profitability.

We derive most of our revenues from commissions and fees for
    brokerage and consulting services. We do not determine insurance
    premiums on which our commissions are generally based. Premiums
    are cyclical in nature and may vary widely based on market
    conditions. For a three-year period in early 2000s, we
    benefitted from a ‘hard’ market with premium rates
    stable or increasing. Since that time, we saw a rapid transition
    from a hard market to a ‘soft’ market, with premium
    rates falling in most markets which impacted our commission
    revenues and operating margin. In 2009, the stabilization of
    rates in the reinsurance market and some specialty markets was
    offset by the continuing soft market in other sectors and the
    adverse impact of the weakened economic environment across the
    globe. Our North American and UK and Irish retail operations
    have been particularly impacted by the weakened economic climate
    and continued soft market from 2009 through 2011 with no
    material improvement in rates across most sectors. This resulted
    in declines in 2009 revenues in these operations with a modest
    improvement in 2010 followed by declines in 2011, particularly
    amongst our smaller clients who have been especially vulnerable
    to the economic downturn.

In addition, as traditional risk-bearing insurance carriers
    continue to outsource the production of premium revenue to
    non-affiliated agents or brokers such as ourselves, those
    insurance carriers may seek to reduce further their expenses by
    reducing the commission rates payable to those insurance agents
    or brokers. The reduction of these commission rates, along with
    general volatility

and/or

declines in premiums, may significantly undermine our
    profitability.

Competition in
    our industry is intense, and if we are unable to compete
    effectively, we may suffer lower revenue, reduced operating
    margins and lose market share which could materially and
    adversely affect our business.

We face competition in all fields in which we operate, based on
    global capability, product breadth, innovation, quality of
    service and price. We compete with Marsh & McLennan
    and Aon, the two other providers of global risk management
    services, as well as with numerous specialist, regional and
    local firms. Competition for business is intense in all of our
    business lines and in every insurance market, and the other two
    providers of global risk management services have substantially
    greater market share than we do. Competition on premium rates
    has also exacerbated the pressures caused by a continuing
    reduction in demand in some classes of business. For example,
    rather than purchase additional insurance through brokers, many
    insureds have been retaining a greater proportion of their risk
    portfolios than previously. Industrial and commercial companies
    increasingly rely upon their own subsidiary insurance companies,
    known as captive insurance companies, self-insurance pools, risk
    retention groups, mutual insurance companies and other
    mechanisms for funding their risks, rather than buy insurance.
    Additional competitive pressures arise from the entry of new
    market participants, such as banks, accounting firms and
    insurance carriers themselves, offering risk management or
    transfer services.

In 2005, we, along with Marsh & McLennan and Aon,
    agreed with New York State and other regulators through an
    Assurance of Discontinuance, to implement certain business
    reforms which included codification of our October 2004

    insurers. Most other special, regional, and local insurance
    brokers, however, continued to accept contingent compensation
    and did not disclose the compensation received in connection
    with providing policy placement services to its customers. In
    February 2010, we entered into an Amended and Restated Assurance
    of Discontinuance with the Attorney General of the State of New
    York and the Amended and Restated Stipulation with the
    Superintendent of Insurance of the State of New York which ended
    many of the requirements previously imposed upon us. The new
    agreement no longer limited the type of compensation we could
    receive and simplified our compensation disclosure requirements.

    Consequently, we will begin to accept all forms of compensation
    from Employee Benefits providers effective April 1, 2012.
    While accepting contingent compensation is legal, and while we
    will only accept them in full compliance with all applicable
    laws and regulations and

consistent with ethical business practices, in the past it has
    been the subject of regulatory action and civil litigation and
    we cannot predict whether our position will cause regulatory or
    other scrutiny.

We will continue to refuse to accept contingent commissions from
    carriers in the non-Employee Benefit areas of our retail
    brokerage business unless similar external factors such as
    legislative change make our position untenable. However, we do
    not believe such a change is likely. To our knowledge, we are
    the only insurance broker that takes this stance. We seek to
    increase revenue through higher commissions and fees that we

    growth by focusing on the provision of value-added risk advisory

    certain that such steps will help us to continue to generate
    profitable organic revenue growth. If we are unable to compete
    effectively against our competitors who are accepting or may
    accept contingent commissions, we may suffer lower revenue,
    reduced operating margins, and loss of market share which could
    materially and adversely affect our business.

Dependence on Key
    Personnel — The loss of our Chairman and Chief
    Executive Officer or a number of our senior management or a
    significant number of our brokers could significantly impede our
    financial plans, growth, marketing and other
    objectives.

The loss of our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, a number
    of our senior management or a significant number of our brokers
    could significantly impede our financial plans, growth,
    marketing and other objectives. Our success depends to a
    substantial extent not only on the ability and experience of our
    Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Joseph J. Plumeri and
    other members of our senior management, but also on the
    individual brokers and teams that service our clients and
    maintain client relationships. The insurance and reinsurance
    brokerage industry has in the past experienced intense
    competition for the services of leading individual brokers and
    brokerage teams, and we have lost key individuals and teams to
    competitors. We believe that our future success will depend in
    part on our ability to attract and retain additional highly
    skilled and qualified personnel and to expand, train and manage
    our employee base. We may not continue to be successful in doing
    so because the competition for qualified personnel in our
    industry is intense.

Legal and
    Regulatory Risks

Our compliance
    systems and controls cannot guarantee that we are in compliance
    with all applicable federal and state or foreign laws and
    regulations, and actions by regulatory authorities or changes in
    applicable laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we
    operate may have an adverse effect on our business.

Our activities are subject to extensive regulation under the
    laws of the United States, the United Kingdom and the European
    Union and its member states, and the other jurisdictions in
    which we operate. Indeed, over the last few years, there has
    been a general increase in focus and developments in these laws
    and regulations. Compliance with laws and regulations that are
    applicable to our operations is complex and may increase our
    cost of doing business. These laws and regulations include
    insurance industry regulations, economic and trade sanctions and
    laws against financial crimes such as money laundering, bribery
    or other corruption, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt
    Practices Act. In most jurisdictions, governmental and
    regulatory authorities have the ability to interpret and amend
    these laws and regulations and impose penalties for
    non-compliance, including sanctions, civil remedies, fines,
    injunctions, revocation of licenses or approvals, suspension of
    individuals, limitations on business activities or redress to
    clients.

Given the increased interest expressed by US and UK regulators
    in the effectiveness of compliance controls relating to
    financial crime in our market sector in particular, we began a
    voluntary internal review of our policies and controls five
    years ago. This review includes analysis and advice from
    external experts on best practices, review of public regulatory
    decisions, and discussions with government regulators in the US
    and UK. In addition, the UK FSA conducted an investigation of
    Willis Limited’s, our UK brokerage subsidiary, compliance
    systems and controls between 2005 and 2009. On July 21,
    2011, we and the FSA announced a settlement under which the FSA
    concluded its investigation by assessing a £7 million
    ($11 million) fine on Willis Limited for lapses in its
    implementation and documentation of its controls to counter the
    risks of improper payments being made to non-FSA authorized
    overseas third parties engaged to help win business,
    particularly in high risk jurisdictions.



Risk factors

As a result of the FSA settlement, we are conducting a further
    internal review of all payments made between 2005 and 2009. We
    also continue to fully cooperate with our US regulators, however
    we are unable to predict at this time when our discussions with
    them will be concluded. We do not believe that this further
    internal review or our discussions with the US regulators will
    result in any material fines or sanctions, but there can be no
    assurance that any resolution will not have an adverse impact on
    our ability to conduct our business in certain jurisdictions.
    While we believe that our current systems and controls are
    adequate and in accordance with all applicable laws and
    regulations, we cannot assure that such systems and controls
    will prevent any violations of applicable laws and regulations.

Our business,
    results of operations, financial condition or liquidity may be
    materially adversely affected by actual and potential claims,
    lawsuits, investigations and proceedings.

We are subject to various actual and potential claims, lawsuits,
    investigations and other proceedings relating principally to
    alleged errors and omissions in connection with the placement of
    insurance and reinsurance in the ordinary course of business.
    Because we often assist our clients with matters, including the
    placement of insurance coverage and the handling of related
    claims, involving substantial amounts of money, errors and
    omissions claims against us may arise which allege our potential
    liability for all or part of the amounts in question.

Claimants can seek large damage awards and these claims can
    involve potentially significant defense costs. Such claims,
    lawsuits and other proceedings could, for example, include
    allegations of damages for our employees or

sub-agents

improperly failing to place coverage or notify claims on behalf
    of clients, to provide insurance carriers with complete and
    accurate information relating to the risks being insured or to
    appropriately apply funds that we hold for our clients on a
    fiduciary basis. Errors and omissions claims, lawsuits and other
    proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business are
    covered in part by professional indemnity or other appropriate
    insurance. The terms of this insurance vary by policy year and
    self-insured risks have increased significantly in recent years.
    In respect of self-insured risks, we have established provisions
    against these items which we believe to be adequate in the light
    of current information and legal advice, and we adjust such
    provisions from time to time according to developments. Our
    business, results of operations, financial condition and
    liquidity may be adversely affected if in the future our
    insurance coverage proves to be inadequate or unavailable or
    there is an increase in liabilities for which we self-insure.
    Our ability to obtain professional indemnity insurance in the
    amounts and with the deductibles we desire in the future may be
    adversely impacted by general developments in the market for
    such insurance or our own claims experience.

We are also subject to actual and potential claims, lawsuits,
    investigations and proceedings outside of errors and omissions
    claims. An example of material claims for which we are subject
    that are outside of the error and omissions claims context
    relate to those arising out of the collapse of The Stanford
    Financial Group, for which we acted as brokers of record on
    certain lines of insurance.

The ultimate outcome of these matters cannot be ascertained and
    liabilities in indeterminate amounts may be imposed on us. It is
    thus possible that future results of operations or cash flows
    for any particular quarterly or annual period could be
    materially affected by an unfavorable resolution of these
    matters. In addition, these matters continue to divert
    management and personnel resources away from operating our
    business. Even if we do not experience significant monetary
    costs, there may also be adverse publicity associated with these
    matters that could result in reputational harm to the insurance
    brokerage industry in general or to us in particular that may
    adversely affect our business, client or employee relationships.

Interruption to
    or loss of our information processing capabilities or failure to
    effectively maintain and upgrade our information processing
    systems or data security breaches could cause material financial
    loss, loss of human resources, regulatory actions, reputational
    harm or legal liability.

Our business depends significantly on effective information
    systems. Our capacity to service our clients relies on effective
    storage, retrieval, processing and management of information.
    Our information systems also rely on the commitment of
    significant resources to maintain and enhance existing systems
    and to develop new systems in order to keep pace with continuing
    changes in information processing technology or evolving
    industry and regulatory standards.



Willis Group
    Holdings plc

Computer viruses, hackers and other external hazards could
    expose our data systems to security breaches. These increased
    risks, and expanding regulatory requirements regarding data
    security, could expose us to data loss, monetary and
    reputational damages and significant increases in compliance
    costs.

If the information we rely on to run our business were found to
    be inaccurate or unreliable or if we fail to maintain effective
    and efficient systems (including through a telecommunications
    failure, failure to replace or update redundant or obsolete
    computer applications or software systems or if we experience
    other disruptions), this could result in material financial
    loss, regulatory action, reputational harm or legal liability.

Our inability to
    successfully recover should we experience a disaster or other
    significant disruption to business continuity could have a
    material adverse effect on our operations.

Our ability to conduct business may be adversely affected, even
    in the short-term, by a disruption in the infrastructure that
    supports our business and the communities where we are located.
    This may include a disruption caused by restricted physical site
    access, terrorist activities, disease pandemics, or outages to
    electrical, communications or other services used by our
    company, our employees or third parties with whom we conduct
    business. Although we have certain disaster recovery procedures
    in place and insurance to protect against such contingencies,
    such procedures may not be effective and any insurance or
    recovery procedures may not continue to be available at
    reasonable prices and may not address all such losses or
    compensate us for the possible loss of clients occurring during
    any period that we are unable to provide services. Our inability
    to successfully recover should we experience a disaster or other
    significant disruption to business continuity could have a
    material adverse effect on our operations.

Improper
    disclosure of personal data could result in legal liability or
    harm our reputation.

One of our significant responsibilities is to maintain the
    security and privacy of our clients’ confidential and
    proprietary information and the personal data of their
    employees. We maintain policies, procedures and technological
    safeguards designed to protect the security and privacy of this
    information in our database. However, we cannot entirely
    eliminate the risk of improper access to or disclosure of
    personally identifiable information. Our technology may fail to
    adequately secure the private information we maintain in our
    databases and protect it from theft, computer viruses, hackers
    or inadvertent loss. In such circumstances, we may be held
    liable to our clients, which could result in legal liability or
    impairment to our reputation resulting in increased costs or
    loss of revenue. Further database privacy, identity theft, and
    related computer and internet issues are matters of growing
    public concern and are subject to frequently changing rules and
    regulations. Our failure to adhere to or successfully implement
    processes in response to changing regulatory requirements in
    this area could result in legal liability or impairment to our
    reputation in the marketplace.

Financial
    Risks

Our outstanding
    debt could adversely affect our cash flows and financial
    flexibility.

We had total consolidated debt outstanding of approximately
    $2.4 billion as of December 31, 2011 and our 2011
    interest expense was $156 million. Although management
    believes that our cash flows will be sufficient to service this
    debt, there may be circumstances in which required payments of
    principal

and/or

interest on this debt could adversely affect our cash flows and
    this level of indebtedness may:

•

require us to dedicate a significant portion of our cash flow
    from operations to payments on our debt, thereby reducing the
    availability of cash flow to fund capital expenditures, to
    pursue other acquisitions or investments in new technologies, to
    pay dividends and for general corporate purposes;

•

increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic
    conditions, including if we borrow at variable interest rates,
    which makes us vulnerable to increases in interest rates
    generally;

•

limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes
    or challenges relating to our business and industry; and



Risk factors

•

put us at a competitive disadvantage against competitors who
    have less indebtedness or are in a more favorable position to
    access additional capital resources.

The terms of our current financings also include certain
    limitations. For example, the agreements relating to the debt
    arrangements and credit facilities contain numerous operating
    and financial covenants, including requirements to maintain
    minimum ratios of consolidated EBITDA to consolidated cash
    interest expense and maximum levels of consolidated funded
    indebtedness in relation to consolidated EBITDA, in each case
    subject to certain adjustments.

A failure to comply with the restrictions under our credit
    facilities and outstanding notes could result in a default under
    the financing obligations or could require us to obtain waivers
    from our lenders for failure to comply with these restrictions.
    The occurrence of a default that remains uncured or the
    inability to secure a necessary consent or waiver could cause
    our obligations with respect to our debt to be accelerated and
    have a material adverse effect on our business, financial
    condition or results of operations.

Our pension
    liabilities may increase which could require us to make
    additional cash contributions to our pension plans reducing the
    cash available for other uses.

We have two principal defined benefit plans: one in the United
    Kingdom and the other in the United States, and in addition, we
    have several smaller defined benefit pension plans in certain
    other countries in which we operate. Cash contributions of
    approximately $142 million will be required in 2012 for
    these pension plans, although we may elect to contribute more.
    Total cash contributions to these defined benefit pension plans
    in 2011 were $135 million. Future estimates are based on
    certain assumptions, including discount rates, interest rates,
    mortality, fair value of assets and expected return on plan
    assets.

In early 2012 we provisionally agreed a revised funding strategy
    with the UK plan’s trustee. Whilst the proposed new funding
    strategy has not been definitively agreed at the date of this
    report, we expect this to occur by the end of March 2012, and we
    expect the cash contributions to the scheme in 2012 to be
    approximately equal to those in 2011.

We have taken actions to manage our pension liabilities,
    including closing our UK and US plans to new participants and
    restricting final pensionable salaries. Future benefit accruals
    in the US pension plan were also stopped, or frozen, on
    May 15, 2009. Nevertheless, the determination of pension
    expense and pension funding is based on a variety of rules and
    regulations. Changes in these rules and regulations could impact
    the calculation of pension plan liabilities and the valuation of
    pension plan assets. They may also result in higher pension
    costs, additional financial statement disclosure, and accelerate
    and increase the need to fully fund our pension plans through
    increased cash contributions. Further, a significant decline in
    the value of investments that fund our pension plan, if not
    offset or mitigated by a decline in our liabilities, may
    significantly alter the values and actuarial assumptions used to
    calculate our future pension expense and we could be required to
    fund our plan with significant additional amounts of cash. In
    addition to the critical assumptions described above, our plans
    use certain assumptions about the life expectancy of plan
    participants and surviving spouses. Periodic revision of those
    assumptions can materially change the present value of future
    benefits and therefore the funded status of the plans and the
    resulting periodic pension expense. Changes in our pension
    benefit obligations, the related net periodic costs or credits,
    and the required level of future cash contributions, may occur
    in the future due to any variance of actual results from our
    assumptions and changes in the number of participating
    employees. The need to make additional cash contributions may
    reduce the Company’s financial flexibility and increase
    liquidity risk by reducing the cash available to meet our other
    obligations, including the payment obligations under our credit
    facilities and other long-term debt, or other needs of our
    business.

We could incur
    substantial losses, including with respect to our own cash and
    fiduciary cash held on behalf of insurance companies and
    clients, if one of the financial institutions we use in our
    operations failed.

The deterioration of the global credit and financial markets has
    created challenging conditions for financial institutions,
    including depositories. As the fallout from the credit crisis
    persists, the financial strength of these institutions may
    continue to decline. We maintain significant cash balances at
    various US depository institutions that are significantly in
    excess of the US Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation insurance
    limits. We also maintain significant cash balances in



Willis Group
    Holdings plc

foreign financial institutions. A significant portion of this
    fiduciary cash is held on behalf of insurance companies or
    clients. If one or more of the institutions in which we maintain
    significant cash balances were to fail, our ability to access
    these funds might be temporarily or permanently limited, and we
    could face a material liquidity problem and potentially material
    financial losses. We could also be liable to claims made by the
    insurance companies or our clients regarding the fiduciary cash
    held on their behalf.

A downgrade to
    our corporate credit rating and the credit ratings of our
    outstanding debt may adversely affect our borrowing costs and
    financial flexibility.

A downgrade in our corporate credit rating or the credit ratings
    of our debt would increase our borrowing costs including those
    under our credit facilities, and reduce our financial
    flexibility. In addition, certain downgrades would trigger a

step-up

in
    interest rates under the indentures for our 6.2% senior
    notes due 2017 and our 7.0% senior notes due 2019

,

which would increase our interest expense. If we need to
    raise capital in the future, any credit rating downgrade could
    negatively affect our financing costs or access to financing
    sources. This may in turn impact the assumptions when performing
    our goodwill impairment testing which may reduce the excess of
    fair value over carrying value of the reporting units.

We face certain
    risks associated with the acquisition or disposition of
    businesses or reorganization of existing investments.

In pursuing our corporate strategy, we may acquire or dispose of
    or exit businesses or reorganize existing investments. The
    success of this strategy is dependent upon our ability to
    identify appropriate opportunities, negotiate transactions on
    favorable terms and ultimately complete such transactions. Once
    we complete acquisitions or reorganizations there can be no
    assurance that we will realize the anticipated benefits of any
    transaction, including revenue growth, operational efficiencies
    or expected synergies. For example, if we fail to recognize some
    or all of the strategic benefits and synergies expected from a
    transaction, goodwill and intangible assets may be impaired in
    future periods. In addition, we may not be able to integrate
    acquisitions successfully into our existing business, and we
    could incur or assume unknown or unanticipated liabilities or
    contingencies, which may impact our results of operations. If we
    dispose of or otherwise exit certain businesses, there can be no
    assurance that we will not incur certain disposition related
    charges, or that we will be able to reduce overheads related to
    the divested assets. We also own an interest in a number of
    associates, such as Gras Savoye, where we do not exercise
    management control and we are therefore unable to direct or
    manage the business to realize the anticipated benefits that we
    can achieve through full integration.

We are a holding
    company and, therefore, may not be able to receive dividends or
    other distributions in needed amounts from our
    subsidiaries.

Willis Group Holdings is organized as a holding company that
    conducts no business of its own. We are dependent upon dividends
    and other payments from our operating subsidiaries to meet our
    obligations for paying principal and interest on outstanding
    debt obligations, for paying dividends to shareholders and for
    corporate expenses. Legal and regulatory restrictions, foreign
    exchange controls, as well as operating requirements of our
    subsidiaries, may limit our ability to obtain cash from these
    subsidiaries. In the event our operating subsidiaries are unable
    to pay dividends and make other payments to Willis Group
    Holdings, we may not be able to service debt, pay obligations or
    pay dividends on ordinary shares.

If our goodwill
    becomes impaired, we may be required to record significant
    charges to earnings.

We have a substantial amount of goodwill on our balance sheet as
    a result of acquisitions we have completed. We review goodwill
    for impairment annually or whenever events or circumstances
    indicate impairment may have occurred.

Application of the impairment test requires judgment, including
    the identification of reporting units, assignment of assets,
    liabilities and goodwill to reporting units and determination of
    fair value of each reporting unit. A significant deterioration



Risk factors

in a key estimate or assumption or a less significant
    deterioration to a combination of assumptions or the sale of a
    part of a reporting unit could result in an impairment charge in
    the future, which could have a significant adverse impact on our
    reported earnings.

Our annual goodwill impairment analysis is performed each year
    at October 1. At October 1, 2011 our analysis showed
    the estimated fair value of each reporting unit was in excess of
    the carrying value, and therefore did not result in an
    impairment charge (2010: $nil, 2009: $nil). The fair values of
    the Global and International reporting units were significantly
    in excess of their carrying values. The fair value of the North
    American unit exceeded its carrying value by approximately
    14 percent.

In the fourth quarter of 2011 our North America segment
    continued to be hampered by declining Loan Protector business
    results, the effect of the soft economy in the U.S. and
    declining retention rates primarily related to M&A activity
    and lost legacy HRH business. Consequently, the annual
    impairment test described above included additional sensitivity
    analysis, over and above that we would usually perform, in
    relation to our North America segment’s goodwill impairment
    review. This additional analysis included reductions to assumed
    rates of revenue growth, increases to assumed rates of expense
    growth and flexing the assumed weighted average cost of capital.
    Although our testing concluded there is no impairment, the
    analysis indicated that in respect of the North America segment,
    in the event of either a significant deterioration in a key
    estimate or assumption or a less significant deterioration to a
    combination of assumptions or the sale of part of the reporting
    unit there could be an impairment to the carrying value in
    future periods.

For further information on our testing for goodwill impairment,
    see ‘Critical Accounting Estimates’ under Item 7,
    Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition
    and Results of Operations.

International
    Risks

Our significant
    non-US operations, particularly our London market operations,
    expose us to exchange rate fluctuations and various risks that
    could impact our business.

A significant portion of our operations is conducted outside the
    United States. Accordingly, we are subject to legal, economic
    and market risks associated with operating in foreign countries,
    including devaluations and fluctuations in currency exchange
    rates; imposition of limitations on conversion of foreign
    currencies into pounds sterling or dollars or remittance of
    dividends and other payments by foreign subsidiaries;
    hyperinflation in certain foreign countries; imposition or
    increase of investment and other restrictions by foreign
    governments; and the requirement of complying with a wide
    variety of foreign laws.

We report our operating results and financial condition in US
    dollars. Our US operations earn revenue and incur expenses
    primarily in US dollars. In our London market operations,
    however, we earn revenue in a number of different currencies,
    but expenses are almost entirely incurred in pounds sterling.
    Outside the United States and our London market operations, we
    predominantly generate revenue and expenses in the local
    currency. The table gives an approximate analysis of revenues
    and expenses by currency in 2011.

Because of devaluations and fluctuations in currency exchange
    rates or the imposition of limitations on conversion of foreign
    currencies into US dollars, we are subject to currency
    translation exposure on the profits of our operations, in
    addition to economic exposure. Furthermore, the mismatch between
    pounds sterling revenues and expenses, together with any net
    sterling balance sheet position we hold in our US dollar
    denominated London market operations, creates an exchange
    exposure.

For example, as the pound sterling strengthens, the US dollars
    required to be translated into pounds sterling to cover the net
    sterling expenses increase, which then causes our results to be
    negatively impacted. However, any net sterling asset we



Willis Group
    Holdings plc

are holding will be more valuable when translated into US
    dollars. Given these facts, the strength of the pound sterling
    relative to the US dollar has in the past had a material
    negative impact on our reported results. This risk could have a
    material adverse effect on our business financial condition,
    cash flow and results of operations in the future.

Where possible, we hedge part of our operating exposure to
    exchange rate movements, but such mitigating attempts may not be
    successful.

In conducting our
    businesses around the world, we are subject to political,
    economic, legal, market, nationalization, operational and other
    risks that are inherent in operating in many
    countries.

In conducting our businesses and maintaining and supporting our
    global operations, we are subject to political, economic, legal,
    market, nationalization, operational and other risks. Our
    businesses and operations continue to expand into new regions
    throughout the world, including emerging markets. The possible
    effects of economic and financial disruptions throughout the
    world could have an adverse impact on our businesses. These
    risks include:

•

the general economic and political conditions in foreign
    countries, for example

,

the potential dissolution of the
    euro and the 2010 devaluation of the Venezuelan Bolivar;

•

the imposition of controls or limitations on the conversion of
    foreign currencies or remittance of dividends and other payments
    by foreign subsidiaries;

•

imposition of withholding and other taxes on remittances and
    other payments from subsidiaries;

•

imposition or increase of investment and other restrictions by
    foreign governments;

•

difficulties in controlling operations and monitoring employees
    in geographically dispersed and culturally diverse
    locations; and

•

the potential costs and difficulties in complying, or monitoring
    compliance, with a wide variety of foreign laws (some of which
    may conflict with US or other sources of law), laws and
    regulations applicable to US business operations abroad,
    including rules relating to trade sanctions administered by the
    US Office of Foreign Assets Control, the EU, the UK and the UN,
    and the requirements of the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act as
    well as other anti-bribery and corruption rules and requirements
    in the countries in which we operate.

Legislative and
    regulatory action could materially and adversely affect us and
    our effective tax rate may increase.

There is uncertainty regarding the tax policies of the
    jurisdictions where we operate (which include the potential
    legislative actions described below), and our effective tax rate
    may increase and any such increase may be material.
    Additionally, the tax laws of Ireland and other jurisdictions
    could change in the future, and such changes could cause a
    material change in our effective tax rate. For example,
    legislative action may be taken by the US Congress which, if
    ultimately enacted, could override tax treaties upon which we
    rely or could broaden the circumstances under which we would be
    considered a US resident, each of which could materially and
    adversely affect our effective tax rate and cash tax position.
    We cannot predict the outcome of any specific legislative
    proposals. However, if proposals were enacted that had the
    effect of limiting our ability to take advantage of tax treaties
    between Ireland and other jurisdictions (including the US), we
    could be subjected to increased taxation. In addition, any
    future amendments to the current income tax treaties between
    Ireland and other jurisdictions could subject us to increased
    taxation.

Irish law differs
    from the laws in effect in the United States and may afford less
    protection to holders of our securities.

It may not be possible to enforce court judgments obtained in
    the United States against us in Ireland based on the civil
    liability provisions of the US federal or state securities laws.
    In addition, there is some uncertainty as to whether the courts
    of Ireland would recognize or enforce judgments of US courts
    obtained against us or our directors or officers based on the
    civil liabilities provisions of the US federal or state
    securities laws or hear actions against us or those persons
    based on those laws. We have been advised that the United States
    currently does not have a treaty with Ireland providing



Risk factors

for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments in
    civil and commercial matters. Therefore, a final judgment for
    the payment of money rendered by any US federal or state court
    based on civil liability, whether or not based solely on US
    federal or state securities laws, would not be directly
    enforceable in Ireland. While not directly enforceable, it is
    possible for a final judgment for the payment of money rendered
    by any US federal or state court based on civil liability to be
    enforced in Ireland through common law rules. However, this
    process is subject to numerous established principles and would
    involve the commencement of a new set of proceedings in Ireland
    to enforce the judgment.

As an Irish company, Willis Group Holdings is governed by the
    Irish Companies Acts, which differ in some material respects
    from laws generally applicable to US corporations and
    shareholders, including, among others, differences relating to
    interested director and officer transactions and shareholder
    lawsuits. Likewise, the duties of directors and officers of an
    Irish company generally are owed to the company only.
    Shareholders of Irish companies generally do not have a personal
    right of action against directors or officers of the company and
    may exercise such rights of action on behalf of the Company only
    in limited circumstances. Accordingly, holders of Willis Group
    Holdings securities may have more difficulty protecting their
    interests than would holders of securities of a corporation
    incorporated in a jurisdiction of the United States.

Our non-core
    operations pose certain underwriting, advisory or reputational
    risks and can have, such as our Loan Protector business, a
    significant adverse impact on our financial results.

We provide a broad range of brokerage, reinsurance and risk
    management consulting services to our clients worldwide. We also
    engage in certain non-core operations. For example, our Willis
    Capital Markets & Advisory business provides advice to
    insurance and reinsurance companies on a broad array of mergers
    and acquisition transactions as well as capital markets
    products, including acting as underwriter or agent for primary
    issuances, operating a secondary insurance-linked securities
    trading desk and engaging in general capital markets and
    strategic advisory work. These operations may pose certain
    underwriting, advisory or reputational risks to our core
    business.

In addition, these non-core operations, although not material to
    the Group as a whole may, in any period, have a material effect
    on our results of operations. For example, our Willis Capital
    Markets & Advisory business is transaction-based which
    can cause results to differ from

period-to-period.

In addition, our financial results in 2011 were adversely
    impacted by the significant deterioration of the financial
    results of our Loan Protector business driven by the loss of
    clients through attrition and M&A activity, industry-wide
    commission pressures and a slowdown in foreclosures.

    Properties

We own and lease a number of properties for use as offices
    throughout the world and believe that our properties are
    generally suitable and adequate for the purposes for which they
    are used. The principal properties are located in the United
    Kingdom and the United States. Willis maintains over
    4.2 million square feet of space worldwide.

London

In London we occupy a prime site comprising 491,000 square
    feet spread over a 28 story tower and adjoining 10 story
    building. We have a

25-year

lease on this property which expires June 2032 and we

sub-let

the
    10-story adjoining building. In September 2011 approximately
    17,500 square feet of the 28 story tower was sublet to a
    third party, a further 52,000 square feet is being marketed.

North
    America

In North America, outside of New York and Chicago, we lease
    approximately 1.9 million square feet over 120 locations.

New
    York

In New York, we occupy 205,000 square feet of office space
    at One World Financial Center under a 20 year lease,
    expiring September 2026.

Chicago

In Chicago, we occupy 140,000 square feet at the Willis
    Tower (formerly the Sears Tower), under a lease expiring
    February 2025.

Nashville

In 2010 we renegotiated our lease and began a major restack of
    our operations facility in Nashville. The first stage was
    completed in December 2010 and the remainder was completed in
    May 2011. We reduced our square footage from 327,000 square
    feet to 160,000 square feet eliminating sublet space.

Rest of
    World

Outside of North America and London we lease approximately
    1.5 million square feet of office space in over 150

There are no governmental laws, decrees or regulations in
    Ireland which will restrict the remittance of dividends or other
    payments to non-resident holders of the Company’s shares.

In circumstances where one of Ireland’s many exemptions
    from dividend withholding tax (‘DWT’) does not apply,
    dividends paid by the Company will be subject to Irish DWT
    (currently 20 percent). Residents of the US should be
    exempted from Irish DWT provided relevant documentation
    supporting the exemption has been put in place. While the
    US-Ireland Double Tax Treaty contains provisions reducing the
    rate of Irish DWT in prescribed circumstances, it should
    generally be unnecessary for US residents to rely on the
    provisions of this treaty due to the wide scope of exemptions
    from DWT available under Irish domestic law. Irish income tax
    may also arise in respect of dividends paid by the



Willis Group
    Holdings plc

Company. However, US residents entitled to an exemption from
    Irish DWT generally have no Irish income tax liability on
    dividends. An exception to this position applies where a
    shareholder holds shares in the Company through a branch or
    agency in Ireland through which a trade is carried on.

With respect to non-corporate US shareholders, certain dividends
    received before January 1, 2011 from a qualified foreign
    corporation may be subject to reduced rates of taxation. A
    foreign corporation is treated as a qualified foreign
    corporation with respect to dividends received from that
    corporation on shares that are readily tradable on an
    established securities market in the United States, such as our
    shares. Non-corporate US shareholders that do not meet a minimum
    holding period requirement for our shares during which they are
    not protected from the risk of loss or that elect to treat the
    dividend income as ‘investment income’ pursuant to
    section 163(d)(4) of the Code will not be eligible for the
    reduced rates of taxation regardless of our status as a
    qualified foreign corporation. In addition, the rate reduction
    will not apply to dividends if the recipient of a dividend is
    obligated to make related payments with respect to positions in
    substantially similar or related property. This disallowance
    applies even if the minimum holding period has been met. US
    shareholders should consult their own tax advisors regarding the
    application of these rules given their particular circumstances.

Management’s
    Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
    Operations

This discussion includes forward-looking statements,
    including under the headings ‘Executive Summary’,
    ‘Liquidity and Capital Resources’, ‘Critical
    Accounting Estimates’ and ‘Contractual
    Obligations’. Please see ‘Forward-Looking
    Statements’ for certain cautionary information regarding
    forward-looking statements and a list of factors that could
    cause actual results to differ materially from those predicted
    in the forward-looking statements.

EXECUTIVE
    SUMMARY

Business
    Overview

We provide a broad range of insurance broking, risk management
    and consulting services to our clients worldwide and organize
    our business into three segments: Global, North America and
    International.

Our Global business provides specialist brokerage and consulting
    services to clients worldwide arising from specific industries
    and activities including Aerospace; Energy; Marine;
    Construction; Financial and Executive Risks; Fine Art, Jewelry
    and Specie; Special Contingency Risks; and Reinsurance.

North America and International comprise our retail operations
    and provide services to small, medium and large corporations and
    the employee benefits practice, our largest product-based
    practice group, provides health, welfare and human resources
    consulting and brokerage services.

In our capacity as advisor and insurance broker, we act as an
    intermediary between our clients and insurance carriers by
    advising our clients on their risk management requirements,
    helping clients determine the best means of managing risk, and
    negotiating and placing insurance with insurance carriers
    through our global distribution network.

We derive most of our revenues from commissions and fees for
    brokerage and consulting services and do not determine the
    insurance premiums on which our commissions are generally based.
    Commission levels generally follow the same trend as premium
    levels as they are derived from a percentage of the premiums
    paid by the insureds. Fluctuations in these premiums charged by
    the insurance carriers can therefore have a direct and
    potentially material impact on our results of operations.

Due to the cyclical nature of the insurance market and the
    impact of other market conditions on insurance premiums,
    commission revenues may vary widely between accounting periods.
    A period of low or declining premium rates, generally known as a
    ‘soft’ or ‘softening’ market, generally
    leads to downward pressure on commission revenues and can have a
    material adverse impact on our commission revenues and operating
    margin. A ‘hard’ or ‘firming’ market, during
    which premium rates rise, generally has a favorable impact on
    our commission revenues and operating margin.

Market
    Conditions

The years 2005 through 2010 were almost universally viewed as
    soft market years across most of our product offerings and our
    commission revenues and operating margins throughout that period
    were negatively impacted, although in 2009 the market
    experienced modest stabilization in the reinsurance market and
    certain specialty markets.

Our North America and UK and Irish retail operations were
    particularly impacted by the weakened economic climate and
    continued soft market throughout 2009 and 2010 with no material
    improvement in rates across most sectors in these geographic
    regions. This resulted in declines in revenues in these
    operations, particularly amongst our smaller clients who have
    been especially vulnerable to the economic downturn.

In 2011, we saw some modest increases in catastrophe-exposed
    property insurance and reinsurance pricing levels driven by
    significant 2011 catastrophe losses including the Japanese
    earthquake and tsunami, the New Zealand earthquake, the



Willis Group
    Holdings plc

mid-west US tornadoes and Thailand floods. However, in general,
    we continued to be negatively impacted by the soft insurance
    market and challenging economic conditions across other sectors
    and most geographic regions.

We believe that, in the absence of a significant catastrophe
    loss or capital impairment in the industry, a universal turn in
    market rates is not likely to occur. However, more recently we
    have not seen the same reduction in rates globally that were
    faced in early 2011 and during 2010 and 2009. There have been
    recent signs that the unprofitability of certain business lines
    such as property catastrophe and workers compensation is slowly
    firming rates in those lines. Additionally, there has been some
    evidence of firming or hardening in certain sectors of the
    reinsurance market in early 2012.

Financial
    Performance

General

This discussion includes references to non-GAAP financial
    measures as defined in Regulation G of the rules of the
    Securities and Exchange Commission (‘SEC’). We present
    such non-GAAP financial measures, specifically, organic growth
    in commissions and fees, adjusted operating margin, adjusted
    operating income, adjusted net income from continuing operations
    and adjusted earnings per diluted share from continuing
    operations, as we believe such information is of interest to the
    investment community because it provides additional meaningful
    methods of evaluating certain aspects of the Company’s
    operating performance from period to period on a basis that may
    not be otherwise apparent on a GAAP basis. Organic growth in
    commissions and fees excludes the impact of acquisitions and
    disposals, year over year movements in foreign exchange, legacy
    contingent commissions assumed as part of the HRH acquisition,
    and investment and other income from growth in revenues and
    commissions and fees. Adjusted operating margin, adjusted net
    income from continuing operations and adjusted earnings per
    diluted share from continuing operations are calculated by
    excluding the impact of certain specified items from net income
    from continuing operations, the most directly comparable GAAP
    measure. These financial measures should be viewed in addition
    to, not in lieu of, the consolidated financial statements for
    the year ended December 31, 2011.

Consolidated
    Financial Performance

2011 compared to

Despite difficult market conditions, total revenues in 2011 of
    $3,447 million increased by $115 million, or 3%,
    compared to 2010. This included organic growth in commissions
    and fees of 2% driven by our International and Global
    operations. Our North America operations reported a revenue
    decline of 4%, including a 4% decline in organic commissions and
    fees reflecting lower revenues generated by Loan Protector, a
    specialty business acquired as part of the HRH business, and the
    continued adverse impact of difficult economic conditions in the
    US.

Total expenses in 2011 of $2,881 million increased
    $302 million compared to 2010, primarily due to incremental
    expense relating to the 2011 Operational Review (discussed later
    in this section), a $22 million write-off of an
    uncollectible accounts receivable balance relating to periods
    prior to January 1, 2011, also discussed later in this
    section, continued investment to support future growth,
    increased incentives amortization relating to our cash retention
    awards, reinstatement of salary reviews for all associates in
    March 2011 and 401(k) matching contributions for our US
    associates from January 2011, unfavorable foreign currency
    translation and an $11 million UK FSA regulatory
    settlement. These increases were partially offset by cost
    savings arising from implementation of the 2011 Operational
    Review, reduced pension expense of $24 million and the

year-on-year

$8 million benefit from the release of funds and reserves
    related to potential legal liabilities.

Net income attributable to Willis shareholders from continuing
    operations was $203 million or $1.15 per diluted share in
    2011 compared to $455 million or $2.66 per diluted share in
    2010. The $252 million reduction in net income compared to
    2010 primarily reflects the increase in total expenses described
    above and the $131 million post-tax cost relating to the
    make-whole amounts on the repurchase and redemption of
    $500 million of our senior debt and the write-off of
    related unamortized debt issuance costs, partly offset by
    revenue growth achieved during the year. Net income was also
    adversely impacted by an $11 million reduction in interest
    in earnings of associates, net of tax, mainly due to declining
    performance in our principal associate, Gras Savoye.



Business discussion

2010 compared to

Total revenues in 2010 of $3,332 million increased by
    $79 million, or 2%, compared to 2009, reflecting organic
    growth in commissions and fees of 4% being partly offset by a 1%
    adverse impact from foreign currency translation and decreased
    investment and other income. Total expenses in 2010 of
    $2,579 million, were $16 million higher compared to
    2009. Salaries and benefits expense increased by
    $46 million, primarily due to a $60 million increase
    in incentive expense, partly offset by reduced severance costs
    and favorable foreign currency translation. Other operating
    expenses declined by $26 million, driven by reduced losses
    on our forward hedging program and a reduction in the
    amortization of intangible assets of $18 million due to a
    lower amortization charge for HRH-related intangibles.

Net income attributable to Willis shareholders from continuing
    operations was $455 million or $2.66 per diluted share in
    2010 compared to $434 million or $2.57 per diluted share in
    2009. The $21 million increase in net income compared to
    2009 primarily reflects the revenue growth described above,
    partly offset by the $16 million increase in total
    expenses, an increase in the effective tax rate from 18% in 2009
    to 24% in 2010 and a $10 million reduction in interest in
    earnings of associates, net of tax following the December 2009
    reduction from 49% to 31% in our ownership interest in Gras
    Savoye.

Adjusted
    Operating Income, Adjusted Net Income from Continuing Operations
    and Adjusted Earnings per Diluted Share from Continuing
    Operations

Adjusted operating income, adjusted net income from continuing
    operations and adjusted earnings per diluted share from
    continuing operations are calculated by excluding the impact of
    certain items from operating income and net income from
    continuing operations respectively, the most directly comparable
    GAAP measures. We believe that excluding these items, as
    applicable, from operating income and net income from continuing
    operations provides a more complete and consistent comparative
    analysis of our results of operations. We use these and other
    measures to establish Group performance targets and evaluate the
    performance of our operations. The Company also uses both
    adjusted earnings per diluted share from continuing operations
    and adjusted operating margin measures to form the basis of
    establishing and assessing components of compensation. As set
    out in the tables below, adjusted operating margin at 22.5% in
    2011, was down 50 basis points compared to 2010, while
    adjusted net income from continuing operations at
    $482 million was $12 million higher than in 2010 and
    adjusted earnings per diluted share from continuing operations
    was $2.74 in 2011, compared to $2.75 in 2010.

A reconciliation of adjusted operating income to reported
    operating income, the most directly comparable GAAP measure, is
    as follows (in millions, except percentages):

2011 Operational
    review

In order to fund the higher anticipated salaries and benefits
    expense and continued investment for the future, we implemented
    a review of all our businesses in 2011 to better align our
    resources with our growth strategies. In connection with this
    review, we incurred pre-tax charges of $180 million in 2011
    including:

•

$98 million of severance costs (including $9 million
    relating to the waiver of retention awards) relating to
    approximately 1,200 positions which have been, or are in the
    process of being, eliminated;

•

$37 million of other salaries and benefits expense to buy
    out previously existing incentive schemes and other contractual
    arrangements that no longer align with the Group’s overall
    remuneration strategy; and

•

$45 million of other operating expenses, including:
    property and systems rationalization costs; related accelerated
    systems depreciation of $5 million; and re-negotiation of
    sourcing contracts.



Business discussion

The full year cost of the 2011 Operational Review at
    $180 million represents an increase of $20 million
    from our third quarter 2011 estimate. This is the result of the
    identification of additional opportunities to achieve
    efficiencies.

In 2011 we realized total cost savings attributable to the 2011
    Operational Review of approximately $80 million. We now
    expect to achieve annualized savings of approximately
    $135 million beginning in 2012, an increase from our
    previous estimate of $115 million to $125 million, and
    represents incremental savings in 2012 compared to 2011 of
    approximately $55 million.

The statements under ‘2011 Operational Review’
    constitute forward-looking statements. Please see
    ‘Forward-Looking Statements’ for certain cautionary
    information regarding forward-looking statements and a list of
    factors that could cause actual results to differ materially
    from those predicted in the forward-looking statements.

Make-whole on
    repurchase and redemption of senior notes and write-off of
    unamortized debt issuance costs

We issued $800 million of new debt in March 2011, comprised
    of $300 million 4.125% senior notes due 2016 and
    $500 million 5.750% senior notes due 2021. Net
    proceeds of approximately $787 million were used in part to
    repurchase and redeem $500 million 12.875% senior
    notes due 2016 and make related make-whole payments totaling
    $158 million. In addition to the make-whole payment we also
    wrote off unamortized debt issuance costs of $13 million.

Correction of
    commissions and fees overstatement relating to 2011 and prior
    periods

In the first quarter of 2012, we identified through our internal
    financial control process an uncollectible accounts receivable
    balance of approximately $28 million in a stand-alone business
    unit that appears to be due to fraudulent overstatements of
    Commissions and Fees from the years 2005 to 2011. This matter
    was brought to management’s attention after we had
    announced our fourth quarter and annual earnings on February 14,
    2012.

The Company is conducting an internal investigation into this
    matter with the assistance of our professional advisors. Based
    on the results of the investigation to date, we believe that the
    overstatements resulted from the conduct of a few associates
    within or dealing with our Employee Benefits group who colluded
    to misapply certain current cash receipts to older outstanding
    accounts receivable balances. We have concluded that the
    overstatements we uncovered did not materially affect our
    previously-issued financial statements for any of the prior
    periods.

For the year ended December 31, 2011, we have corrected the
    misstatement of Commissions and Fees from prior periods by
    recognizing a $22 million charge to Other Operating Expenses to
    write off the uncollectible receivable at January 1, 2011, and
    by reversing the $6 million balance of Commissions and Fees
    which had been recorded during 2011. We have also reversed $2
    million of Salaries and Benefits representing an over-accrual of
    production bonuses relating to the overstated revenue. As a
    result of correcting these misstatements, our financial
    statements for 2011 differ in certain immaterial respects,
    including a net $0.01 reduction in adjusted earnings per diluted
    share, from the unaudited financial statements included in our
    press release issued on February 14, 2012.

The associates in question, who have been placed on
    administrative leave pending completion of the investigation,
    have not been members of Willis executive management or played a
    significant role in internal control over financial reporting.
    Based on the results of our investigation to date, we do not
    believe that any client or carrier funds were misappropriated or
    that any other business units were affected.

We have taken steps to enhance our internal controls in relation
    to the business unit in question, including enhanced procedures
    over handling of cash receipts, increased segregation of duties

Cash retention
    awards

We started making cash retention awards in 2005 to a small
    number of employees. With the success of the program, we
    expanded it over time to include more staff and we believe it is
    a contributing factor to the reduction in employee turnover we
    have seen in recent years.

Salaries and benefits do not reflect the unamortized portion of
    annual cash retention awards made to employees. Employees must
    repay a proportionate amount of these cash retention awards if
    they voluntarily leave our employ (other than in the event of
    retirement or permanent disability) within a certain time
    period, currently three years. We make cash payments to our
    employees in the year we grant these retention awards and
    recognize these payments ratably over the period they are
    subject to repayment, beginning in the quarter in which the
    award is made.

During 2011, we made $210 million of cash retention award
    payments compared with $196 million in 2010 and
    $148 million in 2009. Salaries and benefits in 2011 include
    $185 million of amortization of cash retention award
    payments made on or before December 31, 2011, compared with
    $119 million in 2010 and $88 million in 2009. As of
    December 31, 2011, December 31, 2010 and
    December 31, 2009, we included $196 million,
    $173 million and $98 million, respectively, within
    other current assets and other non-current assets on the balance
    sheet, which represented the unamortized portion of cash
    retention award payments made on or before those dates.

Pension
    Expense

We recorded a net pension charge on our UK and US defined
    benefit pension plans in 2011 of $6 million, and $nil
    respectively, compared with $28 million and $1 million
    respectively in 2010 and $25 million and $7 million
    respectively in 2009. On our international defined benefit
    pension plans, we recorded a net pension charge of
    $5 million in 2011, compared with $6 million in 2010
    and $10 million in 2009.

The UK plan charge was $22 million lower compared to 2010
    as the benefits of higher asset returns, lower amortization of
    prior period losses and a lower service cost reflecting certain
    changes to plan benefits were partly offset by an increased
    interest cost. The UK pension charge was $3 million higher
    in 2010 compared to 2009 as the benefit from higher asset
    returns was more than offset by a higher service cost, higher
    amortization of prior period losses and higher interest cost.

The US pension charge was $1 million lower in 2011 compared
    with 2010 reflecting an increased asset return from a higher
    asset base partly offset by a reduction in amortization of prior
    period losses. The US pension charge was $6 million lower
    in 2010 compared to 2009 reflecting an increased asset return, a
    reduction in the amortization of prior period losses and the
    first full year’s benefit from closing the scheme to future
    accrual in May 2009, partly offset by the non-recurrence of a
    $12 million curtailment gain in 2009.

See ‘Contractual Obligations’ below for further
    information on our obligations relating to our pension plans.

Acquisitions and
    Disposals

During first quarter 2011, we acquired a 23% interest in a South
    African brokerage at a total cost of $2 million. During
    third quarter 2011, we acquired a 100% interest in a Polish
    brokerage, Brokerskie Centrum Ubezpieczeniowe, at a total cost
    of $2 million. In the fourth quarter 2011, we acquired 100%
    of Broking Italia, a Rome-based employee benefits broker at a
    total cost of $12 million.

During 2010, we acquired an additional 39% of our Chinese
    operations at a total cost of approximately $17 million,
    bringing our ownership to 90% and an additional 15% of our
    Colombian operations at a total cost of approximately
    $7 million, bringing our ownership to 80% at
    December 31, 2010.

On December 31, 2011, we disposed of Global Special Risks,
    LLC, Faber & Dumas Canada Ltd and the trade and assets
    of Maclean, Oddy & Associates, Inc. We have recorded
    within Discontinued Operations, net income of $1 million in



Business discussion

associated with these entities, comprising a net loss for the
    year of $1 million offset by the benefit of a
    $2 million net gain on disposal.

Revenue increased by $115 million, or 3%, in 2011 compared
    to 2010. Commissions and fees increased by $121 million or
    4%, including organic growth in commissions and fees of 2%,
    which comprised 4% net new business growth driven by solid new
    business generation and higher retention of existing clients,
    and a 2% negative impact from renewal fluctuations and other
    market factors.

There was a net 2%

year-over-year

benefit to revenue growth from foreign currency translation
    driven by the weakening of the US dollar against a number of
    currencies in which we earn our revenues.

The 2% growth in organic commissions and fees comprised net
    growth in our operating segments:

•

Global achieved 7% growth, including growth in our Reinsurance,
    Global Specialties and Willis Faber and Dumas (formerly London
    Market Wholesale) businesses, together with a $6 million
    2011 benefit from a change in accounting within a Global
    Specialty business to conform to current Group accounting policy;

•

International achieved 5% organic growth driven primarily by our
    Latin America and Eastern Europe regions; and

•

North America reported a 4% decline in organic commissions and
    fees, primarily driven by the revenue decline in Loan Protector
    (a small specialty business acquired as part of the HRH business
    that works with financial institutions to confirm their loans
    are properly insured and interests are adequately protected).
    Excluding Loan Protector, the North America segment recorded a
    2% decline in organic commissions and fees as the benefit of new
    business generation was more than offset by a 1% decline in
    client retention levels, the continued negative impact of the
    soft market and ongoing weakened economic conditions in the US.

Investment income in 2011 at $31 million was
    $7 million lower than in 2010, as low interest rates across
    the globe, in particular in the UK and US, together with the
    roll-off of our interest rate hedge program continued to impact
    our investment income.



Willis Group
    Holdings plc

Organic commissions and fees growth by segment is discussed
    further in ‘Operating Results — Segment
    Information’, below.

Salaries and
    Benefits

Salaries and benefits increased $219 million, or 12% in
    2011, compared with 2010, primarily reflecting additional
    expense in 2011 of $135 million associated with our 2011
    Operational Review, a $66 million increase from the
    amortization of cash retention awards and the

year-on-year

net adverse impact from foreign currency translation, driven
    primarily by the movement of the US dollar against the Pound
    sterling (in which our London Market based operations incur the
    majority of their expenses). Furthermore, we incurred an
    additional $10 million expense relating to the
    reinstatement of our 401(k) match plan for our North America
    employees from January 2011 and incremental expense following
    reinstatement of annual salary reviews for all employees from
    April 2011. These increases were partly offset by cost savings
    arising from implementation of the 2011 Operational Review,
    reduced payments of non-retentive incentives and a
    $24 million decrease in pension expense driven by a higher
    return on assets and lower amortization of prior period gains
    and losses.

Other
    Expenses

Other operating expenses

were $92 million, or 16%,
    higher in 2011 compared with 2010, primarily reflecting
    $40 million of additional expense associated with the 2011
    Operational Review, a $22 million write-off of an
    uncollectible accounts receivable balance relating to periods
    prior to January 1, 2011, and discussed earlier in this
    section, the $11 million second quarter UK FSA regulatory
    settlement and increased expense in support of revenue growth
    initiatives. These were partly offset by cost savings arising
    from implementation of the 2011 Operational Review, the

year-over-year

favorable comparison due to the $12 million 2010 charge
    relating to the devaluation of the Venezuelan currency, the
    $8 million

year-over-year

benefit from the release of funds and reserves related to
    potential legal liabilities and positive

year-over-year

foreign currency translation, driven primarily by gains in 2011
    on our forward rate hedging program, compared to losses in 2010.

Depreciation expense

was $74 million in 2011,
    compared with $63 million in 2010. The increase primarily
    reflects accelerated depreciation expense of $5 million in
    2011 relating to systems rationalization in connection with the
    2011 Operational Review and depreciation of newly capitalized
    systems project costs in 2011.

Amortization of intangible assets

was $68 million in
    2011, a reduction of $14 million compared to 2010. The
    decrease primarily reflects the

year-over-year

benefit of the 2010 amortization of the HRH non-compete
    agreement acquired in 2008, which was fully amortized in 2010.

Make-whole on
    repurchase and redemption of senior notes and write-off of
    unamortized debt issuance costs

As described above, we issued $800 million of new debt in
    March 2011 and net proceeds of approximately $787 million
    were used to repurchase and redeem $500 million of
    12.875% senior notes due 2016 and make related make-whole
    payments totaling $158 million. In addition to the
    make-whole payment we also wrote off unamortized debt issuance
    costs of $13 million.

Interest
    Expense

Interest expense was $156 million in 2011, a reduction of
    $10 million compared to 2010. The decrease in interest
    expense primarily reflects the lower coupon payable on our new
    debt issued in March 2011, the

period-over-period

decrease in the outstanding balance on our

5-year

term
    loan facility and net gains recognized on our forward rate
    hedging program. These benefits were partially offset by the
    $10 million fourth quarter expense relating to the
    write-off of debt issuance costs following the refinancing of
    our bank facility.



Business discussion

Income
    Taxes

The effective tax rate on ordinary income for 2011 was 24%,
    compared with 26% for 2010, with the reduction driven primarily
    by the benefit from the higher tax rates at which costs
    associated with the 2011 Operational Review are relieved and a
    different geographic mix of business. The effective tax rate on
    ordinary income is calculated before the impact of certain
    discrete items. The significant discrete items occurring in 2011
    are:

•

tax related to the make-whole payment on repurchase and
    redemption of senior notes and write-off of unamortized debt
    issuance costs which are relieved at a higher rate than the
    underlying rate;

•

the net impact of gains and losses on disposals recorded in
    continuing operations;

•

tax related to the write-off of an uncollectible accounts
    receivable balance which is relieved at a higher rate than the
    underlying rate;

•

the impact of the UK FSA regulatory settlement expense for which
    no tax relief is available;

•

the impact of the change in rate of UK corporate income tax
    being applied to the Company’s opening temporary
    differences; and

•

adjustments made in respect of tax on profits of prior periods
    to bring in line the Company’s tax provisions to filed tax
    positions.

Including the impact of discrete items, the effective tax rate
    was 13% in 2011 compared to 24% in 2010.

Interest in
    Earnings of Associates, net of Tax

We own an interest in a number of associates, such as Gras
    Savoye, where we do not exercise management control and we are
    therefore unable to direct or manage the business to realize the
    anticipated benefits that we can achieve through full
    integration. Interest in earnings of associates, net of tax, was
    $12 million in 2011, compared with $23 million in
    2010. The decline was mainly driven by a reduction in net income
    reported by our principal associate, Gras Savoye, following
    recent refinancing actions taken by the company, ongoing
    restructuring activity and the negative impact on their results
    from adverse economic conditions in France and other parts of
    Europe.

Discontinued
    Operations, net of Tax

Net income from discontinued operations in 2011 relates to our
    fourth quarter disposal of Global Special Risks, LLC,
    Faber & Dumas Canada Ltd and the trade and assets of
    Maclean, Oddy & Associates, Inc. We recorded net
    income from discontinued operations of $1 million in 2011,
    comprising a net loss for the year of $1 million offset by
    the benefit of a $2 million net gain on disposal.

Revenue increased $79 million, or 2%, in 2010 compared to
    2009, reflecting organic growth in commissions and fees of 4%,
    offset by a 1% adverse impact from foreign currency translation
    and decreased investment and other income. Our Global segment
    achieved 7% organic growth in commission and fees and the
    International segment achieved 5% growth. North America organic
    commissions and fees growth was flat with the positive benefit
    from strong growth in our specialty businesses, driven by good
    business growth, together with a $7 million increase in
    commissions and fees from a change in accounting in an acquired
    specialty business to conform to current Group accounting
    policy, 3% growth in our employee benefits practice, good net
    new business generation and improved client retention, offset by
    the impact of the continued soft market and ongoing weakened
    economic conditions.

Investment income was $12 million lower in 2010 compared to
    2009 with the impact of lower interest rates across the globe,
    particularly on our Euro-denominated deposits, partially
    mitigated by our forward hedging program.

Organic commissions and fees growth by segment is discussed
    further in ‘Operating Results — Segment
    Information’ below.

Salaries and
    Benefits

Salaries and benefits increased by $46 million, or 3% in
    2010 compared to 2009, primarily due to a $60 million
    increase in incentive expenses, comprising a $31 million
    increase in the amortization of cash retention awards and a
    $29 million increase in the accrual for non-retentive
    incentive compensation due to increased headcount and improved
    performance across many regions. The increase in incentive
    expense was partially offset by reduced severance costs in 2010
    and favorable foreign currency translation, primarily the

year-on-year

strengthening of the US dollar against the Pound Sterling.



Business discussion

Other
    Expenses

Other operating expenses

declined by $26 million in
    2010 compared to 2009 as the benefit from $25 million of
    lower losses on our forward hedging program, the release of a
    $7 million previously established legal reserve and
    continued disciplined management of discretionary expenses were
    partially offset by a $12 million first quarter 2010 charge
    relating to the devaluation of the Venezuelan currency and
    expense increases in support of revenue growth initiatives.

Amortization of intangible assets

declined by
    $18 million in 2010 compared to 2009 due to the declining
    charge for the HRH customer relationship intangible and the

year-on-year

benefit from a $7 million accelerated amortization in 2009
    relating to the HRH brand name.

Net gain (loss) on disposal of operations

declined by
    $15 million in 2010 compared to 2009 primarily due to the
    recording in 2009 of a $10 million gain on sale following
    the part-disposal of the Group’s holding in Gras Savoye.

Interest
    Expense

Interest expense in 2010 was $8 million lower than in 2009,
    as interest expense savings arising from the reduction in
    average term loan and revolving credit facility balances was
    partly offset by the effect of the higher coupon payable on the
    $500 million 12.875% senior unsecured notes issued in
    March 2009.

Income
    Taxes

The effective tax rate was 24% for 2010 compared to 18% in 2009
    as a $22 million benefit in 2010 from prior year tax
    adjustments was more than offset by the adverse impact from the
    $12 million charge relating to the devaluation of the
    Venezuelan currency for which no tax credits are available and
    positive impacts on the 2009 effective tax rate from a
    $27 million release relating to a 2009 change in tax law
    and an $11 million release relating to uncertain tax
    positions due to the closure of the statute of limitations on
    assessments for previously unrecognized tax benefits. Excluding
    these items, the effective tax rate of 26% on ordinary income
    for 2010 was broadly in line with 2009.

Interest in
    Earnings of Associates, net of Tax

Interest in earnings of associates, net of tax, in 2010 of
    $23 million was $10 million lower than in 2009,
    primarily due to the reduction from 49% to 31% in our ownership
    interest in Gras Savoye, as part of the reorganization of their
    capital structure in December 2009. Interest receivable on the
    vendor financing we provided as part of the capital

Willis Group
    Holdings plc

In March 2011 we issued $800 million of new debt, comprised
    of $300 million 4.125% senior notes due 2016 and
    $500 million 5.750% senior notes due 2021. We received
    net proceeds, after underwriting discounts and expenses of
    approximately $787 million, which were used largely in part
    to repurchase and redeem $500 million 12.875% senior
    notes due 2016 and make related make-whole payments totaling
    $158 million, which represented a slight discount to the
    make-whole redemption amount provided in the indenture governing
    this debt. In addition to the make-whole payments of
    $158 million, we also wrote off unamortized debt issuance
    costs of $13 million.

In December 2011 we refinanced our bank facility, comprising a
    new

5-year

$300 million term loan and a new

5-year

$500 million revolving credit facility. The
    $300 million term loan repaid the majority of the
    $328 million balance outstanding on our $700 million

5-year

term
    loan facility and the $500 million revolving credit
    facility replaces our existing $300 million and
    $200 million revolving credit facilities. Unamortized debt
    issuance costs of $10 million relating to these facilities
    were written off in December 2011 following completion of the
    refinancing. In 2011, we made $83 million of mandatory
    repayments against the

5-year

term
    loan before repaying the $328 million balance in
    December 2011.

These refinancing actions have lengthened our debt maturity
    profile. At December 31, 2011, we have $nil outstanding
    under both the $500 million and the existing
    $20 million facility compared with December 31, 2010
    when we had $90 million outstanding under our
    $300 million facility and $nil outstanding under our
    $200 million and $20 million facilities. At
    December 31, 2011 the only scheduled debt repayments
    falling due over the next 12 months are scheduled
    repayments on our new $300 million

5-year

term
    loan totaling $11 million and repayment of the
    $4 million 6% loan notes due 2012.

Liquidity

Our principal sources of liquidity are cash from operations and
    $520 million available under our revolving credit
    facilities, of which the $20 million UK facility is solely
    for use by our main regulated UK entity in certain exceptional
    circumstances. At December 31, 2011 we had
    $436 million of cash and cash equivalents, of which
    approximately $100 million is available for general
    corporate purposes.

As of December 31, 2011, our short-term liquidity
    requirements consisted of $125 million payment of interest
    on debt, $11 million of mandatory repayments under our

5-year

term
    loan, a $4 million mandatory repayment of our 6.000% loan
    notes due 2012, $1 million of revolving credit facility
    commitment fees, capital expenditure and working capital
    requirements. In addition, our estimated pension contributions
    for 2012 are $142 million. Our long-term liquidity
    requirements consist of the principal amount of outstanding
    notes and borrowings under our

5-year

term
    loan facility.

Based on current market conditions and information available to
    us at this time, we believe that we have sufficient liquidity to
    meet our cash needs for at least the next 12 months.

Pensions

UK plan

In early 2012 we provisionally agreed a revised funding strategy
    with the UK plan’s trustee. Whilst the proposed new funding
    strategy has not been definitively agreed at the date of this
    report, we expect this to occur by the end of March 2012, and we
    expect the cash contributions to the scheme in 2012 to be
    approximately equal to those in 2011, of $92 million.

US plan

We will make cash contributions of approximately
    $40 million to the US plan in 2012, compared to
    contributions of $30 million in 2011. We also intend to
    make lump sum payments to specific classes of US plan members in
    settlement of



Business discussion

their pension obligations. Such payments will only be made in
    limited tranches. Whilst such payments will have a positive
    impact on the overall liabilities of the US plan they may
    require us to provide additional funding to the plan.

Consolidated Cash
    Flow for 2011 compared to 2010

Operating
    Activities

Total net cash provided by continuing operating activities was
    $439 million in 2011, compared with $489 million in
    2010. The decrease of $50 million primarily reflects the
    $57 million

year-on-year

increase in accounts receivable, reflecting increased revenue
    but also slower collections in the US due to current economic
    conditions; cash outflows of approximately $120 million
    relating to the 2011 Operational Review; and the
    $24 million

year-on-year

increase in payments for cash retention awards. These were
    partly offset by realized cash savings resulting from the 2011
    Operational Review and other working capital movements.

Investing
    Activities

Total net cash used in continuing investing activities was
    $101 million in 2011 compared to $94 million in 2010.
    The $101 million net outflow was mainly due to capital
    spend including fit-out of our Nashville office and IT project
    investments.

Financing
    Activities

Total net cash used in continuing financing activities was
    $214 million in 2011 compared to $293 million in 2010.
    We issued $800 million of new debt in March 2011 and net
    proceeds of approximately $787 million were used to
    repurchase and redeem $500 million of 12.875% senior
    notes due 2016. As part of this debt refinancing we made a
    $158 million make-whole payment on the redemption of our
    12.875% senior notes due 2016. Other significant financing
    activities in 2011 include refinancing our bank facility in
    December 2011, dividend payments of $180 million and
    receipt of $60 million from the issue of shares.

Consolidated Cash
    Flow for 2010 compared to 2009

Operating
    Activities

Total net cash provided by continuing operating activities was
    $489 million in 2010 compared with $419 million in
    2009. The $70 million increase compared with 2009 primarily
    reflected the benefits of a $142 million increase in net
    income from continuing operations before non-cash items offset
    by a $48 million increase in pension scheme contributions,
    a $48 million increase in cash retention award payments,
    the timing of cash collections and other working capital
    movements.

Investing
    Activities

Total net cash outflow from continuing investing activities was
    $94 million in 2010 compared with a net cash inflow of
    $102 million in 2009. The 2010 outflow was primarily due to
    capital spend and $21 million of payments for acquisitions
    of subsidiaries, mainly in respect of prior year acquisitions.
    In 2009, capital spend of $96 million was offset by net
    receipts of $113 million from changes in our ownership
    interest in Gras Savoye, $42 million net proceeds from sale
    of discontinued operations, mainly attributable to the second
    quarter 2009 disposal of Bliss & Glennon and
    $21 million proceeds from the sale of short-term
    investments.

Financing
    Activities

Net cash used in continuing financing activities was
    $293 million in 2010 compared with $516 million in
    2009. The net decrease in cash used in financing activities of
    $223 million was mainly attributable to a $90 million
    drawdown against the revolving credit facilities in 2010 and
    debt refinancing actions in 2009 that resulted in
    $102 million higher debt repayments net of debt issuance in
    that year.

Own
    funds

As of December 31, 2011, we had cash and cash equivalents
    of $436 million, compared with $316 million at
    December 31, 2010 and $520 million remained available
    to draw under our revolving credit facilities, compared with
    $430 million at December 31, 2010.

Fiduciary
    funds

As an intermediary, we hold funds generally in a fiduciary
    capacity for the account of third parties, typically as the
    result of premiums received from clients that are in transit to
    insurers and claims due to clients that are in transit from
    insurers. We report premiums, which are held on account of, or
    due from, clients as assets with a corresponding liability due
    to the insurers. Claims held by, or due to, us which are due to
    clients are also shown as both assets and liabilities. Fiduciary
    funds are generally required to be kept in certain regulated
    bank accounts subject to guidelines which emphasize capital
    preservation and liquidity; such funds are not available to
    service the Company’s debt or for other corporate purposes.
    Notwithstanding the legal relationships with clients and
    insurers, the Company is entitled to retain investment income
    earned on fiduciary funds in accordance with industry custom and
    practice and, in some cases, as supported by agreements with
    insureds.

Share redemptions
    or repurchases

The Company is authorized to repurchase or redeem shares under a
    variety of methods and will consider whether to do so from time
    to time, based on many factors, including market conditions.
    There remains approximately $922 million under the current
    authorization. The Company did not repurchase or redeem any
    shares in 2011 or 2010. In February 2012, the Company announced
    that in 2012 it intends to buyback up to $100 million of
    shares through open market or privately



Business discussion

negotiated transactions, from time to time, depending on market
    conditions. As at February 23, 2012 the Company acquired
    75,000 shares at a total price of approximately
    $3 million.

Dividends

Cash dividends paid in 2011 were $180 million compared with
    $176 million in 2010 and $174 million in 2009, with
    the year-on-year increases due to increases in share count over
    each year.

In February 2012, we declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.27
    per share, an annual rate of $1.08 per share, an increase of
    3.8% over the prior 12 month period.

Reported commissions and fees
    include a $6 million first quarter 2011 benefit from a
    change in accounting within a Global Specialty business to
    conform to current Group accounting policy.

2011 compared to

Revenues

Commissions and fees of $1,073 million were
    $86 million, or 9%, higher in 2011 compared with 2010,
    reflecting organic commissions and fees growth of 7% and a net
    benefit from foreign currency translation of 2%. Organic growth
    included the benefit of net new business generation despite the
    adverse impact of the continued difficult economic environment
    and soft market in many of the specialty classes.

Organic growth included positive growth across Reinsurance,
    Global Specialties, Willis Faber & Dumas and WCMA
    businesses, together with a $6 million first quarter 2011
    benefit from a change in accounting within a Global Specialty
    business to conform to current Group accounting policy.

Organic growth in Reinsurance in 2011 was led by growth in North
    America and Asia-Pacific, and included the benefit of new
    business growth and a profitability initiative that may or may
    not recur. Overall Reinsurance showed stable pricing with modest
    increases in some lines and geographies, particularly those
    affected by catastrophe losses.

Organic growth in Global Specialties was led by strong
    contributions from Marine, Energy, Financial Solutions and
    Aerospace, reflecting good new business, high retention levels,
    targeted hiring of producer talent and connectivity between the
    retail network and specialty businesses. However, the operating
    environment remains challenging across most Global Specialty
    businesses with depressed world trade and transit volumes,
    industry consolidation and pressure on financing of construction
    projects still evident.

Willis Faber & Dumas reported positive organic
    commissions and fees growth in 2011 and our WCMA business was
    marginally positive compared to 2010.

The 2% net benefit to revenue growth from foreign currency
    translation in 2011 primarily reflected the

period-over-period

positive impact of the weakening of the US dollar against both
    the Euro and Pound sterling, in which we earn a significant
    portion of Global revenues.

Productivity in Global, measured in terms of revenue per FTE
    employee, increased to $386,000 for 2011 compared with $366,000
    for 2010.

Client retention levels improved to 91% for 2011, compared with
    90% for 2010.



Business discussion

Operating
    margin

Operating margin was 33% in 2011 compared to 32% in 2010 as the
    benefit of 7% organic commissions and fees growth discussed
    above and an $18 million decrease in pension expense was
    offset by a net negative impact from foreign currency movements,
    an $8 million increase in incentive expense, including
    amortization of cash retention award payments and the impact of
    costs associated with continued support of current and future
    growth.

Operating margin is impacted by foreign exchange movements as
    the London market operations earn revenues in US dollars, Pounds
    sterling and Euros and primarily incur expenses in Pounds
    sterling. In addition, they are exposed to exchange risk on
    certain Pound sterling-denominated balances.

The

period-over-period

net negative impact from foreign currency movements in 2011
    primarily reflected the increased US dollar value of our Pound
    sterling expense base as a result of the weakening of the US
    dollar versus the Pound sterling and the net negative impact of
    translation of non-USD assets and liabilities into US dollar in
    our London market operations. These factors were partially
    offset by the US dollar weakening against the Pound sterling and
    the Euro, increasing the US dollar value of our Pound and Euro
    denominated revenues.

2010 compared to

Revenues

Commissions and fees were $66 million, or 7%, higher in
    2010 compared with 2009 which was driven by 7% organic
    commissions and fees growth.

Our Reinsurance and Global Specialties businesses reported
    mid-single digit organic growth in 2010, driven by net new
    business generation despite the adverse impact of the difficult
    rate environment and soft market in many of the specialty
    classes.

Reinsurance reported strong new business growth in 2010 and
    client retention levels remained high. Organic growth in Global
    Specialties was led by strong contributions from Financial and
    Executive Risks, Construction and Energy, reflecting strong new
    business, improved retention, targeted hiring of producer talent
    and improved cooperation across the retail and specialty
    businesses.

Our WCMA business contributed to organic growth in 2010,
    substantially due to a $9 million fee on a single capital
    markets transaction in the second quarter.

Within Willis Faber & Dumas, revenues in
    Faber & Dumas were slightly lower than 2009, mainly
    reflecting the soft wholesale market, together with continued
    pressure on the most economically sensitive lines such as
    bloodstock, jewelry and fine arts.

Productivity in Global, measured in terms of revenue per FTE
    employee, increased to $366,000 for 2010 compared with $352,000
    for 2009.

Client retention levels remained high at 90% for 2010, in line
    with 2009.

Operating
    margin

Operating margin was 32% in 2010 compared with 33% in 2009. This
    decrease primarily reflected the adverse impact of foreign
    currency translation, as the positive effect on our Pound
    sterling expense base from the strengthening US dollar, was more
    than offset by the adverse impact of foreign currency movements
    on sterling-denominated balances.



Willis Group
    Holdings plc

Excluding the impact of this foreign currency translation,
    Global’s operating margin remained flat as the benefits of
    good organic commissions and fees growth and disciplined cost
    control were offset by the impact of costs associated with
    continued support of current and future growth.

North
    America

Our North America business provides risk management, insurance
    brokerage, related risk services and employee benefits brokerage
    and consulting to a wide array of industry and client segments
    in the United States, Canada and as of January 1, 2011,
    Mexico retail. We have retrospectively adjusted our segmental
    information disclosures within this discussion to reflect the
    allocation of Mexico retail operations to our North America
    segment.

Included in North America reported

    $5 million in 2011, compared with $11 million in 2010
    and $27 million in 2009.

(b)

Reported commissions and fees
    included a favorable impact from a change in accounting
    methodology in a specialty business in North America of
    $7 million in the year ended December 31, 2010.

2011 compared to

Revenues

Commissions and fees of $1,314 million were
    $55 million, or 4%, lower in 2011 compared with 2010 of
    which $6 million was attributable to the decrease in legacy
    contingent commissions assumed as part of the HRH acquisition
    from $11 million in 2010 to $5 million in 2011.

Organic commissions and fees growth declined 4% in 2011 compared
    with 2010, as the benefits of new business generation and growth
    in some regions were more than offset by declining Loan
    Protector revenues and the impact of the soft market conditions
    and weakened economy across most sectors.

The decline in the financial performance of our Loan Protector
    business had a 2% negative impact on North America organic
    growth in commissions and fees and for the full year 2011
    negatively impacted the segment’s revenue by
    $27 million. The Loan Protector decline was driven by the
    loss of clients through attrition and M&A activity,
    industry-wide commission pressures and a slowdown in
    foreclosures in the US in 2011.

Following the introduction of health care reform legislation in
    2010, some major health insurance carriers in North America
    began to change their compensation practices in particular lines
    of business in certain locations. In response to market
    pressures those changes caused, we announced in July 2011 that
    in order to remain competitive, we would begin accepting
    standard compensation based on volume, but would continue to
    resist traditional contingent commissions and bonus payments
    because, while legal, we believe these forms of compensation
    create conflicts with our clients. After



Business discussion

several months of review under changing market conditions, we
    have concluded that we cannot be fully competitive on Employee
    Benefits business if we continue to refuse these legal forms of
    compensation. Consequently, we will begin to accept all forms of
    compensation from Employee Benefits providers effective
    April 1, 2012 in North America.

Despite the decline in revenues, productivity in North America,
    measured in terms of revenue per FTE employee, increased to
    $235,000 for 2011 compared with $234,000 for 2010.

Client retention levels were 91% in 2011 compared to 92% in 2010.

Operating
    margin

Operating margin in North America was 20% in 2011 compared with
    23% in 2010, reflecting the adverse impact from the 4% decline
    in organic commissions and fees growth discussed above, a

period-over-period

increase in 401(k) match expense of $10 million following
    its reinstatement in January 2011 and a $7 million increase
    in incentive expense, including amortization of cash retention
    award payments. These were partly offset by a $5 million
    decrease in stock-based compensation expense and the benefit of
    cost reductions driven by the 2011 Operational Review and
    continued focus on expense management.

2010 compared to

Revenues

Commissions and fees of $1,369 million were
    $12 million, or 1%, lower for 2010 compared with 2009.
    Excluding the $16 million decrease in legacy contingency
    commissions assumed as part of the HRH acquisition, there was a
    modest increase in commissions and fees.

Organic commissions and fees growth was flat for 2010. We
    experienced strong performance in our specialty businesses,
    driven by good business growth together with a $7 million
    increase in commissions and fees from a change in accounting of
    an acquired specialty business in North America to conform to
    Group accounting policy. Our employee benefits practice recorded
    3% growth despite the soft labor market and we achieved good net
    new business generation, with improved client retention. This
    was offset by a negative 2% impact from rate declines and other
    market factors and a further decline in our Construction
    business and smaller declines elsewhere reflecting continued
    soft market conditions and the weak US economy.

Despite the small decline in revenues, productivity in North
    America, measured in terms of revenue per FTE employee,
    increased to $234,000 for 2010 compared with $223,000 for 2009.

Client retention levels increased to 92% for 2010, compared with
    91% for 2009.

Operating
    margin

Operating margin in North America was 23% in both 2010 and 2009,
    as the benefits of continued disciplined cost control and
    underlying lower pension expense in 2010 were offset by a
    $16 million reduction in legacy HRH contingent commissions,
    increased incentive expense, including the impact of increased
    amortization of cash retention award payments and the
    non-recurrence of a $9 million benefit in 2009 from the
    curtailment of the US pension plan relating to our North America
    retail employees.

International

Our International business comprises our retail operations in

    Asia-Pacific, Russia, the Middle East, South Africa and Latin
    America. The services provided are focused

2011 compared to

Revenues

Commissions and fees of $1,027 million were
    $90 million, or 10%, higher in 2011 compared with 2010,
    comprising 5% organic growth and a net 5% positive impact from
    foreign currency translation. Organic growth included net new
    business growth of 7%, partly offset by the negative impact from
    rates and other market factors.

There were strong contributions to 2011 organic commissions and
    fees growth from most regions, including double-digit growth in
    our Latin America and Eastern Europe regions, together with
    single-digit growth in Asia and Western Europe. In particular,
    there was strong growth in Brazil, Chile, Argentina, Russia and
    China.

The single-digit organic commissions and fees growth in our
    large retail operation in Continental Europe was primarily
    driven by strong growth in Italy, Spain and Germany, despite the
    ongoing challenging economic conditions in this region, offset
    by lower commissions and fees in Denmark and the Netherlands.

Organic commissions and fees growth in our UK and Ireland retail
    operations, declined 2% in 2011, compared with the same period
    2010, driven by the economic pressures that continue to affect
    both the UK and Ireland.

A significant part of International’s revenues are earned
    in currencies other than the US dollar, most notably the Euro,
    Pound sterling and Australian dollar. The net 5% benefit from
    foreign currency translation in 2011 primarily reflected the
    weakening of the US dollar against these and other currencies in
    which we earn International revenues.

Productivity in our International business, measured in terms of
    revenue per FTE employee, increased to $160,000 for 2011
    compared with $150,000 for 2010.

Client retention levels increased to 94% for 2011, compared with
    93% for 2010.

Operating
    margin

Operating margin in International was 21% in 2011, compared with
    24% in 2010, with the decrease primarily reflecting a
    $17 million increase in incentive expenses including
    amortization of cash retention award payments, the impact of the
    reinstated annual salary review for all employees from April
    2011 and increased spending on initiatives to drive future
    growth, including investment hires. These increases were partly
    offset by the benefit from organic commissions and fees growth
    and favorable foreign currency movements as discussed above and
    reduced pension expense.



Business discussion

2010 compared to

Revenues

Commissions and fees of $937 million were $39 million,
    or 4%, higher for 2010 compared with 2009, as the benefits of 5%
    organic commissions and fees growth and 1% from the net effect
    of acquisitions and disposals were partly offset by a 2% adverse
    impact from foreign currency translation. Organic growth
    included net new business growth of 8% and there was a negative
    3% impact from rates and other market factors.

There were strong contributions to organic commissions and fees
    growth from most regions, led by growth in Latin America,
    Asia-Pacific and Western Europe. There was further positive
    growth in our Eastern Europe operations, driven by a strong
    contribution from Russia. Organic commissions and fees growth
    was also positive in our UK and Irish retail operations, driven
    by new business growth in the UK. Our employee benefits
    practice, which represents approximately 10% of International
    commissions and fees, performed well in 2010 with growth in the
    mid single digits.

A significant part of International’s revenues are earned
    in currencies other than the US dollar. The US dollar
    strengthened against a number of these currencies in 2010
    compared with 2009, most notably the Euro, Venezuelan Bolivar
    Fuerte, Danish Kroner and Pound Sterling. The adverse impact of
    this strengthening was partly offset by the weakening of the US
    dollar against the Australian dollar. The net impact of these
    movements was a 2% reduction in 2010 revenues compared to 2009.

Productivity in our International business, measured in terms of
    revenue per FTE employee, increased to $150,000 for 2010
    compared with $147,000 for 2009.

Client retention levels remained high at 93% for 2010.

Operating
    margin

Operating margin in International was 24% in both 2010 and 2009.
    Benefits from 5% organic commissions and fees growth and
    continued focus on disciplined expense management were offset by
    the adverse impact from foreign currency translation due to the
    strengthening of the US dollar against the Euro and other
    currencies in which we earn a significant portion of our
    operating income, increased incentive expenses, including
    amortization of cash retention award payments, a reduction in
    investment income, driven by lower interest rates particularly
    in the Eurozone, and spending on initiatives to drive future
    growth.

Corporate &
    Other

The Company evaluates the performance of its operating segments
    based on organic commissions and fees growth and operating
    income. For internal reporting and segmental reporting, items
    for which segmental management are not held responsible for are
    held within ‘Corporate & Other’.

CRITICAL
    ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES

Our accounting policies are described in Note 2 to the
    Consolidated Financial Statements. Management considers that the
    following accounting estimates or assumptions are the most
    important to the presentation of our financial condition or
    operating performance. Management has discussed its critical
    accounting estimates and associated disclosures with our Audit
    Committee.

Pension
    expense

We maintain defined benefit pension plans for employees in the
    US and UK. Both these plans are now closed to new entrants and,
    with effect from May 15, 2009 we closed our US defined
    benefit plan to future accrual. New entrants in the UK are
    offered the opportunity to join a defined contribution plan and
    in the United States are offered the opportunity to join a
    401(k) plan. We also have smaller defined benefit schemes in
    Ireland, Germany, Norway and the Netherlands. These
    international schemes have combined total assets of
    $128 million and a combined net liability for pension
    benefits of $3 million as of December 31, 2011.
    Elsewhere, pension benefits are typically provided through
    defined contribution plans.

We recorded a net pension charge on our UK and US defined
    benefit pension plans in 2011 of $6 million, and $nil
    respectively, compared with $28 million and $1 million
    respectively in 2010. On our international defined benefit
    pension plans, we recorded a net pension charge of
    $5 million in 2011, compared with $6 million in 2010.

Based on December 31, 2011 assumptions, we expect the net
    pension charge in 2012 to decrease by $11 million for the
    UK plan, increase by $3 million for the US plan and
    increase a net $1 million for the international plans.

We make a number of assumptions when determining our pension
    liabilities and pension expense which are reviewed annually by
    senior management and changed where appropriate. The discount
    rate will be changed annually if underlying rates have moved
    whereas the expected long-term return on assets will be changed
    less frequently as longer term trends in asset returns emerge or
    long term target asset allocations are revised. Other material
    assumptions include rates of participant mortality, the expected
    long-term rate of compensation and pension increases and rates
    of employee termination. Our approach to determining appropriate
    assumptions for our UK and US pension plans is set out below.

Discount
    rate

During 2011, we moved from an index based approach to
    determining the discount rate to a duration based approach which
    more closely matches the actual timings of expected cash flows
    to the applicable discount rate. The selected rate used to
    discount UK plan liabilities was 4.80% compared with 5.45% at
    December 31, 2010 with the decrease reflecting a reduction
    in UK long-term bond rates in 2011. Under the old approach, the
    discount rate at the end of 2011 would have been 4.65%. We
    estimate the impact of this change was to:

•

increase the 2011 funded status by approximately
    $54 million; and

•

reduce the 2012 estimated pension expense by approximately
    $5 million.

The lower discount rate generated an actuarial loss of
    approximately $240 million at December 31, 2011.

Expected and
    actual asset returns

Expected long-term rates of return on plan assets are developed
    from the expected future returns of the various asset classes
    using the target asset allocations. The expected long-term rate
    of return used for determining the net UK pension expense in
    2011 was 7.50% (2010: 7.75%), equivalent to an expected return
    in 2011 of $161 million (2010: $141 million). The
    decrease in the expected long-term rate of return followed a
    change in the underlying target asset mix.

The expected and actual returns on UK plan assets for the three
    years ended December 31, 2011 were as follows:

Mortality

During 2011, we amended the mortality assumptions to more
    closely align them to those used in the most recent funding
    valuation. The mortality assumption is now the
    90 / 105% PNA00 table for males / females
    (2010: 100% PNA00 table without an age adjustment).

This change gave rise to an approximate $85 million
    increase in the 2011 projected benefit obligation compared to
    using the 2010 mortality assumptions.



Willis Group

As an indication of the longevity assumed, our calculations
    assume that a UK male retiree aged 65 at December 31, 2011
    would have a life expectancy of 24 years.

Discount
    rate

The rate used to discount US plan liabilities at
    December 31, 2010 was 5.58%, determined based on expected
    plan cash flows discounted using a corporate bond yield curve.
    Since the end of 2010, AA corporate bond spot yields have fallen
    and spreads of long term AA bonds over gilts have widened.
    Consequently, the discount rate at December 31, 2011 was
    4.63%, a reduction of 95 basis points from 2010 year
    end. The impact of the lower discount rate in 2011 increased the
    projected benefit obligation by approximately $100 million.

Expected and
    actual asset returns

The expected long-term rate of return used for determining the
    net US pension scheme expense in 2011 was 7.50%, a reduction of
    0.25% from 2010. Effective January 1, 2012, the expected
    long-term rate of return was further decreased to 7.25%,
    following a change in the underlying target asset mix.

The expected and actual returns on US plan assets for the three
    years ended December 31, 2011 were as follows:

Mortality

The mortality assumption at December 31, 2011 is the
    RP-2000 Mortality Table (blended for annuitants and
    non-annuitants), projected by Scale AA to 2019 for annuitants
    and 2027 for non-annuitants (December 31, 2010: projected
    to 2011 by Scale AA). This change more closely aligns
    assumptions made for accounting purposes to those for funding
    purposes. The impact of the change in mortality assumptions
    increased the projected benefit obligation at December 31,
    2011 by approximately $27 million.



Business discussion

As an indication of the longevity assumed, our calculations
    assume that a US male retiree aged 65 at December 31, 2011,
    would have a life expectancy of 19 years.

Intangible
    assets

Intangible assets represent the excess of cost over the value of
    net tangible assets of businesses acquired. We classify our
    intangible assets into three categories;

•

Goodwill;

•

‘Customer and Marketing Related’ which includes client
    lists, client relationships, trade names and non-compete
    agreements; and

•

‘Contract-based, Technology and Other’ which includes
    all other purchased intangible assets.

Client relationships acquired on the HRH acquisition are
    amortized over twenty years in line with the pattern in which
    the economic benefits of the client relationships are expected
    to be consumed. Over 80% of the client relationships intangible
    will have been amortized after 10 years. Non-compete
    agreements acquired in connection with the HRH acquisition were
    amortized over two years on a straight line basis. Intangible
    assets acquired in connection with other acquisitions are
    amortized over their estimated useful lives on a straight line
    basis. Goodwill is not subject to amortization.

To determine the allocation of intangible assets between
    goodwill and other intangible assets and the estimated useful
    lives in respect of the HRH acquisition we considered a report
    produced by a qualified independent appraiser. The calculation
    of the allocation is subject to a number of estimates and
    assumptions. We base our allocation on assumptions we believe to
    be reasonable. However, changes in these estimates and
    assumptions could affect the allocation between goodwill and
    other intangible assets.

Goodwill
    impairment review

We review goodwill for impairment annually or whenever events or
    circumstances indicate impairment may have occurred.

The goodwill impairment test is a two step analysis. Step One
    requires the fair value of each reporting unit to be compared to
    its book value. If the fair value of a reporting unit is
    determined to be greater than the carrying value of the
    reporting unit, goodwill is not to be impaired and no further
    testing is necessary. If the fair value of a reporting unit is
    less than the carrying value, we perform Step Two. Step Two
    requires the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill to be
    compared with the carrying amount of that goodwill. Determining
    the implied fair value of goodwill requires a valuation of the
    reporting unit’s tangible and intangible assets and
    liabilities in a manner similar to the allocation of the
    purchase price in a business combination. Any excess of the
    value of a reporting unit over the amounts assigned to its
    assets and liabilities is referred to as the implied fair value
    of goodwill. If the carrying amount of reporting unit goodwill
    exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill, an impairment
    loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess.

Application of the impairment test requires judgment, including
    the identification of reporting units, assignment of assets,
    liabilities and goodwill to reporting units and determination of
    fair value of each reporting unit.

Determination of
    reporting units

We have determined our reporting units to be consistent with our
    operating segments: North America; International and Global.
    Goodwill is allocated to these reporting units based on the
    original purchase price allocation for acquisitions within the
    reporting units.



Willis Group
    Holdings plc

Fair value of
    reporting units

The fair value of each reporting unit is estimated using a
    discounted cash flow methodology and, in aggregate, validated
    against our market capitalization.

Determining the fair value of a reporting unit is judgmental in
    nature and involves the use of significant estimates and
    assumptions. These estimates and assumptions include estimations
    of future cash flows which are dependent on internal forecasts,
    long-term rate of growth for our business and determination of
    our weighted average cost of capital.

We base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be
    reasonable but that are unpredictable and inherently uncertain.
    Therefore changes in these estimates and assumptions could
    materially affect the determination of fair value and result in
    goodwill impairment.

In addition, we make certain judgments and assumptions in
    allocating shared assets and liabilities to determine the
    carrying values for each of our reporting units.

Annual goodwill
    impairment analysis

Our annual goodwill impairment analysis is performed each year
    at October 1. At October 1, 2011 our analysis showed
    the estimated fair value of each reporting unit was in excess of
    the carrying value, and therefore did not result in an
    impairment charge (2010: $nil, 2009: $nil). The fair values of
    the Global and International reporting units were significantly
    in excess of their carrying values. The fair value of the North
    American unit exceeded its carrying value by approximately 14%.

In the fourth quarter of 2011 our North America segment
    continued to be hampered by declining Loan Protector business
    results, the effect of the soft economy in the U.S. and
    declining retention rates primarily related to M&A activity
    and lost legacy HRH business. Consequently, the annual
    impairment test described above included additional sensitivity
    analysis, over and above that we would usually perform, in
    relation to our North America segment’s goodwill impairment
    review. This additional analysis included reductions to assumed
    rates of revenue growth, increases to assumed rates of expense
    growth and flexing the assumed weighted average cost of capital.
    Although our testing concluded there is no impairment, the
    analysis indicated that in respect of the North America segment,
    in the event of either a significant deterioration in a key
    estimate or assumption or a less significant deterioration to a
    combination of assumptions or the sale of part of the reporting
    unit there could be an impairment to the carrying value in
    future periods.

Income
    taxes

We recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the
    estimated future tax consequences of events attributable to
    differences between the financial statements carrying amounts of
    existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases
    and operating and capital loss and tax credit carry-forwards. We
    estimate deferred tax assets and liabilities and assess the need
    for any valuation allowances using tax rates in effect for the
    year in which the differences are expected to be recovered or
    settled taking into account our business plans and tax planning
    strategies.

At December 31, 2011, we had gross deferred tax assets of
    $432 million (2010: $294 million) against which a
    valuation allowance of $102 million (2010:
    $87 million) had been recognized. To the extent that:

•

the actual future taxable income in the periods during which the
    temporary differences are expected to reverse differs from
    current projections;

•

assumed prudent and feasible tax planning strategies fail to
    materialize;

•

new tax planning strategies are developed; or

•

material changes occur in actual tax rates or loss carry-forward
    time limits,



Business discussion

we may adjust the deferred tax asset considered realizable in
    future periods. Such adjustments could result in a significant
    increase or decrease in the effective tax rate and have a
    material impact on our net income.

Positions taken in our tax returns may be subject to challenge
    by the taxing authorities upon examination. We recognize the
    benefit of uncertain tax positions in the financial statements
    when it is more likely than not that the position will be
    sustained on examination by the tax authorities. The benefit
    recognized is the largest amount of tax benefit that has a
    greater than 50% likelihood of being realized on settlement with
    the tax authority, assuming full knowledge of the position and
    all relevant facts. The Company adjusts its recognition of these
    uncertain tax benefits in the period in which new information is
    available impacting either the recognition or measurement of its
    uncertain tax positions. In 2011, there was a net increase in
    uncertain tax positions of $3 million compared to a net
    decrease of $4 million in 2010. The Company recognizes
    interest relating to unrecognized tax benefits and penalties
    within income taxes. Accrued interest and penalties are included
    within the related tax liability line in the consolidated
    balance sheet.

Commitments,
    contingencies and accrued liabilities

We purchase professional indemnity insurance for errors and
    omissions claims. The terms of this insurance vary by policy
    year and self-insured risks have increased significantly over
    recent years. We have established provisions against various
    actual and potential claims, lawsuits and other proceedings
    relating principally to alleged errors and omissions in
    connection with the placement of insurance and reinsurance in
    the ordinary course of business. Such provisions cover claims
    that have been reported but not paid and also claims that have
    been incurred but not reported. These provisions are established
    based on actuarial estimates together with individual case
    reviews and are believed to be adequate in the light of current
    information and legal advice.

Debt obligations
    and facilities

The Company’s debt and related interest obligations at
    December 31, 2011 are shown in the above table.

In March 2011 we issued $800 million of new debt, comprised
    of $300 million of 4.125% senior notes due 2016 and
    $500 million of 5.750% senior notes due 2021. We
    received net proceeds, after underwriting discounts and expenses
    of approximately $787 million, which were used, to
    repurchase and redeem $500 million of 12.875% senior
    notes due 2016 and make related make-whole payments totaling
    $158 million, which represented a slight discount to the
    make-whole redemption amount provided in the indenture governing
    this debt. In addition to the make-whole payments of
    $158 million, we also wrote off unamortized debt issuance
    costs of $13 million.

In December 2011 we refinanced our bank facility, comprising a
    new

5-year

$300 million term loan and a new

5-year

$500 million revolving credit facility. The
    $300 million term loan repaid the majority of the
    $328 million balance outstanding on our $700 million

5-year

term
    loan facility and the $500 million revolving facility
    replaces our existing $300 million and our
    $200 million revolving credit facilities. Unamortized debt
    issuance costs of $10 million relating to these facilities
    were written off in December 2011 following completion of the
    refinancing.

Conditions to borrowing under the banking facility include the
    accuracy and completeness in all material respects of all
    representations and warranties in the loan documentation and
    that no default under the banking facility then existed or would
    result from such borrowing or the application of the proceeds
    thereof. Voluntary prepayments are permitted without penalty or
    premium (subject to minimum amounts) and mandatory prepayments
    are required in certain circumstances.

We are subject to various affirmative and negative covenants and
    reporting obligations under the banking facility. These include,
    among others, limitations on subsidiary indebtedness, liens,
    sale and leaseback transactions, certain investments,
    fundamental changes, assets sales and restricted payments, and
    maintenance of certain financial covenants. Events of default
    under the banking facility include non-payment of amounts due to
    the lenders, violation of covenants, incorrect representations,
    defaults under other material indebtedness, judgments and
    specified insolvency-related events, certain ERISA events and
    invalidity of loan documents, subject to, in certain instances,
    specified thresholds, cure periods and exceptions.

At December 31, 2011 the only mandatory debt repayments
    falling due over the next 12 months are scheduled
    repayments on our new $300 million

5-year

term
    loan totaling $11 million and repayment of the
    $4 million 6% loan notes due 2012.

Operating
    leases

The Company leases certain land, buildings and equipment under
    various operating lease arrangements. Original non-cancellable
    lease terms typically are between 10 and 20 years and may
    contain escalation clauses, along with options that permit early
    withdrawal. The total amount of the minimum rent is expensed on
    a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.

As of December 31, 2011, the aggregate future minimum
    rental commitments under all non-cancellable operating lease
    agreements are as follows:

Business discussion

The Company leases its main London building under a

25-year

operating lease, which expires in 2032. The Company’s
    contractual obligations in relation to this commitment included
    in the table above total $715 million (2010:
    $744 million). Annual rentals are $30 million per year
    and the Company has subleased approximately 29% of the premises
    under leases up to 15 years. The amounts receivable from
    subleases, included in the table above, total $82 million
    (2010: $87 million; 2009: $100 million).

Rent expense amounted to $127 million for the year ended
    December 31, 2011 (2010: $131 million; 2009:
    $154 million). The Company’s rental income from
    subleases was $18 million for the year ended
    December 31, 2011 (2010: $22 million; 2009:
    $21 million).

Pensions

Contractual obligations for our pension plans reflect the
    contributions we expect to make over the next five years into
    our US, UK and international plans. These contributions are
    based on current funding positions and may increase or decrease
    dependent on the future performance of the plans.

UK plan

We made total cash contributions to our UK defined benefit
    pension plan of $92 million in 2011 (including amounts in
    respect of the salary sacrifice contribution) compared with
    $88 million in 2010 and $49 million in 2009.

In the UK we are required to agree to a funding strategy for our
    UK defined benefit plan with the plan’s trustees. In
    February 2009, we agreed to make full year contributions to the
    UK plan of approximately $39 million for 2009 through 2011,
    excluding amounts in respect of the salary sacrifice scheme. In
    addition, if certain funding targets were not met at the
    beginning of any of those years, a further contribution of
    approximately $39 million was required for that year. The
    additional funding requirement was triggered in both 2010 and
    2011.

The amounts included as contractual obligations in the table
    above reflect those payable under the current funding strategy
    which expires in March 2015, including amounts in respect of the
    salary sacrifice arrangements. Negotiations between the Company
    and the plan trustees on a revised funding strategy are
    continuing as set out in the ‘Liquidity and Capital
    Resources’ section.

US plan

We made total cash contributions to our US defined benefit
    pension plan of $30 million in 2011, compared with
    $30 million in 2010 and $27 million in 2009.

We expect to make contributions of approximately
    $40 million in 2012 through 2016 under US pension
    legislation based on our December 31, 2011 balance sheet
    position.

International
    plans

We made total cash contributions to our international defined
    benefit pension plans of $13 million in 2011, compared with
    $12 million in 2010 and $6 million in 2009.

In 2012, we expect to contribute approximately $12 million
    to our international plans.

Based on the current UK funding strategy and as shown in the
    table above, the total contracted contributions for all plans
    are currently estimated to be approximately $91 million in
    2012, excluding amounts of approximately $12 million in
    respect of the salary sacrifice scheme. However, a revised UK
    funding strategy, and hence 2012 contribution, is expected



Willis Group
    Holdings plc

to be finalized shortly and the final 2012 contribution for all
    plans is expected to be approximately $142 million,
    including salary sacrifice which compares to an equivalent 2011
    total contribution of $135 million.

Guarantees

Guarantees issued by certain of Willis Group Holdings’
    subsidiaries with respect to the senior notes and revolving
    credit facilities are discussed in Note 21 —
    Commitments and Contingencies — in these consolidated
    financial statements.

Certain of Willis Group Holdings’ subsidiaries have given
    the landlords of some leasehold properties occupied by the
    Company in the UK and the US guarantees in respect of the
    performance of the lease obligations of the subsidiary holding
    the lease. The operating lease obligations subject to such
    guarantees amounted to $828 million and $855 million
    at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively.

In addition, the Company has given guarantees to bankers and
    other third parties relating principally to letters of credit
    amounting to $3 million and $11 million at
    December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Willis Group
    Holdings also guarantees certain of its UK and Irish
    subsidiaries’ obligations to fund the UK and Irish defined
    benefit plans.

Other Contractual
    Obligations

For certain subsidiaries and associates, the Company has the
    right to purchase shares (a call option) from co-shareholders at
    various dates in the future. In addition, the co-shareholders of
    certain subsidiaries and associates have the right to sell (a
    put option) their shares to the Company at various dates in the
    future. Generally, the exercise price of such put options and
    call options is formula-based (using revenues and earnings) and
    is designed to reflect fair value.

At December 31, 2011 the Company owned 50.1% of Gras Savoye
    Re., a company we consolidate in our financial statements. In
    January 2012 the co-shareholders of Gras Savoye exercised a put
    option for the Company to acquire the remaining 49.9% of Gras
    Savoye Re. for approximately $30 million and we anticipate
    concluding this transaction in March 2012.

Based on current projections of profitability and exchange
    rates, and assuming the put options are exercised, the potential
    amount payable from these options, including Gras Savoye Re., is
    not expected to exceed $72 million (2010: $40 million).

In July 2010, the Company made a capital commitment of
    $25 million to Trident V Parallel Fund, LP, an investment
    fund managed by Stone Point Capital. This replaced a capital
    commitment of $25 million that had been made to
    Trident V, LP in December 2009. As at December 31,
    2011 there have been approximately $6 million of capital
    contributions.

In May 2011, the Company made a capital commitment of
    $10 million to Dowling Capital Partners I, LP. As at
    December 31, 2011 there had been no capital contributions.

Other contractual obligations at December 31, 2011 also
    include the capital lease on the Company’s Nashville
    property of $63 million, payable from 2012 onwards.

NEW ACCOUNTING
    STANDARDS

In May 2011, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
    (‘FASB’) issued new guidance to provide a consistent
    definition of fair value and ensure that fair value measurements
    and disclosure requirements are similar between US GAAP and
    International Financial Reporting Standards (‘IFRS’).
    The guidance changes certain fair value measurement principles
    and enhances the disclosure requirements for fair value
    measurements.

In June 2011, the FASB issued new guidance to revise the manner
    in which entities present comprehensive income in their
    financial statements, requiring that the components of
    comprehensive income be presented in either a single



Business discussion

continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate
    but consecutive statements. The amendments do not change the
    items that must be reported in other comprehensive income (OCI)
    or when an item of OCI must be reclassified to net income.

In September 2011, the FASB also issued guidance to allow an
    entity the option to make a qualitative evaluation about the
    likelihood of goodwill impairment to determine whether it should
    calculate the fair value of a reporting unit. All of the above
    accounting changes become effective for the Company from first
    quarter 2012.

Further details of the changes are described in Note 2 to
    the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.

Other than the changes described above, there were no new
    accounting standards issued during 2011 that would impact on the
    Company’s reporting.

OFF BALANCE SHEET
    TRANSACTIONS

Apart from commitments, guarantees and contingencies, as
    disclosed in Note 21 to the Consolidated Financial
    Statements, the Company has no off-balance sheet arrangements
    that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a material effect
    on the Company’s financial condition, results of operations
    or liquidity.

Item 7A —

Quantitative
    and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk

Financial Risk
    Management

We are exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency
    exchange rates and interest rates. In order to manage the risk
    arising from these exposures, we enter into a variety of
    interest rate and foreign currency derivatives. We do not hold
    financial or derivative instruments for trading purposes.

A discussion of our accounting policies for financial and
    derivative instruments is included in Note 2 —
    Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies of
    Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, and further
    disclosure is provided in Note 25 — Derivative
    Financial Instruments and Hedging Activities.

Foreign Exchange
    Risk Management

Because of the large number of countries and currencies we
    operate in, movements in currency exchange rates may affect our
    results.

We report our operating results and financial condition in US
    dollars. Our US operations earn revenue and incur expenses
    primarily in US dollars. Outside the United States, we
    predominantly generate revenues and expenses in the local
    currency with the exception of our London market operations
    which earns revenues in several currencies but incurs expenses
    predominantly in pounds sterling.

The table below gives an approximate analysis of revenues and
    expenses by currency in 2011.

Our principal exposures to foreign exchange risk arise from:

•

our London market operations; and

•

translation.

London market
    operations

In our London market operations, we earn revenue in a number of
    different currencies, principally US dollars, pounds sterling,
    Euros and Japanese yen, but incur expenses almost entirely in
    pounds sterling.

We hedge this risk as follows:

•

to the extent that forecast pound sterling expenses exceed pound
    sterling revenues, we limit our exposure to this exchange rate
    risk by the use of forward contracts matched to specific,
    clearly identified cash outflows arising in the ordinary course
    of business; and

•

to the extent our London market operations earn significant
    revenues in Euros and Japanese yen, we limit our exposure to
    changes in the exchange rate between the US dollar and these
    currencies by the use of forward contracts matched to a
    percentage of forecast cash inflows in specific currencies and
    periods.



Market risk

In addition, we are also exposed to foreign exchange risk on any
    net sterling asset or liability position in our London market
    operations.

However, where the foreign exchange risk relates to any sterling
    pension assets benefit or liability for pensions benefit, we do
    not hedge the risk. Consequently, if our London market
    operations have a significant pension asset or liability, we may
    be exposed to accounting gains and losses if the US dollar and
    pounds sterling exchange rate changes. We do, however, hedge the
    pounds sterling contributions into the pension plan.

Translation
    risk

Outside our US and London market operations, we predominantly
    earn revenues and incur expenses in the local currency. When we
    translate the results and net assets of these operations into US
    dollars for reporting purposes, movements in exchange rates will
    affect reported results and net assets. For example, if the US
    dollar strengthens against the euro, the reported results of our
    Eurozone operations in US dollar terms will be lower.

We do not hedge translation risk.

The table below provides information about our foreign currency
    forward exchange contracts, which are sensitive to exchange rate
    risk. The table summarizes the US dollar equivalent amounts of
    each currency bought and sold forward and the weighted average
    contractual exchange rates. All forward exchange contracts
    mature within three years.

Represents the difference between

Willis Group
    Holdings plc

Income earned within foreign subsidiaries outside of the UK is
    generally offset by expenses in the same local currency but the
    Company does have exposure to foreign exchange movements on the
    net income of these entities. The Company does not hedge net
    income earned within foreign subsidiaries outside of the UK.

Interest rate
    risk management

Our operations are financed principally by $2,050 million
    fixed rate senior notes issued by the Group and
    $300 million under a new

5-year

term
    loan facility. Of the fixed rate senior notes, $350 million
    are due 2015, $300 million are due 2016, $600 million
    are due 2017, $300 million are due 2019, and
    $500 million are due 2021. The

5-year

term
    loan facility is repayable in quarterly installments and a final
    repayment of $225 million is due in the forth quarter of
    2016. As of December 31, 2011 we had access to
    $520 million under revolving credit facilities and no
    drawings had been made under those facilities. The interest rate
    applicable to the bank borrowing is variable according to the
    period of each individual drawdown.

We are also subject to market risk from exposure to changes in
    interest rates based on our investing activities where our
    primary interest rate risk arises from changes in short-term
    interest rates in both US dollars and pounds sterling.

As a result of our operating activities, we receive cash for
    premiums and claims which we deposit in short-term investments
    denominated in US dollars and other currencies. We earn interest
    on these funds, which is included in our consolidated financial
    statements as investment income. These funds are regulated in
    terms of access and the instruments in which it may be invested,
    most of which are short-term in maturity. In order to manage
    interest rate risk arising from these financial assets, we enter
    into interest rate swaps to receive a fixed rate of interest and
    pay a variable rate of interest in the various currencies
    related to the short-term investments. The use of interest rate
    contracts essentially converts groups of short-term variable
    rate investments to fixed rates. However, in the fourth quarter
    of 2011, we stopped renewing hedged positions on their maturity
    given the current flat yield curve environment.

During the year ended December 31, 2010, the Company
    entered into a series of interest rate swaps for a total
    notional amount of $350 million to receive a fixed rate and
    pay a variable rate on a semi-annual basis, with a maturity date
    of July 15, 2015. The Company has designated and accounts
    for these instruments as fair value hedges against its
    $350 million 5.625% senior notes due 2015. The fair
    values of the interest rate swaps are included within other
    assets or other liabilities and the fair value of the hedged
    element of the senior notes is included within the principal
    amount of the debt.

The table below provides information about our derivative
    instruments and other financial instruments that are sensitive
    to changes in interest rates. For interest rate swaps, the table
    presents notional principal amounts and average interest rates
    analyzed by expected maturity dates. Notional principal amounts
    are used to calculate the contractual payments to be exchanged
    under the contracts. The duration of interest rate swaps varies
    between one and five years, with re-fixing periods of three to
    six months. Average fixed and variable rates are, respectively,
    the weighted-average actual and market rates for the interest
    hedges in place. Market rates are the rates prevailing at
    December 31, 2011 or 2010, as appropriate.

REPORT OF
    INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Willis Group
    Holdings Public Limited Company

Dublin, Ireland

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
    Willis Group Holdings Public Limited Company and subsidiaries
    (the ‘Company’) as of December 31, 2011 and 2010,
    and the related consolidated statements of operations, changes
    in equity and comprehensive income, and cash flows for each of
    the three years in the period ended December 31, 2011.
    These financial statements are the responsibility of the
    Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an
    opinion on the financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
    Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
    obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
    statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes
    examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
    disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
    assessing the accounting principles used and significant
    estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
    financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits
    provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present
    fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of
    Willis Group Holdings Public Limited Company and subsidiaries as
    of December 31, 2011 and 2010, and the results of their
    operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in
    the period ended December 31, 2011, in conformity with
    accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
    America.

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States),
    the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as
    of December 31, 2011, based on the criteria established in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework

issued
    by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
    Commission and our report dated February 29, 2012 expressed
    an unqualified opinion on the Company’s internal control
    over financial reporting.

    Group Holdings plc

1.

NATURE OF
    OPERATIONS

    broking and risk management consulting services to its clients
    worldwide, both directly and indirectly through its associates.
    The Company provides both specialized risk management advisory
    and consulting services on a global basis to clients engaged in
    specific industrial and commercial activities, and services to

    operations.

In its capacity as an advisor and insurance broker, the Company
    acts as an intermediary between clients and insurance carriers
    by advising clients on risk management requirements, helping
    clients determine the best means of managing risk, and
    negotiating and placing insurance risk with insurance carriers
    through the Company’s global distribution network.

2.  BASIS
    OF PRESENTATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Redomicile to
    Ireland

On September 24, 2009, Willis Group Holdings was
    incorporated in Ireland, in order to effectuate the change of
    the place of incorporation of the parent company of the Group.
    Willis Group Holdings operated as a wholly-owned subsidiary of
    Willis-Bermuda until December 31, 2009, when the
    outstanding common shares of Willis-Bermuda were canceled and
    Willis Group Holdings issued ordinary shares with substantially
    the same rights and preferences on a

one-for-one

basis to the holders of the Willis-Bermuda common shares that
    were canceled. Upon completion of this transaction, Willis Group
    Holdings replaced Willis-Bermuda as the ultimate parent company
    and Willis-Bermuda became a wholly-owned subsidiary of Willis
    Group Holdings. On July 29, 2010 Willis-Bermuda was
    liquidated.

This transaction was accounted for as a merger between entities
    under common control; accordingly, the historical financial
    statements of Willis-Bermuda for periods prior to this
    transaction are considered to be the historical financial
    statements of Willis Group Holdings. No changes in capital
    structure, assets or liabilities resulted from this transaction,
    other than Willis Group Holdings providing a guarantee of
    amounts due under certain borrowing arrangements of one of its
    subsidiaries as described in Note 29.

Recent Accounting
    Pronouncements

Fair Value
    Measurement and Disclosure

In May 2011, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
    (‘FASB’) issued Accounting Standards Update
    (‘ASU’)

No. 2011-04,

Fair Value Measurement: Amendments to Achieve Common Fair
    Value Measurement and Disclosure Requirements in U.S. GAAP
    and IFRSs.

The new guidance was issued to provide a
    consistent definition of fair value and ensure that fair value
    measurements and disclosure requirements are similar between US
    GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards
    (‘IFRS’). The guidance changes certain fair value
    measurement principles and enhances the disclosure requirements
    for fair value measurements.

This guidance is effective for interim and annual periods
    beginning after December 15, 2011 and is applied
    prospectively.

Other
    Comprehensive Income

In June 2011, the FASB issued ASU

No. 2011-05,

Presentation of Comprehensive Income

to revise the manner
    in which entities present comprehensive income in their
    financial statements. These changes require that components of
    comprehensive income be presented in either a single continuous
    statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but
    consecutive statements. The amendments do not change the items
    that must be reported in other comprehensive income or when an
    item of other comprehensive income must be reclassified to net
    income.

This guidance is effective for interim and annual periods
    beginning after December 15, 2011 and is applied
    retrospectively.



Notes
    to the financial statements

2.

BASIS OF
    PRESENTATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
    (Continued)

ASU No.

2011-05

also
    requires entities to present on the face of the financial
    statements reclassification adjustments for items that are
    reclassified from other comprehensive income to net income in
    the statement(s) where the components of net income and the
    components of other comprehensive income are presented. In
    December 2011, the FASB issued ASU No. 2011-12 in order to
    defer those changes in ASU No. 2011-05 that relate to the
    presentation of reclassification adjustments.

Goodwill
    impairment testing

In September 2011, the FASB issued ASU

No. 2011-08,

Intangibles — Goodwill and Other: Testing Goodwill
    for Impairment

. The new guidance was issued to reduce
    complexity and costs by allowing an entity the option to make a
    qualitative evaluation about the likelihood of goodwill
    impairment to determine whether it should calculate the fair
    value of a reporting unit.

This guidance is effective for interim and annual goodwill
    impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after
    December 15, 2011.

The adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a material
    impact on the financial statements.

Significant
    Accounting Policies

These consolidated financial statements conform to accounting
    principles generally accepted in the United States of America
    (‘US GAAP’). Presented below are summaries of
    significant accounting policies followed in the preparation of
    the consolidated financial statements.

Certain reclassifications have been made to prior year amounts
    to conform to the current year presentation.

Principles of
    Consolidation

The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the
    accounts of Willis Group Holdings and its subsidiaries, which
    are controlled through the ownership of a majority voting
    interest. Intercompany balances and transactions have been
    eliminated on consolidation.

Foreign Currency
    Translation

Transactions in currencies other than the functional currency of
    the entity are recorded at the rates of exchange prevailing at
    the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities in
    currencies other than the functional currency are translated at
    the rates of exchange prevailing at the balance sheet date and
    the related transaction gains and losses are reported in the
    statements of operations. Certain intercompany loans are
    determined to be of a long-term investment nature. The Company
    records transaction gains and losses from remeasuring such loans
    as a component of other comprehensive income.

Upon consolidation, the results of operations of subsidiaries
    and associates whose functional currency is other than the US
    dollar are translated into US dollars at the average exchange
    rate and assets and liabilities are translated at year-end
    exchange rates. Translation adjustments are presented as a
    separate component of other comprehensive income in the
    financial statements and are included in net income only upon
    sale or liquidation of the underlying foreign subsidiary or
    associated company.

BASIS OF
    PRESENTATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
    (Continued)

Use of
    Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with US
    GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
    affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
    disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities as of the dates
    of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues
    and expenses during the year. In the preparation of these
    consolidated financial statements, estimates and assumptions
    have been made by management concerning: the valuation of
    intangible assets and goodwill (including those acquired through
    business combinations); the selection of useful lives of fixed
    and intangible assets; impairment testing; provisions necessary
    for accounts receivable, commitments and contingencies and
    accrued liabilities; long-term asset returns, discount rates and
    mortality rates in order to estimate pension liabilities and
    pension expense; income tax valuation allowances; and other
    similar evaluations. Actual results could differ from the
    estimates underlying these consolidated financial statements.

Cash and Cash
    Equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents primarily consist of time deposits
    with original maturities of three months or less.

Fiduciary Assets
    and Fiduciary Liabilities

In its capacity as an insurance agent or broker, the Company
    collects premiums from insureds and, after deducting its
    commissions, remits the premiums to the respective insurers; the
    Company also collects claims or refunds from insurers which it
    then remits to insureds.

Fiduciary
    Receivables

Fiduciary receivables represent uncollected premiums from
    insureds and uncollected claims or refunds from insurers.

Fiduciary
    Funds

Fiduciary funds represent unremitted premiums received from
    insureds and unremitted claims or refunds received from
    insurers. Fiduciary funds are generally required to be kept in
    certain regulated bank accounts subject to guidelines which
    emphasize capital preservation and liquidity. Such funds are not
    available to service the Company’s debt or for other
    corporate purposes. Notwithstanding the legal relationships with
    insureds and insurers, the Company is entitled to retain
    investment income earned on fiduciary funds in accordance with
    industry custom and practice and, in some cases, as supported by
    agreements with insureds.

In certain instances, the Company advances premiums, refunds or
    claims to insurance underwriters or insureds prior to
    collection. Such advances are made from fiduciary funds and are
    reflected in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as
    fiduciary assets.

Fiduciary
    Liabilities

The obligations to remit these funds to insurers or insureds are
    recorded as fiduciary liabilities on the Company’s
    consolidated balance sheets. The period for which the Company
    holds such funds is dependent upon the date the insured remits
    the payment of the premium to the Company and the date the
    Company is required to forward such payment to the insurer.
    Balances arising from insurance brokerage transactions are
    reported as separate assets or liabilities unless such balances
    are due to or from the same party and a right of offset exists,
    in which case the balances are recorded net.



Notes
    to the financial statements

2.

BASIS OF
    PRESENTATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
    (Continued)

Accounts
    Receivable

Accounts receivable are stated at estimated net realizable
    values. Allowances are recorded, when necessary, in an amount
    considered by management to be sufficient to meet probable
    future losses related to uncollectible accounts.

Fixed
    Assets

Fixed assets are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation.
    Expenditures for improvements are capitalized; repairs and
    maintenance are charged to expenses as incurred. Depreciation is
    computed using the straight-line method based on the estimated
    useful lives of assets.

Depreciation on buildings and long leaseholds is calculated over
    the lesser of 50 years or the lease term. Depreciation on
    leasehold improvements is calculated over the lesser of the
    useful life of the assets or the remaining lease term.
    Depreciation on furniture and equipment is calculated based on a
    range of 3 to 10 years. Freehold land is not depreciated.

Recoverability of
    Fixed Assets

Long-lived assets are tested for recoverability whenever events
    or changes in circumstance indicate that their carrying amounts
    may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognized if the
    carrying amount of a long-lived asset is not recoverable and
    exceeds its fair value. Recoverability is determined based on
    the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and
    eventual disposition of the asset or asset group. Long-lived
    assets and certain identifiable intangible assets to be disposed
    of are reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value
    less cost to sell.

Operating
    Leases

Rentals payable on operating leases are charged straight line to
    expenses over the lease term as the rentals become payable.

Goodwill and
    Other Intangible Assets

Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of businesses
    acquired over the fair market value of identifiable net assets
    at the dates of acquisition. The Company reviews goodwill for
    impairment annually and whenever facts or circumstances indicate
    that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable. In testing for
    impairment, the fair value of each reporting unit is compared
    with its carrying value, including goodwill. If the carrying
    amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the amount of
    an impairment loss, if any, is calculated by comparing the
    implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill with the carrying
    amount of that goodwill.

Acquired intangible assets are amortized over the following
    periods:

Expected

Amortization basis

life (years)

Acquired intangible assets

Acquired HRH customer relationships

In line with underlying cashflows


Acquired HRH non-compete agreements

Amortizable intangible assets are reviewed for impairment
    whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their
    carrying amounts may not be recoverable.

BASIS OF
    PRESENTATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
    (Continued)

Investments in
    Associates

Investments are accounted for using the equity method of
    accounting if the Company has the ability to exercise
    significant influence, but not control, over the investee.
    Significant influence is generally deemed to exist if the
    Company has an equity ownership in the voting stock of the
    investee between 20 and 50 percent, although other factors,
    such as representation on the Board of Directors and the impact
    of commercial arrangements, are considered in determining
    whether the equity method of accounting is appropriate. Under
    the equity method of accounting the investment is carried at
    cost of acquisition, plus the Company’s equity in
    undistributed net income since acquisition, less any dividends
    received since acquisition.

The Company periodically reviews its investments in associates
    for which fair value is less than cost to determine if the
    decline in value is other than temporary. If the decline in
    value is judged to be other than temporary, the cost basis of
    the investment is written down to fair value. The amount of any
    write-down is included in the statements of operations as a
    realized loss.

All other equity investments where the Company does not have the
    ability to exercise significant influence are accounted for by
    the cost method. Such investments are not publicly traded.

Derivative
    Financial Instruments

The Company uses derivative financial instruments for other than
    trading purposes to alter the risk profile of an existing
    underlying exposure. Interest rate swaps are used to manage
    interest risk exposures. Forward foreign currency exchange
    contracts are used to manage currency exposures arising from
    future income and expenses. The fair values of derivative
    contracts are recorded in other assets and other liabilities.
    The effective portions of changes in the fair value of
    derivatives that qualify for hedge accounting as cash flow
    hedges are recorded in other comprehensive income. Amounts are
    reclassified from other comprehensive income into earnings when
    the hedged exposure affects earnings. If the derivative is
    designated as and qualifies as an effective fair value hedge,
    the changes in the fair value of the derivative and of the
    hedged item attributable to the hedged risk are both recognized
    in earnings. The amount of hedge ineffectiveness recognised in
    earnings is based on the extent to which an offset between the
    fair value of the derivative and hedged item is not achieved.
    Changes in fair value of derivatives that do not qualify for
    hedge accounting, together with any hedge ineffectiveness on
    those that do qualify, are recorded in other operating expenses
    or interest expense as appropriate.

Income
    Taxes

The Company recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for
    the estimated future tax consequences of events attributable to
    differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of
    existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases
    and operating and capital loss and tax credit carry forwards.
    Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted
    rates in effect for the year in which the differences are
    expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax
    assets and liabilities of changes in tax rates is recognized in
    the statement of operations in the period in which the enactment
    date changes. Deferred tax assets are reduced through the
    establishment of a valuation allowance at such time as, based on
    available evidence, it is more likely than not that the deferred
    tax assets will not be realized. The Company adjusts valuation
    allowances to measure deferred tax assets at the amount
    considered realizable in future periods if the Company’s
    facts and assumptions change. In making such determination, the
    Company considers all available positive and negative evidence,
    including future reversals of existing taxable temporary
    differences, projected future taxable income, tax planning
    strategies and recent financial operations.

Positions taken in the Company’s tax returns may be subject
    to challenge by the taxing authorities upon examination. The
    Company recognizes the benefit of uncertain tax positions in the
    financial statements when it is more likely than not that the
    position will be sustained on examination by the tax authorities
    upon lapse of the relevant statute of limitations, or when
    positions are effectively settled. The benefit recognized is the
    largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than
    50 percent likely to be realized on settlement with the tax
    authority, assuming full knowledge of the position and all



Notes
    to the financial statements

BASIS OF
    PRESENTATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
    (Continued)

relevant facts. The Company adjusts its recognition of these
    uncertain tax benefits in the period in which new information is
    available impacting either the recognition or measurement of its
    uncertain tax positions. These differences will be reflected as
    increases or decreases to income tax expense in the period in
    which they are determined.

Changes in tax laws and rates could also affect recorded
    deferred tax assets and liabilities in the future. Management is
    not aware of any such changes that would have a material effect
    on the Company’s results of operations, cash flows or
    financial position.

The Company recognizes interest and penalties relating to
    unrecognized tax benefits within income taxes.

Provisions for
    Liabilities

The Company is subject to various actual and potential claims,
    lawsuits and other proceedings. The Company records liabilities
    for such contingencies including legal costs when it is probable
    that a liability has been incurred before the balance sheet date
    and the amount can be reasonably estimated. To the extent such
    losses can be recovered under the Company’s insurance
    programs, estimated recoveries are recorded when losses for
    insured events are recognized and the recoveries are likely to
    be realized. Significant management judgment is required to
    estimate the amounts of such contingent liabilities and the
    related insurance recoveries. The Company analyzes its
    litigation exposure based on available information, including
    consultation with outside counsel handling the defense of these
    matters, to assess its potential liability. Contingent
    liabilities are not discounted.

Pensions

The Company has two principal defined benefit pension plans
    which cover approximately half of employees in the United States
    and United Kingdom. Both these plans are now closed to new
    entrants. New entrants in the United Kingdom are offered the
    opportunity to join a defined contribution plan and in the
    United States are offered the opportunity to join a 401(k) plan.
    In addition, there are smaller plans in certain other countries
    in which the Company operates. Elsewhere, pension benefits are
    typically provided through defined contribution plans.

Defined benefit
    plans

The net periodic cost of the Company’s defined benefit
    plans are measured on an actuarial basis using the projected
    unit credit method and several actuarial assumptions the most
    significant of which are the discount rate and the expected
    long-term rate of return on plan assets. Other material
    assumptions include rates of participant mortality, the expected
    long-term rate of compensation and pension increases and rates
    of employee termination. Gains and losses occur when actual
    experience differs from actuarial assumptions. If such gains or
    losses exceed ten percent of the greater of plan assets or plan
    liabilities the Company amortizes those gains or losses over the

BASIS OF
    PRESENTATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
    (Continued)

Share-Based
    Compensation

The Company accounts for share-based compensation as follows:

•

the cost resulting from all equity awards is recognized in the
    financial statements at fair value estimated at the grant date;

•

the fair value is recognized (generally as compensation cost)
    over the requisite service period for all awards that
    vest; and

•

compensation cost is not recognized for awards that do not vest
    because service or performance conditions are not satisfied.

Revenue
    Recognition

Revenue includes insurance commissions, fees for services
    rendered, certain commissions receivable from insurance
    carriers, investment income and other income.

Brokerage income and fees negotiated in lieu of brokerage are
    recognized at the later of policy inception date or when the
    policy placement is complete. Commissions on additional premiums
    and adjustments are recognized when approved by or agreed
    between the parties and collectability is reasonably assured.

Fees for risk management and other services are recognized as
    the services are provided. Consideration for negotiated fee
    arrangements for an agreed period covering multiple insurance
    placements, the provision of risk management

and/or

other
    services are allocated to all deliverables on the basis of their
    relative selling prices. The Company establishes contract
    cancellation reserves where appropriate: at December 31,
    2011, 2010 and 2009, such amounts were not material.

Investment income is recognized as earned.

Other income comprises gains on disposal of intangible assets,
    which primarily arise on the disposal of books of business.
    Although the Company is not in the business of selling
    intangible assets, from time to time the Company will dispose of
    a book of business (a customer list) or other intangible assets
    that do not produce adequate margins or fit with the
    Company’s strategy.

Severance
    Costs

As part of the Company’s 2011 Operational Review, the
    Company incurred severance costs of $89 million in the year
    ended December 31, 2011. These costs relate to
    approximately 1,200 positions that have been eliminated.

$81 million of these severance costs for these employees
    were recognized pursuant to a one-time benefit arrangement, with
    the remaining $8 million recognized pursuant to the terms
    of employees’ existing benefit arrangements or employee
    arrangements. All of these costs have been recognized within
    salaries and benefits.

In addition to the severance incurred as part of the 2011
    Operational Review, an additional charge of $9 million in
    the year ended December 31, 2011 was recognized within
    salaries and benefits relating to the write-off of retention
    awards held on the balance sheet for the approximately 1,200
    positions that have been eliminated.

The Company’s severance liability under the 2011
    Operational Review was:

    segmental management are not held accountable for certain items
    deemed to be centrally-controlled costs and initiatives, which
    includes the 2011 Operational Review. See
    Note 27 — Segment Information for an analysis of
    centrally-controlled costs and initiatives, including the 2011
    Operational Review costs, disclosed within ‘Corporate and
    Other’.

Severance costs also arise in the normal course of business and
    these charges amounted to a nominal amount in the year ended
    December 31, 2011 (2010: $15 million; 2009:
    $24 million). These relate to approximately 100 positions
    (2010: 550 positions; 2009: 450 positions) that have been, or
    are in the process of being, eliminated.

Cash Retention
    Awards

As part of the Company’s incentive compensation, the
    Company makes annual cash retention awards to its employees.
    Employees must repay a proportionate amount of these awards if
    they voluntarily leave the Company’s employ (other than in
    the event of retirement or permanent disability) before a
    certain time period, currently up to three years. The Company
    makes cash payments to its employees in the year it grants these
    retention awards and recognizes these payments ratably over the
    period they are subject to repayment, beginning in the quarter
    in which the award is made. The unamortized portion of cash
    retention awards is recorded within other current assets and
    other non-current assets.

The following table sets out the amount of cash retention awards
    made and the related amortization of those awards for the years
    ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009:

SHARE-BASED
    COMPENSATION

On December 31, 2011, the Company had a number of open
    share-based compensation plans, which provide for the grant of
    time-based options and performance-based options, restricted
    stock units and various other share-based grants to employees.
    All of the Company’s share-based compensation plans under
    which any options, restricted stock units or other share-based
    grants are outstanding as at December 31, 2011 are
    described below. The compensation cost that has been recognized
    for those plans for the year ended December 31, 2011 was
    $41 million (2010: $47 million; 2009:
    $39 million). The total income tax benefit recognized in
    the statement of operations for share-based compensation
    arrangements for the year ended December 31, 2011 was
    $11 million (2010: $14 million; 2009:
    $12 million).

2008 Share
    Purchase and Option Plan

This plan, which was established on April 23, 2008,
    provides for the granting of time and performance-based options,
    restricted stock units and various other share-based grants at
    fair market value to employees of the Company. There are
    8,000,000 shares available for grant under this plan.
    Options are exercisable on a variety of dates, including from
    the third, fourth or fifth anniversary of grant. Unless
    terminated sooner by the Board of Directors, the 2008 Plan will
    expire 10 years after the date of its adoption. That
    termination will not affect the validity of any grant
    outstanding at that date.

2001 Share
    Purchase and Option Plan

This plan, which was established on May 3, 2001, provides
    for the granting of time-based options, restricted stock units
    and various other share-based grants at fair market value to
    employees of the Company. The Board of Directors has adopted
    several

sub-plans

under the 2001 plan to provide employee sharesave schemes in the
    UK, Ireland and internationally. The 2001 Plan (and all

sub-plans)

expired on May 3, 2011 and no further grants will be made
    under the plan. Options are exercisable on a variety of dates,
    including from the first, second, third, sixth or eighth
    anniversary of grant, although for certain options the
    exercisable date may accelerate depending on the achievement of
    certain performance goals.

HRH Option
    Plans

Options granted under the Hilb Rogal and Hamilton Company 2000
    Stock Incentive Plan (‘HRH 2000 Plan’) and the Hilb
    Rogal & Hobbs Company 2007 Stock Incentive Plan (the
    ‘HRH 2007 Plan’) were converted into options to
    acquire shares of Willis Group Holdings. No further grants are
    to be made under the HRH 2000 Plan. Willis is authorized to
    grant equity awards under the HRH 2007 Plan until 2017 to
    employees who were formerly employed by HRH and to new employees
    who have joined Willis or one of its subsidiaries since
    October 1, 2008, the date that the acquisition of HRH was
    completed.

Employee Stock
    Purchase Plans

The Company has adopted the Willis Group Holdings 2001 North
    America Employee Share Purchase Plan, which expired on
    May 31, 2011 and the Willis Group Holdings 2010 North
    America Employee Stock Purchase Plan. They provide certain
    eligible employees to the Company’s subsidiaries in the US
    and Canada the ability to contribute payroll deductions to the
    purchase of Willis Shares at the end of each offering period.

Option Valuation
    Assumptions

The fair value of each option is estimated on the date of grant
    using the Black-Scholes option pricing model that uses the
    assumptions noted in the following table. Expected volatility is
    based on historical volatility of the Company’s stock. With
    effect from January 1, 2006, the Company uses the
    simplified method set out in Accounting Standard Codification
    (‘ASC’)

718-10-S99

to derive the expected term of options granted. The risk-free
    rate for periods within the expected life of the option is based
    on the US Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant.

    for the Gras Savoye December 2009 leveraged

NET GAIN (LOSS)
    ON DISPOSAL OF OPERATIONS (Continued)

$13 million is recorded in the statement of consolidated
    operations for the year ended December 31, 2009, of which
    $10 million relates to Gras Savoye as shown below.

On December 17, 2009, the Company completed a leveraged
    transaction with the original family shareholders of Gras Savoye
    and Astorg Partners, a private equity fund, to reorganize the
    capital of Gras Savoye (‘December 2009 leveraged
    transaction’), its principal investment in associates. The
    Company, the family shareholders and Astorg owned equal stakes
    of 31 percent in Gras Savoye and had equal representation
    of one third of the voting rights on its board. The remaining
    shareholding was held by a large pool of Gras Savoye managers
    and minority shareholders. The Company’s interest was
    reduced from 31 percent to 30 percent in 2011 following issuance
    of additional share capital as part of an employee share
    incentive scheme.

As a result of the December 2009 leveraged transaction the
    Company recognized a gain of $10 million in the
    consolidated statement of operations from the reduction of its
    interest in Gras Savoye from 49 percent to 31 percent.

The Company received total proceeds of $281 million,
    comprising cash and interest bearing vendor loans and
    convertible bonds issued by Gras Savoye. An analysis of the
    proceeds and the calculation of the gain is as follows:

At December 31, 2011 the Company had valuation allowances
    of $102 million (2010: $87 million) to reduce its deferred
    tax assets to estimated realizable value. The valuation
    allowances at December 31, 2011 relate to the deferred tax
    assets arising from UK capital loss carryforwards ($45 million)
    and other net operating losses ($6 million), which have no
    expiration date and to the deferred tax assets arising from US
    State net operating losses ($51 million). US State net operating
    losses will expire by 2030. Capital loss carryforwards can only
    be offset against future UK capital gains.

At December 31, 2011 the Company had deferred tax assets of
    $330 million (2010: $207 million), net of the valuation
    allowance. Management believes, based upon the level of
    historical taxable income and projections for future taxable
    income, it is more likely than not that the Company will realize
    the benefits of these deductible differences, net of the
    valuation allowance. However, the amount of the deferred tax
    asset considered realizable could be adjusted in the future if
    estimates of taxable income are revised.

The Company recognizes deferred tax balances related to the
    undistributed earnings of subsidiaries when the Company expects
    that it will recover those undistributed earnings in a taxable
    manner, such as through receipt of dividends or sale of the
    investments. The Company does not, however, provide for income
    taxes on the unremitted earnings of certain other subsidiaries
    where, in management’s opinion, such earnings have been
    indefinitely reinvested in those operations, or will be remitted
    either in a tax free liquidation or as dividends with taxes
    substantially offset by foreign tax credits. It is not practical
    to determine the amount of unrecognized deferred tax liabilities
    for temporary differences related to these investments.

Unrecognized tax
    benefits

Total unrecognized tax benefits as at December 31, 2011,
    totaled $16 million. During the next 12 months it is
    reasonably possible that the Company will recognize
    approximately $1 million of tax benefits related to the release
    of provisions no longer required due to either settlement
    through negotiation or closure of the statute of limitations on
    assessment.

A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amounts of
    unrecognized tax benefits is as follows:

INCOME TAXES
    (Continued)

All of the unrecognized tax benefits at December 31, 2011
    would, if recognized, favorably affect the effective tax rate in
    future periods.

The Company files tax returns in the various tax jurisdictions
    in which it operates. The 2007 US tax year closed in 2011 upon
    the expiration of the statute of limitations on assessment. US
    tax returns have been filed timely. The Company has received
    notice that the IRS will be examining the 2009 tax return. The
    Company has not extended the federal statute of limitations for
    assessment in the US.

All UK tax returns have been filed timely and are in the normal
    process of being reviewed, with HM Revenue & Customs
    making enquiries to obtain additional information. There are no
    material ongoing enquiries in relation to filed UK returns. In
    other jurisdictions the Company is no longer subject to
    examinations prior to 2002.

EARNINGS PER
    SHARE

Basic and diluted earnings per share are calculated by dividing
    net income attributable to Willis Group Holdings by the average
    number of shares outstanding during each period. The computation
    of diluted earnings per share reflects the potential dilution
    that could occur if dilutive securities and other contracts to
    issue shares were exercised or converted into shares or resulted
    in the issue of shares that then shared in the net income of the
    Company.

For the year ended December 31, 2011, time-based and
    performance-based options to purchase 9.2 million and
    7.3 million (2010: 11.5 million and 9.4 million;
    2009: 13.4 million and 8.9 million) shares,
    respectively, and 1.2 million restricted stock units (2010:
    1.8 million; 2009: 2.2 million), were outstanding.

Basic and diluted earnings per share are as follows:

    the dilutive effect of stock options because the effect was
    antidilutive (2010: 13.9 million shares; 2009:
    16.1 million shares).

FIDUCIARY
    ASSETS

The Company collects premiums from insureds and, after deducting
    its commissions, remits the premiums to the respective insurers;
    the Company also collects claims or refunds from insurers which
    it then remits to insureds. Uncollected premiums from insureds
    and uncollected claims or refunds from insurers (‘fiduciary
    receivables’) are recorded as fiduciary assets on the
    Company’s consolidated balance sheet. Unremitted insurance
    premiums, claims or refunds (‘fiduciary funds’) are
    also recorded within fiduciary assets.

Fiduciary assets therefore comprise both receivables and funds
    held in a fiduciary capacity.

Fiduciary funds, consisting primarily of time deposits with
    original maturities of less than or equal to three months, were
    $1,688 million as of December 31, 2011 (2010:
    $1,764 million). Accrued interest on funds is recorded as
    other assets.

GOODWILL

Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of businesses
    acquired over the fair market value of identifiable net assets
    at the dates of acquisition. Goodwill is not amortized but is
    subject to impairment testing annually and whenever facts or
    circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be
    recoverable.

The Company’s annual goodwill impairment test for 2011 has
    not resulted in an impairment charge (2010: $nil; 2009: $nil).

When a business entity is sold, goodwill is allocated to the
    disposed entity based on the fair value of that entity compared
    to the fair value of the reporting unit in which it is included.

    segment, is now reported in the North America segment. As a
    result of these changes, goodwill of $60 million has been
    reallocated from the International segment into the Global
    segment for Global Markets International, and $1 million
    has been reallocated from the International segment into the
    North America segment for Mexico Retail. Goodwill has been
    reallocated between segments using the relative fair value
    allocation approach.

INVESTMENTS IN
    ASSOCIATES

The Company holds a number of investments which it accounts for
    using the equity method. The Company’s approximate interest
    in the outstanding stock of the more significant associates is
    as follows:

December 31,

Country



Al-Futtaim Willis Co. L.L.C.

Dubai

49%

49%

GS & Cie Groupe

France

30%

31%

The Company’s principal investment as of December 31,
    2011 and 2010 is GS & Cie Groupe (‘Gras
    Savoye’), France’s leading insurance broker.

The Company’s original investment in Gras Savoye was made
    in 1997, when it acquired a 33 percent ownership interest.
    Between 1997 and December 2009 this interest was increased by a
    series of incremental investments to 49 percent.

On December 17, 2009, the Company completed a leveraged
    transaction with the original family shareholders of Gras Savoye
    and Astorg Partners, a private equity fund, to reorganize the
    capital of Gras Savoye (‘December 2009 leveraged



Willis
    Group Holdings plc

14.

INVESTMENTS IN
    ASSOCIATES (Continued)

transaction’). The Company, the original family
    shareholders and Astorg now own equal stakes of 30 percent
    in Gras Savoye and have equal representation of one third of the
    voting rights on its board. The remaining shareholding is held
    by a large pool of Gras Savoye managers and minority
    shareholders.

A put option that was in place prior to the December 2009
    leveraged transaction, and which could have increased the
    Company’s interest to 90 percent, has been canceled
    and the Company now has a new call option to purchase
    100 percent of the capital of Gras Savoye. If the Company
    does not waive the new call option before April 30, 2014,
    then it must exercise the new call option in 2015 or the other
    shareholders may initiate procedures to sell Gras Savoye. Except
    with the unanimous consent of the supervisory board and other
    customary exceptions, the parties are prohibited from
    transferring any shares of Gras Savoye until 2015. At the end of
    this period, shareholders are entitled to pre-emptive and
    tag-along rights.

As a result of the December 2009 leveraged transaction the
    Company recognized a gain of $10 million in the
    consolidated statement of operations for the year ended
    December 31, 2009 from the reduction of its interest in
    Gras Savoye from 49 percent to 31 percent. The Company
    received total proceeds of $281 million, comprising cash
    and interest bearing vendor loans and convertible bonds issued
    by Gras Savoye. See Note 6 — Net Gain (Loss) on
    Disposal of Operations for an analysis of the proceeds and the
    calculation of the gain.

In 2011 the Company’s ownership of Gras Savoye reduced from
    31 percent to 30 percent following issuance of additional share
    capital as part of an employee share incentive scheme.

The carrying amount of the Gras Savoye investment as of
    December 31, 2011 includes goodwill of $82 million
    (2010: $88 million) and interest bearing vendor loans and
    convertible bonds issued by Gras Savoye of $43 million and
    $85 million respectively (2010: $44 million and
    $78 million, respectively).

A gain of $4 million was recorded in 2011 following
    conclusion of the accounting for the December 2009 leveraged
    transaction.

As of December 31, 2011 and 2010, the Company’s other
    investments in associates, individually and in the aggregate,
    were not material to the Company’s operations.

Unaudited condensed financial information for associates, in the
    aggregate, as of and for the three years ended December 31,
    2011, is presented below. For convenience purposes:

PENSION
    PLANS

The Company maintains two principal defined benefit pension
    plans that cover the majority of our employees in the United
    States and United Kingdom. Both of these plans are now closed to
    new entrants. New entrants in the United Kingdom are
    offered the opportunity to join a defined contribution plan and
    in the United States are offered the opportunity to join a
    401(k) plan. In addition to the Company’s UK and US defined
    benefit pension plans, the Company



Notes
    to the financial statements

18.

PENSION PLANS
    (Continued)

has several smaller defined benefit pension plans in certain
    other countries in which it operates. Elsewhere, pension
    benefits are typically provided through defined contribution
    plans. It is the Company’s policy to fund pension costs as
    required by applicable laws and regulations.

Effective May 15, 2009, the Company closed the US defined
    benefit plan to future accrual. Consequently, a curtailment gain
    of $12 million was recognized during the year ended
    December 31, 2009.

At December 31, 2011, the Company recorded, on the
    Consolidated Balance Sheets:

•

a pension benefit asset of $145 million (2010:
    $182 million) representing:

•

$136 million (2010: $179 million) in respect of the UK
    defined benefit pension plan; and

•

$9 million (2010: $3 million) in respect of the
    international defined benefit pension plans.

•

a total liability for pension benefits of $270 million (2010:
    $167 million) representing:

•

$258 million (2010: $154 million) in respect of the US
    defined benefit pension plan; and

•

$12 million (2010: $13 million) in respect of the
    international defined benefit pension plans.

In the UK the pension trustees in consultation with the Company
    maintain a diversified asset portfolio and this together with
    contributions made by the Company is expected to meet the
    pension scheme’s liabilities as they become due. The UK
    plan’s assets are divided into 12 separate portfolios
    according to asset class and managed by 11 investment managers.
    The broad target allocations are UK and foreign equities (51
    percent), debt securities (22 percent), hedge funds (22 percent)
    and real estate (5 percent). In the US the Company’s
    investment policy is to maintain a diversified asset portfolio,
    which together with contributions made by the Company is
    expected to meet the pension scheme’s liabilities as they
    become due. The US plan’s assets are currently invested in
    11 funds representing most standard equity and debt security
    classes. The broad target allocations are US and foreign
    equities (55 percent) and debt securities (45 percent).

Fair Value
    Hierarchy

The fair value hierarchy has three levels based on the
    reliability of the inputs used to determine fair value:

•

Level 1: refers to fair values determined based on quoted
    market prices in active markets for identical assets;

•

Level 2: refers to fair values estimated using observable
    market based inputs or unobservable inputs that are corroborated
    by market data; and

•

Level 3: includes fair values estimated using unobservable
    inputs that are not corroborated by market data.

2017-2021



Willis North America has a 401(k) plan covering all eligible
    employees of Willis North America and its subsidiaries. The plan
    allows participants to make pre-tax contributions which the
    Company, at its discretion may match. During 2009, the Company
    had decided not to make any matching contributions other than
    for former HRH employees whose contributions were matched up to
    75 percent under the terms of the acquisition. In January
    2011, 401(k) matching was reinstated for our US associates. All
    investment assets of the plan are held in a trust account
    administered by independent trustees. The Company’s 401(k)
    matching contributions for 2011 were $10 million (2010: $nil;
    2009: $5 million).

    Investment UK Holdings Limited, TA I Limited, TA II Limited, TA
    III Limited, Trinity Acquisition plc, TA IV Limited and Willis
    Group Limited.

On that date and in connection with a group reorganization, TA

Debt
    issuance

In December 2011 we refinanced our bank facility, comprising a

5-year

$300 million term loan and a

5-year

$500 million revolving credit facility. The
    $300 million term loan replaces the $328 million
    balance on our $700 million

5-year

term
    loan facility and the $500 million revolving facility
    replaces our $300 million and our $200 million
    revolving credit facilities. Unamortized debt issuance costs of
    $10 million relating to these facilities were written off
    in December 2011 following completion of the refinancing. In
    2011, we made $83 million of mandatory repayments against
    the

5-year

term loan before repaying the $328 million balance in
    December 2011.

The

5-year

term loan facility expiring 2016 bears interest at LIBOR plus
    1.50% and is repayable in quarterly installments and a final
    repayment of $225 million is due in the fourth quarter of
    2016. Drawings under the new revolving $500 million credit
    facility bear interest at LIBOR plus 1.50% and the facility
    expires on December 16, 2016. As of

DEBT
    (Continued)

December 31, 2011 $nil was outstanding under the revolving
    credit facility. These margins apply while the Company’s
    debt rating remains BBB-/Baa3.

The agreements relating to our

5-year

term
    loan facility expiring 2016 and the revolving $500 million
    credit facility contain requirements to maintain maximum levels
    of consolidated funded indebtedness in relation to consolidated
    EBITDA and minimum level of consolidated EBITDA to consolidated
    cash interest expense, subject to certain adjustments. In
    addition, the agreements relating to our credit facilities and
    senior notes include, in the aggregate covenants relating to the
    delivery of financial statements, reports and notices,
    limitations on liens, limitations on sales and other disposals
    of assets, limitations on indebtedness and other liabilities,
    limitations on sale and leaseback transactions, limitations on
    mergers and other fundamental changes, maintenance of property,
    maintenance of insurance, nature of business, compliance with
    applicable laws, maintenance of corporate existence and rights,
    payment of taxes and access to information and properties. At
    December 31, 2011, the Company was in compliance with all
    covenants.

In March 2011, the Company issued $300 million of
    4.125% senior notes due 2016 and $500 million of
    5.750% senior notes due 2021. The effective interest rates
    of these senior notes are 4.240% and 5.871% respectively, which
    include the impact of the discount upon issuance. The proceeds
    were used to repurchase and redeem $500 million of
    12.875% senior notes due 2016 including a make-whole
    payment (representing a slight discount to the contractual
    make-whole amount) of $158 million. Following the
    repurchase the Company wrote off $13 million of unamortized
    debt issuance costs.

During the year ended December 31, 2010, the Company
    entered into a series of interest rate swaps for a total
    notional amount of $350 million to receive a fixed rate and
    pay a variable rate on a semi-annual basis, with a maturity date
    of July 15, 2015. The Company has designated and accounts
    for these instruments as fair value hedges against its
    $350 million 5.625% senior notes due 2015. The fair
    values of the interest rate swaps are included within other
    assets or other liabilities and the fair value of the hedged
    element of the senior notes is included within long-term debt.

On June 22, 2010, a further revolving facility of
    $20 million was put in place which bears interest at LIBOR
    plus 1.700% until 2012 and LIBOR plus 1.850% thereafter. The
    facility expires on December 22, 2012. As at
    December 31, 2011 no drawings had been made on the
    facility. This facility is solely for the use of our main UK
    regulated entity and would be available in certain exceptional
    circumstances. The facility is secured against the freehold of
    the UK regulated entity’s freehold property in Ipswich.

Lines of
    credit

The Company also has available $3 million (2010:
    $2 million) in lines of credit, of which $nil was drawn as
    of December 31, 2011 (2010: $nil).

Debt obligations
    and facilities

The Company’s debt and related interest obligations at
    December 31, 2011 are shown in the above table.

During 2011, the Company entered into a new revolving credit
    facility agreement under which $500 million is available.
    As at December 31, 2011 $nil was outstanding under the
    revolving credit facility.

This facility is in addition to the remaining availability of
    $20 million under the Company’s previously existing
    $20 million revolving credit facility.

The only mandatory repayments of debt over the next
    12 months are the scheduled repayment of $11 million
    current portion of the Company’s

5-year

term
    loan and the final payment of the 6.000% loan notes. We also
    have the right, at our option, to prepay indebtedness under the
    credit facility without further penalty and to redeem the senior
    notes at our option by paying a ‘make whole’ premium
    as provided under the applicable debt instrument.

Operating
    leases

The Company leases certain land, buildings and equipment under
    various operating lease arrangements. Original non-cancellable
    lease terms typically are between 10 and 20 years and may
    contain escalation clauses, along with options that

permit early withdrawal. The total amount of the minimum rent is
    expensed on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.

As of December 31, 2011, the aggregate future minimum
    rental commitments under all non-cancellable operating lease
    agreements are as follows:

The Company leases its main London building under a

operating lease, which expires in 2032. The Company’s
    contractual obligations in relation to this commitment included
    in the table above total $715 million (2010:
    $744 million). Annual rentals are $30 million (2010:
    $31 million) per year and the Company has subleased
    approximately 29 percent (2010: 25 percent) of the premises
    under leases up to 15 years. The amounts receivable from
    subleases, included in the table above, total $82 million
    (2010: $87 million; 2009: $100 million).

Rent expense amounted to $127 million for the year ended
    December 31, 2011 (2010: $131 million; 2009:
    $154 million). The Company’s rental income from
    subleases was $18 million for the year ended
    December 31, 2011 (2010: $22 million; 2009:
    $21 million).

Pensions

Contractual obligations for our pension plans reflect the
    contributions we expect to make over the next five years into
    our US and UK plans. These contributions are based on current
    funding positions and may increase or decrease dependent on the
    future performance of the two plans.

In the UK, we are required to agree a funding strategy for our
    UK defined benefit plan with the plan’s trustees. In
    February 2009, we agreed to make full year contributions to the
    UK plan of $39 million for 2009 through 2012, excluding
    amounts in respect of the salary sacrifice scheme. In addition,
    if certain funding targets were not met at the beginning of any
    of the following years, 2010 through 2012, a further
    contribution of $39 million would be required for that
    year. In 2010, the additional funding requirement was triggered
    and we expect to make a similar additional contribution in 2011.
    A similar, additional contribution may also be required for
    2012, depending on actual performance against funding targets at
    the beginning of 2012.

Based on the current UK funding strategy and as shown in the
    table above, the total contracted contributions for all plans
    are currently estimated to be approximately $91 million in
    2012, excluding amounts of approximately $12 million in
    respect of the salary sacrifice scheme. However, a revised UK
    funding strategy, and hence 2012 contribution, is expected to be
    finalized shortly and the final 2012 contribution for all plans
    is expected to be approximately $142 million, including
    salary sacrifice.

Guarantees

Guarantees issued by certain of Willis Group Holdings’
    subsidiaries with respect to the senior notes and revolving
    credit facilities are discussed in Note 19 — Debt
    in these consolidated financial statements.



Willis
    Group Holdings plc

21.

COMMITMENTS AND
    CONTINGENCIES (Continued)

Certain of Willis Group Holdings’ subsidiaries have given
    the landlords of some leasehold properties occupied by the
    Company in the United Kingdom and the United States guarantees
    in respect of the performance of the lease obligations of the
    subsidiary holding the lease. The operating lease obligations
    subject to such guarantees amounted to $828 million and
    $855 million at December 31, 2011 and 2010,
    respectively.

In addition, the Company has given guarantees to bankers and
    other third parties relating principally to letters of credit
    amounting to $7 million and $11 million at
    December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Willis Group
    Holdings also guarantees certain of its UK and Irish
    subsidiaries’ obligations to fund the UK and Irish defined
    benefit plans.

Other contractual
    obligations

For certain subsidiaries and associates, the Company has the
    right to purchase shares (a call option) from co-shareholders at
    various dates in the future. In addition, the co-shareholders of
    certain subsidiaries and associates have the right to sell their
    shares (a put option) to the Company at various dates in the
    future. Generally, the exercise price of such put options and
    call options is formula-based (using revenues and earnings) and
    is designed to reflect fair value. Based on current projections
    of profitability and exchange rates and assuming the put options
    are exercised, the potential amount payable from these options
    is not expected to exceed $72 million (2010:
    $40 million).

In July 2010, the Company made a capital commitment of
    $25 million to Trident V Parallel Fund, LP, an investment
    fund managed by Stone Point Capital. This replaced a capital
    commitment of $25 million that had been made to
    Trident V, LP in December 2009. As at December 31,
    2011 there have been approximately $6 million of capital
    contributions.

In May 2011, the Company made a capital commitment of
    $10 million to Dowling Capital Partners I, LP. As at
    December 31, 2011 there had been no capital contributions.

Other contractual obligations at December 31, 2011 also
    include the capital lease on the Company’s Nashville
    property of $63 million, payable from 2012 onwards.

Claims, Lawsuits
    and Other Proceedings

In the ordinary course of business, the Company is subject to
    various actual and potential claims, lawsuits, and other
    proceedings relating principally to alleged errors and omissions
    in connection with the placement of insurance and reinsurance.
    Similar to other corporations, the Company is also subject to a
    variety of other claims, including those relating to the
    Company’s employment practices. Some of the claims,
    lawsuits and other proceedings seek damages in amounts which
    could, if assessed, be significant.

Errors and omissions claims, lawsuits, and other proceedings
    arising in the ordinary course of business are covered in part
    by professional indemnity or other appropriate insurance. The
    terms of this insurance vary by policy year and self-insured
    risks have increased significantly in recent years. Regarding
    self-insured risks, the Company has established provisions which
    are believed to be adequate in the light of current information
    and legal advice, and the Company adjusts such provisions from
    time to time according to developments.

On the basis of current information, the Company does not expect
    that the actual claims, lawsuits and other proceedings, to which
    the Company is subject, or potential claims, lawsuits, and other
    proceedings relating to matters of which it is aware, will
    ultimately have a material adverse effect on the Company’s
    financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.
    Nonetheless, given the large or indeterminate amounts sought in
    certain of these actions, and the inherent unpredictability of
    litigation and disputes with insurance companies, it is possible
    that an adverse outcome in certain matters could, from time to
    time, have a material adverse effect on the Company’s
    results of operations or cash flows in particular quarterly or
    annual periods.

The material actual or potential claims, lawsuits and other
    proceedings, of which the Company is currently aware, are:

Assurance of
    Discontinuance

In connection with the investigation launched by the New York
    State Attorney General in April 2004 concerning, among other
    things, contingent commissions paid by insurers to insurance
    brokers, in April 2005, the Company entered into an Assurance of
    Discontinuance (‘Original AOD’) with the New York
    State Attorney General and the Superintendent of the New York
    Insurance Department and paid $50 million to eligible
    clients. As part of the Original AOD, the Company also agreed
    not to accept contingent compensation and to disclose to
    customers any compensation the Company will receive in
    connection with providing policy placement services to the
    customer. The Company also resolved similar investigations
    launched by the Minnesota Attorney General, the Florida Attorney
    General, the Florida Department of Financial Services, and the
    Florida Office of Insurance Regulation for amounts that were not
    material to the Company.

Similarly, in August 2005, HRH entered into an agreement with
    the Attorney General of the State of Connecticut and the
    Insurance Commissioner of the State of Connecticut to resolve
    all issues related to their investigations into certain
    insurance brokerage and insurance agency practices and to settle
    a lawsuit brought in August 2005 by the Connecticut Attorney
    General alleging violations of the Connecticut Unfair Trade
    Practices Act and the Connecticut Unfair Insurance Practices
    Act. As part of this settlement, HRH agreed to take certain
    actions including establishing a $30 million national fund
    for distribution to certain clients; enhancing disclosure
    practices for agency and broker clients; and declining to accept
    contingent compensation on brokerage business.

On February 16, 2010, the Company entered into the Amended
    and Restated Assurance of Discontinuance with the Attorney
    General of the State of New York and the Amended and Restated
    Stipulation with the Superintendent of Insurance of the State of
    New York (the ‘Amended and Restated AOD’) on behalf of
    itself and its named subsidiaries. The Amended and Restated AOD
    was effective February 11, 2010 and supersedes and replaces
    the Original AOD.

The Amended and Restated AOD specifically recognizes that the
    Company has substantially met its obligations under the Original
    AOD and ends many of the requirements previously imposed. It
    relieves the Company of a number of technical compliance
    obligations that have imposed significant administrative and
    financial burdens on its operations. The Amended and Restated
    AOD no longer limits the types of compensation the Company can
    receive and has lowered the compensation disclosure
    requirements. The Amended and Restated AOD requires the Company,
    among other things to: (i) in New York, and each of the
    other 49 states of the United States, the District of
    Columbia and U.S. territories, provide compensation
    disclosure that will, at a minimum, comply with the terms of the
    applicable regulations, as may be amended from time to time, or
    the provisions of the AOD that existed prior to the adoption of
    the Amended and Restated AOD; and (ii) maintain its
    compliance programs and continue to provide appropriate training
    to relevant employees in business ethics, professional
    obligations, conflicts of interest, and antitrust and trade
    practices compliance.

European
    Commission Sector Inquiry

In 2006, the European Commission issued questionnaires pursuant
    to its Sector Inquiry or, in respect of Norway, the European
    Free Trade Association Surveillance Authority, related to
    insurance business practices, including compensation
    arrangements for brokers, to at least 150 European brokers
    including our operations in nine European countries. The Company
    filed responses to the European Commission and the European Free
    Trade Association Surveillance Authority questionnaires. The
    European Commission reported on September 25, 2007,
    expressing concerns over potential conflicts of interest in the
    industry relating to remuneration and binding authorities and
    also over the nature of the coinsurance market.

The Company cooperated with both the European Free Trade
    Association Surveillance Authority and the European Commission
    to resolve issues raised in its final report regarding
    coinsurance as required of the industry by the European
    Commission. The European Commission has appointed Ernst &
    Young to conduct a review of the coinsurance market and

we anticipate that, along with our competitors and insurers, our
    European subsidiaries will receive further questionnaires on
    this matter this year.

Contingent
    Compensation Class Action

Since August 2004, the Company and HRH (along with various other
    brokers and insurers) have been named as defendants in purported
    class actions in various courts across the United States. All of
    these actions have been consolidated into a single action in the
    US District Court for the District of New Jersey
    (‘MDL’). These actions allege that the brokers
    breached their duties to their clients by entering into
    contingent compensation agreements with either no disclosure or
    limited disclosure to clients and participated in other improper
    activities. Plaintiffs seek monetary damages, including punitive
    damages, and certain equitable relief. In May 2011, the majority
    of defendants, including the Company and HRH, entered into a
    written settlement agreement with plaintiffs. On June 28,
    2011, the Judge entered an Order granting preliminary approval
    to the settlement agreement. Notice of the settlement was sent
    to all members of the class and each member was given the
    opportunity to opt out of the settlement and pursue its own
    individual claim against any defendant. A total of 84 members of
    the class have opted out of the settlement. A Fairness Hearing
    to decide if the settlement should be given final approval took
    place on September 14, 2011, but the Judge has not yet
    issued his decision on approval of the settlement. The amount of
    the proposed settlement to be paid by the Company and HRH is
    immaterial and was previously reserved.

Additional actions could be brought in the future by individual
    policyholders. The Company disputes the allegations in all of
    these suits and has been and intends to continue to defend
    itself vigorously against these actions. The outcomes of these
    lawsuits, however, including any losses or other payments that
    may occur as a result, cannot be predicted at this time.

Gender
    Discrimination Class Action

In December 2006, a purported class action was filed against the
    Company in the United States District Court, Southern District
    of New York, alleging that the Company discriminated against
    female officers and officer equivalent employees on the basis of
    their gender and seeking injunctive relief, monetary damages and
    attorneys’ fees and costs. In January 2011, the Company
    reached a settlement with plaintiffs that resolves all
    individual and class claims. The amount of this settlement is
    not material. The Court has given preliminary approval to the
    settlement. Notice of that settlement has been provided to the
    class members and the Court held a Fairness Hearing on
    December 12, 2011 to decide if final approval should be
    given to the settlement. On December 19, 2011, the Court
    granted final approval of the settlement, and the settlement
    payments are being distributed to class members.

World Trade
    Center

The Company acted as the insurance broker, but not as an
    underwriter, for the placement of both property and casualty
    insurance for a number of entities which were directly impacted
    by the September 11, 2001 destruction of the World Trade
    Center complex, including Silverstein Properties LLC, which
    acquired a

99-year

leasehold interest in the twin towers and related facilities
    from the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey in July 2001.
    Although the World Trade Center complex insurance was bound at
    or before the July 2001 closing of the leasehold acquisition,
    consistent with standard industry practice, the final policy
    wording for the placements was still in the process of being
    finalized when the twin towers and other buildings in the
    complex were destroyed on September 11, 2001. There have
    been a number of lawsuits in the United States between the
    insured parties and the insurers for several placements. Other
    disputes may arise in respect of insurance placed by us which
    could affect the Company including claims by one or more of the
    insureds that the Company made culpable errors or omissions in
    connection with our brokerage activities. However, the Company
    does not believe that our role as broker will lead to
    liabilities which in the aggregate would have a material adverse
    effect on our results of operations, financial condition or
    liquidity.

Stanford
    Financial Group Litigation

The Company has been named as a defendant in six similar
    lawsuits relating to the collapse of The Stanford Financial
    Group (‘Stanford’), for which Willis of Colorado, Inc.
    acted as broker of record on certain lines of insurance. The
    complaints in these actions generally allege that the defendants
    actively and materially aided Stanford’s alleged fraud by
    providing Stanford with certain letters regarding coverage that
    they knew would be used to help retain or attract actual or
    prospective Stanford client investors. The complaints further
    allege that these letters, which contain statements about
    Stanford and the insurance policies that the defendants placed
    for Stanford, contained untruths and omitted material facts and
    were drafted in this manner to help Stanford promote and sell
    its allegedly fraudulent certificates of deposit.

The six actions are as follows:

•

Troice, et al. v. Willis of Colorado, Inc., et al.

, C.A.

No. 3:09-CV-01274-N,

was filed on July 2, 2009 in the U.S. District Court
    for the Northern District of Texas against Willis Group Holdings
    plc, Willis of Colorado, Inc. and a Willis associate, among
    others. On April 1, 2011, plaintiffs filed the operative
    Third Amended Class Action Complaint individually and on
    behalf of a putative, worldwide class of Stanford investors,
    adding Willis Limited as a defendant and alleging claims under
    Texas statutory and common law and seeking damages in excess of
    $1 billion, punitive damages and costs. On May 2,
    2011, the defendants filed motions to dismiss the Third Amended
    Class Action Complaint, arguing,

inter alia

, that
    the plaintiffs’ claims are precluded by the Securities
    Litigation Uniform Standards Act of 1998 (‘SLUSA’).

•

Ranni v. Willis of Colorado, Inc., et al.

, C.A.

No. 09-22085,

was filed on July 17, 2009 against Willis Group Holdings
    plc and Willis of Colorado, Inc. in the U.S. District Court
    for the Southern District of Florida. The complaint was filed on
    behalf of a putative class of Venezuelan and other South
    American Stanford investors and alleges claims under Section
    10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (and

Rule 10b-5

thereunder) and Florida statutory and common law and seeks
    damages in an amount to be determined at trial. On
    October 6, 2009,

Ranni

was transferred, for
    consolidation or coordination with other Stanford-related
    actions (including

Troice

), to the Northern District of
    Texas by the U.S. Judicial Panel on Multidistrict
    Litigation (the ‘JPML’). The defendants have not yet

•

Canabal, et al. v. Willis of Colorado, Inc., et al.

, C.A.

No. 3:09-CV-01474-D,

was filed on August 6, 2009 against Willis Group Holdings
    plc, Willis of Colorado, Inc. and the same Willis associate
    named as a defendant in

Troice

, among others, also in the
    Northern District of Texas. The complaint was filed individually
    and on behalf of a putative class of Venezuelan Stanford
    investors, alleged claims under Texas statutory and common law
    and sought damages in excess of $1 billion, punitive
    damages, attorneys’ fees and costs. On December 18,
    2009, the parties in

Troice

and

Canabal

stipulated
    to the consolidation of those actions (under the

Troice

civil action number), and, on December 31, 2009, the
    plaintiffs in

Canabal

filed a notice of dismissal,
    dismissing the action without prejudice.

•

Rupert, et al. v. Winter, et al.

, Case
    No. 2009C115137, was filed on September 14, 2009 on
    behalf of 97 Stanford investors against Willis Group Holdings
    plc, Willis of Colorado, Inc. and the same Willis associate,
    among others, in Texas state court (Bexar County). The complaint
    alleges claims under the Securities Act of 1933, Texas and
    Colorado statutory law and Texas common law and seeks special,
    consequential and treble damages of more than $300 million,
    attorneys’ fees and costs. On October 20, 2009,
    certain defendants, including Willis of Colorado, Inc.,
    (i) removed

Rupert

to the U.S. District Court
    for the Western District of Texas, (ii) notified the JPML
    of the pendency of this related action and (iii) moved to
    stay the action pending a determination by the JPML as to
    whether it should be transferred to the Northern District of
    Texas for consolidation or coordination with the other
    Stanford-related actions. On April 1, 2010, the JPML issued
    a final transfer order for the transfer of

Rupert

to the
    Northern District of Texas. On January 24, 2012, the Court
    remanded

Rupert

to Texas State Court (Bexar County), but
    stayed these cases until further order of the court. The
    defendants have not yet responded to the complaint in

•

Casanova, et al. v. Willis of Colorado, Inc., et al.

,
    C.A.

No. 3:10-CV-01862-O,

was filed on September 16, 2010 on behalf of seven Stanford
    investors against Willis Group Holdings plc, Willis Limited,
    Willis of Colorado, Inc. and the same Willis associate, among
    others, also in the Northern District of Texas. The complaint
    alleges claims under Texas statutory and common law and seeks
    actual damages in excess of $5 million, punitive damages,

    of two Stanford investors, individually and as representatives
    of certain trusts, against Willis Group Holdings plc, Willis of
    Colorado, Inc., Willis of Texas, Inc. and the same Willis
    associate, among others, in Texas state court (Bexar County).
    The complaint alleges claims under Texas and Colorado statutory
    law and Texas common law and seeks special, consequential and
    treble damages of more than $37 million and attorneys’
    fees and costs. On April 11, 2011, certain defendants,
    including Willis of Colorado, Inc., (i) removed

Rishmague

    (ii) notified the JPML of the pendency of this related
    action and (iii) moved to stay the action pending a
    determination by the JPML as to whether it should be transferred
    to the Northern District of Texas for consolidation or

    August 8, 2011, the JPML issued a final transfer order for
    the transfer of

On May 10, 2011, the court presiding over the
    Stanford-related actions in the Northern District of Texas
    entered an order providing that it would consider the
    applicability of SLUSA to the Stanford-related actions based on
    the decision in a separate Stanford action not involving a
    Willis entity,

Roland v. Green

, Civil Action

No. 3:10-CV-0224-N.

On August 31, 2011, the court issued its decision in

Roland

, dismissing that action with prejudice under SLUSA

On October 27, 2011, the court in

Troice

entered an
    order (i) dismissing with prejudice those claims asserted
    in the Third Amended Class Action Complaint on a class
    basis on the grounds set forth in the

Roland

decision
    discussed above and (ii) dismissing without prejudice those
    claims asserted the Third Amended Class Action Complaint on
    an individual basis. Also on October 27, 2011, the court
    entered a final judgment in the action.

On October 28, 2011, the plaintiffs in

Troice

filed
    a notice of appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the
    Fifth Circuit. Subsequently,

Troice, Roland

and a third
    action captioned

    consolidated for purposes of briefing and oral argument. The
    appeals have been fully briefed and the Fifth Circuit heard oral
    argument on February 7, 2012. A ruling is expected sometime
    this year.

Additional actions could be brought in the future by other
    investors in certificates of deposit issued by Stanford and its
    affiliates. The Company disputes these allegations and intends
    to defend itself vigorously against these actions. The outcomes
    of these actions, however, including any losses or other
    payments that may occur as a result, cannot be predicted at this
    time.

Regulatory
    Investigation

Given the increased interest expressed by US and UK regulators
    in the effectiveness of compliance controls relating to
    financial crime in our market sector in particular, we began a
    voluntary internal review of our policies and controls four
    years ago. This review includes analysis and advice from
    external experts on best practices, review of public regulatory
    decisions, and discussions with government regulators in the US
    and UK. In addition, during 2010 and 2011 the UK Financial
    Services Authority (the ‘FSA’) conducted an
    investigation of Willis Limited’s, our UK brokerage
    subsidiary, compliance systems and controls between 2005 and
    2009. On July 21, 2011, we and the FSA announced a
    settlement under which the FSA concluded its investigation by
    assessing a £7 million ($11 million) fine on
    Willis Limited for lapses in its implementation and
    documentation of its controls to counter the risks of improper
    payments being made to non-FSA authorized overseas third parties
    engaged to help win business, particularly in high risk
    jurisdictions.

As a result of the FSA settlement, we are conducting a further
    internal review of all payments made between 2005 and 2009. We
    also continue to fully cooperate with our US regulators, however
    we are unable to predict at this time when our discussions with
    them will be concluded. We do not believe that this further
    internal review or our discussions with the US regulators will
    result in any material fines or sanctions, but there can be no
    assurance that any resolution will not have an adverse impact on
    our ability to conduct our business in certain jurisdictions.
    While we believe that our current

    CONTINGENCIES (Continued)

systems and controls are adequate and in accordance with all
    applicable laws and regulations, we cannot assure that such
    systems and controls will prevent any violations of applicable
    laws and regulations.

DERIVATIVE
    FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES

Fair value of
    derivative financial instruments

In addition to the note below, see Note 26 for information
    about the fair value hierarchy of derivatives.

Primary risks
    managed by derivative financial instruments

The main risks managed by derivative financial instruments are
    interest rate risk and foreign currency risk. The Company’s
    board of directors reviews and approves policies for managing
    each of these risks as summarized below.

The Company enters into derivative transactions (principally
    interest rate swaps and forward foreign currency contracts) in
    order to manage interest rate and foreign currency risks arising
    from the Company’s operations and its sources of finance.
    The Company does not hold financial or derivative instruments
    for trading purposes.

Interest Rate
    Risk — Investment Income

As a result of the Company’s operating activities, the
    Company receives cash for premiums and claims which it deposits
    in short-term investments denominated in US dollars and other
    currencies. The Company earns interest on these funds, which is
    included in the Company’s financial statements as
    investment income. These funds are regulated in terms of

    Group Holdings plc

25.

DERIVATIVE
    FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES
    (Continued)

access and the instruments in which they may be invested, most
    of which are short-term in maturity. In order to manage interest
    rate risk arising from these financial assets, the Company
    enters into interest rate swaps to receive a fixed rate of
    interest and pay a variable rate of interest fixed in the
    various currencies related to the short-term investments. The
    use of interest rate contracts essentially converts groups of
    short-term variable rate investments to fixed rates.

The fair value of these contracts is recorded in other assets
    and other liabilities. For contracts that qualify as cash flow
    hedges for accounting purposes, the effective portions of
    changes in fair value are recorded as a component of other
    comprehensive income.

At December 31, 2011 and 2010, the Company had the
    following derivative financial instruments that were designated
    as cash flow hedges of interest rate risk:

Interest Rate
    Risk — Interest Expense

The Company’s operations are financed principally by
    $2,050 million fixed rate senior notes and
    $300 million under a

5-year

term
    loan facility.

During the year ended December 31, 2010, the Company
    entered into a series of interest rate swaps for a total
    notional amount of $350 million to receive a fixed rate and
    pay a variable rate on a semi-annual basis, with a maturity date
    of July 15, 2015. At the year end the weighted average
    fixed rate was 2.71% and variable rate was 0.44%. The Company
    has designated and accounts for these instruments as fair value
    hedges against its $350 million 5.625% senior notes
    due 2015. The fair values of the interest rate swaps are
    included within other assets or other liabilities and the fair
    value of the hedged element of the senior notes is included
    within long-term debt.

The Company also has access to $520 million under two
    revolving credit facilities; as of December 31, 2011 $nil
    was drawn on these facilities. The

5-year

term
    loan facility bears interest at LIBOR plus 1.50%. Drawings under
    the revolving $500 million credit facility bear interest at
    LIBOR plus 1.50%. These margins apply while the Company’s
    debt rating remains BBB-/Baa3. Should the Company’s debt
    rating change, then the margin will change in accordance with
    the credit facilities agreements.

At December 31, 2011 and 2010, the Company’s interest
    rate swaps were all designated as hedging instruments.



Notes
    to the financial statements

25.

DERIVATIVE
    FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES
    (Continued)

Foreign Currency
    Risk

The Company’s primary foreign exchange risks arise:

•

from changes in the exchange rate between US dollars and pounds
    sterling as its London market operations earn the majority of
    their revenues in US dollars and incur expenses predominantly in
    pounds sterling, and may also hold a significant net sterling
    asset or liability position on the balance sheet. In addition,
    the London market operations earn significant revenues in Euros
    and Japanese yen; and

•

from the translation into US dollars of the net income and net
    assets of its foreign subsidiaries, excluding the London market
    operations which are US dollar denominated.

The foreign exchange risks in its London market operations are
    hedged as follows:

•

to the extent that forecast pound sterling expenses exceed pound
    sterling revenues, the Company limits its exposure to this
    exchange rate risk by the use of forward contracts matched to
    specific, clearly identified cash outflows arising in the
    ordinary course of business; and

•

to the extent the UK operations earn significant revenues in
    Euros and Japanese yen, the Company limits its exposure to
    changes in the exchange rate between the US dollar and these
    currencies by the use of forward contracts matched to a
    percentage of forecast cash inflows in specific currencies and
    periods.

The Company does not hedge net income earned within foreign
    subsidiaries outside of the UK.

The fair value of foreign currency contracts is recorded in
    other assets and other liabilities. For contracts that qualify
    as accounting hedges, changes in fair value resulting from
    movements in the spot exchange rate are recorded as a component
    of other comprehensive income whilst changes resulting from a
    movement in the time value are recorded in interest expense. For
    contracts that do not qualify for hedge accounting, the total
    change in fair value is recorded in interest expense. Amounts
    held in comprehensive income are reclassified into earnings when
    the hedged exposure affects earnings.

At December 31, 2011 and 2010, the Company’s foreign
    currency contracts were all designated as hedging instruments
    except for those relating to short-term cash flows in its London
    market operations.

The table below summarizes by major currency the contractual
    amounts of the Company’s forward contracts to exchange
    foreign currencies for pounds sterling in the case of US dollars
    and US dollars for Euro and Japanese yen. Foreign currency
    notional amounts are reported in US dollars translated at
    contracted exchange rates.

DERIVATIVE
    FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES
    (Continued)

For interest rate swaps all components of each derivative’s
    gain or loss were included in the assessment of hedge
    effectiveness. For foreign exchange contracts only the changes
    in fair value resulting from movements in the spot exchange rate
    are included in this assessment. In instances where the timing
    of expected cash flows can be matched exactly to the maturity of
    the foreign exchange contract, then changes in fair value
    attributable to movement in the forward points are also included.

At December 31, 2011 the Company estimates there will be
    $2 million of net derivative gains reclassified from
    accumulated comprehensive income into earnings within the next
    twelve months.

The following methods and assumptions were used by the Company
    in estimating its fair value disclosure for financial
    instruments:

Cash and cash equivalents—The estimated fair value of these
    financial instruments approximates their carrying values due to
    their short maturities.

Fiduciary funds—Fair values are based on quoted market
    values.

Long-term debt excluding the fair value hedge—Fair values
    are based on quoted market values.

Derivative financial instruments—Market values have been
    used to determine the fair value of interest rate swaps and
    forward foreign exchange contracts based on estimated amounts
    the Company would receive or have to pay to terminate the
    agreements, taking into account the current interest rate
    environment or current foreign currency forward rates.

FINANCIAL
    INFORMATION FOR PARENT GUARANTOR, OTHER GUARANTOR SUBSIDIARIES
    AND NON-GUARANTOR SUBSIDIARIES

Willis North America Inc. (‘Willis North America’) has
    $350 million senior notes outstanding that were issued on
    July 1, 2005. Willis North America issued a further
    $600 million of senior notes on March 28, 2007 and
    another $300 million on September 29, 2009.

Until December 22, 2010, all direct obligations under the
    senior notes were jointly and severally, irrevocably and fully
    and unconditionally guaranteed by Willis Group Holdings, Willis
    Netherlands Holdings B.V., Willis Investment UK Holdings
    Limited, TA I Limited, TA II Limited, Trinity Acquisition plc,
    TA III Limited, TA IV Limited and Willis Group Limited. On that
    date and in connection with an internal group reorganization, TA
    II Limited, TA III Limited and TA IV Limited transferred their
    obligations as guarantors to the other guarantor companies. TA
    II Limited, TA III Limited and TA IV Limited entered voluntary
    liquidation on December 31, 2010. The assets of these
    companies were distributed to the other guarantor companies
    described below (‘Other Guarantors’), either directly
    or indirectly, as a final distribution paid prior to their
    entering voluntary liquidation. As such, these transactions did
    not have a material impact on the guarantees of the senior notes
    and did not require the consent of the noteholders under the
    applicable indentures.

The debt securities that were issued by Willis North America and
    guaranteed by the entities described above, and for which the
    disclosures set forth below relate and are required under
    applicable SEC rules, were issued under a ‘shelf’
    registration statement on

Form S-3,

including our current June 2009 registration statement (the
    ‘Willis Shelf’).

Presented below is condensed consolidating financial information
    for:

(i)

Willis Group Holdings, which is a guarantor, on a parent company
    only basis;

(ii)

the Other Guarantors, which are all 100 percent directly or
    indirectly owned subsidiaries of the parent and are all direct
    or indirect parents of the issuer;

(iii)

the Issuer, Willis North America;

(iv)

Other, which are the non-guarantor subsidiaries, on a combined
    basis;

(v)

Consolidating adjustments; and

(vi)

the Consolidated Company.

The equity method has been used for investments in subsidiaries
    in the condensed consolidating balance sheets for the year ended
    December 31, 2011 of Willis Group Holdings, the Other
    Guarantors and the Issuer. Investments in subsidiaries in the
    condensed consolidating balance sheet for Other, represents the
    cost of investment in subsidiaries recorded in the parent
    companies of the non-guarantor subsidiaries.

The entities included in the Other Guarantors column for the
    year ended December 31, 2011 are Willis Netherlands
    Holdings B.V., Willis Investment UK Holdings Limited, Trinity
    Acquisition plc, TA I Limited and Willis Group Limited.

FINANCIAL
    INFORMATION FOR PARENT ISSUER, GUARANTOR SUBSIDIARIES AND

NON-GUARANTOR

SUBSIDIARIES

The Company may offer debt securities, preferred stock, ordinary
    stock and other securities pursuant to the Willis Shelf. On
    March 17, 2011, the Company issued senior notes totaling
    $800 million under its existing registration statement.
    These debt securities are issued by Willis Group Holdings
    (‘Holdings Debt Securities’) and are guaranteed by
    certain of the Company’s subsidiaries. Therefore, the
    Company is providing the condensed consolidating financial
    information below. The following 100 percent directly or
    indirectly owned subsidiaries fully and unconditionally
    guarantee the Holdings Debt Securities on a joint and several
    basis: Willis Netherlands Holdings B.V., Willis Investment UK
    Holdings Limited, TA I Limited, Trinity Acquisition plc, Willis
    Group Limited and Willis North America (the
    ‘Guarantors’).

The guarantor structure described above differs from the
    guarantor structure associated with the senior notes issued by
    Willis North America (the ‘Willis North America Debt
    Securities’) (and for which condensed consolidating
    financial information is presented in Note 29) in that
    Willis Group Holdings is the Parent Issuer and Willis North
    America is a subsidiary guarantor.

Presented below is condensed consolidating financial information
    for:

(i)

Willis Group Holdings, which is the Parent Issuer;

(ii)

the Guarantors, which are all 100 percent directly or
    indirectly owned subsidiaries of the parent;

(iii)

Other, which are the non-guarantor subsidiaries, on a combined
    basis;

(iv)

Consolidating adjustments; and

(v)

the Consolidated Company.

The equity method has been used for investments in subsidiaries
    in the condensed consolidating balance sheets for the year ended
    December 31, 2011 of Willis Group Holdings and the
    Guarantors. Investments in subsidiaries in the condensed
    consolidating balance sheet for Other, represents the cost of
    investment in subsidiaries recorded in the parent companies of
    the non-guarantor subsidiaries.

The entities included in the Guarantors column for the year
    ended December 31, 2011 are Willis Netherlands Holdings
    B.V., Willis Investment UK Holdings Limited, TA I Limited,
    Trinity Acquisition plc, Willis Group Limited and Willis North
    America.

Item 9A —
    Controls and Procedures

Evaluation of
    Disclosure Controls and Procedures

As of December 31, 2011, the Company carried out an
    evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of
    the Company’s management, including the Chairman and Chief
    Executive Officer and the Group Chief Financial Officer, of the
    effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company’s
    disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Exchange Act

Rule 13a-15(e).

Based upon that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and the
    Group Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of that date,
    the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures as defined
    in

Rule 13a-15(e)

are effective.

Management’s
    Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining
    adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in

Rule 13a-15(f)

under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

Under the supervision and with the participation of our
    management, including our principal executive officer and
    principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the
    effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting
    as of December 31, 2011, based on the criteria related to
    internal control over financial reporting described in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework

issued
    by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
    Commission. Based on our evaluation, management concluded that
    our internal control over financial reporting was effective as
    of December 31, 2011.

Our independent registered public accountants, Deloitte LLP, who
    have audited and reported on our financial statements, have
    undertaken an assessment of the Company’s internal control
    over financial reporting. Deloitte’s report is presented
    below.

February 29, 2012.



REPORT OF
    INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Willis Group
    Holdings Public Limited Company, Dublin, Ireland

We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of
    Willis Group Holdings Public Limited Company and subsidiaries
    (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2011, based on
    criteria established in

Internal Control —
    Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
    Organizations of the Treadway Commission. The Company’s
    management is responsible for maintaining effective internal
    control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the
    effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting,
    included in the accompanying Management’s Report on
    Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is
    to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control
    over financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control
    over financial reporting was maintained in all material
    respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of
    internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk
    that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the
    design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on
    the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we
    considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our
    audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
    process designed by, or under the supervision of, the
    company’s principal executive and principal financial
    officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected
    by the company’s board of directors, management, and other
    personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
    internal control over financial reporting includes those
    policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance
    of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
    reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
    company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions
    are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
    statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
    principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
    are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
    management and directors of the company; and (3) provide
    reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
    unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
    company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
    financial statements.

Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over
    financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or
    improper management override of controls, material misstatements
    due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a
    timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of the
    effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting
    to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may
    become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the
    degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may
    deteriorate.

In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material
    respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as
    of December 31, 2011, based on the criteria established in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework

issued
    by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
    Commission.

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
    consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended
    December 31, 2011 of the Company and our report dated
    February 29, 2012 expressed an unqualified opinion on those
    financial statements.
