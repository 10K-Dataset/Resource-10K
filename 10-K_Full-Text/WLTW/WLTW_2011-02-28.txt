Item 1 —
    Business

History and
    Development of the Company

Willis Group Holdings is the ultimate holding company for the
    Group. We trace our history to 1828 and are one of the largest
    insurance brokers in the world.

Willis Group Holdings was incorporated in Ireland on
    September 24, 2009 to facilitate the change of the place of
    incorporation of the parent company of the Group from Bermuda to
    Ireland (the ‘Redomicile’). At the Effective Time, the
    common shares of Willis-Bermuda were canceled, the
    Willis-Bermuda common shareholders received, on a

one-for-one

basis, new ordinary shares of Willis Group Holdings, and Willis
    Group Holdings became the ultimate parent company for the Group.

For administrative convenience, we utilize the offices of a
    subsidiary company as our principal executive offices. The
    address is:

Willis Group Holdings Public Limited Company

c/o Willis

Group Limited

The Willis Building

51 Lime Street

London EC3M 7DQ

England

Tel: +44 203 124 6000

For several years, we have focused on our core retail and
    specialist broking operations. In 2008, we acquired HRH, at the
    time the eighth largest insurance and risk management
    intermediary in the United States. The acquisition almost
    doubled our North America revenues and created critical mass in
    key markets including California, Florida, Texas, Illinois, New
    York, Boston, New Jersey and Philadelphia. In addition, we have
    made a number of smaller acquisitions around the world and
    increased our ownership in several of our associates and
    existing subsidiaries, which were not wholly-owned, where doing
    so strengthened our retail network and our specialty businesses.

About
    Willis

General

We provide a broad range of insurance brokerage, reinsurance and
    risk management consulting services to our clients worldwide. We
    have significant market positions in the United States, in the
    United Kingdom and, directly and through our associates, in many
    other countries. We are a recognized leader in providing
    specialized risk management advisory and other services on a
    global basis to clients in various industries including
    aerospace, marine, construction and energy.

In our capacity as an advisor and insurance broker, we act as an
    intermediary between our clients and insurance carriers by
    advising our clients on their risk management requirements,
    helping clients determine the best means of managing risk, and
    negotiating and placing insurance risk with insurance carriers
    through our global distribution network.

We assist clients in the assessment of their risks, advise on
    the best ways of transferring suitable risk to the global
    insurance and reinsurance markets and then execute the
    transactions at the most appropriate available price, terms and
    conditions for our clients. Our global distribution network
    enables us to place the risk in the most appropriate insurance
    or reinsurance market worldwide.

We also offer clients a broad range of services to help them to
    identify and control their risks. These

services range from strategic risk consulting (including
    providing actuarial analyses), to a variety of due diligence
    services, to the provision of practical

on-site

risk
    control services (such as health and safety or property loss
    control consulting) as well as analytical and advisory services
    (such as hazard modeling and reinsurance optimization studies).
    We assist clients in planning how to manage incidents or crises
    when they occur. These services include contingency planning,
    security audits and product tampering plans. We are not an
    insurance company and therefore we do not underwrite insurable
    risks for our own account.

We and our associates serve a diverse base of clients including
    major multinational and middle-market companies in a variety of
    industries, as well as public institutions and individual
    clients. Many of our client relationships span decades. We have
    approximately 20,000 employees around the world (including
    approximately 3,000 at our associate companies) and a network in
    excess of 400 offices in some 100 countries.

We believe we are one of only a few insurance brokers in the
    world possessing the global operating presence, broad product
    expertise and extensive distribution network necessary to meet
    effectively the global risk management needs of many of our
    clients.

Business
    Strategy

Since 2008, we have launched a series of initiatives to drive
    profitable growth, including Shaping Our Future, Right Sizing
    Willis, and Funding for Growth. In 2011, we are realigning our
    business model to further grow the company and deliver the
    Willis Cause — our value proposition to clients.

The Willis Cause is our pledge that:

•

we thoroughly understand our clients’ needs and their
    industries;

•

we develop client solutions with the best markets, price and
    terms;

•

we relentlessly deliver quality client service; and

•

we get claims paid quickly.

Our
    Business

Insurance and reinsurance is a global business, and its
    participants are affected by global trends in capacity and
    pricing. Accordingly, we operate as one global business which
    ensures all clients’ interests are handled efficiently and
    comprehensively, whatever their initial point of

contact. We organize our business into three segments: North
    America and International, which together comprise our principal
    retail operations, and Global. In 2010 and 2009, approximately
    50 percent of our total revenue was generated from within
    the US, with no other country contributing in



Willis
    Group Holdings plc

excess of 20 percent. For information regarding revenues,
    operating income and total assets per

segment, see Note 26 of the Consolidated Financial
    Statements contained herein.

Global

Our Global business provides specialist brokerage and consulting
    services to clients worldwide for the risks arising from
    specific industrial and commercial activities. In these
    operations, we have extensive specialized experience handling
    diverse lines of coverage, including complex insurance programs,
    and acting as an intermediary between retail brokers and
    insurers. We increasingly provide consulting services on risk
    management with the objective of assisting clients to reduce the
    overall cost of risk. Our Global business serves clients in
    around 190 countries, primarily from offices in the United
    Kingdom, although we also serve clients from offices in the
    United States, Continental Europe and Asia.

The Global business is divided into:

•

Global Specialties;

•

Willis Re;

•

London Market Wholesale; and

skills, industry knowledge and expertise available elsewhere in

    generally include direct risk management and insurance
    brokerage, specialist and reinsurance brokerage and employee
    benefits consulting.

We believe the combined total revenues of our International
    subsidiaries and associates provide an indication of the spread
    and capability of our International network. The team generated
    over 30 percent of the Group’s total consolidated
    commissions and fees in 2010.

As part of our on-going strategy, we look for opportunities to
    strengthen our International market share through acquisitions
    and strategic investments. We have acquired a controlling
    interest in a broad geographic spread of other brokers. A list
    of significant subsidiaries is included in Exhibit 21.1 to
    this document.

We have also invested in associate companies; our significant
    associates at December 31, 2010 were GS & Cie
    Groupe (‘Gras Savoye’), France (31 percent
    holding) and Al-Futtaim Willis Co. LLC, Dubai (49 percent
    holding). In connection with many of our investments we retain
    the right to increase our ownership over time, typically to a
    majority or 100 percent ownership position. In addition, in
    certain instances our co-shareholders have a right, typically
    based on some price formula of revenues or earnings, to put some
    or all of their shares to us. On December 17, 2009 as part
    of a reorganization of the share capital of Gras Savoye our
    interest in that company reduced from 48 percent to
    31 percent. In addition, we have the option to acquire a
    100 percent interest in the capital of Gras Savoye in 2015.
    For further information on the Gras Savoye capital
    reorganization see ‘Item 8 — Financial
    Statements and Supplementary Data —
    Note 13 — Investments in Associates’.

Customers

Our clients operate on a global and local scale in a multitude
    of businesses and industries throughout the world and generally
    range in size from major multinational corporations to
    middle-market companies. Further, many of our client
    relationships span decades, for instance our relationship with
    The Tokio Marine and Fire Insurance Company Limited

dates back over 100 years. No one client accounted for more
    than 10 percent of revenues for fiscal year 2010.
    Additionally, we place insurance with over 5,000 insurance
    carriers, none of which individually accounted for more than
    10 percent of the total premiums we placed on behalf of our
    clients in 2010.

Competition

We face competition in all fields in which we operate based on
    global capability, product breadth, innovation, quality of
    service and price. According to the Directory of Agents and
    Brokers published by Business Insurance in July 2010, the 136
    largest commercial insurance brokers globally reported brokerage
    revenues totaling $38 billion in 2009, of which
    Marsh & McLennan Companies Inc. had approximately
    28 percent, Aon Corporation had approximately
    20 percent and Willis had approximately 9 percent.

We compete with Marsh & McLennan and Aon as well as
    with numerous specialist, regional and local firms.

Insurance companies also compete with brokers by directly
    soliciting insureds without the assistance of an independent
    broker or agent.

Competition for business is intense in all our business lines
    and in every insurance market. Competition on premium rates has
    also exacerbated the pressures caused by a continuing reduction
    in demand in some classes of business. For example, rather than
    purchase additional insurance through brokers, many insureds
    have been retaining a greater proportion of their risk
    portfolios than previously. Industrial and commercial companies
    are increasingly relying upon captive insurance companies,
    self-insurance pools, risk retention



Willis
    Group Holdings plc

groups, mutual insurance companies and other mechanisms for
    funding their risks, rather than buying insurance.

Additional competitive pressures arise from the entry of new
    market participants, such as banks, accounting firms and
    insurance carriers themselves, offering risk management or
    transfer services.

In 2005, we, along with Marsh & McLennan and Aon,
    agreed to implement certain business reforms which included
    codification of our voluntary termination of contingent
    commission arrangements with insurers. However, most other
    special, regional and local insurance brokers continued to
    accept contingent compensation and did not disclose the
    compensation received in connection with providing policy
    placement services to its customers. In February 2010, we
    entered into the Amended and Restated Assurance of
    Discontinuance with the Attorney General of the State of New
    York and the Amended and Restated Stipulation with the

Superintendent of Insurance of the State of New York which ended
    many of the requirements previously imposed upon us. The new
    agreement no longer limits the type of compensation we can
    receive and lowers the compensation disclosure requirements we
    must make to our clients.

We continue to refuse to accept contingent commissions from
    carriers in our retail brokerage business. To our knowledge, we
    are the only insurance broker that takes this stance. We seek to
    increase revenue through higher commissions and fees that we
    disclose to our clients, and to generate profitable revenue
    growth by focusing on the provision of value-added risk advisory
    services beyond traditional brokerage activities. Although we
    continue to believe in the success of our strategy, we cannot be
    certain that such steps will help us to continue to generate
    profitable organic revenue growth.

Regulation

Our business activities are subject to legal requirements and
    governmental and quasi-governmental regulatory supervision in
    virtually all countries in which we operate. Also, such
    regulations may require individual or company licensing to
    conduct our business activities. While these requirements may
    vary from location to location they are generally designed to
    protect our clients by establishing minimum standards of conduct
    and practice, particularly regarding the provision of advice and
    product information as well as financial criteria.

United
    States

Our activities in connection with insurance brokerage services
    within the United States are subject to regulation and
    supervision by state authorities. Although the scope of
    regulation and form of supervision may vary from jurisdiction to
    jurisdiction, insurance laws in the United States are often
    complex and generally grant broad discretion to supervisory
    authorities in adopting regulations and supervising regulated
    activities. That supervision generally includes the licensing of
    insurance brokers and agents and the regulation of the handling
    and investment of client funds held in

a fiduciary capacity. Our continuing ability to provide
    insurance brokerage in the jurisdictions in which we currently
    operate is dependent upon our compliance with the rules and
    regulations promulgated from time to time by the regulatory
    authorities in each of these jurisdictions.

European
    Union

The European Union Insurance Mediation Directive introduced
    rules to enable insurance and reinsurance intermediaries to
    operate and provide services within each member state of the EU
    on a basis consistent with the EU single market and customer
    protection aims. Each EU member state in which we operate is
    required to ensure that the insurance and reinsurance
    intermediaries resident in their country are registered with a
    statutory body in that country and that each intermediary meets
    professional requirements in relation to their competence, good
    repute, professional indemnity cover and financial capacity.



About
    Willis

United
    Kingdom

In the United Kingdom, the statutory body is the Financial
    Services Authority (‘FSA’). The FSA has prescribed the
    methods by which our insurance and reinsurance operations are to
    conduct business, and has a wide range of rule-making,
    investigatory and enforcement powers aimed at meeting its
    overall aim of promoting efficient, orderly and fair markets and
    helping retail consumers achieve a fair deal. The FSA conducts
    monitoring visits to assess our compliance with regulatory
    requirements.

Certain of our activities are governed by other regulatory
    bodies, such as investment and securities licensing authorities.
    In the United States, Willis Capital Markets &
    Advisory operates through our wholly-owned subsidiary Willis
    Securities, Inc., a US-registered broker-dealer and investment
    advisor, member FINRA/SIPC, primarily in connection with
    investment banking-related services and advising on alternative
    risk financing transactions. Willis Capital Markets provides
    advice on securities or investments

in the EU through our wholly-owned subsidiary Willis Structured
    Financial Solutions Limited, which is authorized and regulated
    by the FSA.

Our failure, or that of our employees, to satisfy the regulators
    that we are in compliance with their requirements or the legal
    requirements governing our activities, can result in
    disciplinary action, fines, reputational damage and financial
    harm.

All companies carrying on similar activities in a given
    jurisdiction are subject to regulations which are not dissimilar
    to the requirements for our operations in the United States and
    United Kingdom. We do not consider that these regulatory
    requirements adversely affect our competitive position.

See Part I,

Item 1A-Risk

Factors ‘Legal and Regulatory Risks’ for discussion of
    how actions by regulatory authorities or changes in legislation
    and regulation in the jurisdictions in which we operate may have
    an adverse effect on our business.

Employees

As of December 31, 2010 we had approximately
    17,000 employees worldwide of whom approximately 3,400 were
    employed in the United Kingdom and 6,500 in the United States,
    with the balance being

employed across the rest of the world. In addition, our
    associates had approximately 3,000 employees, all of whom
    were located outside the United Kingdom and the United States.

Item 1A —
    Risk Factors

Risks Relating to
    our Business and the Insurance Industry

This section describes material risks affecting the Group’s
    business. These risks could materially affect the Group’s
    business, its revenues, operating income, net income, net
    assets, liquidity and capital

resources and ability to achieve its financial targets and,
    accordingly should be read in conjunction with any
    forward-looking statements in this Annual Report on

Form 10-K.

Competitive
    Risks

Worldwide
    economic conditions could have an adverse effect on our
    business.

Our business and operating results are materially affected by
    worldwide economic conditions. Current global economic
    conditions coupled with declining customer and business
    confidence, increasing energy prices, and other challenges, may
    have a significant negative impact on the buying behavior of
    some of our clients as their businesses suffer from these
    conditions. In particular, financial institutions, construction,
    aviation, and logistics businesses such as marine cargo are most
    likely to be affected. Further, the global economic downturn is
    also negatively affecting some of the international economies
    that have supported the strong growth in our International
    operations. Our employee benefits practice may also be adversely
    affected as businesses continue to downsize during this period
    of economic turmoil. In addition, a growing number of
    insolvencies associated with an economic downturn, especially
    insolvencies in the insurance industry, could adversely affect
    our brokerage business through the loss of clients or by
    hampering our ability to place insurance and reinsurance
    business. While it is difficult to predict consequences of any
    further deterioration in global economic conditions on our
    business, any significant reduction or delay by our clients in
    purchasing insurance or making payment of premiums could have a
    material adverse impact on our financial condition and results
    of operations.

The potential for a significant insurer to fail or withdraw from
    writing certain lines of insurance coverages that we offer our
    clients could negatively impact overall capacity in the
    industry, which could then reduce the placement of certain lines
    and types of insurance and reduce our revenues and
    profitability. The potential for an insurer to fail could also
    result in errors and omissions claims by clients.

Since 2008, we have launched certain initiatives, such as the
    Company’s recently announced 2011 review of operations, the
    Willis Cause, Right Sizing Willis, Funding for Growth, and
    Shaping Our Future, to achieve cost-savings or fund our future
    growth plans. In light of the global economic uncertainty, we
    continue to vigorously manage our cost base in order to fund
    further growth initiatives, but we cannot be certain whether we
    will be able to realize any further benefits from these
    initiatives or any new initiatives that we may implement.

While we focus on our core retail and specialist broking
    operations, we do have certain other businesses that are not
    material to the Group as a whole but which, in any period, could
    have a material affect on our results of operations.

We do not control
    the premiums on which our commissions are based, and volatility
    or declines in premiums may seriously undermine our
    profitability.

We derive most of our revenues from commissions and fees for
    brokerage and consulting services. We

do not determine insurance premiums on which our commissions are
    generally based. Premiums are



Risk
    factors

cyclical in nature and may vary widely based on market
    conditions. From the late 1980s through late 2000, insurance
    premium rates generally declined as a result of a number of
    factors, including the expanded underwriting capacity of
    insurance carriers; consolidation of both insurance
    intermediaries and insurance carriers; and increased competition
    among insurance carriers. From 2000 to 2003, we benefitted from
    a ‘hard’ market with premium rates stable or
    increasing. During 2004, we saw a rapid transition from a hard
    market, with premium rates stable or increasing, to a
    ‘soft’ market, with premium rates falling in most
    markets. The soft market continued to have an adverse impact on
    our commission revenues and operating margin from 2005 through
    2008. Rates continued to decline in most sectors through 2005
    and 2006, with the exception of catastrophe-exposed markets. In
    2007, the market softened further with decreases in many of the
    market sectors in which we operated and this continued into 2008
    with further premium rate declines across our market sectors. In
    2009, the stabilization of rates in the reinsurance market and
    some specialty markets was offset by the continuing

soft market in other sectors and the adverse impact of the
    weakened economic environment across the globe. Our North
    America and UK and Irish retail operations have been
    particularly impacted by the weakened economic climate and
    continued soft market throughout both 2009 and 2010 with no
    material improvement in rates across most sectors. This resulted
    in declines in 2009 revenues in these operations with only
    modest improvement in 2010, particularly amongst our smaller
    clients who have been especially vulnerable to the economic
    downturn.

In addition, as traditional risk-bearing insurance carriers
    continue to outsource the production of premium revenue to
    non-affiliated agents or brokers such as ourselves, those
    insurance carriers may seek to reduce further their expenses by
    reducing the commission rates payable to those insurance agents
    or brokers. The reduction of these commission rates, along with
    general volatility

and/or

declines in premiums, may significantly undermine our
    profitability.

Competition in
    our industry is intense, and if we are unable to compete
    effectively, we may suffer lower revenue, reduced operating
    margins and lose market share which could materially and
    adversely affect our business.

We face competition in all fields in which we operate, based on
    global capability, product breadth, innovation, quality of
    service and price. We compete with Marsh & McLennan
    and Aon, the two other providers of global risk management
    services, as well as with numerous specialist, regional and
    local firms. Competition for business is intense in all our
    business lines and in every insurance market, and the other two
    providers of global risk management services have substantially
    greater market share than we do. Competition on premium rates
    has also exacerbated the pressures caused by a continuing
    reduction in demand in some classes of business. For example,
    rather than purchase additional insurance through brokers, many
    insureds have been retaining a greater proportion of their risk
    portfolios than previously. Industrial and commercial companies
    have been increasingly relying upon their own subsidiary
    insurance companies, known as captive insurance companies,

self-insurance pools, risk retention groups, mutual insurance
    companies and other mechanisms for funding their risks, rather
    than buying insurance. Additional competitive pressures arise
    from the entry of new market participants, such as banks,
    accounting firms and insurance carriers themselves, offering
    risk management or transfer services.

In 2005, we, along with Marsh & McLennan and Aon,
    agreed to implement certain business reforms which included
    codification of our voluntary termination of contingent
    commission arrangements with insurers. However, most other
    special, regional and local insurance brokers continued to
    accept contingent compensation and did not disclose the
    compensation received in connection with providing policy
    placement services to its customers. In February 2010, we
    entered into the Amended and Restated Assurance of
    Discontinuance with the Attorney General of the State of New
    York and the



Willis
    Group Holdings plc

Amended and Restated Stipulation with the Superintendent of
    Insurance of the State of New York which ended many of the
    requirements previously imposed upon us. The new agreement no
    longer limits the type of compensation we will receive and
    lowers the compensation disclosure requirements we must make to
    our clients.

We continue to refuse to accept contingent commissions from
    carriers in our retail brokerage business. To our knowledge, we
    are the only insurance broker that takes this stance. We seek to
    increase revenue through higher commissions and fees that we
    disclose to our clients, and to generate

profitable revenue growth by focusing on the provision of
    value-added risk advisory services beyond traditional brokerage
    activities. Although we continue to believe in the success of
    our strategy, we cannot be certain that such steps will help us
    to continue to generate profitable organic revenue growth. If we
    are unable to compete effectively against our competitors who
    are accepting or may accept contingent commissions, we may
    suffer lower revenue, reduced operating margins and loss of
    market share which could materially and adversely affect our
    business.

Dependence on Key
    Personnel — The loss of our Chairman and Chief
    Executive Officer or a number of our senior management or a
    significant number of our brokers could significantly impede our
    financial plans, growth, marketing and other
    objectives.

The loss of our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer or a number
    of our senior management or a significant number of our brokers
    could significantly impede our financial plans, growth,
    marketing and other objectives. Our success depends to a
    substantial extent not only on the ability and experience of our
    Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Joseph J. Plumeri and
    other members of our senior management, but also on the
    individual brokers and teams that service our clients and
    maintain client relationships. The insurance and

reinsurance brokerage industry has in the past experienced
    intense competition for the services of leading individual
    brokers and brokerage teams, and we have lost key individuals
    and teams to competitors. We believe that our future success
    will depend in part on our ability to attract and retain
    additional highly skilled and qualified personnel and to expand,
    train and manage our employee base. We may not continue to be
    successful in doing so because the competition for qualified
    personnel in our industry is intense.

Legal and
    Regulatory Risks

Our compliance
    systems and controls cannot guarantee that we are in compliance
    with all applicable federal and state or foreign laws and
    regulations, and actions by regulatory authorities or changes in
    applicable laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we
    operate may have an adverse effect on our business.

Our activities are subject to extensive regulation under the
    laws of the United States, the United Kingdom and the European
    Union and its member states, and the other jurisdictions in
    which we operate. Indeed, over the last few years, there has
    been a general increase in focus and developments in these laws
    and regulations. Compliance with laws

and regulations that are applicable to our operations is complex
    and may increase our cost of doing business. These laws and
    regulations include insurance industry regulations, economic and
    trade sanctions and laws against financial crimes such as money
    laundering, bribery or other corruption, such as the
    U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. In most



Risk
    factors

jurisdictions, governmental and regulatory authorities have the
    ability to interpret and amend these laws and regulations and
    impose penalties for non-compliance, including sanctions, civil
    remedies, fines, injunctions, revocation of licenses or
    approvals, suspension of individuals, limitations on business
    activities or redress to clients.

Given the increased interest expressed by UK and US regulators
    in the effectiveness of compliance controls relating to
    financial crime in our market sector in particular, we began a
    voluntary internal review of our policies and controls four
    years ago. This review includes analysis and advice from
    external experts on best practices, review of public regulatory
    decisions, and discussions with government regulators in the UK
    and US. In

addition, the U.K. Financial Services Authority is conducting an
    investigation of some of our compliance systems and controls
    between 2005 and 2009. While we are fully cooperating with our
    regulators, we are unable to predict at this time when these
    matters will be concluded. We do not believe that such matters
    will result in any material fines or sanctions from UK or US
    regulators, but there can be no assurance that any resolution
    will not have an adverse impact on our ability to conduct our
    business in certain jurisdictions. While we believe that our
    current systems and controls are adequate and in accordance with
    all applicable laws and regulations, we cannot assure that such
    systems and controls will prevent any violations of applicable
    laws and regulations.

Our business,
    results of operations, financial condition or liquidity may be
    materially adversely affected by actual and potential claims,
    lawsuits, investigations and proceedings.

We are subject to various actual and potential claims, lawsuits,
    investigations and other proceedings relating principally to
    alleged errors and omissions in connection with the placement of
    insurance and reinsurance in the ordinary course of business.
    Because we often assist our clients with matters, including the
    placement of insurance coverage and the handling of related
    claims, involving substantial amounts of money, errors and
    omissions claims against us may arise which allege our potential
    liability for all or part of the amounts in question.

Claimants can seek large damage awards and these claims can
    involve potentially significant defense costs. Such claims,
    lawsuits and other proceedings could, for example, include
    allegations of damages for our employees or

sub-agents

improperly failing to place coverage or notify claims on behalf
    of clients, to provide insurance carriers with complete and
    accurate information relating to the risks being insured or to
    appropriately apply funds that we hold for our clients on a
    fiduciary basis. Errors and omissions claims, lawsuits and other
    proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business are
    covered in part by professional indemnity or other appropriate
    insurance. The terms of this insurance vary by policy year and
    self-insured risks have increased significantly in recent years.
    In respect of

self-insured risks, we have established provisions against these
    items which we believe to be adequate in the light of current
    information and legal advice, and we adjust such provisions from
    time to time according to developments. Our business, results of
    operations, financial condition and liquidity may be adversely
    affected if in the future our insurance coverage proves to be
    inadequate or unavailable or there is an increase in liabilities
    for which we self-insure. Our ability to obtain professional
    indemnity insurance in the amounts and with the deductibles we
    desire in the future may be adversely impacted by general
    developments in the market for such insurance or our own claims
    experience.

We are also subject to actual and potential claims, lawsuits,
    investigations and proceedings outside of errors and omissions
    claims. The material actual or potential claims, lawsuits and
    proceedings to which we are currently subject, including but not
    limited to errors and omissions claims, are: (1) potential
    claims arising out of various legal proceedings between
    reinsurers, reinsureds and their reinsurance brokers relating to
    personal accident excess of loss reinsurance placements for the
    years 1993 to 1998; and (2) claims relating to the collapse
    of The Stanford Financial Group, for which we acted as brokers
    of record on certain lines of insurance.



Willis
    Group Holdings plc

The ultimate outcome of these matters cannot be ascertained and
    liabilities in indeterminate amounts may be imposed on us. It is
    thus possible that future results of operations or cash flows
    for any particular quarterly or annual period could be
    materially affected by an unfavorable resolution of these
    matters. In addition, these matters continue to divert
    management and personnel resources away from

operating our business. Even if we do not experience significant
    monetary costs, there may also be adverse publicity associated
    with these matters that could result in reputational harm to the
    insurance brokerage industry in general or to us in particular
    that may adversely affect our business, client or employee
    relationships.

Interruption to
    or loss of our information processing capabilities or failure to
    effectively maintain and upgrade our information processing
    systems could cause material financial loss, loss of human
    resources, regulatory actions, reputational harm or legal
    liability.

Our business depends significantly on effective information
    systems. Our capacity to service our clients relies on effective
    storage, retrieval, processing and management of information.
    Our information systems also rely on the commitment of
    significant resources to maintain and enhance existing systems
    and to develop new systems in order to keep pace with continuing
    changes in information processing technology or evolving
    industry and regulatory standards. The acquisition of HRH and
    additional information systems has added

to this exposure. If the information we rely on to run our
    business were found to be inaccurate or unreliable or if we fail
    to maintain effective and efficient systems (including through a
    telecommunications failure, failure to replace or update
    redundant or obsolete computer applications or software systems
    or if we experience other disruptions), this could result in
    material financial loss, regulatory action, reputational harm or
    legal liability.

Our inability to
    successfully recover should we experience a disaster or other
    significant disruption to business continuity could have a
    material adverse effect on our operations.

Our ability to conduct business may be adversely affected, even
    in the short-term, by a disruption in the infrastructure that
    supports our business and the communities where we are located.
    This may include a disruption caused by restricted physical site
    access, terrorist activities, disease pandemics, or outages to
    electrical, communications or other services used by our
    company, our employees or third parties with whom we conduct
    business. Although we have certain disaster recovery procedures
    in place and insurance to protect against

such contingencies, such procedures may not be effective and any
    insurance or recovery procedures may not continue to be
    available at reasonable prices and may not address all such
    losses or compensate us for the possible loss of clients
    occurring during any period that we are unable to provide
    services. Our inability to successfully recover should we
    experience a disaster or other significant disruption to
    business continuity could have a material adverse effect on our
    operations.

Improper
    disclosure of personal data could result in legal liability or
    harm our reputation.

One of our significant responsibilities is to maintain the
    security and privacy of our clients’ confidential

and proprietary information and the personal data of their
    employees. We maintain policies, procedures



Risk
    factors

and technological safeguards designed to protect the security
    and privacy of this information in our database. However, we
    cannot entirely eliminate the risk of improper access to or
    disclosure of personally identifiable information. Our
    technology may fail to adequately secure the private information
    we maintain in our databases and protect it from theft or
    inadvertent loss. In such circumstances, we may be held liable
    to our clients, which could result in legal liability or
    impairment to

our reputation resulting in increased costs or loss of revenue.
    Further database privacy, identity theft, and related computer
    and internet issues are matters of growing public concern and
    are subject to frequently changing rules and regulations. Our
    failure to adhere to or successfully implement processes in
    response to changing regulatory requirements in this area could
    result in legal liability or impairment to our reputation in the
    marketplace.

Financial
    Risks

Our outstanding
    debt could adversely affect our cash flows and financial
    flexibility.

As of December 31, 2010, we had total consolidated debt
    outstanding of approximately $2.3 billion and interest
    expense was $166 million. Although management believes that
    our cash flows will be more than adequate to service this debt,
    there may be circumstances in which required payments of
    principal

and/or

interest on this debt could adversely affect our cash flows and
    this level of indebtedness may:

•

require us to dedicate a significant portion of our cash flow
    from operations to payments on our debt, thereby reducing the
    availability of cash flow to fund capital expenditures, to
    pursue other acquisitions or investments in new technologies, to
    pay dividends and for general corporate purposes;

•

increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic
    conditions, including if we borrow at variable interest rates,
    which makes us vulnerable to increases in interest rates
    generally;

•

limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes
    or challenges relating to our business and industry; and

•

put us at a competitive disadvantage against competitors who
    have less indebtedness or are in a more favorable position to
    access additional capital resources.

The terms of our current financings also include certain
    limitations. For example, the agreements relating to the debt
    arrangements and credit facilities contain numerous operating
    and financial covenants, including requirements to maintain
    minimum ratios of consolidated adjusted EBITDA to consolidated
    fixed charges and maximum levels of consolidated funded
    indebtedness in relation to consolidated EBITDA, in each case
    subject to certain adjustments.

A failure to comply with the restrictions under our credit
    facilities and outstanding notes could result in a default under
    the financing obligations or could require us to obtain waivers
    from our lenders for failure to comply with these restrictions.
    The occurrence of a default that remains uncured or the
    inability to secure a necessary consent or waiver could cause
    our obligations with respect to our debt to be accelerated and
    have a material adverse effect on our business, financial
    condition or results of operations.

Our pension
    liabilities may increase which could require us to make
    additional cash contributions to our pension plans.

We have two principal defined benefit plans: one in the United
    Kingdom and the other in the United States. Cash contributions
    of approximately $119 million will be required in 2011 for these
    pension plans, although we may elect to contribute more. Total
    cash contributions to these defined benefit

pension plans in 2010 were $118 million. Future estimates are
    based on certain assumptions, including discount rates, interest
    rates, fair value of assets and expected return on plan assets.
    In the UK, we are required to agree a funding strategy for our
    UK defined benefit plan with the plan’s trustees.



Willis
    Group Holdings plc

In February 2009, we agreed to make full year contributions to
    the UK plan of $39 million for 2009 through 2012, excluding
    amounts in respect of the salary sacrifice scheme. In addition,
    if certain funding targets were not met at the beginning of any
    of the following years, 2010 through 2012, a further
    contribution of $39 million would be required for that year. In
    2010, the additional funding requirement was triggered and we
    expect to make a similar additional contribution in 2011.  A
    similar, additional contribution may also be required for 2012,
    depending on actual performance against funding targets at the
    beginning of 2012. We have taken actions to manage our pension
    liabilities, including closing our UK and US plans to new
    participants and restricting final pensionable salaries. Future
    benefit accruals in the US pension plan were also stopped, or
    frozen, on May 15, 2009.

The determinations of pension expense and pension funding are
    based on a variety of rules and regulations. Changes in these
    rules and regulations could impact the calculation of pension
    plan liabilities and the valuation of pension plan assets. They
    may also result in higher pension costs, additional financial
    statement disclosure, and accelerate and increase the need to
    fully fund our pension plans. Our future required cash
    contributions to our US and UK defined benefit pension plans may
    increase based on the funding reform provisions that were
    enacted into law. Further, a significant decline in the value of
    investments that fund our pension plan, if not offset

or mitigated by a decline in our liabilities, may significantly
    differ from or alter the values and actuarial assumptions used
    to calculate our future pension expense and we could be required
    to fund our plan with significant amounts of cash. In addition,
    if the US Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation requires
    additional contributions to such plans or if other actuarial
    assumptions are modified, our future required cash contributions
    could increase. The need to make these cash contributions may
    reduce the cash available to meet our other obligations,
    including the payment obligations under our credit facilities
    and other long-term debt, or to meet the needs of our business.

In addition to the critical assumptions described above, our
    plans use certain assumptions about the life expectancy of plan
    participants and surviving spouses. Periodic revision of those
    assumptions can materially change the present value of future
    benefits and therefore the funded status of the plans and the
    resulting periodic pension expense. Changes in our pension
    benefit obligations and the related net periodic costs or
    credits may occur in the future due to any variance of actual
    results from our assumptions and changes in the number of
    participating employees. As a result, there can be no assurance
    that we will not experience future decreases in stockholders
    equity, net income, cash flow and liquidity or that we will not
    be required to make additional cash contributions in the future
    beyond those which have been estimated.

We could incur
    substantial losses if one of the financial institutions we use
    in our operations failed.

The deterioration of the global credit and financial markets has
    created challenging conditions for financial institutions,
    including depositories. As the fallout from the credit crisis
    persists, the financial strength of these institutions may
    continue to decline. We maintain cash balances at various US
    depository institutions that are significantly in excess of the
    US Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation insurance

limits. We also maintain cash balances in foreign financial
    institutions. If one or more of the institutions in which we
    maintain significant cash balances were to fail, our ability to
    access these funds might be temporarily or permanently limited,
    and we could face a material liquidity problem and potentially
    material financial losses.



Risk
    factors

A downgrade in
    the credit ratings of our outstanding debt may adversely affect
    our borrowing costs and financial flexibility.

A downgrade in our corporate credit rating or the credit ratings
    of our debt would increase our borrowing costs including those
    under our credit facilities, and reduce our financial
    flexibility. In addition, certain downgrades would trigger a

step-up

in
    interest rates under the indentures for our

6.2% senior notes due 2017 and our 7.0% senior notes
    due 2019

,

which would increase our interest expense. If
    we need to raise capital in the future, any credit rating
    downgrade could negatively affect our financing costs or access
    to financing sources.

We face certain
    risks associated with the acquisition or disposition of business
    or reorganization of existing investments.

In pursuing our corporate strategy, we may acquire or dispose of
    or exit businesses or reorganize existing investments. The
    success of this strategy is dependent upon our ability to
    identify appropriate opportunities, negotiate transactions on
    favorable terms and ultimately complete such transactions. Once
    we complete acquisitions or reorganizations there can be no
    assurance that we will realize the anticipated benefits of any
    transaction, including revenue growth, operational efficiencies
    or expected synergies. For example, if we fail to recognize some
    or all of the strategic benefits and synergies

expected from a transaction, goodwill and intangible assets may
    be impaired in future periods. In addition, we may not be able
    to integrate acquisitions successfully into our existing
    business, and we could incur or assume unknown or unanticipated
    liabilities or contingencies, which may impact our results of
    operations. If we dispose of or otherwise exit certain
    businesses, there can be no assurance that we will not incur
    certain disposition related charges, or that we will be able to
    reduce overheads related to the divested assets.

We are a holding
    company and, therefore, may not be able to receive dividends or
    other distributions in needed amounts from our
    subsidiaries.

Willis Group Holdings is organized as a holding company that
    conducts no business of its own. We are dependent upon dividends
    and other payments from our operating subsidiaries to meet our
    obligations for paying principal and interest on outstanding
    debt obligations, for paying dividends to shareholders and for
    corporate expenses. Legal and regulatory restrictions, foreign
    exchange controls, as

well as operating requirements of our subsidiaries, may limit
    our ability to obtain cash from these subsidiaries. In the event
    our operating subsidiaries are unable to pay dividends and make
    other payments to Willis Group Holdings, we may not be able to
    service debt, pay obligations or pay dividends on ordinary
    shares.

International
    Risks

Our significant
    non-US operations, particularly our London market operations,
    expose us to exchange rate fluctuations and various risks that
    could impact our business.

A significant portion of our operations is conducted outside the
    United States. Accordingly, we are subject to legal, economic
    and market risks

associated with operating in foreign countries, including
    devaluations and fluctuations in currency exchange rates;
    imposition of limitations on



Willis
    Group Holdings plc

conversion of foreign currencies into pounds sterling or dollars
    or remittance of dividends and other payments by foreign
    subsidiaries; hyperinflation in certain foreign countries;
    imposition or increase of investment and other restrictions by
    foreign governments; and the requirement of complying with a
    wide variety of foreign laws.

We report our operating results and financial condition in US
    dollars. Our US operations earn revenue and incur expenses
    primarily in US dollars. In our London market operations,
    however, we earn revenue in a number of different currencies,
    but expenses are almost entirely incurred in pounds sterling.
    Outside the United States and our London market operations, we
    predominantly generate revenue and expenses in the local
    currency. The table gives an approximate analysis of revenues
    and expenses by currency in 2010.

Because of devaluations and fluctuations in currency exchange
    rates or the imposition of limitations on conversion of foreign
    currencies into US dollars, we are subject to currency
    translation exposure on the

profits of our operations, in addition to economic exposure.
    Furthermore, the mismatch between pounds sterling revenues and
    expenses, together with any net sterling balance sheet position
    we hold in our US dollar denominated London market operations,
    creates an exchange exposure.

For example, as the pound sterling strengthens, the US dollars
    required to be translated into pounds sterling to cover the net
    sterling expenses increase, which then causes our results to be
    negatively impacted. Our results may also be adversely impacted
    if we are holding a net sterling position in our US dollar
    denominated London market operations: if the pound sterling
    weakens any net sterling asset we are holding will be less
    valuable when translated into US dollars. Given these facts, the
    strength of the pound sterling relative to the US dollar has in
    the past had a material negative impact on our reported results.
    This risk could have a material adverse effect on our business
    financial condition, cash flow and results of operations in the
    future.

Where possible, we hedge part of our operating exposure to
    exchange rate movements, but such mitigating attempts may not be
    successful.

In conducting our
    businesses around the world, we are subject to political,
    economic, legal, market, nationalization, operational and other
    risks that are inherent in operating in many
    countries.

In conducting our businesses and maintaining and supporting our
    global operations, we are subject to political, economic, legal,
    market, nationalization, operational and other risks. Our
    businesses and operations are increasingly expanding into new
    regions throughout the world, including emerging markets, and we
    expect this trend to continue. The possible effects of economic
    and financial disruptions throughout the world could have an
    adverse impact on our businesses. These risks include:

•

the general economic and political conditions in foreign
    countries, for example, the recent devaluation of the Venezuelan
    Bolivar;

•

the imposition of controls or limitations on the conversion of
    foreign currencies or remittance of

dividends and other payments by foreign subsidiaries;

•

imposition of withholding and other taxes on remittances and
    other payments from subsidiaries;

•

imposition or increase of investment and other restrictions by
    foreign governments;

•

difficulties in controlling operations and monitoring employees
    in geographically dispersed locations; and

•

the potential costs and difficulties in complying, or monitoring
    compliance, with a wide variety of foreign laws (some of which
    may conflict with US or other sources of law), laws and
    regulations applicable to US business operations abroad,
    including rules relating to trade sanctions



Risk
    factors

administered by the US Office of Foreign Assets Control, the EU,
    the UK and the UN, and the requirements of the US Foreign
    Corrupt Practices

Act as well as other anti-bribery and corruption rules and
    requirements in the countries in which we operate.

Legislative and
    regulatory action could materially and adversely affect us and
    our effective tax rate may increase.

There is uncertainty regarding the tax policies of the
    jurisdictions where we operate (which include the potential
    legislative actions described below), and our effective tax rate
    may increase and any such increase may be material.
    Additionally, the tax laws of Ireland and other jurisdictions
    could change in the future, and such changes could cause a
    material change in our effective tax rate. For example,
    legislative action may be taken by the US Congress which, if
    ultimately enacted, could override tax treaties upon which we
    rely or could broaden the circumstances under which we would be
    considered

a US resident, each of which could materially and adversely
    affect our effective tax rate and cash tax position. We cannot
    predict the outcome of any specific legislative proposals.
    However, if proposals were enacted that had the effect of
    limiting our ability to take advantage of tax treaties between
    Ireland and other jurisdictions (including the US), we could be
    subjected to increased taxation. In addition, any future
    amendments to the current income tax treaties between Ireland
    and other jurisdictions could subject us to increased taxation.

Irish law differs
    from the laws in effect in the United States and may afford less
    protection to holders of our securities.

It may not be possible to enforce court judgments obtained in
    the United States against us in Ireland based on the civil
    liability provisions of the US federal or state securities laws.
    In addition, there is some uncertainty as to whether the courts
    of Ireland would recognize or enforce judgments of US courts
    obtained against us or our directors or officers based on the
    civil liabilities provisions of the US federal or state
    securities laws or hear actions against us or those persons
    based on those laws. We have been advised that the United States
    currently does not have a treaty with Ireland providing for the
    reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and
    commercial matters. Therefore, a final judgment for the payment
    of money rendered by any US federal or state court based on
    civil liability, whether or not based solely on US federal or
    state securities laws, would not be directly enforceable in
    Ireland. While not directly enforceable, it is possible for a
    final judgment for the payment of money rendered by any US
    federal or state court based on civil liability to be enforced
    in Ireland through common law rules. However, this

process is subject to numerous established principles and would
    involve the commencement of a new set of proceedings in Ireland
    to enforce the judgment.

As an Irish company, Willis Group Holdings is governed by the
    Irish Companies Acts, which differ in some material respects
    from laws generally applicable to US corporations and
    shareholders, including, among others, differences relating to
    interested director and officer transactions and shareholder
    lawsuits. Likewise, the duties of directors and officers of an
    Irish company generally are owed to the company only.
    Shareholders of Irish companies generally do not have a personal
    right of action against directors or officers of the company and
    may exercise such rights of action on behalf of the Company only
    in limited circumstances. Accordingly, holders of Willis Group
    Holdings securities may have more difficulty protecting their
    interests than would holders of securities of a corporation
    incorporated in a jurisdiction of the United States.

There are no governmental laws, decrees or regulations in
    Ireland which will restrict the remittance of dividends or other
    payments to

non-resident

holders of the Company’s shares.

In circumstances where one of Ireland’s many exemptions
    from dividend withholding tax (‘DWT’) does not apply,
    dividends paid by the Company will be subject to Irish DWT
    (currently 20 percent). Residents of the US should be
    exempted from Irish

DWT provided relevant documentation supporting the exemption has
    been put in place. While the US-Ireland Double Tax Treaty
    contains provisions reducing the rate of Irish DWT in prescribed
    circumstances, it should generally be unnecessary for US
    residents to rely on the provisions of this treaty due to the
    wide scope of exemptions from DWT available under Irish domestic
    law. Irish income tax may also arise in respect of dividends
    paid by the Company. However, US residents entitled to an
    exemption from Irish DWT generally have no Irish income tax
    liability on dividends. An exception to this position applies
    where a shareholder holds shares in the Company through a branch
    or agency in Ireland through which a trade is carried on.

With respect to non-corporate US shareholders, certain dividends
    received before January 1, 2011 from a qualified foreign
    corporation may be subject to reduced rates of taxation. A
    foreign corporation is treated as a qualified foreign
    corporation with respect to dividends received from that
    corporation on shares that are readily tradable on an
    established securities market in the United States, such as our
    shares. Non-corporate US shareholders that do not



Willis
    Group Holdings plc

meet a minimum holding period requirement for our shares during
    which they are not protected from the risk of loss or that elect
    to treat the dividend income as ‘investment income’
    pursuant to section 163(d)(4) of the Code will not be
    eligible for the reduced rates of taxation regardless of our
    status as a qualified foreign corporation. In addition, the rate
    reduction will not apply to dividends if the

recipient of a dividend is obligated to make related payments
    with respect to positions in substantially similar or related
    property. This disallowance applies even if the minimum holding
    period has been met. US shareholders should consult their own
    tax advisors regarding the application of these rules given
    their particular circumstances.

Purchases of
    Equity Securities by the Issuer And Affiliated
    Purchasers

Under a share buyback program approved by the Board of
    Directors, the Company may purchase up to one billion shares,
    from time to time in the open market. The authorization to make
    purchases of Company shares on the open market will expire on
    June 30, 2011 unless varied, revoked or renewed by a
    resolution of the shareholders in accordance with Irish law. The
    Company may also purchase shares through negotiated trades with
    persons who are not affiliates of the Company. These negotiated
    trade purchases are effected by way of share redemption and do
    not require Shareholder approval. The authorization in

respect of open market purchases provides that the cost of the
    acquisition of the Company’s shares (whether by redemption
    or on the open market) may not exceed $925 million. During
    the year ended December 31, 2010, there were no shares
    repurchased.

    and, after deducting its commissions, remits the premiums to the
    respective insurers; the Company also collects claims or refunds
    from insurers on behalf of insureds. Effective December 31,
    2010, uncollected premiums from insureds and uncollected claims
    or refunds from insurers, previously held within accounts
    receivable, are recorded as fiduciary assets on the
    Company’s consolidated balance sheets. Unremitted insurance
    premiums and claims (‘fiduciary funds’) are also
    recorded within fiduciary assets. Fiduciary funds represent

Item 7 —
    Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition
    and Results of Operations

This discussion includes references to non-GAAP financial
    measures as defined in Regulation G of the rules of the
    Securities and Exchange Commission (‘SEC’). We present
    such non-GAAP financial measures, as we believe such information
    is of interest to the investment community because it provides
    additional meaningful methods of evaluating certain aspects of
    the Company’s operating performance from period to period
    on a basis that may not be otherwise apparent on a GAAP basis.
    Organic revenue growth and organic growth in commissions and
    fees exclude the impact of acquisitions and disposals, year over
    year movements in foreign currency translation, legacy
    contingent commissions assumed as part of the HRH acquisition,
    and investment and other income from reported revenues. We
    believe organic revenue growth and organic growth in commissions
    and fees provide measures that the investment community may find
    helpful in assessing the performance of

operations that were part of our operations in both the
    current and prior periods, and provide measures against which
    our businesses may be assessed in the future. These financial
    measures should be viewed in addition to, not in lieu of, the
    consolidated financial statements for the year ended
    December 31, 2010.

BUSINESS OVERVIEW
    AND MARKET OUTLOOK

We provide a broad range of insurance broking, risk management
    and consulting services to our clients worldwide. Our core
    specialty businesses include Aerospace; Energy; Marine;
    Construction; Financial and Executive Risks; Fine Art, Jewelry
    and Specie; Special Contingency Risks; and Reinsurance. Our
    retail operations provide services to small, medium and major
    corporations and the employee benefits practice, our largest
    product-based practice group, provides health, welfare and human
    resources consulting and brokerage services.

In our capacity as advisor and insurance broker, we act as an
    intermediary between our clients and insurance carriers by
    advising our clients on their risk management requirements,
    helping clients determine the best means of managing risk, and
    negotiating and placing insurance risk with insurance carriers
    through our global distribution network.

We derive most of our revenues from commissions and fees for
    brokerage and consulting services and do not determine the
    insurance premiums on which our commissions are generally based.
    Fluctuations in these premiums charged by the insurance carriers

have a direct and potentially material impact on our results of
    operations. Commission levels generally follow the same trend as
    premium levels as they are derived from a percentage of the
    premiums paid by the insureds. Due to the cyclical nature of the
    insurance market and the impact of other market conditions on
    insurance premiums, they may vary widely between accounting
    periods. Reductions in premium rates, leading to downward
    pressure on commission revenues (a ‘soft’ market), can
    have a potentially material adverse impact on our commission
    revenues and operating margin.

A ‘hard’ market occurs when premium uplifting factors,
    including a greater than anticipated loss experience or capital
    shortages, more than offset any downward pressures on premiums.
    This usually has a favorable impact on our commission revenues
    and operating margin.

From 2000 through 2003 we benefited from a hard market with
    premium rates stable or increasing. During 2004, we saw a rapid
    transition from a hard market to a soft market, with premium
    rates falling in most markets. Rates continued to decline in
    most sectors through 2005 and 2006, with the exception



Willis
    Group Holdings plc

of catastrophe-exposed markets. In 2007, the market softened
    further with decreases in many of the market sectors in which we
    operated and this continued into 2008 with further premium rate
    declines across our markets. The soft market had an adverse
    impact on our commission revenues and operating margin from 2005
    through 2008.

In 2009, modest stabilization of rates in the reinsurance market
    and some specialty markets was offset by the continuing soft
    market in other sectors and the adverse impact of the weakened
    economic environment across the globe.

In 2010, the soft market continued across many sectors including
    the reinsurance market.

Our North America and UK and Irish retail operations have been
    particularly impacted by the weakened economic climate and
    continued soft market throughout both 2009 and 2010 with no
    material improvement in rates across most sectors.

This resulted in declines in 2009 revenues in these operations
    with only modest improvement in 2010, particularly amongst our
    smaller clients who have been especially vulnerable to the
    economic downturn.

In 2011, our main priorities will include:

•

execution of the Willis Cause — aiming to become the
    broker and risk adviser of choice globally by aligning our
    business model to the needs of each client segment and
    maintaining a focus on growth;

•

continued investment in technology, advanced analytics, product
    innovation and industry talent and expertise to support our
    growth strategy;

•

reviewing all businesses to better align resources with our
    growth strategies and enable related long-term expense
    savings; and

•

review of our debt profile.

EXECUTIVE
    SUMMARY

Overview

Despite the difficult market conditions during the year, we
    reported total revenue growth of 2 percent in 2010 mainly
    reflecting 4 percent organic growth in commissions and fees
    partly offset by a negative 1 percent impact from foreign
    currency translation.

Organic revenue growth was driven by our Global and
    International operations which both reported 6 percent
    organic growth, whilst revenues in our North America operations
    were broadly in line with 2009, as this segment continued to be
    adversely

impacted by the soft market and difficult economic conditions.

Operating margin was 23 percent in 2010, compared with
    21 percent in 2009. The year on year improvement mainly
    reflected the benefit of organic growth in commissions and fees,
    continuing disciplined management of costs and a small favorable
    effect from foreign currency movements, partly offset by
    increased incentive costs.

Results from
    continuing operations: 2010 compared with 2009

Net income from continuing operations in 2010 was
    $455 million, or $2.66 per diluted share, compared with
    $436 million, or $2.58 per diluted share, in 2009.

Total revenues from continuing operations at $3,339 million
    for 2010 were $76 million, or 2 percent, higher than
    in 2009, reflecting organic commissions and fees growth of
    4 percent, partly offset by an adverse impact from foreign
    currency translation, a $16 million decrease attributable
    to the year over year reduction in contingent

commissions assumed as part of the HRH acquisition and a
    $14 million decrease in investment and other income.

Organic commissions and fees growth of 4 percent comprised
    6 percent net new business growth (which constitutes the
    revenue growth from business won over the course of the year net
    of the revenue from existing business lost) and a 2 percent
    negative impact from declining premium rates and other market
    factors.



Business
    discussion

Operating margin at 23 percent was 2 percentage points
    higher than in 2009 with the increase mainly reflecting:

•

4 percent organic growth in commissions and fees;

•

a favorable year over year impact from foreign currency
    translation, excluding the impact from the devaluation of the
    Venezuelan currency. This reflects the net benefit of:
    significantly lower losses on our forward rate hedging program
    and a weaker year over year Pound Sterling which decreases the
    US dollar value of our net Pound Sterling expense base; partly
    offset by the weakening of the Euro against the US dollar,
    reducing the US dollar value of our net Euro income;

•

an $18 million reduction in amortization of intangible
    assets, equivalent to approximately 1 percentage point;

•

the release of a previously established $7 million legal
    reserve; and

•

rigorous expense management;

partly offset by

•

a $60 million increase in incentive expenses including: a
    $31 million increase in the amortization of cash retention
    awards; and a $29 million increase in the accrual for
    producer and other incentive compensation reflecting improved
    performance across many regions;

•

a $16 million reduction in legacy contingent commissions
    assumed on the acquisition of HRH;

•

investment in initiatives to support current and future growth;

•

a charge of $12 million relating to the devaluation of the
    Venezuelan currency in January 2010;

•

a $12 million reduction in investment income driven by
    lower average interest rates and a reduced contribution to
    investment income from our hedging program, in 2010 compared
    with 2009, with other interest rates across the globe remaining
    consistently low, and

•

an $8 million increase in share-based compensation charge,
    largely due to the non-recurrence of a $5 million credit in
    first quarter 2009.

Interest expense in 2010 was $166 million, $8 million
    lower than in 2009, as the benefit of the interest expense
    savings arising from the year over year reduction in average
    term loan and revolving credit facility balances was partly
    offset by the effect of the higher coupon payable on the
    $500 million of 12.875% senior unsecured notes issued
    in March 2009.

Income tax expense for 2010 was $140 million compared with
    $96 million in 2009. Both years benefited from a release of
    provisions for uncertain tax positions and 2009 additionally
    benefited from a $27 million tax credit following a change
    to UK tax law.

Earnings from associates were $23 million in 2010 compared
    with $33 million in 2009 with the decrease primarily
    reflecting our reduced ownership of Gras Savoye.

Results from
    continuing operations: 2009 compared with 2008

Net income from continuing operations in 2009 was
    $436 million, or $2.58 per diluted share, compared with
    $302 million, or $2.04 per diluted share, in 2008. This
    increase included organic growth in commissions and fees, a
    reduction in costs associated with our 2008 expense review from
    $0.45 per diluted share in 2008 to $0.11 per diluted share for
    severance costs in 2009 and a one-time tax release in 2009
    relating to a change in UK tax law in 2009 equivalent to $0.16
    per diluted share.

Total revenues from continuing operations at $3,263 million
    for 2009 were $436 million, or 15 percent, higher than
    in 2008. Organic revenue growth of 2 percent and a
    19 percent benefit from net acquisitions and disposals in
    2009, driven by the fourth quarter 2008 acquisition of HRH, were
    partly offset by a negative 4 percent impact from foreign
    currency translation and a $31 million decrease in
    investment income compared to 2008.

Organic revenue growth of 2 percent comprised
    5 percent net new business growth (which



Willis
    Group Holdings plc

constitutes the revenue growth from business won over the course
    of the year net of the revenue from existing business lost) and
    a 3 percent negative impact from declining premium rates
    and other market factors.

Operating margin at 21 percent was 3 percentage points
    higher than in 2008 with the increase mainly reflecting:

•

2 percent organic growth in commissions and fees;

•

the realization of savings from prior years’ Shaping Our
    Future initiatives and disciplined cost control; and

•

a favorable year over year impact from foreign currency
    translation, equivalent to 3 percentage points.

partly offset by

•

a $66 million increase in pension costs, mainly driven by
    lower asset levels in our UK pension plan and excluding the
    $12 million US curtailment gain and the impact of the UK
    salary sacrifice scheme;

•

a $31 million reduction in investment income; and

•

a $64 million increase in the amortization of intangible
    assets, including additional charges in respect of intangible
    assets recognized on the HRH acquisition.

2011 Operational
    review

Willis aims to be the broker and risk adviser of choice globally
    by aligning our business model to the needs of each client
    segment and maintaining a focus on growth: this is our value
    proposition which we call the ‘Willis Cause’.

We expect 2011 salaries and benefits expense to include an
    increase of approximately $100 million compared with 2010
    as a result of the following:

•

an approximately $65 million increase due to higher
    amortization of cash retention payments;

•

the reinstatement of annual salary reviews for all employees
    from April of this year; and

•

the reinstatement of a 401(k) match for North American employees.

We estimate that of those items noted above, approximately
    $20 million to $25 million will continue through to
    2012 as incremental expense: reflecting a further but
    significantly lower increase in the amortization of cash
    retention awards in 2012

compared with 2011, and the full year impact of the 2011 annual
    salary review.

In addition to these costs, we will continue to invest in
    technology, advanced analytics, product innovation, and industry
    talent and expertise to support the growth strategy and
    continued execution of the Willis Cause through 2011 and beyond.

In order to fund the higher anticipated salaries and benefits
    expense and these investments, we are undertaking a review of
    all our businesses to better align our resources with our growth
    strategies. We expect to complete this review in the first
    quarter of 2011.

In connection with this review, we anticipate that we will incur
    pre-tax charges of approximately $110 million to
    $130 million, primarily recorded in the first quarter of
    2011. We also anticipate that the operational review will result
    in cost savings of approximately $65 million to
    $80 million in 2011, reaching annualized savings of
    approximately $90 million to $100 million in 2012.

Outlook

As a result of the 2011 operational review and the continued
    investment in our business model, we expect to deliver:

•

modest adjusted margin expansion (operating margin excluding net
    gains and losses on disposals and other one-time items) and
    modest

adjusted earnings per diluted share (diluted earnings per share
    excluding net gains and losses on disposals and other one-time
    items) growth in 2011; and



Business
    discussion

•

significantly accelerated adjusted margin and adjusted diluted
    earnings per share growth in 2012 and beyond.

The statements under ‘2011 Operational Review’ and
    ‘Outlook’ constitute forward-looking statements.

Please see ‘Forward-Looking Statements’ for certain
    cautionary information regarding forward-looking statements and
    a list of factors that could cause actual results to differ
    materially from those predicted in the forward-looking
    statements.

Venezuela
    currency devaluation

With effect from January 1, 2010 the Venezuelan economy was
    designated as hyper-inflationary. The Venezuelan government also
    devalued the Bolivar Fuerte in January 2010. As a result of
    these actions,

we recorded a $12 million charge in other expenses in 2010
    to reflect the re-measurement of our net assets denominated in
    Venezuelan Bolivar Fuerte at January 1, 2010.

Acquisitions

During 2010, we acquired:

•

an additional 39 percent of our Chinese operations at a
    total cost of approximately $17 million, bringing our
    ownership to 90 percent as at December 31,
    2010; and

•

an additional 15 percent of our Colombian operations at a
    total cost of approximately $7 million, bringing our
    ownership to 80 percent as at December 31, 2010.

Cash and
    financing

Cash at December 31, 2010 was $316 million,
    $95 million higher than at December 31, 2009. This
    increase in cash was partly attributable to additional cash
    balances being held in our main UK regulated company.

Net cash generated from operating activities in 2010 was
    $489 million compared with $419 million in 2009.

Net cash generated from operating activities in 2010 of
    $489 million was used to fund debt repayments of
    $209 million; dividends to stockholders of
    $176 million; and fixed asset additions of $83 million.

In August 2010, we entered into a new revolving credit facility
    agreement under which a further $200 million is available.
    This facility is in addition to the remaining availability under
    our previously existing $300 million revolving credit
    facility.

In addition, in June 2010, we entered into an additional
    facility solely for the use of our main UK

regulated entity under which a further $20 million would be
    available in certain exceptional circumstances. This facility is
    secured against the freehold of the UK regulated entity’s
    freehold property in Ipswich.

At December 31, 2010, we have $nil outstanding under both
    the $200 million and the $20 million facilities and
    $90 million outstanding under our

pre-existing

$300 million facility.

Total debt, total equity and the capitalization ratio at
    December 31, 2010 were as follows:

Willis
    Group Holdings plc

We remain committed to our previously stated goals of ongoing
    debt repayment and returning capital to shareholders.

Consistent with this strategy, we are currently reviewing our
    debt profile and, subject to prevailing market conditions, may
    seek to take advantage of attractive financing rates to reduce
    the cost and extend the maturity profile of our existing debt.

Such actions may include redemption of the entire
    $500 million in aggregate principal amount of

12.875% senior notes due 2016. If the 2016 senior notes are
    redeemed, we anticipate that we would incur a one-time pre-tax
    charge of approximately $180 million relating to the
    make-whole premium provided under the terms of the indenture
    governing the notes, as calculated at December 31, 2010.

Based on current market conditions and information available to
    us at this time, we believe that we have sufficient liquidity to
    meet our cash needs for at least the next 12 months.

Management
    structure

Effective January 1, 2011, we have changed our internal
    reporting structure; Global Markets International, previously
    reported within our International segment, is now reported in
    our Global

division. In addition, Mexico, which was previously reported
    within our International segment, is now reported in our North
    America segment.

Our methods of calculating these measures may differ from those

Revenues for 2010 at $3,339 million were $76 million,
    or 2 percent higher than in 2009, reflecting organic growth
    in commissions and fees of 4 percent, offset by a
    1 percent adverse year over year impact from foreign
    currency translation and decreased investment and other income.

Investment income was $38 million for 2010,
    $12 million lower than 2009 with the impact on investment
    income of lower interest rates across the globe, particularly on
    our Euro-denominated deposits, only partially mitigated by our
    forward hedging program. While we expect this forward hedging
    program to generate additional income in 2011 compared to
    current LIBOR based rates, there will be a lower benefit than in
    2010 as older, more beneficial hedges, continue to expire.
    Consequently, we expect investment income to be closer to
    $30 million in 2011.

Our International and Global operations earn a significant
    portion of their revenues in currencies other than the US
    dollar, including the Euro and Pound Sterling. For the year
    ended December 31,

2010, reported revenues were adversely impacted by the year over
    year effect of foreign currency translation: in particular due
    to the strengthening of the US dollar against the Euro,
    Venezuelan Bolivar Fuerte and Pound Sterling, partly offset by
    its weakening against the Australian dollar.

Organic growth in commissions and fees was 4 percent for
    2010. Global achieved 6 percent growth, driven by good
    growth in our Reinsurance, Willis Capital Markets &
    Advisory (WCMA) and Global Specialties businesses. International
    also achieved 6 percent growth driven by double digit
    organic growth in Latin America and Asia, together with solid
    growth in Europe. North America organic revenue growth was flat,
    as the benefits of double digit new business growth and a change
    in accounting policy in an acquired specialty business, were
    offset by the impact of the continued soft market and ongoing
    weakened economic conditions.

Organic revenue growth by segment is discussed further in
    ‘Operating Results — Segment Information’

Organic revenue growth excludes:

    revenues generated from acquisitions; (iii) the net
    commission and fee revenues related to operations disposed of in

    contingent commissions assumed as part of the HRH acquisition
    and that had not been converted into higher standard commission;
    and (v) investment income and other income from reported
    revenues.

(b)

Included in North America reported
    commissions and fees were legacy HRH contingent commissions of
    $27 million in 2009, compared with $50 million in 2008.

Our methods of calculating these measures may differ from those
    used by other companies and therefore comparability may be
    limited.

Revenues for 2009 at $3,263 million were $436 million,
    or 15 percent higher than in 2008, reflecting a
    20 percent benefit from net acquisitions and disposals,
    principally attributable to HRH, and organic growth in
    commissions and fees of 2 percent, offset by a
    4 percent adverse year over year impact from foreign
    currency translation, a reduction in legacy HRH contingent
    commissions and lower investment income.

Investment income was $50 million for 2009,
    $31 million lower than 2008, with the decrease reflecting
    significantly lower average interest rates in 2009. The impact
    of rate decreases on our investment income was partially
    mitigated by our forward hedging program.

Our International and Global operations earn a significant
    portion of their revenues in currencies

other than the US dollar. For the year ended December 31,
    2009, reported revenues were adversely impacted by the year over
    year effect of foreign currency translation: in particular due
    to the strengthening of the US dollar against the Pound Sterling
    and against the Euro, compared with 2008.

Organic growth in commissions and fees was 2 percent for
    2009, despite a negative 3 percent impact from declining
    premium rates and other market factors. Our overall organic
    growth comprised good growth in our Global operations and many
    of our International operations, partly offset by declines in
    our North America, UK and Irish retail operations reflecting the
    weak economic environments and soft market conditions
    experienced in these territories.

Salaries and benefits were 56 percent of revenues for both

•

a $9 million reduction in severance costs to
    $15 million from $24 million: whilst approximately 550
    positions were eliminated in 2010 compared with 450 positions in
    2009 as part of our continued focus on managing expense, the
    average cost per eliminated position was lower in 2010; and

•

a year over year net benefit from foreign currency translation
    driven primarily by the strengthening of the US dollar against
    the Pound Sterling (in which our London Market based operations
    incur the majority of their expenses);

were offset by

•

a $60 million increase in incentive expenses including: a
    $31 million increase in the amortization of cash retention
    payments; and a $29 million increase in the accrual for
    incentive compensation reflecting increased headcount and
    improved performance across many regions;

•

an $8 million increase in share-based compensation mainly
    reflecting the non-recurrence of a $5 million credit in
    first quarter 2009. The credit in 2009 related to accumulated
    compensation expense for certain 2008 awards which were
    dependent upon performance targets which the Company did not
    achieve; and

•

investment in new client-facing hires and spending on other
    growth initiatives.

Cash retention
    awards

We have a cash retention award program in place. We started
    making cash retention awards in 2005 to a small number of
    employees. With the success of the program, we have expanded it
    over time to include more staff and we believe it is a
    contributing factor to the reduction in employee turnover we
    have seen in recent years.

Salaries and benefits do not reflect the unamortized portion of
    annual cash retention awards made to employees. Employees must
    repay a proportionate amount of these cash retention awards if
    they voluntarily leave our employ (other than in the event of
    retirement or permanent disability) before a certain time
    period, currently three years. We make cash payments to our
    employees in the year we grant these retention awards and
    recognize these payments ratably over the period they are
    subject to repayment, beginning in the quarter in which the
    award is made. A significant majority of the Company’s
    incentive compensation for non-production compensation is paid
    in the form of a retention payment versus bonus awards which
    typically are made for prior service and accrued over the prior
    service period.

During 2010, we made $196 million of cash retention
    payments compared with $148 million in 2009. Salaries and
    benefits in 2010 include $119 million of amortization of
    cash retention payments made on or before December 31, 2010
    compared with $88 million in 2009. As of December 31,
    2010 and December 31, 2009, we included $173 million
    and $98 million, respectively, in other assets on the
    balance sheet, which represented the unamortized portion of cash
    retention payments made on or before those dates.

Other
    expenses

Other expenses were 17 percent of revenues in 2010,
    compared with 18 percent in 2009, reflecting the benefits
    of:

•

significantly lower losses on our forward rate hedging program
    in 2010 of $15 million, compared with $40 million in
    2009;

•

the release of a previously established $7 million legal
    reserve; and

•

continued disciplined management of discretionary expenses;

partly offset by

•

the $12 million first quarter 2010 charge relating to the
    devaluation of the Venezuelan currency; and

•

increases in travel and entertaining expenses in support of our
    revenue growth initiatives.



Willis
    Group Holdings plc

2009 compared
    with 2008

Salaries and
    benefits

Salaries and benefits were 56 percent of revenues for 2009,
    compared with 58 percent in 2008 reflecting the benefits of:

•

good cost controls, including our previous Shaping our Future
    and 2008 expense review initiatives, together with the initial
    benefits from our Right Sizing Willis initiatives in 2009;

•

the non-recurrence of $66 million of costs incurred as part
    of the 2008 expense review;

•

a year over year benefit from foreign currency translation
    driven primarily by the significant strengthening of the US
    dollar against the Pound Sterling (in which our London market
    based operations incur the majority of their expenses); and

•

a $12 million curtailment gain realized on the closure of
    our US defined benefit pension plan to accrual of benefit for
    future service (see below);

partly offset by

•

a $66 million increase in pension costs, mainly driven by
    lower asset levels in our UK pension plan and excluding the
    $12 million US curtailment gain and the $8 million
    impact of the introduction of a UK salary sacrifice scheme. The
    increase attributable to the salary sacrifice scheme was
    marginally more than offset by a reduction in salaries and
    payroll taxes.

Effective May 15, 2009, we closed our US defined benefit
    pension plan to future accrual and recognized a curtailment gain
    of $12 million in second quarter 2009. As a result the full
    year 2009 charge for the US plan was $7 million compared
    with an expected $39 million charge had the plan not been
    closed to future accrual.

We also suspended the company match for our US 401(k) plan which
    benefited 2009 by $9 million compared with 2008.

UK salary
    sacrifice scheme

With effect from April 2009, the Company offered UK employees an
    alternative basis on which to fund contributions into the UK
    pension plans. UK employees can now agree to sacrifice an amount
    of their salary and in return the Company makes additional
    pension contributions on their behalf, equivalent to the value
    of the salary sacrificed.

From a payroll tax perspective, this is a more efficient method
    of making pension contributions.

As a result of this change, the Company made additional pension
    contributions of $10 million in 2010 and $8 million in
    2009, with marginally higher savings in salaries and payroll
    taxes.

Other
    expenses

Other expenses were 18 percent of revenues for 2009
    compared with 21 percent in 2008, reflecting the benefit of:

•

the non-recurrence of $26 million of costs incurred as part
    of the 2008 expense review;

•

a reduction in discretionary expenses including travel and
    entertaining, advertising, printing and a number of other areas,
    driven by our Right Sizing Willis initiatives; and

•

lower foreign exchange losses relating to the UK sterling
    pension asset;

partly offset by

•

foreign currency translation losses on our forward rate hedging
    program of $40 million, compared with losses on the
    equivalent program in 2008 of $12 million.

We have a program that hedges our sterling cash outflows from
    our London market operations, a part of which hedges the
    sterling denominated cash contributions into the UK pension
    plan. However, we do not hedge against the pension benefits
    asset or liability recognized for accounting purposes.

The effects of the above increases were partly mitigated by the
    benefits of our continued focus on cost controls.



Business
    discussion

Amortization of
    intangible assets

Amortization of intangible assets of $82 million in 2010
    was $18 million lower than in 2009.

The decrease primarily reflects: the year over year benefit of
    the 2009 accelerated amortization of $7 million relating to
    the HRH brand name; and the declining charge for the
    amortization of the HRH customer relationship intangible, which
    is being amortized in line with the underlying discounted cash
    flows.

We expect the amortization of intangible assets expense in 2011
    to further decrease to approximately $65 million.

Amortization of intangible assets of $100 million in 2009
    was $64 million higher than in 2008. The

significant year over year increase was primarily attributable
    to additional charges of $58 million in 2009 in respect of
    intangible assets recognized on the HRH acquisition, including
    $7 million of accelerated amortization relating to the HRH
    brand name. Following the success of our integration of HRH into
    our previously existing North America operations, we announced
    on October 1, 2009 that we were changing the name of our
    North America operations from Willis HRH to Willis North
    America. Consequently the intangible asset recognized on the
    acquisition of HRH relating to the HRH brand name was fully
    amortized.

Operating margin was 23 percent for 2010, compared with

•

4 percent organic growth in commissions and fees;

•

a favorable year over year impact from foreign currency
    translation, excluding the impact from the devaluation of the
    Venezuelan currency. This reflects the net benefit of:
    significantly lower losses on our forward rate hedging program
    and a weaker year over year Pound Sterling which decreases the
    US dollar value of our net Pound Sterling expense base; partly
    offset by the weakening of the Euro against the US dollar,
    reducing the US dollar value of our net Euro income;

•

an $18 million reduction in amortization of intangible
    assets, as explained above, equivalent to approximately
    1 percentage point;

•

the release of a previously established $7 million legal
    reserve; and

•

rigorous expense management;

    deposits, in 2010 compared with 2009, with other interest rates
    across the globe remaining consistently low, and

Operating margin was 21 percent for 2009 compared with

    in 2008 associated with our 2008 expense review;

•

2 percent organic growth in commissions and fees;

•

the $12 million US pension curtailment gain recognized in

•

a $64 million increase in amortization of intangible
    assets, principally attributable to HRH;

•

a $31 million year over year decline in investment income,
    reflecting the impact of the significant decline in global
    interest rates; and

Interest
    expense




(millions)

Interest expense

$


$


$


Interest expense in 2010 of $166 million was $8 lower than
    in 2009, as the benefit of the interest expense savings arising
    from the year over year reduction in average term loan and
    revolving credit facility balances was partly offset by the
    effect of the higher coupon payable on the $500 million of
    12.875% senior unsecured notes issued in March 2009.

We are reviewing our current debt profile to identify
    opportunities to reduce our financing costs by taking advantage
    of current low global interest rates.

Interest expense in 2009 of $174 million was
    $69 million higher than in 2008. This increase primarily
    reflects higher average debt levels following the HRH
    acquisition, but also includes $5 million of premium and
    costs relating to the early repurchase in September 2009 of
    $160 million of our 5.125% senior notes due July 2010
    at a premium of $27.50 per $1,000 face value.

an adverse impact from the $12 million charge relating to
    the devaluation of the Venezuelan currency for which no tax
    credits are available; and

•

the tax impact of the net loss on disposal of operations.

Excluding these items, the underlying effective tax rate for
    2010 was broadly in line with 2009.

2009 compared
    with 2008

The effective tax rate in 2009 was 18 percent compared with
    24 percent in 2008. The decrease in rate reflects:

•

a $27 million release relating to a 2009 change in tax law.
    As at June 30, 2009 we held a provision of $27 million
    relating to tax that would potentially be payable should the
    unremitted earnings of our foreign subsidiaries be repatriated.
    Following a change in UK tax law effective in third quarter
    2009, these earnings may now be

repatriated without additional tax cost and, consequently, the
    provision was released; and

•

an $11 million release relating to uncertain tax positions
    due to the closure of the statute of limitations on assessments
    for previously unrecognized tax benefits. There was a similar
    $5 million release of uncertain tax positions in 2008.

Excluding the benefit of these items, the underlying effective
    tax rate for 2009 was 26 percent.

Interest in
    earnings of associates

Interest in earnings of associates, net of tax, in 2010 of
    $23 million was $10 million lower than in 2009. This
    fall is primarily driven by the reduction from 49 percent
    to 31 percent in our ownership interest in Gras Savoye, as
    part of the reorganization of their capital structure in
    December 2009. Interest receivable on the vendor financing we
    provided as part of the capital reorganization is also recorded
    under this caption.

Interest in earnings of associates, net of tax, was
    $33 million in 2009, $11 million higher than in 2008,
    reflecting a year over year increased ownership share in Gras
    Savoye. As described above, our interest in Gras Savoye
    subsequently reduced in December 2009 following the
    reorganization of that company’s capital.

    reflecting the benefits of:

•

the $59 million net increase in operating income discussed

an $8 million decrease in interest expense, largely
    reflecting a year over year reduction in the outstanding
    balances on our term loan and revolving credit facility debt;

partly offset by

•

the year over year increase in tax charge of $44 million,
    primarily attributable to the 2009 one-off tax benefits of
    $38 million;

•

a reduction in earnings from associates of
    $10 million; and

•

a reduction in noncontrolling interests share of net income.

Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for 2010
    increased to $2.66 compared to $2.58 in 2009.



Willis

Foreign currency translation, excluding the impact of the
    Venezuelan currency devaluation, had a $0.04 favorable impact on
    diluted earnings per share. This was more than offset by the
    $0.07 per diluted share negative impact from the Venezuela
    currency devaluation in January 2010.

Average share count for 2010 was 171 million compared with
    169 million in 2009. The increased share count had a
    negative $0.03 impact on diluted earnings per share.

    $191 million increase in operating income, discussed above,
    partly offset by the $69 million increase in interest
    expense.

Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for 2009
    increased to $2.58 compared to $2.04 in 2008 as the benefit of
    the increased net

income was partly offset by a 21 million increase in
    average diluted shares outstanding due primarily to the shares
    issued on October 1, 2008 for the HRH acquisition. The
    additional shares issued had a negative $0.36 impact on earnings
    per diluted share in 2009.

Foreign currency translation had a year over year $0.27 positive
    impact on earnings per diluted share in 2009.

Organic revenue growth excludes:
    (i) the impact of foreign currency translation;
    (ii) the first twelve months of net commission and fee
    revenues generated from acquisitions; (iii) the net
    commission and fee revenues related to operations disposed of in
    each period presented; and (iv) investment income and other
    income from reported revenues.

Revenues

2010 compared
    with 2009

Commissions and fees of $873 million were $51 million,
    or 6 percent, higher in 2010 compared with 2009 which was
    driven by 6 percent organic revenue growth, with a
    1 percent benefit from acquisitions and disposals offset by
    the impact of foreign currency translation.

Our Reinsurance and Global Specialties businesses both reported
    mid-single digit organic growth in 2010, driven by good net new
    business generation despite the adverse impact of the continued
    difficult rate environment and soft market in many of the
    specialty classes.

Reinsurance reported strong new business growth across all
    segments in 2010 and client retention levels remained high.
    Despite high loss levels earlier in the year, rates remain soft
    except for Marine and Energy.

Organic growth in Global Specialties was led by strong
    contributions from Financial and Executive Risks, Construction
    and Energy, reflecting strong new business, improved retention,
    targeted hiring of producer talent and global connectivity.
    However, the operating environment remains tough with depressed
    world trade and transit volumes, industry

consolidation and pressure on financing of construction projects
    still evident.

As a result of strong reinsurance underwriting profits in 2009,
    with the exception of marine and energy, there has been a
    general but disciplined softening of rates in 2010 which remain
    a significant headwind for growth.

Our WCMA business also contributed to positive organic revenue
    growth in 2010, substantially due to a $9 million fee on a
    single capital markets transaction in the second quarter. WCMA
    is a transaction oriented business and its results are more
    variable than some of our other businesses.

Faber & Dumas revenues were slightly lower than 2009,
    mainly reflecting the soft wholesale market, together with
    continued pressure on the most economically sensitive lines such
    as bloodstock, jewelry and fine arts.

Productivity in Global, measured in terms of revenue per FTE
    employee, increased to $365,000 for 2010 compared with $358,000
    for 2009.

Client retention levels remained high at 90 percent for
    2010, in line with 2009.

2009 compared
    with 2008

Commissions and fees of $822 million were $38 million,
    or 5 percent, higher in 2009 compared with 2008 of which
    4 percent was attributable to the acquisition of the HRH UK
    wholesale business, Glencairn and 4 percent to organic
    revenue growth.

These were partly offset by a 3 percent negative impact
    from foreign exchange movements.

Net new business growth was 5 percent and there was a
    1 percent adverse impact from rates and other market
    factors. Reinsurance led the growth in net new business. Global
    Specialties organic revenues



Willis
    Group Holdings plc

were slightly higher than in 2008, as growth in Marine,
    Aerospace and Financial and Executive Risks was offset by
    reductions elsewhere. There was continued softness in most
    specialty rates although there were some signs of stabilization
    and firming in some areas, including Aerospace and Energy. The

Faber & Dumas businesses continue to be adversely
    impacted by the weakening economic environment.

There was a sharp decline in investment income in 2009 compared
    with 2008 as global interest rates fell markedly in the latter
    half of 2008 and early 2009.

Operating
    margin

2010 compared
    with 2009

Operating margin was 30 percent in 2010 compared with
    31 percent in 2009. This decrease primarily reflected the
    adverse impact of foreign currency translation, as the positive
    effect on our Pound Sterling expense base of a strengthening US
    dollar, was more than offset by the adverse impact of foreign
    currency movements on sterling-denominated balances.

Operating margin in Global is impacted by foreign exchange
    movements as the London Market businesses within our Global
    operations earn

revenues in US dollars, Pounds Sterling and Euros and primarily
    incur expenses in Pounds Sterling. In addition, they are exposed
    to exchange risk on certain sterling-denominated balances.

Excluding the impact of this foreign currency translation,
    Global’s operating margin remained flat as the benefits of
    good organic revenue growth and disciplined cost control were
    offset by the impact of costs associated with continued support
    of current and future growth.

2009 compared
    with 2008

Operating margin was 31 percent in 2009 compared with
    29 percent in 2008. This improvement reflected a
    significant benefit from foreign currency translation, together
    with organic revenue growth, particularly driven by our
    Reinsurance business, and

good cost controls including a reduction in discretionary
    expenses.

The benefit of these was partly offset by a significant increase
    in the UK pension expense and a sharp reduction in investment
    income.

Revenues

2010 compared
    with 2009

Commissions and fees of $1,359 million were
    $9 million, or 1 percent, lower for 2010 compared with
    2009.

Excluding the $16 million decrease in legacy contingency
    commissions assumed as part of the HRH acquisition, there was a
    modest increase in commissions and fees.

Organic revenue growth was flat for 2010 as the benefits of:

•

strong growth in our specialty businesses, driven by good growth
    in the business, together with a $7 million increase in
    commissions and fees from a change in accounting of an acquired
    specialty business in North America to conform with Group
    accounting policy;

•

3 per cent growth in our employee benefits practice, which
    represents approximately 25 percent of North America’s
    commission and fee base, despite the soft labor market; and

•

good net new business generation, with improved client retention;

partly offset by

•

a negative 2 percent impact from rate declines and other
    market factors;

•

a further decline in our Construction business, which represents
    approximately 10 percent of North America’s commission
    and fee base, reflecting the ongoing challenges in that sector.
    However, declines in commissions and fees were single digits in
    2010 compared with the double digit declines experienced in
    2009; and

•

smaller declines elsewhere reflecting the impact of the
    continued soft market conditions and weak US economy.

Net new business growth includes the benefit of higher standard
    commissions where these have been negotiated in lieu of
    contingent commissions. These



Willis

higher standard commissions however may not have been negotiated
    at the same level or be received in the same periods as the
    related contingent commissions. Furthermore, the business to
    which they related may not have been renewed.

Despite the small decline in revenues, productivity in North
    America, measured in terms of revenue per FTE employee,
    increased to $238,000 for 2010 compared with $227,000 for 2009.

Client retention levels increased to 92 percent for 2010,
    compared with 91 percent for 2009.

2009 compared
    with 2008

Commissions and fees in North America were 51 percent
    higher in 2009 compared with 2008 reflecting the uplift from the
    additional revenues of HRH, partly offset by 3 percent
    negative organic growth. Our North America operations were
    significantly adversely impacted by soft market conditions, the
    weakened US economy and a reduction in project based revenues
    which more than offset a positive impact from net new business.
    In particular, our Construction division saw significant
    declines.

Our primary focus in North America in 2009 was the integration
    of HRH into our existing operations and the improvement of
    margin. Additionally, in the second half of the year we
    refocused our efforts on revenue growth and we believe this led
    to double digit new business generation in parts of the business
    during that time period.

Despite the significant decline in revenues, our productivity
    measured in terms of revenue per FTE employee remained high,
    with a marginal increase to $227,000 for 2009 compared with
    $225,000 for 2008.

Operating
    margin

2010 compared
    with 2009

Operating margin in North America was 23 percent in 2010
    compared with 24 percent in 2009, as the benefits of:

•

continued disciplined cost control; and

•

lower pension expense in 2010, excluding the second quarter 2009
    curtailment gain, following the closure of the US pension plan
    to future accrual in second quarter 2009;

were more than offset by

•

the reduction in legacy HRH contingent commissions of
    $16 million in 2010;

•

the non-recurrence of a $9 million benefit in 2009 from the
    curtailment of the US pension plan relating to our North America
    retail employees; and

•

increased incentive expense in 2010, including the impact of
    increased amortization of cash retention award payments.

2009 compared
    with 2008

Operating margin in North America was 24 percent in 2009
    compared with 15 percent in 2008. The higher margin
    reflected:

•

the acquisition of HRH and the synergies and cost savings
    achieved from the integration of HRH with our existing North
    America operations;

•

a reduction in underlying expense base reflecting the benefits
    of our 2008 Expense Review and Right Sizing Willis
    initiatives; and

•

a $9 million benefit from the curtailment of the US pension
    scheme relating to our North America retail employees;

partly offset by

•

the decline in organic revenues against the backdrop of the soft
    market and weak economic conditions discussed above.

International

Our International business comprises our retail operations in
    Eastern and Western Europe, the United Kingdom and Ireland,
    Asia-Pacific, Russia, the Middle East, South Africa and Latin
    America. The services provided are focused according to the
    characteristics of each market and vary across offices, but
    generally include direct risk

management and insurance brokerage and employee benefits
    consulting.

The following table sets out revenues, organic revenue growth
    and operating income and margin for the three years ended
    December 31, 2010:

    (ii) the first twelve months of net commission and fee
    revenues generated from acquisitions; (iii) the net
    commission and fee revenues related to operations disposed of in
    each period presented; and (iv) investment income and other
    income from reported revenues.

Revenues

2010 compared
    with 2009

Commissions and fees of $1,068 million were
    $48 million, or 5 percent, higher for 2010 compared
    with 2009, as the benefits of 6 percent organic revenue
    growth and 1 percent from the net effect of acquisitions
    and disposals was partly offset by a 2 percent adverse
    impact from foreign currency translation. Net new business
    growth was 9 percent and there was a negative
    3 percent impact from rates and other market factors.

A significant part of International’s revenues are earned
    in currencies other than the US dollar. The US dollar has
    strengthened against a number of these currencies in 2010
    compared with 2009, most notably the Euro, Venezuelan Bolivar
    Fuerte, Danish Kroner and Pound Sterling. The adverse impact of
    this strengthening was partly offset by the weakening of the US
    dollar against the Australian dollar. The net impact of these
    movements was a 2 percent reduction in 2010 revenues
    compared to 2009.

There were strong contributions to our organic growth from most
    regions, led by growth in Latin

America, Asia and Europe. In particular, there was good growth
    in:

•

Venezuela, Argentina, Brazil and Chile in Latin America;

•

China, Indonesia and Korea in Asia; and

•

Germany, Spain and Denmark in continental Europe, despite the
    challenging economic environment in this region.

There was further positive growth in our Eastern Europe
    operations in 2010, driven by a strong contribution from Russia.

Organic revenue growth was also positive in our UK and Irish
    retail operations, driven by new business growth in the UK as we
    begin to see signs of an improving economy. Our employee
    benefits practice, which represents approximately
    10 percent of International commissions and fees, continued
    to perform well in 2010 with growth in the mid single digits.

Productivity in our International business, measured in terms of
    revenue per FTE employee, increased to



Willis
    Group Holdings plc

$160,000 for 2010 compared with $156,000 for 2009.

Client retention levels remained high at 92 percent for
    2010.

2009 compared
    with 2008

Commissions and fees in International were $35 million, or
    3 percent, lower in 2009 compared with 2008 as double digit
    new business generation in many of our International units was
    more than offset by an adverse impact from foreign exchange of
    8 percent, a 3 percent adverse impact from rates and
    other market factors, and significantly lower revenues in our UK
    and Irish retail operations.

A significant part of International’s revenues are earned
    in currencies other than the US dollar which strengthened
    significantly in 2009 on a year over year basis against a number
    of these currencies, most notably the Euro, Pound Sterling,
    Danish kroner and Australian dollar, consequently reducing

International revenues on a year over year basis when reported
    in US dollars.

Despite the slowdown of the global economy, International
    continued its organic growth. Excluding our UK and Irish retail
    divisions, organic revenue growth was 8 percent in 2009,
    with Latin America and Asia, led by Brazil, Columbia and China,
    all reporting strong organic growth. However, our UK and Irish
    retail division saw a 6 percent revenue decline, reflecting
    weak local economic conditions.

Client retention levels remained high at approximately
    90 percent for 2009.

Operating
    margin

2010 compared
    with 2009

Operating margin in International was 26 percent in both
    2010 and 2009, as the benefits of:

•

6 percent organic revenue growth; and

•

continued focus on disciplined expense management to drive
    future growth;

were offset by

•

an adverse impact from foreign currency translation, reflecting
    the negative impact of the weakening of the Euro and other
    currencies in

which we earn a significant portion of our operating income
    against the US dollar;

•

increased incentive expenses, including amortization of cash
    retention award payments;

•

a reduction in investment income, driven by lower interest
    rates, particularly in the Euro zone; and

•

spending on initiatives to drive future growth, including a year
    on year increase in International headcount of approximately 200.

2009 compared
    with 2008

Operating margin in International was 26 percent in 2009
    compared with 28 percent in 2008, as the benefits of:

•

strong organic revenue growth outside of Ireland; and

•

focused expense management including savings in discretionary
    costs driven by our Right Sizing Willis initiatives;

were more than offset by

•

increased pension expense for the UK pension plan;

•

a sharp reduction in investment income reflecting lower global
    interest rates; and

•

a weak performance by our Irish retail operations reflecting
    their difficult market conditions.

CRITICAL
    ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES

Our accounting policies are described in Note 2 to the
    Consolidated Financial Statements. Management considers that the
    following accounting estimates or assumptions are the most
    important to the

presentation of our financial condition or operating
    performance. Management has discussed its critical accounting
    estimates and associated disclosures with our Audit Committee.

Pension
    expense

We maintain defined benefit pension plans for employees in the
    US and UK. Both these plans are now closed to new entrants and,
    with effect from May 15, 2009 we closed our US defined
    benefit plan to future accrual. New entrants in the UK are
    offered the opportunity to join a defined contribution plan and
    in the United States are offered the opportunity to join a
    401(k) plan. We also have smaller defined benefit schemes in
    Ireland, Germany, Norway and the Netherlands. These
    International schemes have combined total assets of
    $125 million and a combined net liability for pension
    benefits of $10 million as of December 31, 2010.
    Elsewhere, pension benefits are typically provided through
    defined contribution plans.

We make a number of assumptions when determining our pension
    liabilities and pension expense which are reviewed annually by
    senior management and changed where appropriate. The discount
    rate will be changed annually if underlying rates have moved
    whereas the expected long-term return on assets will be changed
    less frequently as

longer term trends in asset returns emerge or long term target
    asset allocations are revised. Other material assumptions
    include rates of participant mortality, the expected long-term
    rate of compensation and pension increases and rates of employee
    termination.

We recorded a net pension charge on our UK and US defined
    benefit pension plans in 2010 of $29 million, compared with
    $32 million in 2009, a decrease of $3 million.

On our International defined benefit pension plans, we recorded
    a net pension charge of $6 million in 2010, compared with
    $10 million in 2009, a decrease of $4 million.

The UK plan charge was $3 million higher as the benefit of
    higher asset returns from higher asset levels was more than
    offset by:

•

a higher service cost reflecting higher inflation, the first
    full year of the salary sacrifice arrangement and a lower
    discount rate;



Willis
    Group Holdings plc

•

higher amortization of prior period losses; and

•

an increased interest cost.

The US pension charge was $6 million lower in 2010 compared
    with 2009 reflecting:

•

an increased asset return from a higher asset base;

•

a reduction in amortization of prior period losses; and

•

the first full year’s benefit from closing the scheme to
    future accrual in May 2009;

partly offset by

•

the non-recurrence of a $12 million curtailment gain in
    2009.

Based on December 31, 2010 assumptions, we expect the net
    pension charge in 2011 to decrease by: $20 million for the
    UK plan; $1 million for the US plan; and a net
    $2 million for the International plans.

Expected long-term rates of return on plan assets are developed
    from the expected future returns of the various asset classes
    using the target asset allocations. The expected long-term rate
    of return used for determining the net UK pension expense in
    2010 remained unchanged at 7.8 percent, equivalent to an
    expected return in 2010 of $141 million.

Effective January 1, 2011, the expected long-term rate of
    return was decreased to 7.50%, following a change in the
    underlying target asset mix.

During the latter half of 2008 the value of assets held by our
    UK pension plan was significantly adversely affected by the
    turmoil in worldwide markets. The holdings of equity securities
    were particularly affected in 2008, but have recovered, to some
    extent, in 2009 and 2010.

Rates used to discount pension plan liabilities at
    December 31, 2010 were based on yields prevailing at that
    date of high quality corporate bonds of appropriate maturity.
    The selected rate used to discount UK plan liabilities was
    5.5 percent compared with 5.8 percent at
    December 31, 2009

with the decrease reflecting a reduction in UK long-term bond
    rates in the latter part of 2010. This lower discount rate
    generated an actuarial loss of $84 million at
    December 31, 2010.

Mortality assumptions at December 31, 2010 were unchanged
    from December 31, 2009. The mortality assumption is the
    100 percent PNA00 table without an age adjustment. As an
    indication of the longevity assumed, our calculations assume
    that a UK male retiree aged 65 at December 31, 2010 would
    have a life expectancy of 22 years.

The expected long-term rate of return used for determining the
    net US pension scheme expense in 2010 was 8.0 percent,
    consistent with 2009. Effective January 1, 2011, the
    expected long-term rate of return was decreased to 7.50%,
    following a change in the underlying target asset mix.

The rate used to discount US plan liabilities at
    December 31, 2010 was 5.6 percent, determined

based on expected plan cash flows discounted using a corporate
    bond yield curve, a small reduction from 6.1 percent at
    December 31, 2009.

As for the UK plan, the 2008 actual return on assets was
    adversely impacted by the turmoil in worldwide markets.

The mortality assumption at December 31, 2010 is the
    RP-2000 Mortality Table (blended for annuitants and
    non-annuitants), projected to 2011 by Scale AA

(December 31, 2009: projected to 2010 by Scale AA). As an
    indication of the longevity assumed, our calculations assume
    that a US male retiree aged 65 at December 31, 2010, would
    have a life expectancy of 19 years.

Intangible
    assets

Intangible assets represent the excess of cost over the value of
    net tangible assets of businesses acquired. We classify our
    intangible assets into three categories:

•

Goodwill;

•

‘Customer and Marketing Related’ includes client
    lists, client relationships, trade names and non-compete
    agreements; and

•

‘Contract-based, Technology and Other’ includes all
    other purchased intangible assets.

Client relationships acquired on the HRH acquisition are
    amortized over twenty years in line with the

pattern in which the economic benefits of the client
    relationships are expected to be consumed. Over 80 percent
    of the client relationships intangible will have been amortized
    after 10 years. Non-compete agreements acquired in
    connection with the HRH acquisition were amortized over two
    years on a straight line basis. Intangible assets acquired in
    connection with other acquisitions are amortized over their
    estimated useful lives on a straight line basis. Goodwill is not
    subject to amortization.

To determine the allocation of intangible assets between
    goodwill and other intangible assets and the estimated useful
    lives in respect of the HRH



Willis
    Group Holdings plc

acquisition we considered a report produced by a qualified
    independent appraiser. The calculation of the allocation is
    subject to a number of estimates and assumptions. We base our
    allocation on

assumptions we believe to be reasonable. However, changes in
    these estimates and assumptions could affect the allocation
    between goodwill and other intangible assets.

Goodwill
    impairment review

We review goodwill for impairment annually or whenever events or
    circumstances indicate impairment may have occurred. Application
    of the impairment test requires judgment, including:

•

the identification of reporting units;

•

assignment of assets, liabilities and goodwill to reporting
    units; and

•

determination of fair value of each reporting unit.

The fair value of each reporting unit is estimated using a
    discounted cash flow methodology and, in aggregate, validated
    against our market capitalization. This analysis requires
    significant judgments, including:

•

estimation of future cash flows which is dependent on internal
    forecasts;

•

estimation of the long-term rate of growth for our business;

•

determination of our weighted average cost of capital.

We base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be
    reasonable. However, changes in these estimates and assumptions
    could materially affect the determination of fair value and
    result in a goodwill impairment.

Our annual goodwill impairment analysis, which we performed
    during the fourth quarter of 2010, showed the estimated fair
    value of our reporting units was in excess of their carrying
    values, and therefore did not result in an impairment charge
    (2009: $nil, 2008: $nil).

Income
    taxes

We recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the
    estimated future tax consequences of events attributable to
    differences between the financial statements carrying amounts of
    existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases
    and operating and capital loss and tax credit carry-forwards. We
    estimate deferred tax assets and liabilities and assess the need
    for any valuation allowances using tax rates in effect for the
    year in which the differences are expected to be recovered or
    settled taking into account our business plans and tax planning
    strategies.

At December 31, 2010, we had gross deferred tax assets of
    $294 million (2009: $390 million) against which a
    valuation allowance of $87 million (2009: $92 million)
    had been recognized. To the extent that:

•

the actual future taxable income in the periods during which the
    temporary differences are expected to reverse differs from
    current projections;

•

assumed prudent and feasible tax planning strategies fail to
    materialize;

•

new tax planning strategies are developed; or

•

material changes occur in actual tax rates or loss carry-forward
    time limits,

we may adjust the deferred tax asset considered realizable in
    future periods. Such adjustments could result in a significant
    increase or decrease in the effective tax rate and have a
    material impact on our net income.

Positions taken in our tax returns may be subject to challenge
    by the taxing authorities upon examination. We recognize the
    benefit of uncertain tax positions in the financial statements
    when it is more likely than not that the position will be
    sustained on examination by the tax authorities upon lapse of
    the relevant statute of limitations, or when positions are
    effectively settled. The benefit recognized is the largest
    amount of tax benefit that has a greater than 50 percent
    likelihood of being realized on settlement with the tax
    authority, assuming full knowledge of the position and all
    relevant facts. The Company adjusts its recognition of



Business
    discussion

these uncertain tax benefits in the period in which new
    information is available impacting either the recognition or
    measurement of its uncertain tax positions. In 2010,
    $7 million was released relating to uncertain tax positions
    due to the closure of the statute of limitations on assessments
    for previously unrecognized tax benefits. There was a similar

$11 million release of uncertain tax positions in 2009. The
    Company recognizes interest relating to unrecognized tax
    benefits and penalties within income taxes. Accrued interest and
    penalties are included within the related tax liability line in
    the consolidated balance sheet.

Commitments,
    contingencies and accrued liabilities

We purchase professional indemnity insurance for errors and
    omissions claims. The terms of this insurance vary by policy
    year and self-insured risks have increased significantly over
    recent years. We have established provisions against various
    actual and potential claims, lawsuits and other proceedings
    relating principally to alleged errors and omissions in
    connection with the placement of insurance and

reinsurance in the ordinary course of business. Such provisions
    cover claims that have been reported but not paid and also
    claims that have been incurred but not reported. These
    provisions are established based on actuarial estimates together
    with individual case reviews and are believed to be adequate in
    the light of current information and legal advice.

NEW ACCOUNTING
    STANDARDS

There were no new accounting standards issued during the year
    that would have a significant impact on the Company’s
    reporting.

LIQUIDITY AND
    CAPITAL RESOURCES

Effective December 31, 2010, we changed the presentation
    of certain items on our balance sheet. Uncollected premiums from
    insureds and uncollected claims or refunds from insurers,
    previously reported within accounts receivable, are now recorded
    as fiduciary assets on the Company’s consolidated balance
    sheets. Unremitted insurance premiums and

claims (‘fiduciary funds’) are also recorded within
    fiduciary assets. The obligations to remit these funds,
    previously reported within accounts payable, are now recorded as
    fiduciary liabilities on the Company’s consolidated balance
    sheets. Accordingly, prior year comparatives and commentary
    below have been recast to reflect this revised presentation.

We remain committed to our previously stated goals of ongoing
    debt repayment and returning capital to shareholders.

Consistent with this strategy, we are reviewing our current debt
    profile and, subject to prevailing market conditions, may seek
    to take advantage of attractive financing rates to reduce the
    cost and extend the maturity profile of our existing debt.

Such actions may include redemption of the entire
    $500 million in aggregate principal amount of
    12.875 percent senior notes due 2016. If the 2016 senior
    notes are redeemed, we anticipate that we would incur a one-time
    pre-tax charge of approximately $180 million relating to
    the make-whole premium provided under the terms of the

indenture governing the notes, as calculated at
    December 31, 2010.

Total debt as of December 31, 2010 decreased to
    $2.3 billion, compared with $2.4 billion at
    December 31, 2009.

In 2010, we made $110 million of mandatory repayments
    against the

5-year

term
    loan, thereby reducing the outstanding balance as at
    December 31, 2010 to $411 million. We also repurchased
    the remaining $90 million of 5.125% senior notes due
    July 2010 and repaid in full a $9 million fixed rate loan
    due 2010.

In August 2010, we entered into a new revolving credit facility
    agreement under which a further $200 million is available.
    This facility is in addition



Willis
    Group Holdings plc

to the remaining availability under our previously existing
    $300 million revolving credit facility.

In addition, in June 2010, we entered into an additional
    facility solely for the use of our main UK regulated entity
    under which a further $20 million would be available in
    certain exceptional circumstances. This facility is secured
    against the freehold of the UK regulated entity’s freehold
    property in Ipswich.

At December 31, 2010, we have $nil outstanding under both
    the $200 million and the $20 million facilities and
    $90 million outstanding under our pre-existing
    $300 million facility, compared with $nil at
    December 31, 2009.

At December 31, 2010 the only mandatory debt repayments
    falling due over the next 12 months are scheduled
    repayments on our $700 million

5-year

term
    loan totaling $110 million.

Liquidity

Our principal sources of liquidity are cash from operations,
    cash and cash equivalents of $316 million at
    December 31, 2010 and remaining availability of
    $430 million under our revolving credit facilities.

As of December 31, 2010, our short-term liquidity
    requirements consisted of:

•

payment of interest on debt and $110 million of mandatory
    repayments under our 5-year term loan;

•

capital expenditure; and

•

working capital.

Our long-term liquidity requirements consist of:

•

the principal amount of outstanding notes; and

•

borrowings under our 5-year term loan and revolving credit
    facility.

Based on current market conditions and information available to
    us at this time, we believe that we have sufficient liquidity to
    meet our cash needs for at least the next 12 months.

We continue to identify and implement further actions to control
    costs and enhance our operating performance, including future
    cash flow.

Fiduciary
    funds

As an intermediary, we hold funds generally in a fiduciary
    capacity for the account of third parties, typically as the
    result of premiums received from clients that are in transit to
    insurers and claims due to clients that are in transit from
    insurers. We report premiums, which are held on account of, or
    due from, clients as assets with a corresponding liability due
    to the insurers. Claims held by, or due to, us which are due to
    clients are also shown as both assets and liabilities.

Fiduciary funds are generally required to be kept in certain
    regulated bank accounts subject to guidelines which emphasize
    capital preservation and liquidity; such funds are not available
    to service the Company’s debt or for other corporate
    purposes. Notwithstanding the legal relationships with clients
    and insurers, the Company is entitled to retain investment
    income earned on fiduciary funds in accordance with industry
    custom and practice and, in some cases, as supported by
    agreements with insureds.

Own
    funds

As of December 31, 2010, we had cash and cash equivalents
    of $316 million, compared with $221 million at
    December 31, 2009 and $430 million

of the total $520 million under our revolving credit
    facilities remained available to draw.

Operating
    activities

2010 compared to

Net cash provided by operations was $489 million in 2010
    compared with $419 million in 2009.

The $70 million increase in 2010 compared with 2009
    primarily reflected the benefits of:



Business
    discussion

•

a $141 million increase in net income from continuing
    operations before the non-cash charges for: amortization of
    intangible assets; amortization of cash retention award
    payments; provision for deferred taxation; the Venezuela
    currency devaluation in January 2010; and share-based
    compensation;

partly offset by

•

increased pension scheme contributions of $130 million in
    2010, compared with $82 million in 2009; and

•

the timing of cash collections and other working capital
    movements.

2009 compared to

Net cash provided by operations was $419 million in 2009
    compared with $253 million in 2008. The $166 million
    increase between 2008 and 2009 mainly reflects:

•

a $161 million increase in net income before the non-cash
    charges for: amortization of intangible assets; amortization of
    cash retention award payments; provision for deferred taxation;
    and share-based compensation; and

•

a $72 million reduction in pension scheme contributions to
    $82 million in 2009, compared with $154 million in
    2008;

partly offset by

•

the timing of cash collections and other working capital
    movements, including a year over year negative impact from
    foreign currency translation.

Pension
    contributions

UK Plan

We made total cash contributions to our UK defined benefit
    pension plan of $88 million in 2010, (including amounts in
    respect of the salary sacrifice contributions) compared with
    $49 million in 2009 and $140 million in 2008.

The additional $39 million cash contribution in 2010
    reflects an additional payment required under the UK plan’s
    funding strategy which we are required to agree with the
    plan’s trustees.

The funding strategy was agreed in February 2009 and requires
    full year contributions to the UK plan of $39 million for
    2009 through 2012, excluding

amounts in respect of the salary sacrifice scheme. In addition,
    if certain funding targets were not met at the beginning of any
    of the following years, 2010 through 2012, a further
    contribution of $39 million would be required for that year.

In 2010, the additional funding requirement was triggered and we
    expect to make a similar additional contribution in 2011. A
    similar, additional contribution may also be required for 2012,
    depending on actual performance against funding targets at the
    beginning of 2012.

US Plan

We made total cash contributions to our US defined benefit
    pension plan of $30 million in 2010, compared with
    $27 million in 2009 and $8 million in 2008.

For the US plan, expected contributions are the contributions we
    will be required to make under

US pension legislation based on our December 31, 2010
    balance sheet position. We currently expect to contribute
    $30 million in 2011.

International
    Plans

We made cash contributions to our International defined benefit
    pension plans of $12 million in 2010, compared with
    $6 million in both 2009 and 2008.

In 2011, we expect to contribute approximately $6 million
    to our International plans.

Investing
    activities

2010 compared to

Total net cash outflow from investing activities was
    $94 million in 2010 compared with an inflow of
    $102 million in 2009 mainly reflecting:

•

the $155 million received in December 2009 from the
    reorganization of Gras Savoye, less a $42 million payment
    in January 2009 for an additional investment in Gras Savoye made
    in December 2008;

•

the year over year decrease of $42 million in net proceeds
    from sale of operations, mainly

attributable to the second quarter 2009 disposal of
    Bliss & Glennon;

•

the 2009 proceeds from the sale of short-term investments of
    $21 million; and

•

a $21 million increase in cash payments in 2010 for
    acquisitions of subsidiaries, mainly reflecting payments in
    respect of prior year acquisitions.

2009 compared to

Total net cash inflow from investing activities was
    $102 million in 2009 compared with an outflow of
    $1,033 million in 2008, primarily reflecting:

•

the $926 million net cash outflow attributable to the HRH
    acquisition in 2008;

•

$113 million cash received in 2009 in respect of
    investments in associates, compared with $31 million paid
    in 2008. The 2009 receipt

includes $155 million from the reorganization of Gras
    Savoye, less $42 million settled in January 2009 for an
    additional investment in Gras Savoye made in December
    2008; and

•

a $40 million increase in net proceeds from sale of
    operations, mainly attributable to the second quarter 2009
    disposal of Bliss & Glennon.

Financing
    activities

2010 compared to

Net cash used in financing activities was $293 million in
    2010 compared with $516 million in 2009.

The net decrease in cash used in financing activities of
    $223 million was mainly attributable to:

•

a $90 million increase in the drawdown against our
    revolving credit facilities; and

•

a $880 million reduction in debt repayments, largely due to
    the 2009 repayment/refinancing of

$750 million of the then outstanding interim credit
    facility;

partly offset by

•

the 2009 proceeds, net of issuance costs, from issuing senior
    notes of $778 million to finance debt repayments.

2009 compared to

Net cash used in financing activities was $516 million in
    2009 compared with an inflow of $808 million in 2008.

In March 2009, we issued $500 million of senior unsecured
    notes due 2016 at 12.875%.

We used the $482 million net proceeds of the notes,
    together with $208 million cash generated from operating
    activities and $60 million cash in hand, to

pay down the $750 million outstanding on our interim credit
    facility as of December 31, 2008.

In September 2009, we issued $300 million of
    7.0% senior notes due 2019. We then launched a tender offer
    on September 22, 2009 to repurchase any and all of our
    $250 million 5.125% senior notes due July 2010 at a
    premium of $27.50 per $1,000 face value. Notes totaling
    approximately $160 million were tendered and repurchased on
    September 29, 2009.



Business
    discussion

In December 2009, we applied the net cash proceeds of
    $155 million from the Gras Savoye transaction, together
    with other cash in hand, to reduce the balance outstanding on
    the 5-year term loan by approximately $180 million to

$521 million, of which $27 million related to our
    first mandatory debt repayment.

As of December 31, 2009, there were no amounts outstanding
    under our $300 million revolving credit facility (2008:
    $nil).

Share
    buybacks

We did not buyback any shares in 2010 or 2009. There remains
    $925 million under the current buyback authorization.

In 2008, we repurchased 2.3 million shares at a cost of
    $75 million.

In 2009, the Company filed a Tender Offer Statement with the SEC
    to repurchase for cash options to purchase Company shares. The
    tender offer expired on August 6, 2009. Approximately
    1.6 million options to purchase Company shares were
    repurchased at an average per share price of $2.04.

Dividends

Cash dividends paid in 2010 were $176 million compared with
    $174 million in 2009 and $146 million in 2008.

The $2 million increase in 2010, compared with 2009 is
    driven by the small increase in share count during the year.

The $28 million increase in 2009, compared with 2008,
    primarily reflects dividend payments on the 24 million
    additional shares issued in connection with the fourth quarter
    2008 acquisition of HRH.

In February 2011, we declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.26
    per share, an annual rate of $1.04 per share.

Willis
    Group Holdings plc

Debt obligations
    and facilities

The Company’s debt and related interest obligations at
    December 31, 2010 are shown in the above table.

During 2010, the Company entered into a new revolving credit
    facility agreement under which a further $200 million is
    available and a new UK facility under which a further
    $20 million is available. As at December 31, 2010 no
    drawings had been made on either facility.

These facilities are in addition to the remaining availability
    of $210 million (2009: $300 million)

under the Company’s previously existing $300 million
    revolving credit facility.

The only mandatory repayment of debt over the next
    12 months is the scheduled repayment of $110 million
    current portion of the Company’s

5-year

term
    loan. We also have the right, at our option, to prepay
    indebtedness under the credit facility without further penalty
    and to redeem the senior notes at our option by paying a
    ‘make whole’ premium as provided under the applicable
    debt instrument.

Operating
    leases

The Company leases certain land, buildings and equipment under
    various operating lease arrangements. Original non-cancellable
    lease terms typically are between 10 and 20 years and may
    contain escalation clauses, along with options that permit early
    withdrawal. The total amount of the minimum rent is expensed on
    a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.

As of December 31, 2010, the aggregate future minimum
    rental commitments under all non-cancellable operating lease
    agreements are as follows:

The Company leases its London headquarters building under a

25-year

operating lease, which expires in 2032. The Company’s
    contractual obligations in relation to this commitment included
    in the table above total $744 million (2009:
    $785 million). Annual rentals are $31 million per year
    and the Company has subleased approximately 25 percent of
    the premises under leases up to 15 years. The amounts
    receivable from subleases, included in the table above, total
    $87 million (2009: $100 million; 2008:
    $106 million).

Rent expense amounted to $131 million for the year ended
    December 31, 2010 (2009: $154 million; 2008:
    $151 million). The Company’s rental income from
    subleases was $22 million for the year ended
    December 31, 2010 (2009: $21 million; 2008:
    $22 million).

Pensions

Contractual obligations for our pension plans reflect the
    contributions we expect to make over the next five years into
    our US and UK plans. These contributions are based on current
    funding positions and may increase or decrease dependent on the
    future performance of the two plans.

In the UK, we are required to agree a funding strategy for our
    UK defined benefit plan with the

plan’s trustees. In February 2009, we agreed to make full
    year contributions to the UK plan of $39 million for 2009
    through 2012, excluding amounts in respect of the salary
    sacrifice scheme. In addition, if certain funding targets were
    not met at the beginning of any of the following years, 2010
    through 2012, a further contribution of $39 million would
    be required for that year. In 2010, the



Business
    discussion

additional funding requirement was triggered and we expect to
    make a similar additional contribution in 2011.  A similar,
    additional contribution may also be required for 2012, depending
    on actual performance against funding targets at the beginning
    of 2012.

The total contributions for all plans are currently estimated to
    be approximately $125 million in 2011, including amounts in
    respect of the salary sacrifice scheme.

Guarantees

Guarantees issued by certain of Willis Group Holdings’
    subsidiaries with respect to the senior notes and revolving
    credit facilities are discussed in Note 18 — Debt
    in these consolidated financial statements.

Certain of Willis Group Holdings’ subsidiaries have given
    the landlords of some leasehold properties occupied by the
    Company in the United Kingdom and the United States guarantees
    in respect of the performance of the lease obligations of the
    subsidiary holding the lease. The operating lease

obligations subject to such guarantees amounted to
    $855 million and $903 million at December 31,
    2010 and 2009, respectively.

In addition, the Company has given guarantees to bankers and
    other third parties relating principally to letters of credit
    amounting to $11 million and $5 million at
    December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Willis Group
    Holdings also guarantees certain of its UK and Irish
    subsidiaries’ obligations to fund the UK and Irish defined
    benefit pension plans.

Other contractual
    obligations

For certain subsidiaries and associates, the Company has the
    right to purchase shares (a call option) from co-shareholders at
    various dates in the future. In addition, the co-shareholders of
    certain subsidiaries and associates have the right to sell (a
    put option) their shares to the Company at various dates in the
    future. Generally, the exercise price of such put options and
    call options is formula-based (using revenues and earnings) and
    is designed to reflect fair value. Based on current projections
    of profitability and exchange rates, the potential amount
    payable from these options is not expected to exceed
    $40 million (2009: $49 million).

In December 2009, the Company made a capital commitment of
    $25 million to Trident V, LP, an investment fund
    managed by Stone Point Capital. In July 2010, we withdrew from
    Trident V, LP and subscribed to Trident V Parallel Fund, LP
    (with the total capital commitment remaining the same). As at
    December 31, 2010 there had been approximately
    $1 million of capital contributions.

Other contractual obligations at December 31, 2010 also
    include the capital lease on the Company’s Nashville
    property of $63 million, payable from 2012 onwards.

OFF BALANCE SHEET
    TRANSACTIONS

Apart from commitments, guarantees and contingencies, as
    disclosed in Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial
    Statements, the Company has no off-balance sheet arrangements
    that have, or

are reasonably likely to have, a material effect on the
    Company’s financial condition, results of operations or
    liquidity.

Item 7A —
    Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market
    Risk

Financial Risk
    Management

We are exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency
    exchange rates and interest rates. In order to manage the risk
    arising from these exposures, we enter into a variety of
    interest rate and foreign currency derivatives. We do not hold
    financial or derivative instruments for trading purposes.

A discussion of our accounting policies for financial and
    derivative instruments is included in Note 2 —
    Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies of
    Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, and further
    disclosure is provided in Note 24 — Derivative
    Financial Instruments and Hedging Activities.

Foreign exchange
    risk management

Because of the large number of countries and currencies we
    operate in, movements in currency exchange rates may affect our
    results.

We report our operating results and financial condition in US
    dollars. Our US operations earn revenue and incur expenses
    primarily in US dollars. Outside the United States, we
    predominantly generate revenues and expenses in the local
    currency with the exception of our London market operations
    which earns revenues in several currencies but incurs expenses
    predominantly in pounds sterling.

The table below gives an approximate analysis of revenues and
    expenses by currency in 2010.

Our principal exposures to foreign exchange risk arise from:

•

our London market operations; and

•

translation.

London market
    operations

In our London market operations, we earn revenue in a number of
    different currencies, principally US dollars, pounds sterling,
    euros and Japanese yen, but incur expenses almost entirely in
    pounds sterling.

We hedge this risk as follows:

•

to the extent that forecast pound sterling expenses exceed pound
    sterling revenues, we limit our exposure to this exchange rate
    risk by the use of forward contracts matched to specific,
    clearly identified cash outflows arising in the ordinary course
    of business; and

•

to the extent our London market operations earn significant
    revenues in euros and Japanese yen, we limit our exposure to
    changes in the exchange rate between the US dollar and these
    currencies by the use of forward contracts matched to a
    percentage of forecast cash inflows in specific currencies and
    periods.

Generally, it is our policy to hedge at least 25 percent of
    the next 12 months’ exposure in significant
    currencies. We do not hedge exposures beyond three years.

In addition, we are also exposed to foreign exchange risk on any
    net sterling asset or liability position in our London market
    operations. Where this risk relates to short-term cash flows, we
    hedge all or part of the risk by forward purchases or sales.

However, where the foreign exchange risk relates to any sterling
    pension assets benefit or liability for pensions benefit, we do
    not hedge the risk. Consequently, if our London market
    operations have a significant pension asset or liability, we may
    be exposed to accounting gains and losses if the US dollar and
    pounds sterling exchange rate changes. We do, however, hedge the
    pounds sterling contributions into the pension plan.



Market
    risk

Translation
    risk

Outside our US and London market operations, we predominantly
    earn revenues and incur expenses in the local currency. When we
    translate the results and net assets of these operations into US
    dollars for reporting purposes, movements in exchange rates will
    affect reported results and net assets. For example, if the US
    dollar strengthens against the euro, the reported results of our
    Eurozone operations in US dollar terms will be lower.

We do not hedge translation risk.

The table below provides information about our foreign currency
    forward exchange contracts, which are sensitive to exchange rate
    risk. The table summarizes the US dollar equivalent amounts of
    each currency bought and sold forward and the weighted average
    contractual exchange rates. All forward exchange contracts
    mature within three years.

Represents the difference between
    the contract amount and the cash flow in US dollars which would
    have been receivable had the foreign currency forward exchange
    contracts been entered into on December 31, 2010 or 2009 at
    the forward exchange rates prevailing at that date.

Income earned within foreign subsidiaries outside of the UK is
    generally offset by expenses in the same local currency but the
    Company does have exposure to foreign exchange movements on the
    net income

of these entities. The Company does not hedge net income earned
    within foreign subsidiaries outside of the UK.

Interest rate
    risk management

Our operations are financed principally by $1,750 million
    fixed rate senior notes issued by subsidiaries and
    $411 million under a

5-year

term
    loan facility. Of the fixed rate senior notes,

$350 million are due 2015, $500 million are due 2016,
    $600 million are due 2017 and $300 million are due
    2019. The

5-year

term
    loan facility amortizes at the rate of $27 million per
    quarter. As of



Willis
    Group Holdings plc

December 31, 2010 we had access to, $520 million under
    revolving credit facilities of which $90 million has been
    drawn. The interest rate applicable to the bank borrowing is
    variable according to the period of each individual drawdown.

We are also subject to market risk from exposure to changes in
    interest rates based on our investing activities where our
    primary interest rate risk arises from changes in short-term
    interest rates in both US dollars and pounds sterling.

As a consequence of our insurance and reinsurance broking
    activities, there is a delay between the time we receive cash
    for premiums and claims and the time the cash needs to be paid.
    We earn interest on this float, which is included in our
    consolidated financial statements as investment income.

This float is regulated in terms of access and the instruments
    in which it may be invested, most of which are short-term in
    maturity. We manage the interest rate risk arising from this
    exposure primarily through the use of interest rate swaps. It is
    our policy that, for currencies with significant balances, a
    minimum of 25 percent of forecast income arising is hedged
    for each of the next three years.

During the year ended December 31, 2010, the Company
    entered into a series of interest rate swaps

for a total notional amount of $350 million to receive a
    fixed rate and pay a variable rate on a semi-annual basis, with
    a maturity date of July 15, 2015. The Company has
    designated and accounts for these instruments as fair value
    hedges against its $350 million 5.625% senior notes
    due 2015. The fair values of the interest rate swaps are
    included within other assets or other liabilities and the fair
    value of the hedged element of the senior notes is included
    within the principal amount of the debt.

The table below provides information about our derivative
    instruments and other financial instruments that are sensitive
    to changes in interest rates. For interest rate swaps, the table
    presents notional principal amounts and average interest rates
    analyzed by expected maturity dates. Notional principal amounts
    are used to calculate the contractual payments to be exchanged
    under the contracts. The duration of interest rate swaps varies
    between one and five years, with re-fixing periods of three to
    six months. Average fixed and variable rates are, respectively,
    the weighted-average actual and market rates for the interest
    hedges in place. Market rates are the rates prevailing at
    December 31, 2010 or 2009, as appropriate.

REPORT OF
    INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Willis Group
    Holdings Public Limited Company

Dublin, Ireland

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
    Willis Group Holdings Public Limited Company and subsidiaries
    (the ‘Company’) as of December 31, 2010 and 2009,
    and the related consolidated statements of operations, changes
    in equity and comprehensive income, and cash flows for each of
    the three years in the period ended December 31, 2010.
    These financial statements are the responsibility of the
    Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an
    opinion on the financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
    free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
    test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
    the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the
    accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
    management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
    statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
    reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present
    fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of
    Willis Group Holdings Public Limited Company and subsidiaries as
    of December 31, 2010 and 2009, and the results of their
    operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in
    the period ended December 31, 2010, in conformity with
    accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
    America.

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
    Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of
    December 31, 2010, based on the criteria established in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework

issued
    by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
    Commission and our report dated February 25, 2011 expressed
    an unqualified opinion on the Company’s internal control
    over financial reporting.

Willis
    Group Holdings plc

1.

NATURE OF
    OPERATIONS

Willis Group Holdings plc (‘Willis Group Holdings’)
    and subsidiaries (collectively, the ‘Company’ or the
    ‘Group’) provide a broad range of insurance and
    reinsurance broking and risk management consulting services to
    its clients worldwide, both directly and indirectly through its
    associates. The Company provides both specialized risk
    management advisory and consulting services on a global basis to
    clients engaged in specific industrial and commercial
    activities, and services to small, medium and major corporates
    through its retail operations.

In its capacity as an advisor and insurance broker, the Company
    acts as an intermediary between clients and insurance carriers
    by advising clients on risk management requirements, helping
    clients determine the best means of managing risk, and
    negotiating and placing insurance risk with insurance carriers
    through the Company’s global distribution network.

2.

BASIS OF
    PRESENTATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Redomicile to
    Ireland

On September 24, 2009, Willis Group Holdings was
    incorporated in Ireland, in order to effectuate the change of
    the place of incorporation of the parent company of the Group.
    Willis Group Holdings operated as a wholly-owned subsidiary of
    Willis-Bermuda until December 31, 2009, when the
    outstanding common shares of Willis-Bermuda were canceled and
    Willis Group Holdings issued ordinary shares with substantially
    the same rights and preferences on a

one-for-one

basis to the holders of the Willis-Bermuda common shares that
    were canceled. Upon completion of this transaction, Willis Group
    Holdings replaced Willis-Bermuda as the ultimate parent company
    and Willis-Bermuda became a wholly-owned subsidiary of Willis
    Group Holdings. On July 29, 2010 Willis-Bermuda was
    liquidated.

This transaction was accounted for as a merger between entities
    under common control; accordingly, the historical financial
    statements of Willis-Bermuda for periods prior to this
    transaction are considered to be the historical financial
    statements of Willis Group Holdings. No changes in capital
    structure, assets or liabilities resulted from this transaction,
    other than Willis Group Holdings has provided a guarantee of
    amounts due under certain borrowing arrangements of one of its
    subsidiaries as described in Note 28.

Balance sheet
    presentation

Further to the Company’s redomiciliation to Ireland at the
    end of 2009, the Group is required to file consolidated
    financial statements for fiscal year 2010 with the Irish
    regulator. These consolidated financial statements are prepared
    under US GAAP and also incorporate additional Irish Companies
    Act disclosures. To facilitate this process, the Group has
    decided to incorporate these requirements within its US filings
    and consequently has recast the presentation of its 2010 and
    2009 consolidated balance sheets. In addition, the company has
    taken the opportunity to provide additional disclosure within
    the consolidated balance sheet of the Group’s non-fiduciary
    balances and the further distinction between those assets and
    liabilities that are expected to be realized within or later
    than twelve months of the balance sheet date. The Company
    believes this amended presentation better reflects the
    Company’s liquidity position and exposures to credit risk.

The 2009 and 2008 consolidated statements of cash flows have
    been recast to conform with the new balance sheet presentation.

Significant
    Accounting Policies

These consolidated financial statements conform to accounting
    principles generally accepted in the United States of America
    (‘US GAAP’). Presented below are summaries of
    significant accounting policies followed in the preparation of
    the consolidated financial statements.



Notes
    to the financial statements

2.

BASIS OF
    PRESENTATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
    (Continued)

Principles of
    Consolidation

The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the
    accounts of Willis Group Holdings and its subsidiaries, which
    are controlled through the ownership of a majority voting
    interest. Intercompany balances and transactions have been
    eliminated on consolidation.

Foreign
    Currency Translation

Transactions in currencies other than the functional currency of
    the entity are recorded at the rates of exchange prevailing at
    the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities in
    currencies other than the functional currency are translated at
    the rates of exchange prevailing at the balance sheet date and
    the related transaction gains and losses are reported in the
    statements of operations. Certain intercompany loans are
    determined to be of a long-term investment nature. The Company
    records transaction gains and losses from remeasuring such loans
    as a component of other comprehensive income.

Upon consolidation, the results of operations of subsidiaries
    and associates whose functional currency is other than the US
    dollar are translated into US dollars at the average exchange
    rate and assets and liabilities are translated at year-end
    exchange rates. Translation adjustments are presented as a
    separate component of other comprehensive income in the
    financial statements and are included in net income only upon
    sale or liquidation of the underlying foreign subsidiary or
    associated company.

Use of
    Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with US
    GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
    affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
    disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities as of the dates
    of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues
    and expenses during the year. In the preparation of these
    consolidated financial statements, estimates and assumptions
    have been made by management concerning: the valuation of
    intangible assets and goodwill (including those acquired through
    business combinations); the selection of useful lives of fixed

Cash and Cash
    Equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents primarily consist of time deposits
    with original maturities of three months or less.

Fiduciary
    Assets and Fiduciary Liabilities

In its capacity as an insurance agent or broker, the Company
    collects premiums from insureds and, after deducting its
    commissions, remits the premiums to the respective insurers; the
    Company also collects claims or refunds from insurers on behalf
    of insureds.

Fiduciary
    Assets

Effective December 31, 2010, the Company changed the
    presentation of its fiduciary balances. Uncollected premiums
    from insureds and uncollected claims or refunds from insurers,
    previously held within accounts receivable, are now recorded as
    fiduciary assets on the Company’s consolidated balance
    sheets. Unremitted insurance premiums and claims
    (‘fiduciary funds’) are also recorded within fiduciary
    assets.

    (Continued)

Fiduciary
    Liabilities

The obligations to remit these funds to insurers or insureds are
    recorded as fiduciary liabilities on the Company’s
    consolidated balance sheets. The period for which the Company
    holds such funds is dependent upon the date the insured remits
    the payment of the premium to the Company and the date the
    Company is required to forward such payment to the insurer.
    Balances arising from insurance brokerage transactions are
    reported as separate assets or liabilities unless such balances
    are due to or from the same party and a right of offset exists,
    in which case the balances are recorded net.

Fiduciary
    Funds

Fiduciary funds represent unremitted premiums received from
    insureds and unremitted claims received from insurers. Fiduciary
    funds are generally required to be kept in certain regulated
    bank accounts subject to guidelines which emphasize capital
    preservation and liquidity; such funds are not available to
    service the Company’s debt or for other corporate purposes.
    Notwithstanding the legal relationships with clients and
    insurers, the Company is entitled to retain investment income
    earned on fiduciary funds in accordance with industry custom and
    practice and, in some cases, as supported by agreements with
    insureds.

Included in fiduciary funds are cash and cash equivalents
    consisting primarily of time deposits. The debt securities are
    classified as

available-for-sale.

Accordingly, they are recorded at fair market value with
    unrealized holding gains and losses reported, net of tax, as a
    component of other comprehensive income.

In certain instances, the Company advances premiums, refunds or
    claims to insurance underwriters or insureds prior to
    collection. Such advances are made from fiduciary funds and are
    reflected in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as
    fiduciary assets.

Accounts
    Receivable

Accounts receivable are stated at estimated net realizable
    values. Allowances are recorded, when necessary, in an amount
    considered by management to be sufficient to meet probable
    future losses related to uncollectible accounts.

Fixed
    Assets

Fixed assets are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation.
    Expenditures for improvements are capitalized; repairs and
    maintenance are charged to expenses as incurred. Depreciation is
    computed using the straight-line method based on the estimated
    useful lives of assets.

Depreciation on buildings and long leaseholds is calculated over
    the lesser of 50 years or the lease term. Depreciation on
    leasehold improvements is calculated over the lesser of the
    useful life of the assets or the remaining lease term.
    Depreciation on furniture and equipment is calculated based on a
    range of 3 to 10 years.

Recoverability
    of Fixed Assets

Long-lived assets are tested for recoverability whenever events
    or changes in circumstance indicate that their carrying amounts
    may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognized if the
    carrying amount of a long-lived asset is not recoverable and
    exceeds its fair value. Recoverability is determined based on
    the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and
    eventual disposition of the asset or asset group. Long-lived
    assets and certain identifiable intangible assets to be disposed
    of are reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value
    less cost to sell.

Operating
    Leases

Rentals payable on operating leases are charged straight line to
    expenses over the lease term as the rentals become payable.

Goodwill and
    Other Intangible Assets

Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of businesses
    acquired over the fair market value of identifiable net assets
    at the dates of acquisition. The Company reviews goodwill for
    impairment annually and whenever facts or circumstances indicate
    that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable. In testing for
    impairment, the fair value of each reporting unit is compared
    with its carrying value, including goodwill. If the carrying
    amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the amount of
    an impairment loss, if any, is calculated by comparing the
    implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill with the carrying
    amount of that goodwill.

Acquired intangible assets are amortized over the following
    periods:

Expected

Acquired intangible assets

Amortizable intangible assets are reviewed for impairment
    whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their
    carrying amounts may not be recoverable.

Investments in
    Associates

Investments are accounted for using the equity method of
    accounting if the Company has the ability to exercise
    significant influence, but not control, over the investee.
    Significant influence is generally deemed to exist if the
    Company has an equity ownership in the voting stock of the
    investee between 20 and 50 percent, although other factors,
    such as representation on the Board of Directors and the impact
    of commercial arrangements, are considered in determining
    whether the equity method of accounting is appropriate. Under
    the equity method of accounting the investment is carried at
    cost of acquisition, plus the Company’s equity in
    undistributed net income since acquisition, less any dividends
    received since acquisition.

The Company periodically reviews its investments in associates
    for which fair value is less than cost to determine if the
    decline in value is other than temporary. If the decline in
    value is judged to be other than temporary, the cost basis of
    the investment is written down to fair value. The amount of any
    write-down is included in the statements of operations as a
    realized loss.

All other equity investments where the Company does not have the
    ability to exercise significant influence are accounted for by
    the cost method. Such investments are not publicly traded.

Derivative
    Financial Instruments

The Company uses derivative financial instruments for other than
    trading purposes to alter the risk profile of an existing
    underlying exposure. Interest rate swaps are used to manage
    interest risk exposures. Forward foreign currency exchange
    contracts are used to manage currency exposures arising from
    future income and expenses. The fair values of derivative
    contracts are recorded in other assets and other liabilities.
    The effective portions of changes in the fair value of
    derivatives that qualify for hedge accounting as cash flow
    hedges are recorded in other comprehensive income. Amounts are
    reclassified from other comprehensive income into earnings when
    the hedged exposure affects earnings. If the derivative is
    designated as and qualifies as an



Willis
    Group Holdings plc

2.

BASIS OF
    PRESENTATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
    (Continued)

effective fair value hedge, the changes in the fair value of the
    derivative and of the hedged item attributable to the hedged
    risk are recognized in earnings. Changes in fair value of
    derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting, together
    with any hedge ineffectiveness on those that do qualify, are
    recorded in other operating expenses or interest expense as
    appropriate.

Income
    Taxes

The Company recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for
    the estimated future tax consequences of events attributable to
    differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of
    existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases
    and operating and capital loss and tax credit carry forwards.
    Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted
    rates in effect for the year in which the differences are
    expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax
    assets and liabilities of changes in tax rates is recognized in
    the statement of operations in the period in which the enactment
    date changes. Deferred tax assets are reduced through the
    establishment of a valuation allowance at such time as, based on
    available evidence, it is more likely than not that the deferred
    tax assets will not be realized. The Company adjusts valuation
    allowances to measure deferred tax assets at the amount
    considered realizable in future periods if the Company’s
    facts and assumptions change. In making such determination, the
    Company considers all available positive and negative evidence,
    including future reversals of existing taxable temporary
    differences, projected future taxable income, tax planning
    strategies and recent financial operations.

Positions taken in the Company’s tax returns may be subject
    to challenge by the taxing authorities upon examination. The
    Company recognizes the benefit of uncertain tax positions in the
    financial statements when it is more likely than not that the
    position will be sustained on examination by the tax authorities
    upon lapse of the relevant statute of limitations, or when
    positions are effectively settled. The benefit recognized is the
    largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than
    50 percent likely to be realized on settlement with the tax
    authorities, assuming full knowledge of the position and all
    relevant facts. The Company adjusts its recognition of these
    uncertain tax benefits in the period in which new information is
    available impacting either the recognition or measurement of its
    uncertain tax positions. These differences will be reflected as
    increases or decreases to income tax expense in the period in
    which they are determined.

Changes in tax laws and rates could also affect recorded
    deferred tax assets and liabilities in the future. Management is
    not aware of any such changes that would have a material effect
    on the Company’s results of operations, cash flows or
    financial position.

The Company recognizes interest and penalties relating to
    unrecognized tax benefits within income taxes.

Provisions for
    Liabilities

The Company is subject to various actual and potential claims,
    lawsuits and other proceedings. The Company records liabilities
    for such contingencies including legal costs when it is probable
    that a liability has been incurred before the balance sheet date
    and the amount can be reasonably estimated. To the extent such
    losses can be recovered under the Company’s insurance
    programs, estimated recoveries are recorded when losses for
    insured events are recognized and the recoveries are likely to
    be realized. Significant management judgment is required to
    estimate the amounts of such contingent liabilities and the
    related insurance recoveries. The Company analyzes its
    litigation exposure based on available information, including
    consultation with outside counsel handling the defense of these
    matters, to assess its potential liability. Contingent
    liabilities are not discounted.

Pensions

The Company has two principal defined benefit pension plans
    which cover the majority of employees in the United States and
    United Kingdom. Both these plans are now closed to new entrants.
    New entrants in the



Notes

BASIS OF

    (Continued)

United Kingdom are offered the opportunity to join a defined
    contribution plan and in the United States are offered the
    opportunity to join a 401(k) plan. In addition, there are
    smaller plans in certain other countries in which the Company
    operates. Elsewhere, pension benefits are typically provided
    through defined contribution plans.

Defined benefit
    plans

The net periodic cost of the Company’s defined benefit
    plans are measured on an actuarial basis using the projected
    unit credit method and several actuarial assumptions. The most
    significant of which are the discount rate and the expected
    long-term rate of return on plan assets. Other material
    assumptions include rates of participant mortality, the expected
    long-term rate of compensation and pension increases and rates
    of employee termination. Gains and losses occur when actual
    experience differs from actuarial assumptions. If such gains or
    losses exceed ten percent of the greater of plan assets or plan
    liabilities the Company amortizes those gains or losses over the
    average remaining service period of the employees.

In accordance with US GAAP the Company records on the balance
    sheet the funded status of its pension plans based on the
    projected benefit obligation.

Defined
    contribution plans

Contributions to the Company’s defined contribution plans
    are recognized as they fall due. Differences between
    contributions payable in the year and contributions actually
    paid are shown as either other assets or other liabilities in
    the consolidated balance sheets.

Share-Based
    Compensation

The Company accounts for share-based compensation as follows:

•

the cost resulting from all equity awards is recognized in the
    financial statements at fair value estimated at the grant date;

•

the fair value is recognized (generally as compensation cost)
    over the requisite service period for all awards that
    vest; and

•

compensation cost is not recognized for awards that do not vest
    because service or performance conditions are not satisfied.

Revenue
    Recognition

Revenue includes insurance commissions, fees for services
    rendered, certain commissions receivable from insurance
    carriers, investment income and other income.

Brokerage income and fees negotiated instead of brokerage are
    recognized at the later of policy inception date or when the
    policy placement is complete. Commissions on additional premiums
    and adjustments are recognized as and when advised.

Fees for risk management and other services are recognized as
    the services are provided. Negotiated fee arrangements for an
    agreed period covering multiple insurance placements, the
    provision of risk management

and/or

other
    services are determined, contract by contract, on the basis of
    the relative fair value of the services completed and the
    services yet to be rendered. The Company establishes contract
    cancellation reserves where appropriate: at December 31,
    2010, 2009 and 2008, such amounts were not material.

Investment income is recognized as earned.

    Group Holdings plc

BASIS OF
    PRESENTATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
    (Continued)

Other income comprises gains on disposal of intangible assets,
    which primarily arise on the disposal of books of business.
    Although the Company is not in the business of selling
    intangible assets (mainly books of business), from time to time
    the Company will dispose of a book of business (a customer list)
    or other intangible assets that do not produce adequate margins
    or fit with the Company’s strategy.

    450 positions; 2008: 100 positions) that have been, or are in
    the process of being, eliminated as part of the Company’s
    continuing focus on managing expense. Severance costs for these
    employees were recognized pursuant to the terms of their
    existing benefit arrangements or employment agreements.

Cash Retention
    Awards

The Company makes annual cash retention awards to its employees.
    Employees must repay a proportionate amount of these awards if
    they voluntarily leave the Company’s employ (other than in
    the event of retirement or permanent disability) before a
    certain time period, currently up to three years. The Company
    makes cash payments to its employees in the year it grants these
    retention awards and recognizes these payments ratably over the
    period they are subject to repayment, beginning in the quarter
    in which the award is made. The unamortized portion of cash
    retention awards is recorded within other assets.

SHARE-BASED
    COMPENSATION

On December 31, 2010, the Company had a number of open
    share-based compensation plans, which provide for the grant of
    time-based and performance-based options, restricted stock units
    and various other share-based grants to employees. All of the
    Company’s share-based compensation plans under which any
    options, restricted stock units or other share-based grants are
    outstanding as at December 31, 2010 are described below.
    The compensation cost that has been charged against income for
    those plans for the year ended December 31, 2010 was
    $47 million (2009: $39 million; 2008:
    $40 million). The total income tax benefit recognized in
    the statement of operations for share-based compensation
    arrangements for the year ended December 31, 2010 was
    $14 million (2009: $12 million; 2008:
    $12 million).

2001 Share
    Purchase and Option Plan

This plan, which was established on May 3, 2001, provides
    for the granting of time-based options, restricted stock units
    and various other share-based grants at fair market value to
    employees of the Company. There are 25,000,000 shares
    available for grant under this plan. Options are exercisable on
    a variety of dates, including from the first, second, third,
    sixth or eighth anniversary of grant, although for certain
    options the exercisable date may accelerate depending on the
    achievement of certain performance goals. The Board of Directors
    has adopted several

sub-plans

under the 2001 plan to provide employee sharesave schemes in the
    UK, Ireland and internationally. Unless terminated sooner by the
    Board of Directors, the 2001 Plan (and all

sub-plans)

will expire 10 years after the date of its adoption. That
    termination will not affect the validity of any grant
    outstanding at that date.

2008 Share
    Purchase and Option Plan

This plan, which was established on April 23, 2008,
    provides for the granting of time and performance-based options,
    restricted stock units and various other share-based grants at
    fair market value to employees of the Company. There are
    8,000,000 shares available for grant under this plan.
    Options are exercisable on a variety of dates, including from
    the third, fourth or fifth anniversary of grant. Unless
    terminated sooner by the Board of Directors, the 2008 Plan will
    expire 10 years after the date of its adoption. That
    termination will not affect the validity of any grant
    outstanding at that date.

HRH Option
    Plans

Options granted under the Hilb Rogal and Hamilton Company 2000
    Stock Incentive Plan (‘HRH 2000 Plan’) and the Hilb
    Rogal & Hobbs Company 2007 Stock Incentive Plan (the
    ‘HRH 2007 Plan’) were converted into options to
    acquire shares of Willis Group Holdings. No further grants are
    to be made under the HRH 2000 Plan. Willis is authorized to
    grant equity awards under the HRH 2007 Plan until 2017 to
    employees who were formerly employed by HRH and to new employees
    who have joined Willis or one of its subsidiaries since
    October 1, 2008, the date that the acquisition of HRH was
    completed.

The Company has adopted the Willis Group Holdings 2001 North
    America Employee Share Purchase Plan, expiring May 31, 2011
    and the Willis Group Holdings 2010 North America Employee Stock
    Purchase Plan. They provide certain eligible employees to the
    Company’s subsidiaries in the US and Canada the ability to
    contribute payroll deductions to the purchase of Willis Shares
    at the end of each offering period.

The Company may also issue 245,000 Shares to directors upon
    exercise of options.

Option
    Valuation Assumptions

The fair value of each option is estimated on the date of grant
    using the Black-Scholes option pricing model that uses the
    assumptions noted in the following table. Expected volatility is
    based on historical volatility of the Company’s stock. With
    effect from January 1, 2006, the Company uses the
    simplified method set out in Accounting Standard Codification
    (‘ASC’)

718-10-S99

to derive the expected term of options granted. The risk-free
    rate for periods within the expected life of the option is based
    on the US Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant.

NET (LOSS) GAIN
    ON DISPOSAL OF OPERATIONS

Total proceeds for 2010 were $4 million, comprising
    $2 million relating to 2010 disposals of operations and
    $2 million of deferred proceeds relating to prior year. A
    loss on disposal of $2 million is recorded in the
    consolidated statements of operations for the year ended
    December 31, 2010.

NET (LOSS) GAIN
    ON DISPOSAL OF OPERATIONS (Continued)

Total proceeds from the disposal of operations for 2009 were
    $315 million, including $281 million for
    18 percent of the Group’s 49 percent interest in
    Gras Savoye and $39 million for 100 percent of
    Bliss & Glennon. A gain on disposal of
    $13 million is recorded in the statement of consolidated
    operations for the year ended December 31, 2009, of which
    $10 million relates to Gras Savoye as shown below.

On December 17, 2009, the Company completed a leveraged
    transaction with the original family shareholders of Gras Savoye
    and Astorg Partners, a private equity fund, to reorganize the
    capital of Gras Savoye (‘December 2009 leveraged
    transaction’), its principal investment in associates. The
    Company, the family shareholders and Astorg now own equal stakes
    of 31 percent in Gras Savoye and have equal representation
    of one third of the voting rights on its board. The remaining
    shareholding is held by a large pool of Gras Savoye managers and
    minority shareholders.

As a result of the December 2009 leveraged transaction the
    Company recognized a gain of $10 million in the
    consolidated statement of operations from the reduction of its
    interest in Gras Savoye from 49 percent to 31 percent.
    The Company received total proceeds of $281 million,
    comprising cash and interest bearing vendor loans and
    convertible bonds issued by Gras Savoye. An analysis of the
    proceeds and the calculation of the gain is as follows:

At December 31, 2010, the Company had valuation allowances
    of $87 million (2009: $92 million) to reduce its
    deferred tax assets to estimated realizable value. The valuation
    allowances at December 31, 2010 relate to the deferred tax
    assets arising from UK capital loss carryforwards
    ($49 million) and other net operating losses
    ($1 million), which have no expiration date and to the
    deferred tax assets arising from US State net operating losses
    ($37 million). Capital loss carryforwards can only be
    offset against future UK capital gains.

At December 31, 2010, the Company had deferred tax assets
    of $207 million (2009: $298 million), net of the
    valuation allowance. Management believes, based upon the level
    of historical taxable income and projections for future taxable
    income, it is more likely than not that the Company will realize
    the benefits of these deductible differences, net of the
    valuation allowance. However, the amount of the deferred tax
    asset considered realizable could be adjusted in the future if
    estimates of taxable income are revised.

The Company recognizes deferred tax balances related to the
    undistributed earnings of subsidiaries when the Company expects
    that it will recover those undistributed earnings in a taxable
    manner, such as through receipt of dividends or sale of the
    investments. The Company does not, however, provide for income
    taxes on the unremitted earnings of certain other subsidiaries
    where, in management’s opinion, such earnings have been
    indefinitely reinvested in those operations, or will be remitted
    either in a tax free liquidation or as dividends

with taxes substantially offset by foreign tax credits. It is
    not practical to determine the amount of unrecognized deferred
    tax liabilities for temporary differences related to these
    investments.

Unrecognized tax
    benefits

Total unrecognized tax benefits as at December 31, 2010,
    totaled $13 million. During the next 12 months it is
    reasonably possible that the Company will recognize
    approximately $1 million of tax benefits related to the
    release of provisions no longer required due to either
    settlement through negotiation or closure of the statute of
    limitations on assessment.

A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amounts of

All of the unrecognized tax benefits at December 31, 2010

The Company files tax returns in the various tax jurisdictions
    in which it operates. The 2006 US tax year closed in 2010 upon
    the expiration of the statute of limitations on assessment. US
    tax returns have been filed timely. The Company has received
    notice that the IRS will be examining the 2009 tax return. The
    Company has not extended the federal statute of limitations for
    assessment in the US.

All UK tax returns have been filed timely and are in the normal
    process of being reviewed, with HM Revenue & Customs
    making enquiries to obtain additional information. There are no
    material ongoing enquiries in relation to filed UK returns other
    than in relation to the quantification of foreign tax reliefs
    available on the remittance of foreign earnings.

EARNINGS PER
    SHARE

Basic and diluted earnings per share are calculated by dividing
    net income attributable to Willis Group Holdings by the average
    number of shares outstanding during each period. The computation
    of diluted earnings per share reflects the potential dilution
    that could occur if dilutive securities and other contracts to
    issue shares were exercised or converted into shares or resulted
    in the issue of shares that then shared in the net income of the
    Company.

For the year ended December 31, 2010, time-based and
    performance-based options to purchase 11.5 million and
    9.4 million (2009: 13.4 million and 8.9 million;
    2008: 16.9 million and 5.8 million) shares,
    respectively, and 1.8 million restricted stock units (2009:
    2.2 million; 2008: 1.4 million), respectively, were
    outstanding.

FIDUCIARY
    ASSETS

The Company collects premiums from insureds and, after deducting
    its commissions, remits the premiums to the respective insurers;
    the Company also collects claims or refunds from insurers on
    behalf of insureds. Uncollected premiums from insureds and
    uncollected claims or refunds from insurers (‘fiduciary
    receivables’) are recorded as fiduciary assets on the
    Company’s consolidated balance sheets. Unremitted insurance
    premiums and claims (‘fiduciary funds’) are also
    recorded within fiduciary assets.

Fiduciary assets therefore comprise both receivables and funds
    held in a fiduciary capacity.

Fiduciary funds, consisting primarily of time deposits with
    original maturities of less than or equal to three months, were
    $1,764 million as of December 31, 2010 (2009:
    $1,683 million). Accrued interest on funds is recorded as
    other assets.

Consolidation
    of fiduciary funds

The financial statements as at December 31, 2010 and 2009
    reflect the consolidation of one Variable Interest Entity
    (‘VIE’), a UK non-statutory trust that was established
    in January 2005 following the introduction of statutory
    regulation of insurance in the UK by the Financial Services
    Authority. The regulation requires that all fiduciary funds
    collected by an insurance broker such as the Company be paid
    into a non-statutory trust designed to give additional credit
    protection to the clients and insurance carriers of the Company.
    This trust restricts the financial instruments in which such
    funds may be invested and affects the timing of transferring
    commission from fiduciary funds to own funds.



Willis
    Group Holdings plc

9.

FIDUCIARY ASSETS
    (Continued)

As of December 31, 2010, the fair value of the fiduciary
    funds in the VIE was $976 million (2009: $903 million)
    and the fair value of the associated liabilities was
    $976 million (2009: $903 million). There are no assets
    of the Company that serve as collateral for the VIE.

GOODWILL

Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of businesses
    acquired over the fair market value of identifiable net assets
    at the dates of acquisition. Goodwill is not amortized but is
    subject to impairment testing annually and whenever facts or
    circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be
    recoverable.

The Company’s annual goodwill impairment tests for 2010 and
    prior years have not resulted in an impairment charge (2009:
    $nil; 2008: $nil).



Notes

GOODWILL

When a business entity is sold, goodwill is allocated to the

INVESTMENTS IN
    ASSOCIATES

The Company holds a number of investments which it accounts for
    using the equity method. The Company’s approximate interest
    in the outstanding stock of the more significant associates is
    as follows:

December 31,

Country



Al-Futtaim Willis Co. L.L.C.

Dubai


%


%

GS & Cie Groupe

France


%


%

The Company’s principal investment as of December 31,
    2010 and 2009 is GS & Cie Groupe (‘Gras
    Savoye’), France’s leading insurance broker.

The Company’s original investment in Gras Savoye was made
    in 1997, when it acquired a 33 percent ownership interest.
    Between 1997 and December 2009 this interest was increased by a
    series of incremental investments to 49 percent.

On December 17, 2009, the Company completed a leveraged
    transaction with the original family shareholders of Gras Savoye
    and Astorg Partners, a private equity fund, to reorganize the
    capital of Gras Savoye (‘December 2009 leveraged
    transaction’). The Company, the original family
    shareholders and Astorg now own equal stakes of 31 percent
    in Gras Savoye and have equal representation of one third of the
    voting rights on its board. The remaining shareholding is held
    by a large pool of Gras Savoye managers and minority
    shareholders.

A put option that was in place prior to the December 2009
    leveraged transaction, and which could have increased the
    Company’s interest to 90 percent, has been canceled
    and the Company now has a new call option to purchase
    100 percent of the capital of Gras Savoye. If the Company
    does not waive the new call option before April 30, 2014,
    then it must exercise the new call option in 2015 or the other
    shareholders may initiate procedures to sell Gras Savoye. Except
    with the unanimous consent of the supervisory board and other
    customary exceptions, the parties are prohibited from
    transferring any shares of Gras Savoye until 2015. At the end of
    this period, shareholders are entitled to pre-emptive and
    tag-along rights.

As a result of the December 2009 leveraged transaction the
    Company recognized a gain of $10 million in the
    consolidated statement of operations for the year ended
    December 31, 2009 from the reduction of its interest in
    Gras Savoye from 49 percent to 31 percent. The Company
    received total proceeds of $281 million, comprising cash
    and interest bearing vendor loans and convertible bonds issued
    by Gras Savoye. See Note 6 — Net (Loss) Gain on
    Disposal of Operations for an analysis of the proceeds and the
    calculation of the gain.

The carrying amount of the Gras Savoye investment as of
    December 31, 2010 includes goodwill of $88 million
    (2009: $94 million) and interest bearing vendor loans and
    convertible bonds issued by Gras Savoye of $44 million and
    $78 million respectively (2009: $46 million and
    $78 million, respectively).

PENSION
    PLANS

The Company maintains two principal defined benefit pension
    plans that cover the majority of our employees in the United
    States and United Kingdom. Both of these plans are now closed to
    new entrants. New entrants in the United Kingdom are offered the
    opportunity to join a defined contribution plan and in the
    United States are offered the opportunity to join a 401(k) plan.
    In addition to the Company’s UK and US defined benefit
    pension plans, the Company has several smaller defined benefit
    pension plans in certain other countries in

which it operates. Elsewhere, pension benefits are typically
    provided through defined contribution plans. It is the
    Company’s policy to fund pension costs as required by
    applicable laws and regulations.

Effective May 15, 2009, the Company closed the US defined
    benefit plan to future accrual. Consequently, a curtailment gain
    of $12 million was recognized during the year ended
    December 31, 2009.

At December 31, 2010, the Company recorded, on the
    Consolidated Balance Sheets:

•

a pension benefit asset of $179 million (2009:
    $69 million) in respect of the UK defined benefit pension
    plan; and

•

a total liability for pension benefits of $164 million
    (2009: $187 million) representing:

•

$154 million (2009: $157 million) in respect of the US
    defined benefit pension plan; and

•

$10 million (2009: $30 million) in respect of the
    International defined benefit pension plans.

    classes to achieve that goal. The UK plan’s assets are
    divided into 10 separate portfolios according to asset class and
    managed by 11 investment managers. The broad target allocations
    are UK and foreign equities (59 percent), debt securities
    (20 percent), hedge funds (16 percent) and real estate
    (5 percent). The US plan’s assets are currently
    invested in 17 funds representing most standard equity and debt
    security classes. The broad target allocations are US and

Fair Value
    Hierarchy

The fair value hierarchy has three levels based on the
    reliability of the inputs used to determine fair value:

•

Level 1: refers to fair values determined based on quoted
    market prices in active markets for identical assets;

•

Level 2: refers to fair values estimated using observable
    market based inputs or unobservable inputs that are corroborated
    by market data; and

•

Level 3: includes fair values estimated using unobservable
    inputs that are not corroborated by market data.

The following tables present, at December 31, 2010 and
    2009, for each of the fair value hierarchy levels, the
    Company’s UK pension plan assets that are measured at fair
    value on a recurring basis.

The UK plan’s real estate investment comprises UK property
    and infrastructure investments which are valued by the fund
    manager taking into account cost, independent appraisals and
    market based comparable data. The UK plan’s hedge fund
    investments are primarily invested in various ‘fund of
    funds’ and are valued based on net asset values calculated
    by the fund and are not publicly available. Liquidity is
    typically monthly and is subject to liquidity of the underlying
    funds.

2016-2020



Effective May 15, 2009, the Company closed the US defined
    benefit plan to future accrual. Consequently, a curtailment gain
    of $12 million was recognized during the year ended
    December 31, 2009.

Willis North America has a 401(k) plan covering all eligible
    employees of Willis North America and its subsidiaries. The plan
    allows participants to make pre-tax contributions which the
    Company, at its discretion may match. During 2009, the Company
    has decided not to make any matching contributions other than
    for former HRH employees whose contributions were matched up to
    75 percent under the terms of the acquisition. All
    investment assets of the plan are held in a trust account
    administered by independent trustees. The Company’s 401(k)
    matching contributions for 2010 were $nil million (2009:
    $5 million; 2008: $8 million).

International
    defined benefit pension plans

In addition to the Company’s UK and US defined benefit
    pension plans, the Company has several smaller defined benefit
    pension plans in certain other countries in which it operates.

A $10 million pension benefit liability (2009:
    $30 million) has been recognized in respect of these
    schemes.

    II Limited, TA III Limited and TA IV Limited entered
    member’s voluntary liquidation on December 31, 2010.

Debt
    issuance

During the year ended December 31, 2010, the Company
    entered into a series of interest rate swaps for a total
    notional amount of $350 million to receive a fixed rate and
    pay a variable rate on a semi-annual basis, with a maturity date
    of July 15, 2015. The Company has designated and accounts
    for these instruments as fair value hedges against its
    $350 million 5.625% senior notes due 2015. The fair
    values of the interest rate swaps are included within other
    assets or other liabilities and the fair value of the hedged
    element of the senior notes is included within long-term debt.

The

5-year

term loan facility bears interest at LIBOR plus 2.250% and is
    repayable at $27 million per quarter, with a final payment
    of $115 million due in the fourth quarter of 2013. Drawings
    under the revolving $300 million credit facility bear
    interest at LIBOR plus 2.250% and the facility expires on
    October 1, 2013. On August 9, 2010, Willis North
    America, Inc. agreed an additional revolving credit facility for
    $200 million. Drawings on this facility bear interest at
    LIBOR plus a margin of either 1.750% or 2.750% depending upon

the currency of the loan. This margin applies while the
    Company’s debt rating remains

BBB-/Baa3.

This facility expires on October 1, 2013. As at
    December 31, 2010 no drawings had been made on the facility.

On June 22, 2010, a further revolving credit facility of
    $20 million was put in place which bears interest at LIBOR
    plus 1.700% until 2012 and LIBOR plus 1.850% thereafter. The
    facility expires on December 22, 2012. As at
    December 31, 2010 no drawings had been made on the facility.

The $20 million revolving credit facility put in place on
    June 22, 2010 is solely for the use of our main UK
    regulated entity and would be available in certain exceptional
    circumstances. This facility is secured against the freehold of
    the UK regulated entity’s freehold property in Ipswich.

In March 2009, Trinity Acquisition plc issued
    12.875% senior notes due 2016 in an aggregate principal
    amount of $500 million to Goldman Sachs Mezzanine Partners
    which generated net proceeds of $482 million. These
    proceeds were used to refinance part of an interim credit
    facility.

In September 2009, Willis North America, Inc. issued
    $300 million of 7.000% senior notes due 2019. A tender
    offer was launched on September 22, 2009, to repurchase any
    and all of the $250 million 5.125% senior notes due
    July 2010 at a premium of $27.50 per $1,000 face value. Notes
    totaling approximately $160 million were tendered and
    repurchased.

The agreements relating to our 5-year term loan facility and the
    Willis North America, Inc. revolving credit facility contain
    requirements to maintain maximum levels of consolidated funded
    indebtedness in relation to consolidated EBITDA and minimum
    levels of consolidated EBITDA to consolidated fixed charges,
    subject to certain adjustments. In addition, the agreements
    relating to our credit facilities and senior notes include, in
    the aggregate, covenants relating to the delivery of financial
    statements, reports and notices, limitations on liens,
    limitations on sales and other disposals of assets, limitations
    on indebtedness and other liabilities, limitations on sale and
    leaseback transactions, limitations on mergers and other
    fundamental changes, maintenance of property, maintenance of
    insurance, nature of business, compliance with applicable laws,
    maintenance of corporate existence and rights, payment of taxes
    and access to information and properties. At December 31,
    2010, the Company was in compliance with all covenants.

Lines of
    credit

The Company also has available $2 million (2009:
    $7 million) in lines of credit, of which $nil was drawn as
    of December 31, 2010 (2009: $nil).

Debt
    obligations and facilities

The Company’s debt and related interest obligations at
    December 31, 2010 are shown in the above table.

During 2010, the Company entered into a new revolving credit
    facility agreement under which a further $200 million is
    available and a new UK facility under which a further
    $20 million is available. As at December 31, 2010 no
    drawings had been made on either facility.

These facilities are in addition to the remaining availability
    of $210 million (2009: $300 million) under the
    Company’s previously existing $300 million revolving
    credit facility.

The only mandatory repayment of debt over the next
    12 months is the scheduled repayment of $110 million
    current portion of the Company’s

5-year

term
    loan. We also have the right, at our option, to prepay
    indebtedness under the credit facility without further penalty
    and to redeem the senior notes at our option by paying a
    ‘make whole’ premium as provided under the applicable
    debt instrument.

Operating
    leases

The Company leases certain land, buildings and equipment under
    various operating lease arrangements. Original non-cancellable
    lease terms typically are between 10 and 20 years and may
    contain escalation clauses, along with options that permit early
    withdrawal. The total amount of the minimum rent is expensed on
    a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.

The Company leases its London headquarters building under a

operating lease, which expires in 2032. The Company’s
    contractual obligations in relation to this commitment included
    in the table above total $744 million (2009:
    $785 million). Annual rentals are $31 million per year
    and the Company has subleased approximately 25 percent of
    the premises under leases up to 15 years. The amounts
    receivable from subleases, included in the table above, total
    $87 million (2009: $100 million; 2008:
    $106 million).

Rent expense amounted to $131 million for the year ended
    December 31, 2010 (2009: $154 million; 2008:
    $151 million). The Company’s rental income from
    subleases was $22 million for the year ended
    December 31, 2010 (2009: $21 million; 2008:
    $22 million).

Pensions

Contractual obligations for our pension plans reflect the
    contributions we expect to make over the next five years into
    our US and UK plans. These contributions are based on current
    funding positions and may increase or decrease dependent on the
    future performance of the two plans.

In the UK, we are required to agree a funding strategy for our
    UK defined benefit plan with the plan’s trustees. In
    February 2009, we agreed to make full year contributions to the
    UK plan of $39 million for 2009 through 2012, excluding
    amounts in respect of the salary sacrifice scheme. In addition,
    if certain funding targets were not met at the beginning of any
    of the following years, 2010 through 2012, a further
    contribution of $39 million would be required for that
    year. In 2010, the additional funding requirement was triggered
    and we expect to make a similar additional contribution in
    2011.  A similar, additional contribution may also be required
    for 2012, depending on actual performance against funding
    targets at the beginning of 2012.

The total contributions for all plans are currently estimated to
    be approximately $125 million in 2011, including amounts in
    respect of the salary sacrifice scheme.

Guarantees

Guarantees issued by certain of Willis Group Holdings’
    subsidiaries with respect to the senior notes and revolving
    credit facilities are discussed in Note 18 — Debt
    in these consolidated financial statements.

Certain of Willis Group Holdings’ subsidiaries have given
    the landlords of some leasehold properties occupied by the
    Company in the United Kingdom and the United States guarantees
    in respect of the performance of the lease obligations of the
    subsidiary holding the lease. The operating lease obligations
    subject to such guarantees amounted to $855 million and
    $903 million at December 31, 2010 and 2009,
    respectively.



Notes
    to the financial statements

20.

COMMITMENTS AND
    CONTINGENCIES (Continued)

In addition, the Company has given guarantees to bankers and
    other third parties relating principally to letters of credit
    amounting to $11 million and $5 million at
    December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Willis Group
    Holdings also guarantees certain of its UK and Irish
    subsidiaries’ obligations to fund the UK and Irish defined
    benefit pension plans.

Other
    contractual obligations

For certain subsidiaries and associates, the Company has the
    right to purchase shares (a call option) from co-shareholders at
    various dates in the future. In addition, the co-shareholders of
    certain subsidiaries and associates have the right to sell (a
    put option) their shares to the Company at various dates in the
    future. Generally, the exercise price of such put options and
    call options is formula-based (using revenues and earnings) and
    is designed to reflect fair value. Based on current projections
    of profitability and exchange rates, the potential amount
    payable from these options is not expected to exceed
    $40 million (2009: $49 million).

In December 2009, the Company made a capital commitment of
    $25 million to Trident V, LP, an investment fund
    managed by Stone Point Capital. In July 2010, we withdrew from
    Trident V, LP and subscribed to Trident V Parallel Fund, LP
    (with the total capital commitment remaining the same). As at
    December 31, 2010 there had been approximately
    $1 million of capital contributions.

Other contractual obligations at December 31, 2010 also
    include the capital lease on the Company’s Nashville
    property of $63 million, payable from 2012 onwards.

Claims,
    Lawsuits and Other Proceedings

In the ordinary course of business, the Company is subject to
    various actual and potential claims, lawsuits, and other
    proceedings relating principally to alleged errors and omissions
    in connection with the placement of insurance and reinsurance.
    Similar to other corporations, the Company is also subject to a
    variety of other claims, including those relating to the
    Company’s employment practices. Some of the claims,
    lawsuits and other proceedings seek damages in amounts which
    could, if assessed, be significant.

Errors and omissions claims, lawsuits, and other proceedings
    arising in the ordinary course of business are covered in part
    by professional indemnity or other appropriate insurance. The
    terms of this insurance vary by policy year and self-insured
    risks have increased significantly in recent years. In respect
    of self-insured risks, the Company has established provisions
    which are believed to be adequate in the light of current
    information and legal advice, and the Company adjusts such
    provisions from time to time according to developments.

On the basis of current information, the Company does not expect
    that the actual claims, lawsuits and other proceedings, to which
    the Company is subject, or potential claims, lawsuits, and other
    proceedings relating to matters of which it is aware will
    ultimately have a material adverse effect on the Company’s
    financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.
    Nonetheless, given the large or indeterminate amounts sought in
    certain of these actions, and the inherent unpredictability of
    litigation and disputes with insurance companies, it is possible
    that an adverse outcome in certain matters could, from time to
    time, have a material adverse effect on the Company’s
    results of operations or cash flows in particular quarterly or
    annual periods.

The material actual or potential claims, lawsuits and other
    proceedings, of which the Company is currently aware, are:

Inquiries and
    Investigations

In connection with the investigation launched by the New York
    State Attorney General in April 2004 concerning, among other
    things, contingent commissions paid by insurers to insurance
    brokers, in April 2005, the Company entered into an Assurance of
    Discontinuance (‘Original AOD’) with the New York
    State Attorney General and the Superintendent of the New York
    Insurance Department and paid $50 million to



Willis
    Group Holdings plc

20.

COMMITMENTS AND
    CONTINGENCIES (Continued)

eligible clients. As part of the Original AOD, the Company also
    agreed not to accept contingent compensation and to disclose to
    customers any compensation the Company will receive in
    connection with providing policy placement services to the
    customer. The Company also resolved similar investigations
    launched by the Minnesota Attorney General, the Florida Attorney
    General, the Florida Department of Financial Services, and the
    Florida Office of Insurance Regulation for amounts that were not
    material to the Company.

Similarly, in August 2005 HRH entered into an agreement with the
    Attorney General of the State of Connecticut (the ‘CT
    Attorney General’) and the Insurance Commissioner of the
    State of Connecticut to resolve all issues related to their
    investigations into certain insurance brokerage and insurance
    agency practices and to settle a lawsuit brought in August 2005
    by the CT Attorney General alleging violations of the
    Connecticut Unfair Trade Practices Act and the Connecticut
    Unfair Insurance Practices Act. As part of this settlement, HRH
    agreed to take certain actions including establishing a
    $30 million national fund for distribution to certain
    clients; enhancing disclosure practices for agency and broker
    clients; and declining to accept contingent compensation on
    brokerage business. The Company has cooperated fully with other
    similar investigations by the regulators

and/or

attorneys general of other jurisdictions, some of which have
    been concluded with no indication of any finding of wrongdoing.

On February 16, 2010, the Company entered into the Amended
    and Restated Assurance of Discontinuance with the Attorney
    General of the State of New York and the Amended and Restated
    Stipulation with the Superintendent of Insurance of the State of
    New York (the ‘Amended and Restated AOD’) on behalf of
    itself and its subsidiaries named therein. The Amended and
    Restated AOD was effective February 11, 2010 and supersedes
    and replaces the Original AOD.

The Amended and Restated AOD specifically recognizes that the
    Company has substantially met its obligations under the Original
    AOD and ends many of the requirements previously imposed. It
    relieves the Company of a number of technical compliance
    obligations that have imposed significant administrative and
    financial burdens on its operations. The Amended and Restated
    AOD no longer limits the types of compensation the Company can
    receive and has lowered the compensation disclosure requirements.

The Amended and Restated AOD requires the Company
    to:  (i) in New York, and each of the other
    49 states of the United States, the District of Columbia
    and U.S. territories, provide compensation disclosure that
    will, at a minimum, comply with the terms of the applicable
    regulations, as may be amended from time to time, or the
    provisions of the AOD that existed prior to the adoption of the
    Amended and Restated AOD; and (ii) maintain its compliance
    programs and continue to provide appropriate training to
    relevant employees in business ethics, professional obligations,
    conflicts of interest, and antitrust and trade practices
    compliance. In addition, in placing, renewing, consulting on or
    servicing any insurance policy, it prohibits the Company from
    directly or indirectly (a) accepting from or requesting of
    any insurer any promise or commitment to use any of the
    Company’s brokerage, agency, producing or consulting
    services in exchange for production of business to such insurer
    or (b) knowingly place, renew or consult on or service a
    client’s insurance business through a wholesale broker in a
    manner that is contrary to the client’s best interest.

In 2006, the European Commission issued questionnaires pursuant
    to its Sector Inquiry or, in respect of Norway, the European
    Free Trade Association Surveillance Authority, related to
    insurance business practices, including compensation
    arrangements for brokers, to at least 150 European brokers
    including our operations in nine European countries. The Company
    filed responses to the European Commission and the European Free
    Trade Association Surveillance Authority questionnaires. The
    European Commission reported on a final basis on
    September 25, 2007, expressing concerns over potential
    conflicts of interest in the industry relating to remuneration
    and binding authorities and also over the nature of the
    coinsurance market. The Company co-operated with both the
    European Free Trade Association Surveillance Authority and the
    European Commission to resolve issues raised in its final report
    regarding coinsurance as required of the industry by the
    European Commission.



Notes
    to the financial statements

COMMITMENTS AND
    CONTINGENCIES (Continued)

Since August 2004, the Company and HRH (along with various other
    brokers and insurers) have been named as defendants in purported
    class actions in various courts across the United States. All of
    these actions have been consolidated into a single action in the
    US District Court for the District of New Jersey
    (‘MDL’). There are two amended complaints within the
    MDL, one that addresses employee benefits (‘EB
    Complaint’) and one that addresses all other lines of
    insurance (‘Commercial Complaint’). HRH was a named
    defendant in the EB Complaint, but has since been voluntarily
    dismissed. HRH is a named defendant in the Commercial Complaint.
    The Company is a named defendant in both MDL complaints. Each of
    the EB Complaint and the Commercial Complaint seeks monetary
    damages, including punitive damages, and equitable relief and
    makes allegations regarding the practices and conduct that have
    been the subject of the investigation of state attorneys general
    and insurance commissioners, including allegations that the
    brokers have breached their duties to their clients by entering
    into contingent compensation agreements with either no
    disclosure or limited disclosure to clients and participated in
    other improper activities. The complaints also allege the
    existence of a conspiracy among insurance carriers and brokers
    and allege violations of federal antitrust laws, the federal
    Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations
    (‘RICO’) statute and the Employee Retirement Income
    Security Act of 1974 (‘ERISA’). In separate decisions
    issued in August and September 2007, the antitrust and RICO Act
    claims were dismissed with prejudice and the state claims were
    dismissed without prejudice from the Commercial Complaint. In
    January 2008, the Judge dismissed the ERISA claims with
    prejudice from the EB Complaint and the state law claims without
    prejudice.

Plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal regarding the dismissal of
    the antitrust and RICO claims and oral arguments on this appeal
    were heard in April 2009. In August 2010, the United States
    Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit issued its decision on
    plaintiffs’ appeal. The Court upheld the dismissal of all
    claims against HRH and the Company, with the exception of one
    RICO related claim. The Court remanded the RICO claim to the
    District Court for further consideration. The District Judge is
    allowing HRH and the Company (and the other affected defendants)
    to submit new motions to dismiss the remanded RICO claim. The
    motion has been filed, but a decision is not expected until
    sometime in 2011. Additional actions could be brought in the
    future by individual policyholders. The Company disputes the
    allegations in all of these suits and has been and intends to
    continue to defend itself vigorously against these actions. The
    outcomes of these lawsuits, however, including any losses or
    other payments that may occur as a result, cannot be predicted
    at this time.

Reinsurance
    Market Dispute

Various legal proceedings are pending, have concluded or may
    commence between reinsurers, reinsureds and in some cases their
    intermediaries, including reinsurance brokers, relating to
    personal accident excess of loss reinsurance for the years 1993
    to 1998. The proceedings principally concern allegations by
    reinsurers that they have sustained substantial losses due to an
    alleged abnormal ‘spiral’ in the market in which the
    reinsurance contracts were placed, the existence and nature of
    which, as well as other information, was not disclosed to them
    by the reinsureds or their reinsurance broker.

A ‘spiral’ is a market term for a situation in which
    reinsureds and reinsurers reinsure each other with the effect
    that the same loss or portion of that loss moves through the
    market multiple times.

The reinsurers concerned have taken the position that, despite
    their decisions to underwrite risks or a group of risks, they
    are no longer bound by their reinsurance contracts. As a result,
    they have stopped settling claims and are seeking to recover
    claims already paid. The Company also understands that there
    have been arbitration awards in relation to a
    ‘spiral’, among other things, in which the reinsurer
    successfully argued that it was no longer bound by parts of its
    reinsurance program. Willis Limited, the Company’s
    principal insurance brokerage subsidiary in the United Kingdom,
    acted as the reinsurance broker or otherwise as intermediary,
    but not as an underwriter, for numerous personal accident
    reinsurance contracts. Due to the small number of reinsurance
    brokers generally, Willis Limited also utilized other brokers
    active in this market as

sub-agents,

including brokers who are parties to the legal proceedings
    described above, for certain contracts and may be

COMMITMENTS AND
    CONTINGENCIES (Continued)

responsible for any errors and omissions they may have made. In
    July 2003, one of the reinsurers received a judgment in the
    English High Court against certain parties, including a

sub-broker

Willis Limited used to place two of the contracts involved in
    this trial. Although neither the Company nor any of its
    subsidiaries were a party to this proceeding or any arbitration,
    Willis Limited entered into tolling agreements with certain of
    the principals to the reinsurance contracts tolling the statute
    of limitations pending the outcome of proceedings between the
    reinsureds and reinsurers.

Two former clients of Willis Limited, American Reliable
    Insurance Company and one of its associated companies
    (collectively, ‘ARIC’), and CNA Insurance Company
    Limited and two of its associated companies (‘CNA’)
    terminated their respective tolling agreements with Willis
    Limited and commenced litigation in September 2007 and January
    2008, respectively, in the English Commercial Court against
    Willis Limited. ARIC alleged conspiracy between a former Willis
    Limited employee and the ARIC underwriter as well as negligence
    and CNA alleged deceit and negligence by the same Willis Limited
    employee both in connection with placements of personal accident
    reinsurance in the excess of loss market in London and
    elsewhere. On June 9, 2009, Willis Limited entered into a
    settlement agreement under which Willis Limited paid a total of
    $139 million to ARIC, which was covered by errors and
    omissions insurance. On September 11, 2009, Willis Limited
    entered into a settlement agreement under which Willis Limited
    paid a total of $130 million to CNA. The Company has
    substantially collected and believes it will collect in full the
    $130 million required under the CNA settlement agreement
    from errors and omissions insurers. The settlements include no
    admission of wrongdoing by any party. Each party also realized
    and waived all claims it may have against any of the other
    parties arising out of or in connection with the subject matter
    of the litigation.

Various arbitrations relating to reinsurance continue and, from
    time to time, the principals request co-operation from the
    Company and suggest that claims may be asserted against the
    Company. Such claims may be made against the Company if
    reinsurers do not pay claims on policies issued by them. The
    Company cannot predict at this time whether any such claims will
    be made or the damages that may be alleged.

Gender
    Discrimination Class Action

In March 2008, the Company settled an action in the United
    States District Court for the Southern District of New York
    commenced against the Company in 2001 on behalf of an alleged
    nationwide class of present and former female officer and
    officer equivalent employees alleging that the Company
    discriminated against them on the basis of their gender and
    seeking injunctive relief, money damages, attorneys’ fees
    and costs. Although the Court had denied plaintiffs’
    motions to certify a nationwide class or to grant nationwide
    discovery, it certified a class of approximately 200 female
    officers and officer equivalent employees based in the
    Company’s offices in New York, New Jersey and
    Massachusetts. The settlement agreement provides for injunctive
    relief and a monetary payment, including the amount of attorney
    fees plaintiffs’ counsel are entitled to receive, which was
    not material to the Company. In December 2006, a former female
    employee, whose motion to intervene in the class action was
    denied, filed a purported class action in the United States
    District Court, Southern District of New York, with almost
    identical allegations as those contained in the suit that was
    settled in 2008, except seeking a class period of 1998 to the
    time of trial (the class period in the settled suit was 1998 to
    the end of 2001). The Company’s motion to dismiss this suit
    was denied and the Court did not grant the Company permission to
    immediately file an appeal from the denial of its motion to
    dismiss. The parties are in the discovery phase of the
    litigation. The suit was amended to include one additional
    plaintiff and another filed an arbitration demand that includes
    a class allegation.

In January 2011, the Company reached an agreement with
    plaintiffs on a monetary settlement to settle all class claims
    and the claims of the individual named plaintiffs as well as the
    plaintiff that filed an arbitration demand. The amount of this
    settlement is not material. However, before this matter can be
    settled in its entirety, the parties must reach agreement on any
    injunctive measures the Company will implement and the Court
    must approve all terms of the settlement.

COMMITMENTS AND
    CONTINGENCIES (Continued)

World Trade
    Center

The Company acted as the insurance broker, but not as an
    underwriter, for the placement of both property and casualty
    insurance for a number of entities which were directly impacted
    by the September 11, 2001, destruction of the World Trade
    Center complex, including Silverstein Properties LLC, which
    acquired a

99-year

leasehold interest in the twin towers and related facilities
    from the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey in July 2001.
    Although the World Trade Center complex insurance was bound at
    or before the July 2001 closing of the leasehold acquisition,
    consistent with standard industry practice, the final policy
    wording for the placements was still in the process of being
    finalized when the twin towers and other buildings in the
    complex were destroyed on September 11, 2001. There have
    been a number of lawsuits in the United States between the
    insured parties and the insurers for several placements and
    other disputes may arise in respect of insurance placed by us
    which could affect the Company including claims by one or more
    of the insureds that the Company made culpable errors or
    omissions in connection with our brokerage activities. However,
    the Company does not believe that our role as broker will lead
    to liabilities which in the aggregate would have a material
    adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition
    or liquidity.

Stanford
    Financial Group

On July 2, 2009, a putative class action complaint,
    captioned

Troice, et al. v. Willis of Colorado, Inc., et
    al.

, C.A.

No. 3:09-CV-01274-N,

was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern
    District of Texas against Willis Group Holdings, Willis of
    Colorado, Inc. and a Willis associate, among others, relating to
    the collapse of The Stanford Financial Group
    (’Stanford’), for which Willis of Colorado, Inc. acted
    as broker of record on certain lines of insurance. The complaint
    generally alleged that the defendants actively and materially
    aided Stanford’s alleged fraud by providing Stanford with
    certain letters regarding coverage that they knew would be used
    to help retain or attract actual or prospective Stanford client
    investors. The complaint alleged that these letters, which
    contain statements about Stanford and the insurance policies
    that the defendants placed for Stanford, contained untruths and
    omitted material facts and were drafted in this manner to help
    Stanford promote and sell its allegedly fraudulent certificates
    of deposit. The putative class consisted of Stanford investors
    in Mexico and the complaint asserted various claims under Texas
    statutory and common law and sought actual damages in excess of
    $1 billion, punitive damages and costs. On August 12,
    2009, the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint, which,
    notwithstanding the addition of certain factual allegations and
    Texas common law claims, largely mirrored the original and
    sought the same relief.

On July 17, 2009, a putative class action complaint,
    captioned

Ranni v. Willis of Colorado, Inc., et al.

,
    C.A.

No. 09-22085,

was filed against Willis Group Holdings and Willis of Colorado,
    Inc. in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District
    of Florida, relating to the same alleged course of conduct as
    the Troice complaint described above. Based on substantially the
    same allegations as the Troice complaint, but on behalf of a
    putative class of Venezuelan and other South American Stanford
    investors, the Ranni complaint asserts a claim under
    Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and

Rule 10b-5

thereunder, as well as various claims under Florida statutory
    and common law, and seeks damages in an amount to be determined
    at trial and costs.

On or about July 24, 2009, a motion was filed by certain
    individuals (collectively, the ‘Movants’) with the
    U.S. Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation (the
    ‘JPML’) to consolidate and coordinate in the Northern
    District of Texas nine separate putative class
    actions — including the Troice and Ranni actions
    described above, as well as other actions against various
    Stanford-related entities and individuals and the Commonwealth
    of Antigua and Barbuda — relating to Stanford and its
    allegedly fraudulent certificates of deposit.

On August 6, 2009, a putative class action complaint,
    captioned

Canabal, et al. v. Willis of Colorado, Inc.,
    et al.

, C.A.

No. 3:09-CV-01474-D,

was filed against Willis Group Holdings, Willis of Colorado,
    Inc. and the same Willis associate, among others, also in the
    Northern District of Texas, relating to the same alleged course

    CONTINGENCIES (Continued)

of conduct as the Troice complaint described above. Based on
    substantially the same allegations as the Troice complaint, but
    on behalf of a putative class of Venezuelan investors, the
    Canabal complaint asserted various claims under Texas statutory
    and common law and sought actual damages in excess of
    $1 billion, punitive damages, attorneys’ fees and
    costs.

On or about August 10, 2009, the Movants filed with the
    JPML a Notice of Related Action that referred the Canabal action
    to the JPML. On October 6, 2009, the JPML ruled on the
    transfer motion, transferring seven of the subject actions
    (including the Troice and Ranni actions) — i.e., the
    original nine actions minus two that had since been
    dismissed — for consolidation or coordination in the
    Northern District of Texas. On October 27, 2009, the
    parties to the Canabal action stipulated to the designation of
    that action as a related case and properly part of the new
    Stanford MDL proceeding in the Northern District of Texas.

On September 14, 2009, a complaint, captioned

Rupert, et
    al. v. Winter, et al.

, Case No. 2009C115137, was
    filed on behalf of 97 Stanford investors against Willis Group
    Holdings, Willis of Colorado, Inc. and the same Willis
    associate, among others, in Texas state court (Bexar County).
    Based on substantially the same allegations as the Troice
    complaint, the Rupert complaint asserts claims under the
    Securities Act of 1933, as well as various Texas statutory and
    common law claims, and seeks rescission, damages, special
    damages and consequential damages of $79.1 million, treble
    damages of $237.4 million under the Texas Insurance Code,
    attorneys’ fees and costs. On October 20, 2009,
    certain defendants, including Willis of Colorado, Inc.,
    (i) removed the Rupert action to the U.S. District
    Court for the Western District of Texas, (ii) notified the
    JPML of the pendency of this additional ‘tag-along’
    action and (iii) moved to stay the action pending a
    determination by the JPML as to whether it should be transferred
    to the Northern District of Texas for consolidation or
    coordination with the other Stanford-related actions. In
    November 2009, the JPML issued a conditional transfer order (the
    ‘CTO’) for the transfer of the Rupert action to the
    Northern District of Texas. On December 22, 2009, the
    plaintiffs filed a motion to vacate, or alternatively stay, the
    CTO, to which Willis of Colorado, Inc. responded on
    January 4, 2010. On April 1, 2010, the JPML denied the
    plaintiffs’ motion to vacate the CTO and issued a final
    transfer order for the transfer of the Rupert action to the
    Northern District of Texas.

On December 18, 2009, the parties to the Troice and Canabal
    actions stipulated to the consolidation of those actions and, on
    December 31, 2009, the plaintiffs therein, collectively,
    filed a Second Amended Class Action Complaint, which
    largely mirrors the Troice and Canabal predecessor complaints,
    but seeks relief on behalf of a worldwide class of Stanford
    investors. Also on December 31, 2009, the plaintiffs in the
    Canabal action filed a Notice of Dismissal, dismissing the
    Canabal action without prejudice. On February 25, 2010, the
    defendants filed motions to dismiss the Second Amended
    Class Action Complaint in the consolidated Troice/Canabal
    action. Those motions are currently pending. On May 24,
    2010, the plaintiffs in the consolidated Troice/Canabal action
    filed a motion for leave to file a Third Amended
    Class Action Complaint, which, among other things, adds
    several Texas statutory claims. That motion is also currently
    pending.

On September 16, 2010, a complaint, captioned

Casanova,
    et al. v. Willis of Colorado, Inc., et al.

, C.A.

No. 3:10-CV-01862-O,

was filed on behalf of seven Stanford investors against Willis
    Group Holdings, Willis Limited, Willis of Colorado, Inc. and the
    same Willis associate, among others, also in the Northern
    District of Texas. Although this is not a class action, the
    Casanova complaint is based on substantially the same
    allegations as the Second Amended Class Action Complaint in
    the consolidated Troice/Canabal action. The Casanova complaint
    asserts various claims under Texas statutory and common law and
    seeks actual damages in excess of $5 million, punitive
    damages, attorneys’ fees and costs.

The defendants have not yet responded to the Ranni or Rupert or
    Casanova complaints.

Additional actions could be brought in the future by other
    investors in certificates of deposit issued by Stanford and its
    affiliates. The Company disputes these allegations and intends
    to defend itself vigorously

against these actions. The outcomes of these actions, however,
    including any losses or other payments that may occur as a
    result, cannot be predicted at this time.

St.
    Jude

In January 2009, Willis of Minnesota, Inc. was named as a third
    party defendant in a lawsuit between American Insurance Company
    (‘AIC’) and St. Jude Medical, Inc. (‘St.
    Jude’) pending in the United States District Court,
    District of Minnesota, that arose out of a products liability
    insurance program for St. Jude in which AIC provided one layer
    of insurance and the Company acted as the broker. St. Jude
    sought a judgment against AIC requiring AIC to pay its policy
    limits of $50 million plus interest and costs for certain
    personal injury claims filed against St. Jude and denied by AIC.
    To the extent there was a finding that AIC does not have to
    provide coverage for these claims, St. Jude alternatively
    alleged standard errors and omissions claims against the Company
    for the same amount.

On December 22, 2010, the parties to this suit entered into
    a settlement agreement that fully resolves all claims in the
    lawsuit. Under the settlement agreement, the Company agreed to
    make and has already made an immaterial one-time payment to St.
    Jude. As part of the settlement agreement, each party has also
    fully and completely released and waived all claims it may have
    against any of the other parties arising out of or in connection
    with the subject matter of the litigation. The settlement
    includes no admissions of wrongdoing by any party. The lawsuit
    was dismissed with prejudice on January 3, 2011.

DERIVATIVE
    FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES

Fair value of
    derivative financial instruments

In addition to the note below, see Note 25 for information
    about the fair value hierarchy of derivatives.

Primary risks
    managed by derivative financial instruments

The main risks arising from the Company’s financial
    instruments are interest rate risk, liquidity risk, foreign
    currency risk and credit risk. The Company’s board of
    directors reviews and agrees policies for managing each of these
    risks as summarized below.

The Company enters into derivative transactions (principally
    interest rate swaps and forward foreign currency contracts) in
    order to manage interest rate and currency risks arising from
    the Company’s operations and its sources of finance. The
    Company does not hold financial or derivative instruments for
    trading purposes.

Interest Rate
    Risk

As a result of the Company’s operating activities, the
    Company receives cash for premiums and claims which it deposits
    in short-term investments denominated in US dollars and other
    currencies. The Company earns interest on these funds, which is
    included in the Company’s financial statements as
    investment income. These funds are regulated in terms of access
    and the instruments in which they may be invested, most of which
    are short-term in maturity. In order to manage interest rate
    risk arising from these financial assets, the Company enters
    into interest rate swaps to receive a fixed rate of interest and
    pay a variable rate of interest fixed in the various currencies
    related to the short-term investments. The use of interest rate
    contracts essentially converts groups of short-term variable
    rate investments to fixed rates.

DERIVATIVE
    FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES
    (Continued)

The fair value of these contracts is recorded in other assets
    and other liabilities. For contracts that qualify as cash flow
    hedges for accounting purposes, the effective portions of
    changes in fair value are recorded as a component of other
    comprehensive income.

At December 31, 2010 and 2009, the company had the
    following derivative financial instruments that were designated
    as cash flow hedges of interest rate risk:

(i)

Notional amounts represent US
    dollar equivalents translated at the spot rate as of
    December 31.

The Company’s operations are financed principally by
    $1,750 million fixed rate senior notes and
    $411 million under a

5-year

term
    loan facility. Of the fixed rate senior notes $350 million
    are due 2015, $500 million are due 2016, $600 million
    are due 2017 and $300 million are due 2019. The Company
    also has access to $520 million under three revolving
    credit facilities; as of December 31, 2010 $90 million
    was drawn from the

5-year

$300 million revolving credit facility. All debt is issued
    by subsidiaries of the Company.

The interest rates applicable to the borrowings under the

5-year

term
    loan and the revolving credit facilities vary according to LIBOR
    on the date of individual drawdowns.

During the year ended December 31, 2010, the Company
    entered into a series of interest rate swaps for a total
    notional amount of $350 million to receive a fixed rate and
    pay a variable rate on a semi-annual basis, with a maturity date
    of July 15, 2015. At the year end the weighted average
    fixed rate payable was 2.71% and variable rate receivable was
    2.04%. The Company has designated and accounts for these
    instruments as fair value hedges against its $350 million
    5.625% senior notes due 2015. The fair values of the
    interest rate swaps are included within other assets or other
    liabilities and the fair value of the hedged element of the
    senior notes is included within long-term debt.

At December 31, 2010 and 2009, the Company’s interest
    rate swaps were all designated as hedging instruments.

Liquidity
    Risk

The Company’s objective is to ensure that it has the
    ability to generate sufficient cash either from internal or
    external sources, in a timely and cost-effective manner, to meet
    its commitments as they fall due. The Company’s management
    of liquidity risk is embedded within its overall risk management
    framework. Scenario analysis is continually undertaken to ensure
    that the Company’s resources can meet its liquidity
    requirements. These resources are supplemented by access to
    $520 million under three revolving credit facilities.



Notes
    to the financial statements

24.

DERIVATIVE
    FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES
    (Continued)

Foreign
    Currency Risk

The Company’s primary foreign exchange risks arise:

•

from changes in the exchange rate between US dollars and pounds
    sterling as its London market operations earn the majority of
    their revenues in US dollars and incur expenses predominantly in
    pounds sterling, and may also hold a significant net sterling
    asset or liability position on the balance sheet. In addition,
    the London market operations earn significant revenues in euros
    and Japanese yen; and

•

from the translation into US dollars of the net income and net
    assets of its foreign subsidiaries, excluding the London market
    operations which are US dollar denominated.

The foreign exchange risks in its London market operations are
    hedged as follows:

•

To the extent that forecast pound sterling expenses exceed pound
    sterling revenues, the Company limits its exposure to this
    exchange rate risk by the use of forward contracts matched to
    specific, clearly identified cash outflows arising in the
    ordinary course of business;

•

To the extent the UK operations earn significant revenues in
    euros and Japanese yen, the Company limits its exposure to
    changes in the exchange rate between the US dollar and these
    currencies by the use of forward contracts matched to a
    percentage of forecast cash inflows in specific currencies and
    periods; and

•

To the extent that the net sterling asset or liability position
    in its London market operations relate to short-term cash flows,
    the Company limits its exposure by the use of forward purchases
    and sales. These forward purchases and sales are not effective
    hedges for accounting purposes.

The Company does not hedge net income earned within foreign
    subsidiaries outside of the UK.

The fair value of foreign currency contracts is recorded in
    other assets and other liabilities. For contracts that qualify
    as accounting hedges, changes in fair value resulting from
    movements in the spot exchange rate are recorded as a component
    of other comprehensive income whilst changes resulting from a
    movement in the time value are recorded in interest expense. For
    contracts that do not qualify for hedge accounting, the total
    change in fair value is recorded in interest expense. Amounts
    held in comprehensive income are reclassified into earnings when
    the hedged exposure affects earnings.

At December 31, 2010 and 2009, the Company’s foreign
    currency contracts were all designated as hedging instruments.

The table below summarizes by major currency the contractual
    amounts of the Company’s forward contracts to exchange
    foreign currencies for pounds sterling in the case of US dollars
    and US dollars for Euro and Japanese yen. Foreign currency
    notional amounts are reported in US dollars translated at
    contracted exchange rates.

    FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES
    (Continued)

Credit Risk
    and Concentrations of Credit Risk

Credit risk represents the loss that would be recognized at the
    reporting date if counterparties failed to perform as contracted
    and from movements in interest rates and foreign exchange rates.
    The Company does not anticipate non-performance by
    counterparties. The Company generally does not require
    collateral or other security to support financial instruments
    with credit risk; however, it is the Company’s policy to
    enter into master netting arrangements with counterparties as
    practical.

Concentrations of credit risk that arise from financial
    instruments exist for groups of customers or counterparties when
    they have similar economic characteristics that would cause
    their ability to meet contractual obligations to be similarly
    affected by changes in economic or other conditions. Financial
    instruments on the balance sheet that potentially subject the
    Company to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of
    cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable and derivatives
    which are recorded at fair value.

The Company maintains a policy providing for the diversification
    of cash and cash equivalent investments and places such
    investments in an extensive number of financial institutions to
    limit the amount of credit risk exposure. These financial
    institutions are monitored on an ongoing basis for credit
    quality predominantly using information provided by credit
    agencies.

Concentrations of credit risk with respect to receivables are
    limited due to the large number of clients and markets in which
    the Company does business, as well as the dispersion across many
    geographic areas. Management does not believe significant risk
    exists in connection with the Company’s concentrations of
    credit as of December 31, 2010.

The following methods and assumptions were used by the Company
    in estimating its fair value disclosure for financial
    instruments:

Cash and Cash Equivalents

—

The estimated fair
    value of these financial instruments approximates their carrying
    values due to their short maturities.

Fiduciary Funds — Restricted

—

Fair
    values are based on quoted market values

Long-Term Debt excluding the fair value hedge

—

Fair values are based on quoted market values.

Derivative Financial Instruments

—

Market
    values have been used to determine the fair value of interest
    rate swaps and forward foreign exchange contracts based on
    estimated amounts the Company would receive or have to pay to
    terminate the agreements, taking into account the current
    interest rate environment or current foreign currency forward
    rates.

SEGMENT
    INFORMATION

During the periods presented, the Company operated through three
    segments: Global; North America and International. Global
    provides specialist brokerage and consulting services to clients
    worldwide for specific industrial and commercial activities and
    is organized by specialism. North America and International
    predominantly comprise our retail operations which provide
    services to small, medium and major corporates, accessing
    Global’s specialist expertise when required.

The Company evaluates the performance of its operating segments
    based on organic revenue growth and operating income. For
    internal reporting and segmental reporting, the following items
    for which segmental management are not held accountable are
    excluded from segmental expenses:

i)

costs of the holding company;

ii)

foreign exchange loss from the devaluation of the Venezuelan
    currency;



Willis
    Group Holdings plc

SEGMENT
    INFORMATION (Continued)

iii)

foreign exchange hedging activities, foreign exchange movements
    on the UK pension plan asset and foreign exchange gains and
    losses from currency purchases and sales;

iv)

amortization of intangible assets;

v)

gains and losses on the disposal of operations and major
    properties;

vi)

significant legal settlements which are managed centrally;

vii)

integration costs associated with the acquisition of
    HRH; and

viii)

costs associated with the redomicile of the Company’s
    parent company from Bermuda to Ireland.

The accounting policies of the operating segments are consistent
    with those described in Note 2 — Basis of
    Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies. There are no
    inter-segment revenues, with segments operating on a
    revenue-sharing basis equivalent to that used when sharing
    business with other third-party brokers.

FINANCIAL
    INFORMATION FOR PARENT GUARANTOR, OTHER GUARANTOR SUBSIDIARIES
    AND NON-GUARANTOR SUBSIDIARIES

On July 1, 2005, Willis North America Inc. (‘Willis
    North America’) issued senior notes totaling
    $600 million under its February 2004 registration
    statement. On March 28, 2007, Willis North America issued
    further senior notes totaling $600 million under its June
    2006 registration statement. On September 29, 2009, Willis
    North America issued senior notes totaling
    $300 million under its June 2009 registration statement
    (Note 18 — Debt).

Until December 22, 2010, all direct obligations under the
    senior notes were jointly and severally, irrevocably and fully
    and unconditionally guaranteed by Willis Group Holdings, Willis
    Netherlands Holdings B.V., Willis Investment UK Holdings
    Limited, TA I Limited, TA II Limited, Trinity Acquisition plc,
    TA III Limited, TA IV Limited, and Willis Group Limited, the
    Guarantor Companies. On that date and in connection with an
    internal group reorganisation, TA II Limited, TA III Limited and
    TA IV Limited transferred their obligations



Willis
    Group Holdings plc

28.

FINANCIAL
    INFORMATION FOR PARENT GUARANTOR, OTHER GUARANTOR SUBSIDIARIES
    AND NON-GUARANTOR SUBSIDIARIES (Continued)

as guarantors to the other Guarantor Companies. TA II Limited,
    TA III Limited and TA IV Limited entered member’s voluntary
    liquidation on December 31, 2010. The assets of these
    companies were distributed to the other Guarantor Companies,
    either directly or indirectly, as a final distribution paid
    prior to their entering member’s voluntary liquidation.
    These final distributions have been excluded from the 2010
    results and cash flows of the Other Guarantors. The final
    distributions comprise: a $4.3 billion dividend from TA IV
    Limited to Trinity Acquisition plc; a $5.1 billion
    distribution from TA III Limited to TA II Limited and a
    $4.7 billion distribution from TA II Limited to TA I
    Limited. Since all of the liquidated guarantors were ultimately
    liquidated into another guarantor, these transactions did not
    have a material impact on the guarantees of the senior notes and
    did not require the consent of the noteholders under the
    applicable indentures.

Willis Group Holdings was incorporated on September 24,
    2009 and, as discussed in Note 2, replaced Willis-Bermuda
    as the ultimate parent company on December 31, 2009. Willis
    Netherlands Holdings B.V. was incorporated on November 27,
    2009.

The debt securities that were issued by Willis North America and
    guaranteed by the entities described above, and for which the
    disclosures set forth below relate and are required under
    applicable SEC rules, were issued under a “shelf”
    registration statements on Form S-3, including our current
    June 2009 registration statement (the “Willis Shelf”).
    The Willis Shelf also covers and contemplates possible issuances
    of securities by, and guarantees by, other Willis group
    entities, including Willis Group Holdings. One possible
    structure originally contemplated by the Willis Shelf was for
    debt securities issued by Trinity Acquisition plc and guaranteed
    by certain of its direct and indirect parent entities, but not
    guaranteed by its direct and indirect subsidiaries, including
    Willis North America, and the financial statements included in
    our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended
    December 31, 2009 included a footnote (Note 25) that
    corresponded to this possible issuance structure. We have
    determined that we will not utilize the Willis Shelf to issue
    debt securities using such a structure, and we therefore have
    not included a corresponding footnote in these financial
    statements.

Presented below is condensed consolidating financial information
    for:

(i)

Willis Group Holdings, which is a guarantor, on a parent company
    only basis;

(ii)

the Other Guarantors, which are all 100 percent directly or
    indirectly owned subsidiaries of the parent and are all direct
    or indirect parents of the issuer;

(iii)

the Issuer, Willis North America;

(iv)

Other, which are the non-guarantor subsidiaries, on a combined
    basis;

(v)

Eliminations; and

(vi)

Consolidated Company.

Controls
    and Procedures

Evaluation of
    Disclosure Controls and Procedures

As of December 31, 2010, the Company carried out an
    evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of
    the Company’s management, including the Chairman and Chief
    Executive Officer and the Group Chief Financial Officer, of the
    effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company’s
    disclosure controls and procedures

pursuant to Exchange Act

Rule 13a-15(e).

Based upon that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and the
    Group Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of that date,
    the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures as defined
    in

Rule 13a-15(e)

are effective.

Management’s
    Report on Internal Control over Financial
    Reporting

Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining
    adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in

Rule 13a-15(f)

under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

Under the supervision and with the participation of our
    management, including our principal executive officer and
    principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the
    effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting
    as of December 31, 2010, based on the criteria related to
    internal control over financial reporting described in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework

issued
    by the

Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
    Commission. Based on our evaluation, management concluded that
    our internal control over financial reporting was effective as
    of December 31, 2010.

Our independent registered public accountants, Deloitte LLP, who
    have audited and reported on our financial statements, have
    undertaken an assessment of the Company’s internal control
    over financial reporting. Deloitte’s report is presented
    below.

February 25, 2011.



REPORT OF
    INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Willis Group
    Holdings Public Limited Company,

Dublin, Ireland

We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of
    Willis Group Holdings Public Limited Company and subsidiaries
    (the ‘Company’) as of December 31, 2010, based on
    criteria established in

Internal Control —
    Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
    Organizations of the Treadway Commission. The Company’s
    management is responsible for maintaining effective internal
    control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the
    effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting,
    included in the accompanying Management’s Report on
    Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is
    to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control
    over financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control
    over financial reporting was maintained in all material
    respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of
    internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk
    that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the
    design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on
    the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we
    considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our
    audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
    process designed by, or under the supervision of, the
    company’s principal executive and principal financial
    officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected
    by the company’s board of directors, management, and other
    personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
    internal control over financial reporting includes those
    policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance
    of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
    reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
    company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions
    are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
    statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
    principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
    are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
    management and directors of the company; and (3) provide
    reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
    unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
    company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
    financial statements.

Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over
    financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or
    improper management override of controls, material misstatements
    due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a
    timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of the
    effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting
    to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may
    become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the
    degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may
    deteriorate.

In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material
    respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as
    of December 31, 2010, based on the criteria established in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework

issued
    by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
    Commission.

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
    consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended
    December 31, 2010 of the Company and our report dated
    February 25, 2011 expressed an unqualified opinion on those
    financial statements.

Changes in
    Internal Control over Financial Reporting

There has been no change in the Company’s internal controls
    over financial reporting during the three months ended
    December 31, 2010 that has materially affected, or is
    reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s
    internal control over financial reporting.
