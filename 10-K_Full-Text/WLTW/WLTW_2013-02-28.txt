Willis Group Holdings plc

PART I

Item 1 — Business

History and Development of the Company

Willis Group Holdings is the ultimate holding company for the Group. We trace our history to 1828 and are one of the largest insurance brokers in the world.

Willis Group Holdings was incorporated in Ireland on September 24, 2009 to facilitate the change of the place of incorporation of the parent company of the Group from Bermuda to Ireland (the ‘Redomicile’). At December 31, 2009, the common shares of Willis-Bermuda were canceled, the Willis-Bermuda common shareholders received, on a one-for-one basis, new ordinary shares of Willis Group Holdings, and Willis Group Holdings became the ultimate parent company for the Group.

For administrative convenience, we utilize the offices of a subsidiary company as our principal executive offices. The address is:

Willis Group Holdings Public Limited Company

c/o Willis Group Limited

The Willis Building

51 Lime Street

London EC3M 7DQ

England

Tel: +44 203 124 6000

For several years, we have focused on our core retail and specialist broking operations. In 2008, we acquired HRH, at the time the eighth largest insurance and risk management intermediary in the United States. The acquisition almost doubled our North America revenues and created critical mass in key markets including California, Florida, Texas, Illinois, New York, Boston, New Jersey and Philadelphia. In addition, we have made a number of smaller acquisitions around the world and increased our ownership in several of our associates and existing subsidiaries, which were not wholly-owned, where doing so strengthened our retail network and our specialty businesses.

The Company files annual, quarterly and current reports, proxy statements and other information with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the ‘SEC’).

General

We provide a broad range of insurance brokerage, reinsurance and risk management consulting services to our clients worldwide. We have significant market positions in the United States, in the United Kingdom and, directly and through our associates, in many other countries. We are a recognized leader in providing specialized risk management advisory and other services on a global basis to clients in various industries including aerospace, marine, construction and energy.



About Willis

In our capacity as an advisor and insurance broker, we act as an intermediary between our clients and insurance carriers by advising our clients on their risk management requirements, helping clients determine the best means of managing risk, and negotiating and placing insurance with insurance carriers through our global distribution network.

We assist clients in the assessment of their risks, advise on the best ways of transferring suitable risk to the global insurance and reinsurance markets and then execute the transactions at the most appropriate available price, terms and conditions for our clients. Our global distribution network enables us to place the risk in the most appropriate insurance or reinsurance market worldwide.

We also offer clients a broad range of services to help them to identify and control their risks. These services range from strategic risk consulting (including providing actuarial analysis), to a variety of due diligence services, to the provision of practical on-site risk control services (such as health and safety or property loss control consulting) as well as analytical and advisory services (such as hazard modeling and reinsurance optimization studies). We assist clients in planning how to manage incidents or crises when they occur. These services include contingency planning, security audits and product tampering plans. We are not an insurance company and therefore we do not underwrite insurable risks for our own account.

We derive most of our revenues from commissions and fees for brokerage and consulting services and do not determine the insurance premiums on which our commissions are generally based. Commission levels generally follow the same trend as premium levels as they are derived from a percentage of the premiums paid by the insureds. Fluctuations in these premiums charged by the insurance carriers can therefore have a direct and potentially material impact on our results of operations.

We and our associates serve a diverse base of clients including major multinational and middle-market companies in a variety of industries, as well as public institutions and individual clients. Many of our client relationships span decades. We have approximately 21,000 employees around the world (including approximately 3,400 at our associate companies) and a network of in excess of 400 offices in nearly 120 countries.

We believe we are one of only a few insurance brokers in the world possessing the global operating presence, broad product expertise and extensive distribution network necessary to meet effectively the global risk management needs of many of our clients.

Business Strategy

Our aim is to be the insurance broker and risk adviser of choice globally.

Our business model is aligned to the needs of each client segment:

•

Insurer — platform-neutral capital management and advisory services;

•

Large Accounts — delivering Willis’s global capabilities through client advocacy;

•

Mid-Market — mass-customization through our Sales 2.0 model;

•

Commercial — providing products and services to networks of retail brokers; and

•

Personal — focused on affinity models and High Net Worth segments.

Our business model has three elements:

•

Organic growth;

•

Recruitment of teams and individuals; and

•

Strategic acquisitions.

To meet the needs of our clients, we realigned our business model in 2011 to further grow the company and position us to deliver the Willis Cause:

•

we thoroughly understand our clients' needs and their industries;

•

we develop client solutions with the best markets, price and terms;

•

we relentlessly deliver quality client service; and

•

we get claims paid quickly

...With Integrity



Willis Group Holdings plc

Our Business

Insurance and reinsurance is a global business, and its participants are affected by global trends in capacity and pricing. Accordingly, we operate as one global business which ensures all clients' interests are handled efficiently and comprehensively, whatever their initial point of contact. We organize our business into three segments: North America and International, which together comprise our principal retail operations, and Global. In 2012 and 2011, approximately 50 percent of our total revenue was generated from within the US, with no other country contributing in excess of 20 percent. For information regarding revenues and operating income per segment, see Note 28 of the Consolidated Financial Statements contained herein.

Global

Our Global business provides specialist brokerage and consulting services to clients worldwide for the risks arising from specific industrial and commercial activities. In these operations, we have extensive specialized experience handling diverse lines of coverage, including complex insurance programs, and acting as an intermediary between retail brokers and insurers. We increasingly provide consulting services on risk management with the objective of assisting clients to reduce the overall cost of risk. Our Global business serves clients in over 150 countries, primarily from offices in the United Kingdom, although we also serve clients from offices in the United States, Continental Europe and Asia.

The Global business is divided into:

•

Placement

Global placement is the Willis Group's specialist function for the placement of risk into the worldwide insurance market.

This structure enables Willis to place business in the most appropriate market for a client regardless of the domicile of the client or carrier.

LLC, organized under the laws of Dubai (49 percent holding). In connection with many of our investments we retain the right to increase our ownership over time, typically to a majority or 100 percent ownership position. In addition, in certain instances our co-shareholders have a right, typically based on some price formula of revenues or earnings, to put some or all of their shares to us. For further information on Gras Savoye, see 'Item 8 - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 15 - Investments in Associates'.

We believe the combined total revenues of our International subsidiaries and associates provide an indication of the spread and capability of our International network. The team generated approximately 30 percent of the Group’s total consolidated commissions and fees in


.

Customers

Our clients operate on a global and local scale in a multitude of businesses and industries throughout the world and generally range in size from major multinational corporations to middle-market companies. Further, many of our client relationships span decades, for instance our relationship with The Tokio Marine and Fire Insurance Company Limited dates back over 100 years. No one client accounted for more than 10 percent of revenues for fiscal year 2012. Additionally, we place insurance with approximately 2,500 insurance carriers, none of which individually accounted for more than 10 percent of the total premiums we placed on behalf of our clients in 2012.

Competition

We face competition in all fields in which we operate based on global capability, product breadth, innovation, quality of service and price. According to the Directory of Agents and Brokers published by Business Insurance in July 2012, the 140 largest commercial insurance brokers globally reported brokerage revenues totaling $44 billion in 2011, of which Marsh & McLennan Companies Inc. had approximately 26 percent, Aon Corporation had approximately 26 percent and Willis, being the third largest broker, had approximately 8 percent.

We face competition in all fields in which we operate, based on global capability, product breadth, innovation, quality of service and price. We compete with Marsh & McLennan and Aon, the two other providers of global risk management services, as well as with numerous specialist, regional and local firms. Competition for business is intense in all of our business lines and in every insurance market, and Marsh & McLennan and Aon have substantially greater market share than we do. Competition on premium rates has also exacerbated the pressures caused by a continuing reduction in demand in some classes of business. For example, rather than purchase additional insurance through brokers, many insureds have been retaining a greater proportion of their risk portfolios than previously. Industrial and commercial companies increasingly rely upon their own subsidiary insurance companies, known as captive insurance companies, self-insurance pools, risk retention groups, mutual insurance companies and other mechanisms for funding their risks, rather than buy insurance. Additional competitive pressures arise from the entry of new market participants, such as banks, accounting firms and insurance carriers themselves, offering risk management or transfer services.



Willis Group Holdings plc

In addition, to date, we have not accepted contingent commissions from carriers in the non-Human Capital areas of our retail brokerage business. To our knowledge, we are the only insurance broker that takes this stance. We seek to increase revenue through higher commissions and fees that we disclose to our clients, and to generate profitable revenue growth by focusing on the provision of value-added risk advisory services beyond traditional brokerage activities. We cannot be certain that such steps will help us to continue to generate profitable organic revenue growth. If we are unable to compete effectively against our competitors who are accepting or may accept contingent commissions, we may suffer lower revenue, reduced operating margins, and loss of market share which could materially and adversely affect our business.

Regulation

Our business activities are subject to legal requirements and governmental and quasi-governmental regulatory supervision in virtually all countries in which we operate. Also, such regulations may require individual or company licensing to conduct our business activities. While these requirements may vary from location to location they are generally designed to protect our clients by establishing minimum standards of conduct and practice, particularly regarding the provision of advice and product information as well as financial criteria. Our three most significant regulatory regions are described below:

United States

Our activities in connection with insurance brokerage services within the United States are subject to regulation and supervision by state authorities. Although the scope of regulation and form of supervision may vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, insurance laws in the United States are often complex and generally grant broad discretion to supervisory authorities in adopting regulations and supervising regulated activities. That supervision generally includes the licensing of insurance brokers and agents and the regulation of the handling and investment of client funds held in a fiduciary capacity. Our continuing ability to provide insurance brokerage in the jurisdictions in which we currently operate is dependent upon our compliance with the rules and regulations promulgated from time to time by the regulatory authorities in each of these jurisdictions.

European Union

The European Union Insurance Mediation Directive introduced rules to enable insurance and reinsurance intermediaries to operate and provide services within each member state of the EU on a basis consistent with the EU single market and customer protection aims. Each EU member state in which we operate is required to ensure that the insurance and reinsurance intermediaries resident in their country are registered with a statutory body in that country and that each intermediary meets professional requirements in relation to their competence, good repute, professional indemnity cover and financial capacity.

United Kingdom

In the United Kingdom, our business is currently regulated by the Financial Services Authority.  Under legislation enacted by the UK Parliament, the regulation of our business will be transitioned from the FSA to the Financial Conduct Authority ('FCA') on or about April 1, 2013.  The FCA will have a wide range of rule-making, investigatory and enforcement powers, and will conduct monitoring visits to assess our compliance with regulatory requirements.

The FCA will have a sole strategic objective: to protect and enhance confidence in the UK financial system.  Its operational objectives will be to:  secure an appropriate degree of protection for consumers; promote efficiency and choice in the market for financial services; and protect and enhance the integrity of the UK financial system.  The FCA will also have a duty to act in a way that promotes competition, and to minimize the extent to which regulated businesses may be used for a purpose connected with financial crime.  Finally, the FCA will have new powers in product intervention. For instance, it will be able to instruct firms to withdraw or amend misleading financial promotions.

Other



About Willis

Certain of our activities are governed by other regulatory bodies, such as investment and securities licensing authorities. In the United States, our Willis Capital Markets & Advisory business operates through our wholly-owned subsidiary Willis Securities, Inc., a US-registered broker-dealer and investment advisor, member FINRA/SIPC, primarily in connection with investment banking-related services and advising on alternative risk financing transactions. Willis Capital Markets provides advice on securities or investments in the EU through our wholly-owned subsidiary Willis Capital Markets & Advisory Limited, which is authorized and regulated by the FSA.

Our failure, or that of our employees, to satisfy the regulators that we comply with their requirements or the legal requirements governing our activities, can result in disciplinary action, fines, reputational damage and financial harm.

All companies carrying on similar activities in a given jurisdiction are subject to regulations which are not dissimilar to the requirements for our operations in the United States and United Kingdom. We do not consider that these regulatory requirements adversely affect our competitive position.

See Part I, Item 1A-Risk Factors ‘Legal and Regulatory Risks’ for discussion of how actions by regulatory authorities or changes in legislation and regulation in the jurisdictions in which we operate may have an adverse effect on our business.

Employees

As of

December 31, 2012

we had approximately 17,500 employees worldwide of whom approximately 3,600 were employed in the United Kingdom and 6,100 in the United States, with the balance being employed across the rest of the world. In addition, our associates had approximately 3,400 employees, all of whom were located outside the United Kingdom and the United States.

Item 1A — Risk Factors

Risks Relating to our Business and the Insurance Industry

This section describes material risks affecting the Group’s business. These risks could materially affect the Group’s business, its revenues, operating income, net income, net assets, liquidity and capital resources and ability to achieve its financial targets and, accordingly should be read in conjunction with any forward-looking statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Competitive Risks

Worldwide economic conditions, including those associated with the current Eurozone crisis, could have an adverse effect on our business, prospects, operating results, financial condition and cash flows.

Our business and operating results are materially affected by worldwide economic conditions. Current global economic conditions, including those associated with the current Eurozone crisis, coupled with low customer and business confidence may have a significant negative impact on the buying behavior of some of our clients as their businesses suffer from these conditions. For example, our Human Capital practice may be adversely affected as businesses downsize during this period of economic turmoil and our construction business may be adversely affected by the lack of new construction. Over the past few years, our North American and UK and Irish retail operations have been particularly impacted by the weakened economic climate and the global economic downturn has negatively affected some of the international economies that have supported the strong growth in our International operations.

A growing number of insolvencies associated with an economic downturn could adversely affect our brokerage business through the loss of clients or by hampering our ability to place insurance and reinsurance business. In addition, an increase in mergers and acquisitions can also result in the loss of clients. While it is difficult to predict consequences of any further deterioration in global economic conditions on our business, any significant reduction or delay by our clients in purchasing insurance or making payment of premiums could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, the potential for a significant insurer to fail, be downgraded or withdraw from writing certain lines of insurance coverages that we offer our clients could negatively impact overall capacity in the industry, which could then reduce the placement of certain lines and types of insurance and reduce our revenues and profitability. The potential for an insurer to fail or be downgraded could also result in errors and omissions claims by clients.

The credit and economic conditions within certain European Union countries remain poor and have contributed to the instability in the global credit and financial markets. While the outcome of the current credit and economic crisis cannot be predicted, it is possible that it could have a negative effect on the global economy as a whole, and our business, operating results and financial condition. If the Eurozone crisis continues or further deteriorates, there will likely be a negative effect on our European business (which constitutes approximately 40 percent of our business in terms of revenue), as well as the businesses of our European clients. If the Euro were to be withdrawn entirely, or the Eurozone were to be dissolved as a common currency area, the legal and contractual consequences for holders of Euro-denominated obligations would be determined by laws in effect at such time. A significant devaluation of the Euro would cause the value of our financial assets that are denominated in Euros to be significantly reduced. Any of these conditions could ultimately harm our overall business, prospects, operating results, financial condition and cash flows.

In light of the current global economic uncertainty, we strive to manage our cost base vigorously in order to fund further growth initiatives. We cannot be certain whether we will be able to realize benefits from current cost-saving or revenue generating initiatives or any new initiatives that we may implement, including the announced headcount reductions we are proposing in 2013.

We do not control the premiums on which our commissions are based, and volatility or declines in premiums may seriously undermine our profitability.

We derive most of our revenues from commissions and fees for brokerage and consulting services. We do not determine insurance premiums on which our commissions are generally based. Premiums are cyclical in nature and may vary widely based on market conditions.

The years 2005 through 2010 were generally viewed as soft market years across most of our product offering and our commission revenues and operating margins throughout that period were negatively impacted, although in 2009 the market experienced modest stabilization in the reinsurance market and certain specialty markets.



Risk factors

Our North America, UK and Irish retail operations were particularly impacted by the weakened economic climate and continued soft market throughout 2009 and 2010 with no material improvement in rates across most sectors in these geographic regions. This resulted in declines in revenues in these operations, particularly amongst our smaller clients who have been especially vulnerable to the economic downturn.

In 2011, we saw some modest increases in catastrophe-exposed property insurance and reinsurance pricing levels driven by significant 2011 catastrophe losses including the Japanese earthquake and tsunami, the New Zealand earthquake, the mid-west US tornadoes and Thailand floods. In 2012 the trend in rates noted in 2011 in catastrophe-exposed regions continued as insurance and reinsurance rates in such regions or sectors have firmed or hardened. However in general, we continue to be negatively impacted by the soft insurance market across other sectors and most geographic regions.

There have also been recent signs that the unprofitability of certain business lines such as property, catastrophe and workers' compensation is slowly firming rates in those lines. However we believe that in the absence of a significant catastrophe loss or capital impairment in the industry, a universal turn in market rates is not likely to occur.

In addition, insurance carriers may seek to reduce their expenses by reducing the commission rates payable to insurance agents or brokers such as ourselves. The reduction of these commission rates, along with general volatility and/or declines in premiums, may significantly undermine our profitability.

Competition in our industry is intense, and if we are unable to compete effectively, we may suffer lower revenue, reduced operating margins and lose market share which could materially and adversely affect our business.

We face competition in all fields in which we operate, based on global capability, product breadth, innovation, quality of service and price. We compete with Marsh & McLennan and Aon, the two other providers of global risk management services, as well as with numerous specialist, regional and local firms. Competition for business is intense in all of our business lines and in every insurance market, and Marsh & McLennan and Aon have substantially greater market share than we do. Competition on premium rates has also exacerbated the pressures caused by a continuing reduction in demand in some classes of business. For example, rather than purchase additional insurance through brokers, many insureds have been retaining a greater proportion of their risk portfolios than previously. Industrial and commercial companies increasingly rely upon their own subsidiary insurance companies, known as captive insurance companies, self-insurance pools, risk retention groups, mutual insurance companies and other mechanisms for funding their risks, rather than buy insurance. Additional competitive pressures arise from the entry of new market participants, such as banks, accounting firms and insurance carriers themselves, offering risk management or transfer services.

In addition, to date, we have not accepted contingent commissions from carriers in the non-Human Capital areas of our retail brokerage business. To our knowledge, we are the only insurance broker that takes this stance. We seek to increase revenue through higher commissions and fees that we disclose to our clients, and to generate profitable revenue growth by focusing on the provision of value-added risk advisory services beyond traditional brokerage activities. We cannot be certain that such steps will help us to continue to generate profitable organic revenue growth. If we are unable to compete effectively against our competitors who are accepting or may accept contingent commissions, we may suffer lower revenue, reduced operating margins, and loss of market share which could materially and adversely affect our business.

Dependence on Key Personnel — The loss of our Chief Executive Officer or a number of our senior management or a significant number of our brokers could significantly impede our financial plans, growth, marketing and other objectives.

The loss of our Chief Executive Officer, a number of our senior management or a significant number of our brokers could significantly impede our financial plans, growth, marketing and other objectives. Our success depends to a substantial extent not only on the ability and experience of our Chief Executive Officer, Dominic Casserley, and other members of our senior management, but also on the individual brokers and teams that service our clients and maintain client relationships. The insurance and reinsurance brokerage industry has in the past experienced intense competition for the services of leading individual brokers and brokerage teams, and we have lost key individuals and teams to competitors. We believe that our future success will depend in part on our ability to attract and retain additional highly skilled and qualified personnel and to expand, train and manage our employee base. We may not continue to be successful in doing so because the competition for qualified personnel in our industry is intense.

Legal and Regulatory Risks

Our compliance systems and controls cannot guarantee that we are in compliance with all applicable federal and state or foreign laws and regulations, and actions by regulatory authorities or changes in applicable laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate may have an adverse effect on our business.

Our activities are subject to extensive regulation under the laws of the United States, the United Kingdom and the European Union and its member states, and the other jurisdictions in which we operate. Indeed, over the last few years, there has been a substantial increase in focus and developments in these laws and regulations. Compliance with laws and regulations that are applicable to our operations is complex and may increase our cost of doing business. These laws and regulations include insurance and financial industry regulations, economic and trade sanctions and laws against financial crimes, including money laundering, bribery or other corruption, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act or the UK Bribery Act. In most jurisdictions, governmental and regulatory authorities have the ability to interpret and amend these laws and regulations and impose penalties for non-compliance, including sanctions, civil remedies, fines, injunctions, revocation of licenses or approvals, suspension of individuals, limitations on business activities or redress to clients.

In 2011, we and the FSA announced a settlement for lapses by Willis Limited, our UK brokerage subsidiary, in its implementation and documentation of its controls to counter the risks of improper payments being made to non-FSA authorized overseas third parties engaged to help win business, particularly in high-risk jurisdictions.

As a result of the FSA settlement, we are conducting a further internal review of certain high-risk payments made by our UK subsidiary between 2005 and 2009.  We do not believe that this further internal review will result in any material fines or sanctions, but there can be no assurance that any resolution will not have an adverse impact on our ability to conduct our business in certain jurisdictions. While we believe that our current systems and controls are adequate and in accordance with all applicable laws and regulations, we cannot assure that such systems and controls will prevent any violations of applicable laws and regulations.

Our business, results of operations, financial condition or liquidity may be materially adversely affected by actual and potential claims, lawsuits, investigations and proceedings.

We are subject to various actual and potential claims, lawsuits, investigations and other proceedings relating principally to alleged errors and omissions in connection with the placement of insurance and reinsurance in the ordinary course of business. Because we often assist our clients with matters, including the placement of insurance coverage and the handling of related claims, involving substantial amounts of money, errors and omissions claims against us may arise which allege our potential liability for all or part of the amounts in question.

Claimants can seek large damage awards and these claims can involve potentially significant defense costs. Such claims, lawsuits and other proceedings could, for example, include allegations of damages for our employees or sub-agents improperly failing to place coverage or notify claims on behalf of clients, to provide insurance carriers with complete and accurate information relating to the risks being insured or to appropriately apply funds that we hold for our clients on a fiduciary basis. Errors and omissions claims, lawsuits and other proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business are covered in part by professional indemnity or other appropriate insurance. The terms of this insurance vary by policy year and self-insured risks have increased significantly in recent years. In respect of self-insured risks, we have established provisions against these items which we believe to be adequate in the light of current information and legal advice, and we adjust such provisions from time to time according to developments. Our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity may be adversely affected if in the future our insurance coverage proves to be inadequate or unavailable or there is an increase in liabilities for which we self-insure. Our ability to obtain professional indemnity insurance in the amounts and with the deductibles we desire in the future may be adversely impacted by general developments in the market for such insurance or our own claims experience.

We are also subject to actual and potential claims, lawsuits, investigations and proceedings outside of errors and omissions claims. An example of material claims for which we are subject that are outside of the error and omissions claims context relate to those arising out of the collapse of The Stanford Financial Group, for which we acted as brokers of record on certain lines of insurance.

The ultimate outcome of these matters cannot be ascertained and liabilities in indeterminate amounts may be imposed on us. It is thus possible that future results of operations or cash flows for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by an unfavorable resolution of these matters. In addition, these matters continue to divert management and personnel resources away from operating our business. Even if we do not experience significant monetary costs, there may also be adverse publicity associated with these matters that could result in reputational harm to the insurance brokerage industry in general or to us in particular that may adversely affect our business, client or employee relationships.



Risk factors

Accepting market derived income may cause regulatory or other scrutiny which could have a material adverse effect on our operations.

Insurance intermediaries have traditionally been remunerated by means of commission.  Increasingly, intermediaries are also obtaining revenue from insurance markets (carriers).  This  is commonly known as market derived income or 'MDI'.  MDI takes a variety of forms, including contingent and profit commissions, facilities administration charges, relationship services and fees for the provision of information.

MDI creates various risks.  Intermediaries have a duty to act in the best interests of their clients and payments from markets can incentivize intermediaries to put the interests of carriers ahead of their clients. In addition, MDI may be subject to further scrutiny by the various regulators.  Finally, payments from carriers to intermediaries could have implications under the UK Bribery Act and create potential exposure under fair competition and antitrust laws.

While accepting MDI is a lawful and acceptable business practice, and while we will only accept MDI in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations and consistent with ethical business practices, we cannot predict whether our position will cause regulatory or other scrutiny.

IT and Operational Risks

Interruption to or loss of our information processing capabilities or failure to effectively maintain and upgrade our information processing systems or data security breaches could cause material financial loss, loss of human resources, regulatory actions, reputational harm or legal liability.

Our business depends significantly on effective information systems. Our capacity to service our clients relies on effective storage, retrieval, processing and management of information. Our information systems also rely on the commitment of significant resources to maintain and enhance existing systems, develop and create new systems and products in order to keep pace with continuing changes in information processing technology or evolving industry and regulatory standards and to be at the forefront of a range of technology relevant to our business.

Computer viruses, hackers and other external hazards could expose our data systems to security breaches. These increased risks, and expanding regulatory requirements regarding data security, could expose us to data loss, monetary and reputational damages and significant increases in compliance costs.

If the information we rely on to run our business were found to be inaccurate or unreliable or if we fail to maintain effective and efficient systems (including through a telecommunications failure, failure to replace or update redundant or obsolete computer applications or software systems or if we experience other disruptions), this could result in material financial loss, regulatory action, reputational harm or legal liability.

Our inability to successfully recover should we experience a disaster or other significant disruption to business continuity could have a material adverse effect on our operations.

Our ability to conduct business may be adversely affected, even in the short-term, by a disruption in the infrastructure that supports our business and the communities where we are located. This may include a disruption caused by restricted physical site access, terrorist activities, disease pandemics, or outages to electrical, communications or other services used by our company, our employees or third parties with whom we conduct business. Although we have certain disaster recovery procedures in place and insurance to protect against such contingencies, such procedures may not be effective and any insurance or recovery procedures may not continue to be available at reasonable prices and may not address all such losses or compensate us for the possible loss of clients occurring during any period that we are unable to provide services. Our inability to successfully recover should we experience a disaster or other significant disruption to business continuity could have a material adverse effect on our operations.



Willis Group Holdings plc

Improper disclosure of personal data could result in legal liability or harm our reputation.

One of our significant responsibilities is to maintain the security and privacy of our clients’ confidential and proprietary information and the personal data of their employees. We maintain policies, procedures and technological safeguards designed to protect the security and privacy of this information in our database. However, we cannot entirely eliminate the risk of improper access to or disclosure of personally identifiable information. Our technology may fail to adequately secure the private information we maintain in our databases and protect it from theft, computer viruses, hackers or inadvertent loss. In such circumstances, we may be held liable to our clients, which could result in legal liability or impairment to our reputation resulting in increased costs or loss of revenue. Further database privacy, identity theft, and related computer and internet issues are matters of growing public concern and are subject to frequently changing rules and regulations. Our failure to adhere to or successfully implement processes in response to changing regulatory requirements in this area could result in legal liability or impairment to our reputation in the marketplace.

Our non-core operations, such as our Willis Capital Markets & Advisory business, pose certain underwriting, advisory or reputational risks and can have a significant adverse impact on our financial results.

We provide a broad range of brokerage, reinsurance and risk management consulting services to our clients worldwide. We also engage in certain non-core operations. For example, our Willis Capital Markets & Advisory business provides advice to insurance and reinsurance companies on a broad array of mergers and acquisition transactions as well as capital markets products, including acting as underwriter or agent for primary issuances, operating a secondary insurance-linked securities trading desk and engaging in general capital markets and strategic advisory work. These operations may pose certain underwriting, advisory or reputational risks to our core business.

In addition, these non-core operations, although not material to the Group as a whole may, in any period, have a material effect on our results of operations. For example, our Willis Capital Markets & Advisory business is transaction-based which can cause results to differ from period-to-period. In addition, our financial results in 2011 and first three quarters of 2012 were adversely impacted by the significant deterioration of the financial results of our Loan Protector business driven by the loss of clients through attrition and M&A activity, industry-wide commission pressures and a slowdown in foreclosures.

Financial Risks

Our outstanding debt could adversely affect our cash flows and financial flexibility.

We had total consolidated debt outstanding of approximately

$2.4 billion

as of

December 31, 2012

and our


interest expense was $

128 million

. Although management believes that our cash flows will be sufficient to service this debt, there may be circumstances in which required payments of principal and/or interest on this debt could adversely affect our cash flows and this level of indebtedness may:

•

require us to dedicate a significant portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our debt, thereby reducing the availability of cash flow to fund capital expenditures, to pursue other acquisitions or investments in new technologies, to pay dividends and for general corporate purposes;

•

increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic conditions, including if we borrow at variable interest rates, which makes us vulnerable to increases in interest rates generally;

•

limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes or challenges relating to our business and industry; and

•

put us at a competitive disadvantage against competitors who have less indebtedness or are in a more favorable position to access additional capital resources.

The terms of our current financings also include certain limitations. For example, the agreements relating to the debt arrangements and credit facilities contain numerous operating and financial covenants, including requirements to maintain minimum ratios of consolidated EBITDA to consolidated cash interest expense and maximum levels of consolidated funded indebtedness in relation to consolidated EBITDA, in each case subject to certain adjustments.

A failure to comply with the restrictions under our credit facilities and outstanding notes could result in a default under the financing obligations or could require us to obtain waivers from our lenders for failure to comply with these restrictions. The occurrence of a default that remains uncured or the inability to secure a necessary consent or waiver could cause our obligations with respect to our debt to be accelerated and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.



Risk factors

Our pension liabilities may increase which could require us to make additional cash contributions to our pension plans reducing the cash available for other uses.

We have two principal defined benefit plans: one in the United Kingdom and the other in the United States, and in addition, we have several smaller defined benefit pension plans in certain other countries in which we operate. Total cash contributions to these defined benefit pension plans in 2012 were

$120 million

. Cash contributions of approximately

$131 million

will be required in 2013 for these pension plans, although we may elect to contribute more. Future estimates are based on certain assumptions, including discount rates, interest rates, mortality, fair value of assets and expected return on plan assets.

In 2012, we agreed a revised funding strategy with the UK plan's trustee under which we are committed to make additional cash contributions in the event that our adjusted EBITDA exceeds certain thresholds, or we make exceptional returns for our shareholders, including share buybacks or special dividends.  As a result, we may be committed to make additional contributions in 2014 through 2016 based on the prior year's performance.

We have taken actions to manage our pension liabilities, including closing our UK and US plans to new participants and restricting final pensionable salaries. Future benefit accruals in the US pension plan were also stopped, or frozen, on May 15, 2009. Nevertheless, the determination of pension expense and pension funding is based on a variety of rules and regulations. Changes in these rules and regulations could impact the calculation of pension plan liabilities and the valuation of pension plan assets. They may also result in higher pension costs, additional financial statement disclosure, and accelerate and increase the need to fully fund our pension plans through increased cash contributions. Further, a significant decline in the value of investments that fund our pension plan, if not offset or mitigated by a decline in our liabilities, may significantly alter the values and actuarial assumptions used to calculate our future pension expense and we could be required to fund our plan with significant additional amounts of cash. In addition to the critical assumptions described above, our plans use certain assumptions about the life expectancy of plan participants and surviving spouses. Periodic revision of those assumptions can materially change the present value of future benefits and therefore the funded status of the plans and the resulting periodic pension expense. Changes in our pension benefit obligations, the related net periodic costs or credits, and the required level of future cash contributions, may occur in the future due to any variance of actual results from our assumptions and changes in the number of participating employees. The need to make additional cash contributions may reduce the Company’s financial flexibility and increase liquidity risk by reducing the cash available to meet our other obligations, including the payment obligations under our credit facilities and other long-term debt, or other needs of our business.

We could incur substantial losses, including with respect to our own cash and fiduciary cash held on behalf of insurance companies and clients, if one of the financial institutions we use in our operations failed.

The deterioration of the global credit and financial markets has created challenging conditions for financial institutions, including depositories and the financial strength of these institutions may continue to decline. We maintain significant cash balances at various US depository institutions that are significantly in excess of the US Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation insurance limits. We also maintain significant cash balances in foreign financial institutions. A significant portion of this fiduciary cash is held on behalf of insurance companies or clients. If one or more of the institutions in which we maintain significant cash balances were to fail, our ability to access these funds might be temporarily or permanently limited, and we could face a material liquidity problem and potentially material financial losses. We could also be liable to claims made by the insurance companies or our clients regarding the fiduciary cash held on their behalf.

A downgrade to our corporate credit rating and the credit ratings of our outstanding debt may adversely affect our borrowing costs and financial flexibility.

A downgrade in our corporate credit rating or the credit ratings of our debt would increase our borrowing costs including those under our credit facilities, and reduce our financial flexibility. In addition, certain downgrades would trigger a step-up in interest rates under the indentures for our 6.2% senior notes due 2017 and our 7.0% senior notes due 2019

,

which would increase our interest expense. If we need to raise capital in the future, any credit rating downgrade could negatively affect our financing costs or access to financing sources. This may in turn impact the assumptions when performing our goodwill impairment testing which may reduce the excess of fair value over carrying value of the reporting units.



Willis Group Holdings plc

We face certain risks associated with the acquisition or disposition of businesses and lack of control over investments in associates.

In pursuing our corporate strategy, we may acquire or dispose of or exit businesses or reorganize existing investments. The success of this strategy is dependent upon our ability to identify appropriate opportunities, negotiate transactions on favorable terms and ultimately complete such transactions. Once we complete acquisitions or reorganizations there can be no assurance that we will realize the anticipated benefits of any transaction, including revenue growth, operational efficiencies or expected synergies. For example, if we fail to recognize some or all of the strategic benefits and synergies expected from a transaction, goodwill and intangible assets may be impaired in future periods.

In addition, we may not be able to integrate acquisitions successfully into our existing business, and we could incur or assume unknown or unanticipated liabilities or contingencies, which may impact our results of operations. If we dispose of or otherwise exit certain businesses, there can be no assurance that we will not incur certain disposition related charges, or that we will be able to reduce overheads related to the divested assets.

We also own an interest in a number of associates, such as Gras Savoye, where we do not exercise management control and we are therefore unable to direct or manage the business to realize the anticipated benefits that we can achieve through full integration.

If our goodwill becomes impaired, we may be required to record significant charges to earnings.

We have a substantial amount of goodwill on our balance sheet as a result of acquisitions we have completed. We review goodwill for impairment annually or whenever events or circumstances indicate impairment may have occurred.

Our annual goodwill impairment analysis is performed each year at October 1.  At October 1, 2012 our analysis showed the estimated fair values of our Global and International reporting units were significantly in excess of the carrying values, and therefore did not result in an impairment charge (2011: $nil, 2010: $nil).  However, the fair value of our North American reporting unit was not in excess of the carrying value and an impairment charge has been recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Operations of

$492 million

(2011: $

nil

; 2010: $

nil

).

Application of the impairment test requires judgment, including the identification of reporting units, assignment of assets, liabilities and goodwill to reporting units and determination of fair value of each reporting unit. Notwithstanding the fact that we have recognized an impairment charge this year for our North American reporting unit, the risk remains that a significant deterioration in a key estimate or assumption or a less significant deterioration to a combination of assumptions or the sale of a part of a reporting unit could result in an impairment charge in the future, which could have a significant adverse impact on our reported earnings.

For further information on our testing for goodwill impairment, see ‘Critical Accounting Estimates’ under Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.

We are a holding company and, therefore, may not be able to receive dividends or other distributions in needed amounts from our subsidiaries.

Willis Group Holdings is organized as a holding company that conducts no business of its own. We are dependent upon dividends and other payments from our operating subsidiaries to meet our obligations for paying principal and interest on outstanding debt obligations, for paying dividends to shareholders and for corporate expenses. Legal and regulatory restrictions, foreign exchange controls, as well as operating requirements of our subsidiaries, may limit our ability to obtain cash from these subsidiaries. In the event our operating subsidiaries are unable to pay dividends and make other payments to Willis Group Holdings, we may not be able to service debt, pay obligations or pay dividends on ordinary shares.



Risk factors

International Risks

Our significant non-US operations, particularly our London market operations, expose us to exchange rate fluctuations and various risks that could impact our business.

A significant portion of our operations is conducted outside the United States. Accordingly, we are subject to legal, economic and market risks associated with operating in foreign countries, including devaluations and fluctuations in currency exchange rates; imposition of limitations on conversion of foreign currencies into pounds sterling or dollars or remittance of dividends and other payments by foreign subsidiaries; hyperinflation in certain foreign countries; imposition or increase of investment and other restrictions by foreign governments; and the requirement of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws.

We report our operating results and financial condition in US dollars. Our US operations earn revenue and incur expenses primarily in US dollars. In our London market operations, however, we earn revenue in a number of different currencies, but expenses are almost entirely incurred in pounds sterling. Outside the United States and our London market operations, we predominantly generate revenue and expenses in the local currency. The table gives an approximate analysis of revenues and expenses by currency in 2012.

________________

(i)

In 2012, the proportion of expenses incurred in pounds sterling was lower than in 2011 as a result of increased US dollar expenses, primarily due to the impact of the goodwill impairment charge.

Because of devaluations and fluctuations in currency exchange rates or the imposition of limitations on conversion of foreign currencies into US dollars, we are subject to currency translation exposure on the profits of our operations, in addition to economic exposure. Furthermore, the mismatch between pounds sterling revenues and expenses, together with any net sterling balance sheet position we hold in our US dollar denominated London market operations, creates an exchange exposure.

For example, as the pound sterling strengthens, the US dollars required to be translated into pounds sterling to cover the net sterling expenses increase, which then causes our results to be negatively impacted. However, any net sterling asset we are holding will be more valuable when translated into US dollars. Given these facts, the strength of the pound sterling relative to the US dollar has in the past had a material negative impact on our reported results. This risk could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition, cash flow and results of operations in the future.

Where needed, we deploy a hedging strategy to mitigate part of our operating exposure to exchange rate movements, but such mitigating attempts may not be successful. For more information on this strategy, see Part II Item 8 - 'Note 26 Derivative Financial Instruments and Hedging Activities'.

In conducting our businesses around the world, we are subject to political, economic, legal, market, nationalization, operational and other risks that are inherent in operating in many countries.

In conducting our businesses and maintaining and supporting our global operations, we are subject to political, economic, legal, market, nationalization, operational and other risks. Our businesses and operations continue to expand into new regions throughout the world, including emerging markets. The possible effects of economic and financial disruptions throughout the world could have an adverse impact on our businesses. These risks include:

•

the general economic and political conditions in foreign countries, for example

,

the potential dissolution of the Euro and the devaluation of the Venezuelan Bolivar;

•

the imposition of controls or limitations on the conversion of foreign currencies or remittance of dividends and other payments by foreign subsidiaries;

•

imposition of withholding and other taxes on remittances and other payments from subsidiaries;

•

imposition or increase of investment and other restrictions by foreign governments;

•

fluctuations in our effective tax rate;

•

difficulties in controlling operations and monitoring employees in geographically dispersed and culturally diverse locations; and



Willis Group Holdings plc

•

the potential costs and difficulties in complying, or monitoring compliance, with a wide variety of foreign laws (some of which may conflict with US or other sources of law), laws and regulations applicable to US business operations abroad, including rules relating to trade sanctions administered by the US Office of Foreign Assets Control, the EU, the UK and the UN, and the requirements of the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act as well as other anti-bribery and corruption rules and requirements in the countries in which we operate.

Legislative and regulatory action could materially and adversely affect us and our effective tax rate may increase.

There is uncertainty regarding the tax policies of the jurisdictions where we operate (which include the potential legislative actions described below), and our effective tax rate may increase and any such increase may be material. Additionally, the tax laws of Ireland and other jurisdictions could change in the future, and such changes could cause a material change in our effective tax rate. For example, legislative action may be taken by the US Congress which, if ultimately enacted, could override tax treaties upon which we rely or could broaden the circumstances under which we would be considered a US resident, each of which could materially and adversely affect our effective tax rate and cash tax position. We cannot predict the outcome of any specific legislative proposals. However, if proposals were enacted that had the effect of limiting our ability to take advantage of tax treaties between Ireland and other jurisdictions (including the US), we could be subjected to increased taxation. In addition, any future amendments to the current income tax treaties between Ireland and other jurisdictions could subject us to increased taxation.

Irish law differs from the laws in effect in the United States and may afford less protection to holders of our securities.

It may not be possible to enforce court judgments obtained in the United States against us in Ireland based on the civil liability provisions of the US federal or state securities laws. In addition, there is some uncertainty as to whether the courts of Ireland would recognize or enforce judgments of US courts obtained against us or our directors or officers based on the civil liabilities provisions of the US federal or state securities laws or hear actions against us or those persons based on those laws. We have been advised that the United States currently does not have a treaty with Ireland providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters. Therefore, a final judgment for the payment of money rendered by any US federal or state court based on civil liability, whether or not based solely on US federal or state securities laws, would not be directly enforceable in Ireland. While not directly enforceable, it is possible for a final judgment for the payment of money rendered by any US federal or state court based on civil liability to be enforced in Ireland through common law rules. However, this process is subject to numerous established principles and would involve the commencement of a new set of proceedings in Ireland to enforce the judgment.

As an Irish company, Willis Group Holdings is governed by the Irish Companies Acts, which differ in some material respects from laws generally applicable to US corporations and shareholders, including, among others, differences relating to interested director and officer transactions and shareholder lawsuits. Likewise, the duties of directors and officers of an Irish company generally are owed to the company only. Shareholders of Irish companies generally do not have a personal right of action against directors or officers of the company and may exercise such rights of action on behalf of the Company only in limited circumstances. Accordingly, holders of Willis Group Holdings securities may have more difficulty protecting their interests than would holders of securities of a corporation incorporated in a jurisdiction of the United States.

Share data

Our shares have been traded on the New York Stock Exchange (‘NYSE’) under the symbol ‘WSH’ since June 11, 2001. The high and low sale prices of our shares, as reported by the NYSE, are set forth below for the periods indicated.

On February 15, 2013, the last reported sale price of our shares as reported by the NYSE was $36.69 per share. As of February 15, 2013 there were approximately 1,337 shareholders on record of our shares.

Dividends

We normally pay dividends on a quarterly basis to shareholders of record on March 31, June 30, September 30 and December 31. The dividend payment dates and amounts are as follows:

There are no governmental laws, decrees or regulations in Ireland which will restrict the remittance of dividends or other payments to non-resident holders of the Company’s shares.



Share data and dividends

In circumstances where one of Ireland’s many exemptions from dividend withholding tax (‘DWT’) does not apply, dividends paid by the Company will be subject to Irish DWT (currently 20 percent). Residents of the US should be exempted from Irish DWT provided relevant documentation supporting the exemption has been put in place. While the US-Ireland Double Tax Treaty contains provisions reducing the rate of Irish DWT in prescribed circumstances, it should generally be unnecessary for US residents to rely on the provisions of this treaty due to the wide scope of exemptions from DWT available under Irish domestic law. Irish income tax may also arise in respect of dividends paid by the Company. However, US residents entitled to an exemption from Irish DWT generally have no Irish income tax liability on dividends.

With respect to non-corporate US shareholders, certain dividends from a qualified foreign corporation may be subject to reduced rates of taxation. A foreign corporation is treated as a qualified foreign corporation with respect to dividends received from that corporation on shares that are readily tradable on an established securities market in the United States, such as our shares. Non-corporate US shareholders that do not meet a minimum holding period requirement for our shares during which they are not protected from the risk of loss or that elect to treat the dividend income as ‘investment income’ pursuant to section 163(d)(4) of the Code will not be eligible for the reduced rates of taxation regardless of our status as a qualified foreign corporation. In addition, the rate reduction will not apply to dividends if the recipient of a dividend is obligated to make related payments with respect to positions in substantially similar or related property. This disallowance applies even if the minimum holding period has been met. US shareholders should consult their own tax advisors regarding the application of these rules given their particular circumstances.

Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds

During the quarter ended

December 31, 2012

, no shares were issued by the Company without registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.

Purchases of Equity Securities by the Issuer and Affiliated Purchasers

The Company is authorized to buy back shares, by way of redemption, and will consider whether to do so from time to time, based on many factors, including market conditions. The Company is authorized to purchase up to one billion shares from time to time in the open market (such open market purchases would be effected as redemptions under Irish law) and it may also redeem its shares through negotiated trades with persons who are not affiliated with the Company as long as the cost of the acquisition of the Company's shares does not exceed $925 million.

In February 2012, the Company announced that during the year it intended to buy back up to $100 million of shares under this authorization, from time to time, depending on many factors including market conditions. The purchase of the $100 million of shares was completed by September 30, 2012. There remains approximately $824 million available to purchase common shares  under the current authorization.

On October 1, 2008, we completed the acquisition of HRH, at the time the eighth largest insurance and risk management intermediary in the United States. We recognized goodwill and other intangible assets on the HRH acquisition of approximately $1.6 billion and $651 million, respectively.

(ii)

The Company collects premiums from insureds and, after deducting its commissions, remits the premiums to the respective insurers; the Company also collects claims or refunds from insurers which it then remits to insureds. Uncollected premiums from insureds and uncollected claims or refunds from insurers (‘fiduciary receivables’) are recorded as fiduciary assets on the Company’s consolidated balance sheet. Unremitted insurance premiums, claims or refunds (‘fiduciary funds’) are also recorded within fiduciary assets.

Item 7 —

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

This discussion includes references to non-GAAP financial measures as defined in

Regulation G of the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission ('SEC'). We

present such non-GAAP financial measures, specifically, organic growth in commissions

and fees, adjusted operating margin, adjusted operating income, adjusted net income

from continuing operations and adjusted earnings per diluted share from continuing

operations, as we believe such information is of interest to the investment community

because it provides additional meaningful methods of evaluating certain aspects of

the Company's operating performance from period to period on a basis that may not be

otherwise apparent on a GAAP basis. Organic growth in commissions and fees excludes

the impact of acquisitions and disposals, period over period movements in foreign

exchange, legacy contingent commissions assumed as part of the HRH acquisition, and

investment and other income from growth in revenues and commissions and fees.

Adjusted operating income

,

adjusted operating margin, adjusted net income from continuing operations and

adjusted earnings per diluted share from continuing operations are calculated by

excluding the impact of certain specified items from operating income, net income from continuing

operations, and earnings per diluted share from continuing operations, respectively, the most directly comparable GAAP measures. These financial measures

should be viewed in addition to, not in lieu of, the consolidated financial

statements for the year ended

December 31, 2012

.

This discussion includes forward-looking statements, including under the headings 'Executive Summary', 'Liquidity and Capital Resources', 'Critical Accounting Estimates' and 'Contractual Obligations'. Please see 'Forward-Looking Statements' for

certain cautionary information regarding forward-looking statements and a list of

factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those predicted in

those statements.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Business Overview

We provide a broad range of insurance broking, risk management and consulting services to our clients worldwide and organize our business into three segments: Global, North America and International.

Our Global business provides specialist brokerage and consulting services to clients worldwide arising from specific industries and activities including Aerospace; Energy; Marine; Construction, Property and Casualty; Financial and Executive Risks; Financial Solutions; Faber Global; Fine Art, Jewelry and Specie; Special Contingency Risks; and Reinsurance.

North America and International comprise our retail operations and provide services to small, medium and large corporations and the Human Capital practice, our largest product-based practice group, provides health, welfare and human resources consulting and brokerage services.

In our capacity as advisor and insurance broker, we act as an intermediary between our clients and insurance carriers by advising our clients on their risk management requirements, helping clients determine the best means of managing risk, and negotiating and placing insurance with insurance carriers through our global distribution network.

We derive most of our revenues from commissions and fees for brokerage and consulting services and do not determine the insurance premiums on which our commissions are generally based. Commission levels generally follow the same trend as premium levels as they are derived from a percentage of the premiums paid by the insureds. Fluctuations in these premiums charged by the insurance carriers can therefore have a direct and potentially material impact on our results of operations.

Due to the cyclical nature of the insurance market and the impact of other market conditions on insurance premiums, commission revenues may vary widely between accounting periods. A period of low or declining premium rates, generally known as a 'soft' or 'softening' market, generally leads to downward pressure on commission revenues and can have a material adverse impact on our commission revenues and operating margin. A 'hard' or 'firming' market, during which premium rates rise, generally has a favorable impact on our commission revenues and operating margin.



Business discussion

Market Conditions

The years 2005 through 2010 were generally viewed as soft market years across most of our product offerings and our commission revenues and operating margins throughout that period were negatively impacted, although in 2009 the market experienced modest stabilization in the reinsurance market and certain specialty markets.

Our North America, UK and Irish retail operations were particularly impacted by the weakened economic climate and continued soft market throughout 2009 and 2010 with no material improvement in rates across most sectors in these geographic regions. This resulted in declines in revenues in these operations, particularly amongst our smaller clients who have been especially vulnerable to the economic downturn.

In 2011, we saw some modest increases in catastrophe-exposed property insurance and reinsurance pricing levels driven by significant 2011 catastrophe losses including the Japanese earthquake and tsunami, the New Zealand earthquake, the mid-west US tornadoes and Thailand floods. The trend in rates noted in 2011 in catastrophe-exposed regions continues as insurance and reinsurance rates in such regions  firmed or hardened during 2012. However, in general, we continued to be negatively impacted by the soft insurance market and challenging economic conditions across other sectors and most geographic regions.

There have been recent signs that the unprofitability of certain business lines such as property catastrophe and workers' compensation is slowly firming rates in those lines. However, we believe that, in the absence of a significant catastrophe loss or capital impairment in the industry, a universal turn in market rates is not likely to occur.

The outlook for our business, operating results and financial condition continues to be challenging due to the economic conditions within certain European Union countries, in particular, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Portugal and Spain. If the Eurozone crisis continues or further deteriorates, there will likely be a negative effect on our European business as well as the businesses of our European clients. A significant devaluation of the Euro would cause the value of our financial assets that are denominated in Euros to be reduced.

Financial Performance

Consolidated Financial Performance


compared to


Total revenues in 2012 of

$3,480 million

increased by

$33 million

, or

1 percent

, compared to 2011, including a $59 million or

2 percent

negative impact from movements in foreign exchange. Organic growth in commissions and fees of

3 percent

was driven by our International and Global operations. Our North America operations reported a decline of

1 percent

in commissions and fees, due to lower revenues generated by Loan Protector, a specialty business acquired as part of the HRH business, and the continued adverse impact of difficult economic conditions in the US.

Total expenses in 2012 of $

3,689 million

increased $

808 million

compared to 2011, primarily due to the recognition of a $

492 million

non-cash goodwill impairment charge related to our North American reporting unit, a $200 million write-off of unamortized cash retention awards following the decision to eliminate the repayment requirement of past awards, and a $252 million expense related to the accrual for 2012 cash bonuses due to be paid in 2013, that do not feature a repayment requirement.

Excluding these expenses, total operating expenses declined $136 million, or 5 percent, principally due to $180 million expense recognised in 2011 related to the Operational Review and favorable movements in foreign exchange partially offset by increases in salary and benefits expenses linked to annual pay reviews, new hires and investments in targeted businesses and geographies.

Net loss attributable to Willis shareholders from continuing operations was $

446 million

or a loss of $

2.58

per diluted share in 2012 compared to a profit of $

203 million

or $

1.15

per diluted share in 2011. The

$649 million

decrease in net income compared to 2011 primarily reflects the increase in total expenses described above and the $113 million charge to establish a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets in our U.S. operations, partially offset by the non-recurrence of the $131 million



Willis Group Holdings plc

post-tax cost in 2011 relating to the make-whole amounts on the repurchase and redemption of $500 million of our senior debt and the write-off of related unamortized debt issuance costs and by the revenue growth achieved during the year. Net income was also adversely impacted by a $7 million reduction in interest in earnings of associates, net of tax, mainly due to declining performance in our principal associate, Gras Savoye.


compared to


Despite difficult market conditions, total revenues in 2011 of $3,447 million increased by $115 million, or 3 percent, compared to 2010. This included organic growth in commissions and fees of 2 percent driven by our International and Global operations. Our North America operations reported a revenue decline of 4 percent, including a 4 percent decline in organic commissions and fees reflecting lower revenues generated by Loan Protector and the continued adverse impact of difficult economic conditions in the US.

Total expenses in 2011 of $2,881 million increased $302 million compared to 2010, primarily due to incremental expense relating to the 2011 Operational Review, a $22 million write-off of an uncollectible accounts receivable balance relating to periods prior to January 1, 2011, discussed later in this section, continued investment to support future growth, increased incentives amortization relating to our cash retention awards, reinstatement of salary reviews for all associates in March 2011 and 401(k) matching contributions for our US associates from January 2011, unfavorable foreign currency translation and an $11 million UK FSA regulatory settlement. These increases were partially offset by cost savings arising from implementation of the 2011 Operational Review, reduced pension expense of $24 million and the year-on-year $8 million benefit from the release of funds and reserves related to potential legal liabilities.

Net income attributable to Willis shareholders from continuing operations was $203 million or $1.15 per diluted share in 2011 compared to $455 million or $2.66 per diluted share in 2010. The $252 million reduction in net income compared to 2010 primarily reflects the increase in total expenses described above and the $131 million post-tax cost relating to the make-whole amounts on the repurchase and redemption of $500 million of our senior debt and the write-off of related unamortized debt issuance costs, partly offset by revenue growth achieved during the year. Net income was also adversely impacted by an $11 million reduction in interest in earnings of associates, net of tax, mainly due to declining performance in our principal associate, Gras Savoye.

Adjusted Operating Income, Adjusted Net Income from Continuing Operations and Adjusted Earnings per Diluted Share from Continuing Operations

Adjusted operating income, adjusted net income from continuing operations and adjusted earnings per diluted share from continuing operations are calculated by excluding the impact of certain items (as detailed below) from operating income, net income from continuing operations, and earnings per diluted share from continuing operations, respectively, the most directly comparable GAAP measures.

The following items are excluded from operating income and net income from continuing operations as applicable:

(i)

the additional accrual recognized following the change in cash retention awards under our annual incentive program;

(ii)

write-off of unamortized cash retention awards following decision to eliminate the repayment requirement on past awards;

(iii)

goodwill impairment charge;

(iv)

valuation allowance against deferred tax assets;

(v)

write-off of uncollectible accounts receivable balance and associated legal fees arising in Chicago due to fraudulent overstatement of commissions and fees;

(vi)

costs associated with the 2011 Operational Review;



Business discussion

(vii)

significant legal and regulatory settlements which are managed centrally;

(viii)

gains and losses on the disposal of operations;

(ix)

insurance recoveries;

(x)

foreign exchange loss from the devaluation of the Venezuelan currency; and

(xi)

make-whole amounts on repurchase and redemption of senior notes and write-off of unamortized debt issuance costs.

We believe that excluding these items, as applicable, from operating income, net income from continuing operations and earnings per diluted share from continuing operations provides a more complete and consistent comparative analysis of our results of operations. We use these and other measures to establish Group performance targets and evaluate the performance of our operations. The Company also uses both adjusted earnings per diluted share from continuing operations and adjusted operating margin measures to form the basis of establishing and assessing components of compensation.

As set out in the tables below, adjusted operating margin at

21.6 percent

in 2012, was down


basis points compared to 2011, while adjusted net income from continuing operations at

$454 million

was $

28 million

lower than in 2011. Adjusted earnings per diluted share from continuing operations was

$2.58

in 2012, compared to

$2.74

in 2011.

(j)

Potentially issuable shares were not included in the calculation of diluted earnings per share, GAAP basis, because the Company's net loss from continuing operations rendered their impact anti-dilutive.



Willis Group Holdings plc

Goodwill Impairment

We completed our annual goodwill impairment test as of October 1, 2012 and concluded that an impairment charge was required to reduce the carrying value of the goodwill associated with the Company's North America reporting unit. The goodwill impairment charge for the North America reporting unit amounted to $492 million. There was no impairment for the Global and International reporting units, as the fair values of these units were significantly in excess of their carrying value.

Correction of commissions and fees overstatement relating to 2011 and prior periods

As previously disclosed, in early 2012 we identified through our internal financial control process and a subsequent internal investigation an uncollectible accounts receivable balance of approximately $40 million in Chicago from the fraudulent overstatement of Commissions and fees from the years 2005 to 2011.

We concluded that the total $40 million of overstatement does not materially affect our previously issued financial statements for any of the prior periods and we corrected the misstatement by recognizing a charge to Other operating expenses to write off the uncollectible receivable (a) of $13 million (including legal expenses) in the first quarter of 2012 and (b) of $22 million in the fourth quarter of 2011.  In the fourth quarter 2011 we also reversed a $6 million balance of Commissions and fees which had been recorded during 2011 and $2 million of Salaries and benefits expense representing an over-accrual of production bonuses relating to the overstated revenue.  During 2012, we have recorded within Other operating expenses a $10 million insurance settlement from insurers in respect of our claim under Group insurance policies, for compensation paid out in the years 2005 to 2010 on the fraudulently overstated revenues discussed above.

The employees in question, who have been terminated, were not members of Willis executive management nor did they play a significant role in internal control over financial reporting.  Based on the results of our investigation, which has now been completed, we do not believe that any client or carrier funds were misappropriated or that any other business units were affected.

We have enhanced our internal controls in relation to the business unit in question, including enhanced procedures over receipt of checks and application of cash, increased segregation of duties between the operating unit and the accounting and settlement function, and additional central sign off requirement on revenue recognition.

Headcount Reduction

In our initial assessment of the Company's organizational design, we have identified a number of positions that we can eliminate and leases we can exit to realize cost savings. The assessment is ongoing but will be completed in the first quarter of 2013 and is expected to result in the elimination of approximately 200 full-time positions.

As a result we expect to incur a pre-tax charge of approximately $35 million to $45 million in the first quarter of 2013. These actions are expected to deliver cost savings, primarily through headcount reduction, of approximately $20 million to $25 million in 2013, beginning in the second quarter, and annualized cost savings of approximately $25 million to $30 million.

Cash retention awards

For the past several years, certain cash retention awards under the Company's annual incentive programs included a feature which required the recipient to repay a proportionate amount of the annual award if the employee voluntarily left the Company before a specified date, which was generally three years following the award. As previously disclosed, the Company made the cash payment to the recipient in the year of grant and recognized the payment in expense ratably over the period it was subject to repayment, beginning in the quarter in which the award was made. The unamortized portion of cash retention awards was  recorded within 'other current assets' and 'other non-current assets' in the consolidated balance sheets.

The following table sets out the amount of cash retention awards made and the related amortization of those awards for the three years ended December 31, 2012.



Business discussion

Included within the

$216 million

amortization of cash retention awards in 2012 is a $7 million allowance for amounts estimated to be uncollectible.

The remaining increase in amortization of cash retention awards of $24 million reflects the higher level of cash retention awards paid in 2012 compared to cash retention awards paid in 2009, which were fully amortized in 2011.

In December 2012, the Company decided to eliminate the repayment requirement from past annual cash retention awards under the Company's annual incentive plan and, as a result, recognized a one-time, non-cash, pre-tax charge of

$200 million

which represents the write-off of the unamortized balance of past awards.

There were, however, a number of off-cycle awards with a fixed period guarantee attached, for which we have not waived the repayment requirement. The unamortized portion of these awards amounted to $9 million at December 31, 2012.

In addition, the Company has replaced annual cash retention awards with annual cash bonuses which will not include a repayment requirement. The Company has accrued an additional

$252 million

within deferred revenue and accrued expenses for these 2012 cash bonuses to be paid in 2013.

As of

December 31, 2012

,

December 31, 2011

and

December 31, 2010

, we included

$9 million

,

$196 million

and

$173 million

respectively, within other current assets and other non-current assets on the balance sheet, which represented the unamortized portion of cash retention award payments made on or before those dates.

Pension expense

We recorded a net pension credit on our UK defined benefit pension plan in 2012 of

$5 million

(2011: charge of

$6 million

; 2010: charge of

$28 million

). On our US defined benefit pension plan, we recorded a net pension charge of

$3 million

in 2012 (2011: $

nil

; 2010:

$1 million

). On our international and US non-qualified defined benefit pension plans, we recorded a net pension charge of $

4 million

in 2012 (2011:

$5 million

; 2010:

$6 million

).

The movement from a $6 million charge on the UK plan in 2011 to a $5 million credit in 2012 was the result of higher asset returns and lower service cost, reflecting certain changes to plan benefits, partly offset by higher amortization of prior period losses and increased interest cost.

The 2011 UK plan charge was $22 million lower compared to 2010 as the benefits of higher asset returns, lower amortization of prior period losses and a lower service cost reflecting certain changes to plan benefits were partly offset by an increased interest cost.

The US pension charge was $3 million higher in 2012 compared with 2011 reflecting increased asset return from a higher asset base being more than offset by an increase in amortization of prior period losses.

The 2011 US pension charge was $1 million lower compared with 2010 reflecting an increased asset return from a higher asset base partly offset by a reduction in amortization of prior period losses.

See 'Contractual Obligations' below for further information on our obligations relating to our pension plans.



Willis Group Holdings plc

Acquisitions and Disposals

In fourth quarter 2012, we acquired 100 percent of Avalon Actuarial, Inc, a Canadian actuarial consulting firm for cash consideration of $25 million. Additional consideration of up to approximately $5 million is payable in 2016 based on achievement of certain revenue targets.

Also in the fourth quarter 2012, we sold 100 percent of our reinsurance operation in Mauritius, Willis Re Mauritius Limited, for minimal consideration. A net loss of approximately $1 million was recognized, primarily related to the write-off of goodwill held in relation to this operation.

In second quarter 2012, we acquired 100 percent of Attain Consulting Limited and Trustee Principles Limited at a total cost of $3 million.

In first quarter 2012 we acquired 49.9 percent of Gras Savoye Re at a cost of $29 million, increasing our shareholding from 50.1 percent to 100 percent.

Also in first quarter 2012 we sold 49.9 percent of our retail operation in Peru, Willis Corredores de Seguros S.A., to Grupo Credito S.A. for $3 million reducing our shareholding to 50.1 percent.  Grupo Credito S.A. is an investment arm of Peru's largest financial services holding company.

was led by high single-digit growth across Reinsurance and Willis Faber & Dumas. Global Specialties reported low single-digit growth as strong growth from our Marine, Energy, Financial Solutions, and Construction specialties were partially offset by declines in Aerospace, which continues to be hampered by competitive pricing and a soft rate environment.

The North America segment reported a

1 percent

decline in organic commissions and fees, compared to 2011. Whilst  new business levels were higher than in 2011, resulting in growth in certain regions and business segments, these were more than offset by lower Loan Protector revenues, the impact of the weakened economy, which negatively impacted our Construction and Human Capital practice groups, and a modest decrease in client retention levels.

The International segment reported flat growth in commissions and fees compared with 2011, comprising

5 percent

organic commissions and fees growth and a

5 percent

negative impact from foreign currency translation.  Organic growth in commissions and fees was led by double-digit growth in our Latin America region, supported by high single-digit growth in Asia and Eastern Europe. Our Western Europe operations reported low single-digit growth despite the continued weakness of economies within the Eurozone.



Business discussion

Our International and Global segments earn a significant portion of their revenues in currencies other than the US dollar, including the Euro and Pound sterling. For 2012, our International segment's reported revenues were adversely impacted by the net effects of foreign currency translation.

Investment income in 2012 at

$18 million

was

$13 million

lower than in 2011, primarily due to declining net yields on cash and cash equivalents.  Organic commissions and fees growth by segment is discussed further in 'Operating Results - Segment Information', below.

Salaries and Benefits

Salaries and benefits increased by $

388 million

, or

19 percent

, in 2012 compared with 2011. Foreign currency movements lowered salaries and benefits by $34 million, or 1 percent.  The year-on-year net favorable impact from foreign currency translation was driven primarily by the movement of the US dollar against the Pound sterling (in which our London Market based operations incur the majority of their expenses).

Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, salaries and benefits increased by $422 million, or 20 percent, compared with 2011 primarily due to the $452 million expense recognized as a result of the change in remuneration policy for future incentive awards and the elimination of the repayment requirement on past awards; an approximate $55 million increase in salaries, including associated taxes and benefits, resulting from new hires and annual pay reviews; increases in incentives linked to production; long term incentive plans and the amortization of cash retention awards.. These increases were partially offset by the $135 million expense recognized in salaries and benefits associated with the 2011 Operational Review and lower defined benefit pension plan expenses.

Other Expenses

Other operating expenses

were $

75 million

, or

12 percent

, lower in 2012 compared with 2011. Foreign currency movements positively impacted expenses by $35 million, or 6 percent.

Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, other operating expenses decreased by $40 million or 6 percent compared with 2011 primarily due to the non-recurrence of the $73 million expense recognized in other operating expenses associated with the 2011 Operational Review and the $10 million insurance recovery in 2012 related to the previously disclosed fraudulent activity, partially offset by increases in certain other costs, including provisioning for bad debts and higher technology expenditure.

Depreciation expense

was

$79 million

in


, compared with

$74 million

in


. The increase is primarily due to a number of information technology related projects becoming operational at the end of 2011 and during first half 2012 partially offset by $5 million depreciation charge incurred in 2011 related to the Operational Review.

Amortization of intangible assets

was

$59 million

in


, a reduction of $9 million compared to


. The decrease primarily reflects the ongoing reduction in the HRH acquisition-related amortization.

Goodwill impairment

charge was

$492 million

in 2012. This was a non-cash charge recognized related to the impairment of the carrying value of the North America reporting unit's goodwill. For further information on our testing for goodwill impairment, see 'Critical Accounting Estimates', below.

Net loss on disposal of operations

of

$3 million

was related principally to the dissolution of a joint venture operation in India and loss recognized on disposal of Mauritian reinsurance operation.

Interest Expense

Interest expense was $128 million in


compared to

$156 million

in


. The decrease in interest expense primarily reflects the non-recurrence of a $10 million write-off of debt fees in 2011 related to the refinancing of the term loan and revolving credit facility and savings as a result of the lower coupon payable and reduced fee amortization on our new debt issued in March 2011 and December 2011.

Income Taxes

The effective tax rate on ordinary income for 2012 was 25 per cent, compared with 24 per cent for 2011, with the increase driven primarily by higher than anticipated US state income tax expense, the benefit from the higher tax rates at which costs associated with the 2011 Operational Review are relieved and from a different geographic mix of earnings. The effective tax



Willis Group Holdings plc

rate on ordinary income is calculated before the impact of certain discrete items.  Discrete items occurring in 2012 with a significant impact on the tax rate are:

•

a tax credit of $34 million on the $492 million charge related to the impairment of the carrying value of the North America reporting unit's goodwill.  The tax credit arises in relation to that part of the charge that is attributable to tax deductible goodwill;

•

tax related to the $252 million charge for the additional incentive accrual arising from a change in remuneration policy which is generally relieved at a higher rate than the underlying rate;

•

tax related to the $200 million charge for the write-off of unamortized retention awards which is generally relieved at a higher rate than the underlying rate;

•

a valuation allowance of $125 million made against US deferred tax assets recorded following cumulative losses being incurred in the US.  The cumulative losses are primarily attributable to exceptional charges associated with the 2011 Operational review, the impairment of North America goodwill and the additional incentive costs associated with the change in remuneration policy.  Of the total valuation allowance, $113 million was recorded in the income statement and $12 million in other comprehensive income;

•

a non-deductible  charge of $11 million for a settlement  with former partners related to the termination of a joint venture arrangement in India;

•

adjustments made in respect of tax on profits of prior periods to bring in line the Company's tax provisions to filed tax positions; and

•

the net tax impact of the $3 million loss on disposal of operations.

Including the impact of discrete items, a tax charge of $101 million was recorded on a net loss from continuing operations before interest in earnings of associates of $337 million.  This compares to a tax rate of 13 percent in 2011.

Interest in Earnings of Associates, net of Tax

The majority of our interest in earnings of associates relates to our share of ownership of Gras Savoye, the leading broker in France. Interest in earnings of associates, net of tax, in


was

$5 million

compared to

$12 million

in


. The decline was mainly driven by a reduction in net income reported by our principal associate, Gras Savoye.

Similar to many businesses located in the Eurozone, Gras Savoye's operations are being pressured by the economic conditions. In addition, Gras Savoye recently appointed a new CEO and is undergoing a business review that is designed to drive growth in revenues and improve operational efficiencies.

Discontinued Operations, net of Tax

There have not been any discontinued operations in 2012.

On December 31, 2011, the Company disposed of Global Special Risks, LLC, Faber & Dumas Canada Ltd and the trade and assets of Maclean, Oddy & Associates, Inc.. The gain (net of tax) on this disposal was

$2 million

Organic commissions and fees growth excludes: (i) the impact of foreign currency translation; (ii) the first twelve months of net commission and fee revenues generated from acquisitions; (iii) the net commission and fee revenues related to operations disposed of in each period presented; (iv) in North America, legacy contingent commissions assumed as part of the HRH acquisition and that had not been converted into higher standard commission; and (v) investment income and other income from reported revenues.

(b)

Included in North America reported commissions and fees were legacy HRH contingent commissions of $5 million in


, compared with $11 million in


.

(c)

Reported commissions and fees and organic commissions and fees growth for Global for 2011 included a 2011 favorable impact from a change in accounting methodology in a Global Specialty business of $6 million.

(d)

Reported commissions and fees included a favorable impact from a change in accounting methodology in a specialty business in North America of $7 million in the year ended December 31, 2010.

Our methods of calculating these measures may differ from those used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited.

Revenue increased by $115 million, or 3 percent, in 2011 compared to 2010. Commissions and fees increased by $121 million or 4 percent, including organic growth in commissions and fees of 2 percent, which comprised 4 percent net new business growth driven by solid new business generation and higher retention of existing clients, and a 2 percent negative impact from renewal fluctuations and other market factors.

There was a net 2 percent year-over-year benefit to revenue growth from foreign currency translation driven by the weakening of the US dollar against a number of currencies in which we earn our revenues.

The 2 percent growth in organic commissions and fees comprised net growth in our segments:

•

Global achieved 7 percent growth, including growth in our Reinsurance, Global Specialties and Willis Faber and Dumas businesses, together with a $6 million 2011 benefit from a change in accounting within a Global Specialty business to conform to current Group accounting policy;

•

International achieved 5 percent organic growth driven primarily by our Latin America and Eastern Europe regions; and

•

North America reported a 4 percent decline in organic commissions and fees, primarily driven by the revenue decline in Loan Protector (a small specialty business acquired as part of the HRH business that works with financial institutions to confirm their loans are properly insured and interests are adequately protected). Excluding Loan Protector, the North America segment recorded a 2 percent decline in organic commissions and fees as the benefit of new business generation was more than offset by a 1 percent decline in client retention levels, the continued negative impact of the soft market and ongoing weakened economic conditions in the US.

Investment income in 2011 at $31 million was $7 million lower than in 2010, as low interest rates across the globe, in particular in the UK and US, together with the roll-off of our interest rate hedge program continued to impact our investment income.



Willis Group Holdings plc

Organic commissions and fees growth by segment is discussed further in 'Operating Results - Segment Information', below.

Salaries and Benefits

Salaries and benefits increased $219 million, or 12 percent, in 2011 compared with 2010, primarily reflecting additional expense in 2011 of $135 million associated with our 2011 Operational Review, a $66 million increase from the amortization of cash retention awards and the year-on-year net adverse impact from foreign currency translation, driven primarily by the movement of the US dollar against the Pound sterling (in which our London Market based operations incur the majority of their expenses). Furthermore, we incurred an additional $10 million expense relating to the reinstatement of our 401(k) match plan for our North America employees from January 2011 and incremental expense following reinstatement of annual salary reviews for all employees from April 2011. These increases were partly offset by cost savings arising from implementation of the 2011 Operational Review, reduced payments of non-retentive incentives and a $24 million decrease in pension expense driven by a higher return on assets and lower amortization of prior period gains and losses.

Other Expenses

Other operating expenses

were $92 million, or 16 percent, higher in 2011 compared with 2010, primarily reflecting $40 million of additional expense associated with the 2011 Operational Review, a $22 million write-off of an uncollectible accounts receivable balance relating to periods prior to January 1, 2011, and the $11 million second quarter UK FSA regulatory settlement and increased expense in support of revenue growth initiatives. These were partly offset by cost savings arising from implementation of the 2011 Operational Review, the year-over-year favorable comparison due to the $12 million 2010 charge relating to the devaluation of the Venezuelan currency, the $8 million year-over-year benefit from the release of funds and reserves related to potential legal liabilities and positive year-over-year foreign currency translation, driven primarily by gains in 2011 on our forward rate hedging program, compared to losses in 2010.

Depreciation expense

was $74 million in 2011, compared with $63 million in 2010. The increase primarily reflects accelerated depreciation expense of $5 million in 2011 relating to systems rationalization in connection with the 2011 Operational Review and depreciation of newly capitalized systems project costs in 2011.

Amortization of intangible assets

was $68 million in 2011, a reduction of $14 million compared to 2010. The decrease primarily reflects the year-over-year benefit of the 2010 amortization of the HRH non-compete agreement acquired in 2008, which was fully amortized in 2010.

Make-whole on repurchase and redemption of senior notes and write-off of unamortized debt issuance costs

We issued $800 million of new debt in March 2011 and net proceeds of approximately $787 million were used to repurchase and redeem $500 million of 12.875 percent senior notes due 2016 and make related make-whole payments totaling $158 million. In addition to the make-whole payment we also wrote off unamortized debt issuance costs of $13 million.

Interest Expense

Interest expense was $156 million in 2011, a reduction of $10 million compared to 2010. The decrease in interest expense primarily reflects the lower coupon payable on our new debt issued in March 2011, the period-over-period decrease in the outstanding balance on our 5-year term loan facility and net gains recognized on our forward rate hedging program. These benefits were partially offset by the $10 million fourth quarter expense relating to the write-off of debt issuance costs following the refinancing of our bank facility.



Business discussion

Income Taxes

The effective tax rate on ordinary income for 2011 was 24 percent, compared with 26 percent for 2010, with the reduction driven primarily by the benefit from the higher tax rates at which costs associated with the 2011 Operational Review are relieved and a different geographic mix of business. The effective tax rate on ordinary income is calculated before the impact of certain discrete items. The significant discrete items occurring in 2011 are:

•

tax related to the make-whole payment on repurchase and redemption of senior notes and write-off of unamortized debt issuance costs which are relieved at a higher rate than the underlying rate;

•

the net impact of gains and losses on disposals recorded in continuing operations;

•

tax related to the write-off of an uncollectible accounts receivable balance which is relieved at a higher rate than the underlying rate;

•

the impact of the UK FSA regulatory settlement expense for which no tax relief is available;

•

the impact of the change in rate of UK corporate income tax being applied to the Company's opening temporary differences; and

•

adjustments made in respect of tax on profits of prior periods to bring in line the Company's tax provisions to filed tax positions.

Including the impact of discrete items, the effective tax rate was 13 percent in 2011 compared to 24 percent in 2010.

Interest in Earnings of Associates, net of Tax

Interest in earnings of associates, net of tax, was $12 million in 2011, compared with $23 million in 2010. The decline was mainly driven by a reduction in net income reported by our principal associate, Gras Savoye, following recent refinancing actions taken by the company, ongoing restructuring activity and the negative impact on their results from adverse economic conditions in France and other parts of Europe.

Discontinued Operations, net of Tax

Net income from discontinued operations in 2011 relates to our fourth quarter disposal of Global Special Risks, LLC, Faber & Dumas Canada Ltd and the trade and assets of Maclean, Oddy & Associates, Inc. We recorded net income from discontinued operations of $1 million in 2011, comprising a net loss for the year of $1 million offset by the benefit of a $2 million net gain on disposal.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

Debt

Total debt, total equity and the capitalization ratio at

December 31, 2012

and


were as follows (in millions, except percentages):

In July 2012, a new revolving credit facility of 15 million Chinese Yuan Renminbi 'RMB' ($2 million) was put in place. Drawings on this facility bear interest at 110 percent of the applicable short term interest rate of an RMB loan having a term equal to the tenor of that drawing, as published by the People's Bank of China 'PBOC'; prevailing as at the drawdown date of that drawing. The facility expires on July 11, 2013. As at December 31, 2012 ¥nil ($nil) had been drawn down on the facility. This facility is solely for the use of our Chinese subsidiary and is available for general working capital purposes.

In March 2011 we issued $800 million of new debt, comprised of $300 million 4.125% senior notes due 2016 and $500 million 5.750% senior notes due 2021. We received net proceeds, after underwriting discounts and expenses, of approximately $787 million, which were used largely to repurchase and redeem $500 million 12.875% senior notes due 2016 and make related make-whole payments totaling $158 million, which represented a slight discount to the make-whole redemption amount provided in the indenture governing this debt. In addition to the make-whole payments of $158 million, we also wrote off unamortized debt issuance costs of $13 million.

In December 2011 we refinanced our bank facility, comprising a new 5-year $300 million term loan and a new 5-year $500 million revolving credit facility. The $300 million term loan repaid the majority of the $328 million balance outstanding on our $700 million 5-year term loan facility and the $500 million revolving credit facility replaces our existing $300 million and $200 million revolving credit facilities. Unamortized debt issuance costs of $10 million relating to these facilities were written off in December 2011 following completion of the refinancing. In 2011, we made $83 million of mandatory repayments against the 5-year term loan before repaying the $328 million balance in December 2011.

These refinancing actions have lengthened our debt maturity profile. At

December 31, 2012

, we have $nil outstanding under the $500 million facility (December 31, 2011: $nil),  the UK facility $20 million facility (December 31, 2011: $nil) and the RMB facility. At

December 31, 2012

the only mandatory debt repayments falling due over the next 12 months are scheduled repayments on our $300 million 5-year term loan totaling $15 million.

Liquidity

Our principal sources of liquidity are cash from operations and $522 million available under our revolving credit facilities, of which the $20 million UK facility is solely for use by our main regulated UK entity in certain exceptional circumstances. At

December 31, 2012

we had

$500 million

of cash and cash equivalents, of which approximately $150 million is available for general corporate purposes.

As of

December 31, 2012

, our short-term liquidity requirements consisted of $124 million payment of interest on debt, $15 million of mandatory repayments under our 5-year term loan,  $1 million of revolving credit facility commitment fees, capital expenditure and working capital requirements. In addition, our estimated pension contributions for 2013 are

$142 million

, excluding salary sacrifice contributions. Our long-term liquidity requirements consist of the principal amount of outstanding notes and borrowings under our 5-year term loan facility.

Based on current market conditions and information available to us at this time, we believe that we have sufficient liquidity to meet our cash needs for at least the next 12 months.

Fiduciary funds

As an intermediary, we hold funds generally in a fiduciary capacity for the account of third parties, typically as the result of premiums received from clients that are in transit to insurers and claims due to clients that are in transit from insurers. We report premiums, which are held on account of, or due from, clients as assets with a corresponding liability due to the insurers. Claims held by, or due to, us which are due to clients are also shown as both assets and liabilities.

Fiduciary funds are generally required to be kept in certain regulated bank accounts subject to guidelines which emphasize capital preservation and liquidity; such funds are not available to service the Company’s debt or for other corporate purposes. Notwithstanding the legal relationships with clients and insurers, the Company is entitled to retain investment income earned on fiduciary funds in accordance with industry custom and practice and, in some cases, as supported by agreements with insureds.

Share Buybacks

The Company is authorized to buy back shares, by way of redemption, and will consider whether to do so from time to time, based on many factors, including market conditions. The Company is authorized to purchase up to one billion shares from time to time in the open market (such open market purchases would be effected as redemptions under Irish law) and it may also redeem its shares through negotiated trades with persons who are not affiliated with the Company as long as the cost of the acquisition of the Company's shares does not exceed $925 million. In February 2012, the Company announced that during the year it intended to buy back up to $100 million of shares under this authorization.

During 2012, we bought back a total of 2,796,546 shares at a total price of $100 million and at an average price of $35.87 on a trade date basis. The purchase of the $100 million of shares was completed during third quarter 2012.

REVIEW OF SEGMENTAL RESULTS

We organize our business into three segments: Global, North America and International. Our Global business provides specialist brokerage and consulting services to clients worldwide for risks arising from specific industries and activities. North America and International comprise our retail operations and provide services to small, medium and major corporations.

compared to


Revenues

Commissions and fees of

$1,124 million

were

$51 million

, or

5 percent

, higher in 2012 compared with 2011. Foreign exchange movements had a net

1 percent

impact on commissions and fees; organic growth was

6 percent

.

Organic growth included positive growth across Reinsurance, Global Specialties, Willis Faber & Dumas and WCMA, as strong new business and higher one-off transactions, primarily in WCMA, were partially offset by increases in lost business.

Organic growth in Global Specialties was led by strong performances from Energy, Marine, Financial Solutions and Construction Specialities reflecting single-digit net new business.  This growth was partially offset by declines in Aerospace, which continues to be negatively impacted by competitive pricing and rate decreases.

Reinsurance reported mid-single digit growth in 2012, as growth in the International, Specialty and North America divisions was partially offset by the non-recurrence of a fee related to a 2011 profitability initiative. Rates had a modest positive impact on commission and fees in the year.

Willis Faber & Dumas also reported mid-single digit growth in 2012.

WCMA is a transaction-oriented business and its results are more variable than some of our other businesses. In 2012 we reported significantly higher organic commissions and fees than in 2011. Growth in the WCMA business was positively impacted by a higher volume of advisory and catastrophe bond deals closing during the year.

Operating margin

Operating margin was

32.9 percent

in 2012 and

32.5 percent

in 2011.  The organic growth in commissions and fees discussed above, and lower defined benefit pension costs were offset by higher salary and benefit expense due to the impact of annual salary increases and new hires, higher production linked incentives and increases to discretionary costs.


compared to


Revenues

Commissions and fees of

$1,073 million

were $86 million, or

9 percent

, higher in 2011 compared with 2010, reflecting organic commissions and fees growth of

7 percent

and a net benefit from foreign currency translation of 2 percent. Organic growth included the benefit of net new business generation despite the adverse impact of the continued difficult economic environment and soft market in many of the specialty classes.

Organic growth included positive growth across Reinsurance, Global Specialties, Willis Faber & Dumas and WCMA businesses, together with a $6 million first quarter 2011 benefit from a change in accounting within a Global Specialty business to conform to current Group accounting policy.

Organic growth in Reinsurance in 2011 was led by growth in North America and Asia-Pacific, and included the benefit of new business growth and a profitability initiative that may or may not recur. Overall Reinsurance showed stable pricing with modest increases in some lines and geographies, particularly those affected by catastrophe losses.

Organic growth in Global Specialties was led by strong contributions from Marine, Energy, Financial Solutions and Aerospace, reflecting good new business, high retention levels, targeted hiring of producer talent and connectivity between the retail network and specialty businesses. However, the operating environment remains challenging across most Global Specialty



Business discussion

businesses with depressed world trade and transit volumes, industry consolidation and pressure on financing of construction projects still evident.

Willis Faber & Dumas reported positive organic commissions and fees growth in 2011 and our WCMA business was marginally positive compared to 2010.

The 2 percent net benefit to revenue growth from foreign currency translation in 2011 primarily reflected the period-over-period positive impact of the weakening of the US dollar against both the Euro and Pound sterling, in which we earn a significant portion of Global revenues.

Client retention levels improved to 91 percent for 2011, compared with 90 percent for 2010.

Operating margin was 32.5 percent in 2011 compared to 32.1 percent in 2010 as the benefit of 7 percent organic commissions and fees growth discussed above and an $18 million decrease in pension expense was offset by a net negative impact from foreign currency movements, an $8 million increase in incentive expense, including amortization of cash retention award payments and the impact of costs associated with continued support of current and future growth.

Operating margin is impacted by foreign exchange movements as the London market operations earn revenues in US dollars, Pounds sterling and Euros and primarily incur expenses in Pounds sterling. In addition, they are exposed to exchange risk on certain Pound sterling-denominated balances.

The period-over-period net negative impact from foreign currency movements in 2011 primarily reflected the increased US dollar value of our Pound sterling expense base as a result of the weakening of the US dollar versus the Pound sterling and the net negative impact of translation of non-USD assets and liabilities into US dollar in our London market operations. These factors were partially offset by the US dollar weakening against the Pound sterling and the Euro, increasing the US dollar value of our Pound and Euro denominated revenues.

North America

Our North America business provides risk management, insurance brokerage, related risk services and employee benefits brokerage and consulting to a wide array of industry and client segments in the United States, Canada and Mexico.

Revenues

Commissions and fees of

$1,306 million

were

, lower in 2012 compared with 2011. Legacy contingent commissions assumed as part of the HRH acquisition amounted to

$2 million

compared to

in 2011.

Organic commissions and fees growth declined

1 percent

in 2012 compared with 2011, whilst  new business levels were higher than in 2011, resulting in growth in certain regions and business segments. These were more than offset by lower Loan Protector revenues and the impact of weakened economy.

The decline in the financial performance of our Loan Protector business had a 1 percent negative impact on North America organic growth in commissions and fees and for the full year 2011 and negatively impacted the segment's revenue by $10 million. The Loan Protector decline was driven by the loss of clients through attrition and M&A activity, industry-wide commission pressures and a slowdown in foreclosures in the US in 2011.

Client retention levels were 91 percent in 2012 consistent with 2011.

Operating margin

Operating margin in North America was

18.3 percent

in 2012 compared with

20.5 percent

in 2011, reflecting the adverse impact from the

1 percent

decline in organic commissions and fees growth discussed above, a

$4 million

reduction in investment income due to declining yields and increases to incentive expenses and increased production linked awards and stock based compensation. These were partly offset by a reduction to other expenses, including lower premises costs and a reduction in E&O provisions.


compared to


Revenues

Commissions and fees of $1,314 million were $55 million, or 4 percent, lower in 2011 compared with 2010 of which $6 million was attributable to the decrease in legacy contingent commissions assumed as part of the HRH acquisition from $11 million in 2010 to $5 million in 2011.

Organic commissions and fees growth declined 4 percent in 2011 compared with 2010, as the benefits of new business generation and growth in some regions were more than offset by declining Loan Protector revenues and the impact of the soft market conditions and weakened economy across most sectors.

The decline in the financial performance of our Loan Protector business had a 2 percent negative impact on North America organic growth in commissions and fees and for the full year 2011 negatively impacted the segment's revenue by $27 million. The Loan Protector decline was driven by the loss of clients through attrition and M&A activity, industry-wide commission pressures and a slowdown in foreclosures in the US in 2011.

Following the introduction of health care reform legislation in 2010, some major health insurance carriers in North America began to change their compensation practices in particular lines of business in certain locations. In response to market pressures those changes caused, we announced in July 2011 that in order to remain competitive, we would begin accepting standard compensation based on volume, but would continue to resist traditional contingent commissions and bonus payments because, while legal, we believe these forms of compensation create conflicts with our clients. After several months of review under changing market conditions, we have concluded that we cannot be fully competitive on Human Capital business if we continue to refuse these legal forms of compensation. Consequently, we will begin to accept all forms of compensation from Employee Benefits providers effective April 1, 2012 in North America.

Client retention levels were 91 percent in 2011 compared to 92 percent in 2010.



Business discussion

Operating margin

Operating margin in North America was 20.5 percent in 2011 compared with 23.1 percent in 2010, reflecting the adverse impact from the 4 percent decline in organic commissions and fees growth discussed above, a period-over-period increase in 401(k) match expense of $10 million following its reinstatement in January 2011 and a $7 million increase in incentive expense, including amortization of cash retention award payments. These were partly offset by a $5 million decrease in stock-based compensation expense and the benefit of cost reductions driven by the 2011 Operational Review and continued focus on expense management.

International

Our International business comprises our retail operations in Western Europe, Central and Eastern Europe the United Kingdom, Asia, Australasia, the Middle East, South Africa and Latin America. The services provided are focused according to the characteristics of each market and vary across offices, but generally include direct risk management and insurance brokerage and employee benefits consulting.

compared to


Revenues

Commissions and fees of

$1,028 million

were

$1 million

higher in 2012 compared with 2011. Foreign exchange movements had a

5 percent

negative impact on commissions and fees, and organic commissions and fees growth was

5 percent

. Organic growth included double digit new business growth, partly offset by slight increases to lost business. Rates and other market factors had no significant impact on commissions and fees in the year.

Despite the ongoing economic difficulties faced by the Eurozone, our large retail operations in the region delivered low single-digit growth in 2012, driven by strong growth in Germany, Sweden and Denmark, although this growth was partially offset by declines in Ireland and Norway.

Our Latin American operation delivered high double-digit growth in 2012, the result of  significant new business growth; principally in Brazil, Venezuela and Argentina.

Asia reported high single-digit growth in organic commissions and fees in 2012 led by strong growth in Japan, China and Korea.

Organic commissions and fees growth in our UK retail operation was flat in 2012, compared with 2011, this reflects a stabilization of the business in the region following a 2 percent decline in 2011.



Willis Group Holdings plc

A significant part of International's revenues are earned in currencies other than the US dollar, most notably the Euro,  and Australian dollar. The net

5 percent

negative impact from foreign currency translation in 2012 primarily reflected the weakening of the US dollar against these and other currencies in which we earn International revenues.

Client retention levels decreased to 93 percent for 2012, compared with 94 percent for 2011.

Operating margin

Operating margin in International was

17.6 percent

in 2012, compared with

21.2 percent

in 2011. The decrease primarily reflected significant increases in salaries and benefits as a result of new hires supporting growth in targeted geographies and annual pay increases,  negative impact of foreign exchange on revenues and increases to certain provisions including bad debts. These decreases were partly offset by the benefit from organic commissions and fees discussed above.


compared to


Revenues

Commissions and fees of $1,027 million were $90 million, or 10 percent, higher in 2011 compared with 2010, comprising 5 percent organic growth and a net 5 percent positive impact from foreign currency translation. Organic growth included net new business growth of 7 percent, partly offset by the negative impact from rates and other market factors.

There were strong contributions to 2011 organic commissions and fees growth from most regions, including double-digit growth in our Latin America and Eastern Europe regions, together with single-digit growth in Asia and Western Europe. In particular, there was strong growth in Brazil, Chile, Argentina, Russia and China.

The single-digit organic commissions and fees growth in our large retail operation in Continental Europe was primarily driven by strong growth in Italy, Spain and Germany, despite the ongoing challenging economic conditions in this region, offset by lower commissions and fees in Denmark and the Netherlands.

Organic commissions and fees growth in our UK and Ireland retail operations, declined 2 percent in 2011, compared with the same period 2010, driven by the economic pressures that continue to affect both the UK and Ireland.

A significant part of International's revenues are earned in currencies other than the US dollar, most notably the Euro, Pound sterling and Australian dollar. The net 5 percent benefit from foreign currency translation in 2011 primarily reflected the weakening of the US dollar against these and other currencies in which we earn International revenues.

Client retention levels increased to 94 percent for 2011, compared with 93 percent for 2010.

Operating margin

Operating margin in International was 21.2 percent in 2011, compared with 23.8 percent in 2010, with the decrease primarily reflecting a $17 million increase in incentive expenses including amortization of cash retention award payments, the impact of the reinstated annual salary review for all employees from April 2011 and increased spending on initiatives to drive future growth, including investment hires. These increases were partly offset by the benefit from organic commissions and fees growth and favorable foreign currency movements as discussed above and reduced pension expense.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES

Our accounting policies are described in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Management considers that the following accounting estimates or assumptions are the most important to the presentation of our financial condition or operating performance. Management has discussed its critical accounting estimates and associated disclosures with our Audit Committee.

Pension expense

We maintain defined benefit pension plans for employees in the US and UK. Both of these plans are now closed to new entrants and, with effect from May 15, 2009 we closed our US defined benefit plan to future accrual. New employees in the UK are offered the opportunity to join a defined contribution plan and in the US are offered the opportunity to join a 401(k) plan. We also have smaller defined benefit plans in Ireland, Germany, Norway and the Netherlands and a non-qualified plan in the US. These schemes have combined total assets of

$150 million

and a combined net liability for pension benefits of

$30 million

as of

December 31, 2012

. Elsewhere, pension benefits are typically provided through defined contribution plans.

We recorded a

$5 million

net pension credit on our UK defined benefit pension scheme and a net pension charge of

$3 million

on our US defined benefit pension plans in


, compared with net pension charges of

$6 million

and $

nil

respectively in


. On our international defined benefit pension plans and US non-qualified plan, we recorded a net pension charge of

$4 million

in


, compared with

$5 million

in


.

Based on

December 31, 2012

assumptions, except for the expected rate of return updated to 7.25 percent, we expect the net pension credit in


to be unchanged for the UK plan. The net pension charge will decrease by $6 million for the US plan and be unchanged for the international plans.

We make a number of assumptions when determining our pension liabilities and pension expense which are reviewed annually by senior management and changed where appropriate. The discount rate will be changed annually if underlying rates have moved whereas the expected long-term return on assets will be changed less frequently as longer term trends in asset returns emerge or long term target asset allocations are revised. Other material assumptions include rates of participant mortality, the expected long-term rate of compensation and pension increases and rates of employee termination. Our approach to determining appropriate assumptions for our UK and US pension plans is set out below.

With all other assumptions held constant.

(c)

Discount rate

During 2012 we continued to use a duration-based approach, which more closely matches the actual timing of expected cash flows to the applicable discount rate. The selected rate used to discount UK plan liabilities in 2012 was

4.40%

compared with

4.80%

at

December 31, 2011

with the decrease reflecting falls in pound sterling high-quality bond yields during


.

The lower discount rate generated an actuarial loss of approximately $186 million at

December 31, 2012

.

Expected and actual asset returns

Expected long-term rates of return on plan assets are developed from the expected future returns of the various asset classes using the target asset allocations. The expected long-term rate of return used for determining the net UK pension expense in

was

(

7.50%

), equivalent to an expected return in


of $181 million (


: $161 million).  Effective January 1, 2013, the expected long-term rate of return was decreased to 7.25%. The decrease in the expected long-term rate of return followed a change in the underlying target asset mix, which reflects the expected commencement in 2013 of the de-risking strategy proposed by the Trustees which will lead to a strategic target asset allocation with a greater weighting to non-return seeking assets.

The expected and actual returns on UK plan assets for the three years ended

December 31, 2012

were as follows:

Mortality

The mortality assumption used during 2012 is the 90/105% PNA00 table for males / females, unchanged from the assumptions used during 2011.

As an indication of the longevity assumed, our calculations assume that a UK male retiree aged 65 at

As an indication of the longevity assumed, our calculations assume that a US male retiree aged 65 at

December 31, 2012

, would have a life expectancy of 19 years.

Intangible assets

Intangible assets represent the excess of cost over the value of net tangible assets of businesses acquired. We classify our intangible assets into three categories;

•

Goodwill;

•

‘Customer and Marketing Related’ which includes client lists, client relationships, trade names and non-compete agreements; and

•

‘Contract-based, Technology and Other’ which includes all other purchased intangible assets.

Client relationships acquired on the HRH acquisition are amortized over twenty years in line with the pattern in which the economic benefits of the client relationships are expected to be consumed. Over 80% of the client relationships intangible will have been amortized after 10 years. Non-compete agreements acquired in connection with the HRH acquisition were amortized over two years on a straight line basis. Intangible assets acquired in connection with other acquisitions are amortized over their estimated useful lives on a straight line basis. Goodwill is not subject to amortization.

We review purchased intangible assets with finite lives for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of these intangible assets is assessed based on the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the continued use of the asset. If the undiscounted future cash flows are less than the carrying amount, the purchased intangible assets with finite lives are considered to be impaired. The amount of the impairment is measured as the difference between the carrying value and the fair value.

Goodwill impairment review

We test goodwill for impairment annually or whenever events or circumstances indicate impairment may have occurred.

The goodwill impairment test is a two step analysis. Step One requires the fair value of each reporting unit to be compared to its carrying value. If the fair value of a reporting unit is determined to be greater than the carrying value of the reporting unit, goodwill is not considered impaired and no further testing is necessary. If the fair value of a reporting unit is less than the carrying value, we perform Step Two. Step Two requires the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill to be compared with the carrying amount of that goodwill. Determining the implied fair value of goodwill requires a valuation of the reporting unit’s tangible and intangible assets and liabilities in a manner similar to the allocation of the purchase price in a business combination. Any excess of the value of a reporting unit over the amounts assigned to its assets and liabilities is referred to as the implied fair value of goodwill. If the carrying amount of reporting unit goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess.

Application of the impairment test requires judgment, including the identification of reporting units, assignment of assets, liabilities and goodwill to reporting units and determination of fair value of each reporting unit.



Business discussion

Determination of reporting units

We have determined our reporting units to be consistent with our operating segments: North America; International and Global. Goodwill is allocated to these reporting units based on the original purchase price allocation for acquisitions within the reporting units.

Fair value of reporting units

The fair value of each reporting unit is estimated using a discounted cash flow methodology and, in aggregate, validated against our market capitalization.

Determining the fair value of a reporting unit is judgmental in nature and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions include estimations of future cash flows which are dependent on internal forecasts, long-term rate of growth for our business and determination of our weighted average cost of capital.

We base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable but that are unpredictable and inherently uncertain. Therefore changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value and result in goodwill impairment.

In addition, we make certain judgments and assumptions in allocating shared assets and liabilities to determine the carrying values for each of our reporting units.

Annual goodwill impairment analysis

We completed our annual goodwill impairment test as of October 1, 2012 and concluded that an impairment charge was required to reduce the carrying value of the goodwill associated with the Company's North America reporting unit. The goodwill impairment charge for the North America reporting unit amounted to $492 million. There was no impairment for the Global and International reporting units, as the fair values of these units were significantly in excess of their carrying value.

Under the income approach, the fair value of the North America reporting unit was determined based on the present value of estimated future cash flows. The fair value measurements used unobservable inputs in a discounted cash flow model based on the Company's most recent forecasts. Such projections were based on management's estimates of revenue growth rates and operating margins, taking into consideration industry and market conditions, and the uncertainty related to the reporting unit's ability to execute on the projected cash flows with consideration of market comparables where appropriate. The discount rate was based on the weighted-average cost of capital adjusted for the relevant risk associated with market participant expectations of characteristics of the individual reporting units.

As the fair value of the reporting unit was less than its carrying value, the second step of the impairment test was performed to measure the amount of any impairment loss. In the second step, the North America reporting unit's fair value was allocated to all of the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit, including any unrecognized intangible assets. The fair value of intangible assets associated with the North America reporting unit included customer relationship intangible assets, which were valued using a multiple period excess earnings approach involving discounted future projections of associated revenue streams.

The decline in the fair value of the North America reporting unit, as well as differences between fair values and carrying values for other assets and liabilities in the second step of the goodwill impairment test, resulted in an implied fair value of goodwill substantially below the carrying value of the goodwill for the reporting unit. As a result, the Company recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $492 million.

As previously disclosed, the North America reporting unit has been hampered by the declining Loan Protector business results, the effect of the soft economy in the U.S., which has significantly impacted the Construction and Human Capital sectors, and declining retention rates primarily related to M&A activity and lost legacy HRH business.

The decline in the estimated fair value of the reporting unit resulted from lower projected revenue growth rates and profitability levels as well as an increase in the discount rate used to calculate the discounted cash flows. The increase in the discount rate was due to increases in the risk-free rate and small company premium offset by a reduction to the expected market rate of return. The lower projected profitability levels reflect changes in assumptions related to organic revenue growth and cost rates  which can be attributed to the declines discussed above and also includes consideration of the uncertainty related to the business's ability to execute on the projected cash flows.



Willis Group Holdings plc

Income taxes

We recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the estimated future tax consequences of events attributable to differences between the financial statements carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating and capital loss and tax credit carry-forwards. We estimate deferred tax assets and liabilities and assess the need for any valuation allowances using tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to be recovered or settled taking into account our business plans and tax planning strategies.

At

December 31, 2012

, we had gross deferred tax assets of

$451 million

(


:

$432 million

) against which a valuation allowance of

$221 million

(


:

$102 million

) had been recognized. To the extent that:

•

the actual future taxable income in the periods during which the temporary differences are expected to reverse differs from current projections;

•

assumed prudent and feasible tax planning strategies fail to materialize;

•

new tax planning strategies are developed; or

•

material changes occur in actual tax rates or loss carry-forward time limits,

we may adjust the deferred tax asset considered realizable in future periods. Such adjustments could result in a significant increase or decrease in the effective tax rate and have a material impact on our net income.

Positions taken in our tax returns may be subject to challenge by the taxing authorities upon examination. We recognize the benefit of uncertain tax positions in the financial statements when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on examination by the tax authorities. The benefit recognized is the largest amount of tax benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized on settlement with the tax authority, assuming full knowledge of the position and all relevant facts. The Company adjusts its recognition of these uncertain tax benefits in the period in which new information is available impacting either the recognition or measurement of its uncertain tax positions. In


, there was a net increase in uncertain tax positions of $21 million compared to a net increase of $3 million in


. The Company recognizes interest relating to unrecognized tax benefits and penalties within income taxes. Accrued interest and penalties are included within the related tax liability line in the consolidated balance sheet.

Commitments, contingencies and accrued liabilities

We purchase professional indemnity insurance for errors and omissions claims. The terms of this insurance vary by policy year and self-insured risks have increased significantly over recent years. We have established provisions against various actual and potential claims, lawsuits and other proceedings relating principally to alleged errors and omissions in connection with the placement of insurance and reinsurance in the ordinary course of business. Such provisions cover claims that have been reported but not paid and also claims that have been incurred but not reported. These provisions are established based on actuarial estimates together with individual case reviews and are believed to be adequate in the light of current information and legal advice.

Debt obligations and facilities

The Company’s debt and related interest obligations at

December 31, 2012

are shown in the above table.

In July 2012, a new revolving credit facility of 15 million Chinese Yuan Renminbi 'RMB' ($2 million) was put in place which bears interest at 110 percent of the applicable short term interest rate on an RMB loan having a term equal to the tenor of that drawing as published by the People's Bank of China 'PBOC' prevailing as at the drawdown date of that drawing. The facility expires on July 11, 2013. As at December 31, 2012 ¥nil ($nil) had been drawn down on the facility. This facility is solely for the use of our Chinese subsidiary and is available for general working capital purposes.

In March 2011 we issued $800 million of debt, comprising of $300 million of 4.125% senior notes due 2016 and $500 million of 5.750% senior notes due 2021. We received net proceeds, after underwriting discounts and expenses of approximately $787 million, which were largely used, to repurchase and redeem $500 million of 12.875% senior notes due 2016 and make related make-whole payments totaling $158 million, which represented a slight discount to the make-whole redemption amount provided in the indenture governing this debt. In addition to the make-whole payments of $158 million, we also wrote off unamortized debt issuance costs of $13 million.

In December 2011 we refinanced our bank facility, comprising a 5-year $300 million term loan and a new 5-year $500 million revolving credit facility. The $300 million term loan repaid the majority of the $328 million balance outstanding on our $700 million 5-year term loan facility and the $500 million revolving facility replaced our $300 million and our $200 million revolving credit facilities. Unamortized debt issuance costs of $10 million relating to these facilities were written off in December 2011 following completion of the refinancing.



Willis Group Holdings plc

Conditions to borrowing under the banking facility include the accuracy and completeness in all material respects of all representations and warranties in the loan documentation and that no default under the banking facility then existed or would result from such borrowing or the application of the proceeds thereof. Voluntary prepayments are permitted without penalty or premium (subject to minimum amounts) and mandatory prepayments are required in certain circumstances.

We are subject to various affirmative and negative covenants and reporting obligations under the banking facility. These include, among others, limitations on subsidiary indebtedness, liens, sale and leaseback transactions, certain investments, fundamental changes, assets sales and restricted payments, and maintenance of certain financial covenants. Events of default under the banking facility include non-payment of amounts due to the lenders, violation of covenants, incorrect representations, defaults under other material indebtedness, judgments and specified insolvency-related events, certain ERISA events and invalidity of loan documents, subject to, in certain instances, specified thresholds, cure periods and exceptions.

At

Operating leases

The Company leases certain land, buildings and equipment under various operating lease arrangements. Original non-cancellable lease terms typically are between 10 and 20 years and may contain escalation clauses, along with options that permit early withdrawal. The total amount of the minimum rent is expensed on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.

As of

Pensions

Contractual obligations for our pension plans reflect the contributions we expect to make over the next five years into our US, UK, international and US non-qualified  plans. These contributions are based on current funding positions and may increase or decrease dependent on the future performance of the plans.

UK plan

During 2012, the Company made cash contributions to the UK defined benefit pension plan of $80 million (2011: $81 million; 2010: $78 million), additionally

$12 million

(2011:

$11 million

; 2010:

$10 million

) will be paid into the plan in respect of employees' salary sacrifice contributions.



Business discussion

In March 2012, the Company agreed to a revised schedule of contributions towards on-going accrual of benefits and deficit funding contributions the Company will make to the UK plan over the six years ended December 31, 2017.  Contributions in each of the next five years are expected to total approximately $81 million, of which approximately $23 million relates to on-going contributions calculated as 15.9 percent of active plan members' pensionable salary and approximately $58 million that relates to contributions towards the funding deficit.

In addition, further contributions will be payable based on a profit share calculation (equal to 20 percent of EBITDA in excess of $900 million per annum as defined by the revised schedule of contributions) and an exceptional return calculation (equal to 10 percent of any exceptional returns made to shareholders, for example, share buybacks, and special dividends). Upon finalization of these calculations the Company expects to make a further contribution in 2013 of $10 million, calculated as 10 percent of the $100 million share buy-back program completed during 2012. Aggregate contributions under the deficit funding contribution and the profit share calculation are capped at £312 million ($507 million) over the six years ended December 31, 2017.

The schedule of contributions is automatically renegotiated after three years and at any earlier time jointly agreed by the Company and the Trustee.

Guarantees

Guarantees issued by certain of Willis Group Holdings’ subsidiaries with respect to the senior notes and revolving credit facilities are discussed in Note 19 — 'Debt' in these consolidated financial statements.

Certain of Willis Group Holdings’ subsidiaries have given the landlords of some leasehold properties occupied by the Company in the UK and the US guarantees in respect of the performance of the lease obligations of the subsidiary holding the lease. The operating lease obligations subject to such guarantees amounted to

$829 million

and

$828 million

at

December 31, 2012

and


, respectively.

In addition, the Company has given guarantees to bankers and other third parties relating principally to letters of credit amounting to

$10 million

and

$7 million

at

December 31, 2012

and


, respectively. Willis Group Holdings also guarantees certain of its UK and Irish subsidiaries’ obligations to fund the UK and Irish defined benefit plans.

Other Contractual Obligations

For certain subsidiaries and associates, the Company has the right to purchase shares (a call option) from co-shareholders at various dates in the future. In addition, the co-shareholders of certain subsidiaries and associates have the right to sell (a put option) their shares to the Company at various dates in the future. Generally, the exercise price of such put options and call options is formula-based (using revenues and earnings) and is designed to reflect fair value. Based on current projections of profitability and exchange rates and assuming the put options are exercised, the potential amount payable from these options is not expected to exceed $19 million (2011: $72 million).

NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

In May 2011, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (‘FASB’) issued new guidance to provide a consistent definition of fair value and ensure that fair value measurements and disclosure requirements are similar between US GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards (‘IFRS’). The guidance changes certain fair value measurement principles and enhances the disclosure requirements for fair value measurements.

In June 2011, the FASB issued new guidance to revise the manner in which entities present comprehensive income in their financial statements, requiring that the components of comprehensive income be presented in either a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements. The amendments do not change the items that must be reported in other comprehensive income (OCI) or when an item of OCI must be reclassified to net income.

ASU No. 2011-05 also requires entities to present on the face of the financial statements reclassification adjustments for items that are reclassified from other comprehensive income to net income in the statement(s) where the components of net income and the components of other comprehensive income are presented. In December 2011, the FASB issued ASU No. 2011-12 in order to defer those changes in ASU No. 2011-05 that relate to the presentation of reclassification adjustments.  In February 2013, the FASB issued ASU No. 2013-02, Reporting of Amounts Reclassified Out of Accumulated Other Comprehensive (ASU 2013-02). This guidance is the culmination of the FASB's deliberation on reporting reclassification adjustments from accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI). The amendments in ASU 2013-02 do not change the current requirements for reporting net income or other comprehensive income but do require disclosure of amounts reclassified out of AOCI in its entirety, by component, on the face of the statement of operations or in the notes thereto. Amounts that are not required to be reclassified in their entirety to net income must be cross-referenced to other disclosures that provide additional detail. This standard is effective prospectively for annual and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2012. The Company is evaluating the effect the adoption of ASU 2013-02 will have on its consolidated financial statements effective from first quarter 2013.

In September 2011, the FASB also issued guidance to allow an entity the option to make a qualitative evaluation about the likelihood of goodwill impairment to determine whether it should calculate the fair value of a reporting unit.

All of the above accounting changes became effective for the Company from first quarter 2012.

Further details of the changes are described in Note 2 to the  Consolidated Financial Statements.

Other than the changes described above, there were no new accounting standards issued during


that would impact on the Company’s reporting.

OFF BALANCE SHEET TRANSACTIONS

Apart from commitments, guarantees and contingencies, as disclosed in Note 22 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company has no off-balance sheet arrangements that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a material effect on the Company’s financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.



Market risk

Item 7A —

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk

Financial Risk Management

We are exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. In order to manage the risk arising from these exposures, we enter into a variety of interest rate and foreign currency derivatives. We do not hold financial or derivative instruments for trading purposes.

A discussion of our accounting policies for financial and derivative instruments is included in Note 2 — 'Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies' of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, and further disclosure is provided in Note 26 — 'Derivative Financial Instruments and Hedging Activities'.

Foreign Exchange Risk Management

Because of the large number of countries and currencies we operate in, movements in currency exchange rates may affect our results.

We report our operating results and financial condition in US dollars. Our US operations earn revenue and incur expenses primarily in US dollars. Outside the United States, we predominantly generate revenues and expenses in the local currency with the exception of our London market operations which earns revenues in several currencies but incurs expenses predominantly in pounds sterling.

The table below gives an approximate analysis of revenues and expenses by currency in


.

_________________

(i)

In 2012, the proportion of expenses incurred in pounds sterling was lower than in 2011 as a result of increased US dollar expenses, primarily due to the impact of the goodwill impairment charge.

Our principal exposures to foreign exchange risk arise from:

•

our London market operations; and

•

translation.

London market operations

In our London market operations, we earn revenue in a number of different currencies, principally US dollars, pounds sterling, Euros and Japanese yen, but incur expenses almost entirely in pounds sterling.

We hedge this risk as follows:

•

to the extent that forecast pound sterling expenses exceed pound sterling revenues, we limit our exposure to this exchange rate risk by the use of forward contracts matched to specific, clearly identified cash outflows arising in the ordinary course of business; and

•

to the extent our London market operations earn significant revenues in Euros and Japanese yen, we limit our exposure to changes in the exchange rate between the US dollar and these currencies by the use of forward contracts matched to a percentage of forecast cash inflows in specific currencies and periods. In addition, we are also exposed to foreign exchange risk on any net sterling asset or liability position in our London market operations.

However, where the foreign exchange risk relates to any sterling pension assets benefit or liability for pensions benefit, we do not hedge the risk. Consequently, if our London market operations have a significant pension asset or liability, we may be exposed to accounting gains and losses if the US dollar and pounds sterling exchange rate changes. We do, however, hedge the pounds sterling contributions into the pension plan.

Translation risk

Outside our US and London market operations, we predominantly earn revenues and incur expenses in the local currency. When we translate the results and net assets of these operations into US dollars for reporting purposes, movements in exchange



Willis Group Holdings plc

rates will affect reported results and net assets. For example, if the US dollar strengthens against the Euro, the reported results of our Eurozone operations in US dollar terms will be lower.

With the exception of foreign currency hedges for certain intercompany loans, that are not designated as hedging instruments, we do not hedge translation risk.

The table below provides information about our foreign currency forward exchange contracts, which are sensitive to exchange rate risk. The table summarizes the US dollar equivalent amounts of each currency bought and sold forward and the weighted average contractual exchange rates. All forward exchange contracts mature within three years.

_________________

(i)

Represents the difference between the contract amount and the cash flow in US dollars which would have been receivable had the foreign currency forward exchange contracts been entered into on

December 31, 2012

or


at the forward exchange rates prevailing at that date.

Income earned within foreign subsidiaries outside of the UK is generally offset by expenses in the same local currency but the Company does have exposure to foreign exchange movements on the net income of these entities.

Interest rate risk management

Our operations are financed principally by $2,050 million fixed rate senior notes issued by the Group and $289 million under a 5-year term loan facility. Of the fixed rate senior notes, $350 million are due 2015, $300 million are due 2016, $600 million are due 2017, $300 million are due 2019, and $500 million are due 2021. The 5-year term loan facility is repayable in quarterly installments and a final repayment of $225 million is due in the fourth quarter of 2016. As of

December 31, 2012

we had access to $522 million under three revolving credit facilities and, as at this date, no amount was outstanding under those facilities. The interest rate applicable to the bank borrowing is variable according to the period of each individual drawdown.

We are also subject to market risk from exposure to changes in interest rates based on our investing activities where our primary interest rate risk arises from changes in short-term interest rates in both US dollars and pounds sterling.



Market risk

As a result of our operating activities, we receive cash for premiums and claims which we deposit in short-term investments denominated in US dollars and other currencies. We earn interest on these funds, which is included in our consolidated financial statements as investment income. These funds are regulated in terms of access and the instruments in which it may be invested, most of which are short-term in maturity. In order to manage interest rate risk arising from these financial assets, we entered into interest rate swaps to receive a fixed rate of interest and pay a variable rate of interest in the various currencies related to the short-term investments. The use of interest rate contracts essentially converted groups of short-term variable rate investments to fixed rates. However, in the fourth quarter of 2011, we stopped renewing hedged positions on their maturity given the flat yield curve environment. Further to this, during second quarter 2012, the Company closed out its legacy position for these interest rate swap contracts.

During the year ended December 31, 2010, the Company entered into a series of interest rate swaps for a total notional amount of $350 million to receive a fixed rate and pay a variable rate on a semi-annual basis, with a maturity date of July 15, 2015. The Company has designated and accounts for these instruments as fair value hedges against its $350 million 5.625% senior notes due 2015. The fair values of the interest rate swaps are included within other assets or other liabilities and the fair value of the hedged element of the senior notes is included within the principal amount of the debt.

The table below provides information about our derivative instruments and other financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates. For interest rate swaps, the table presents notional principal amounts and average interest rates analyzed by expected maturity dates. Notional principal amounts are used to calculate the contractual payments to be exchanged under the contracts. The duration of interest rate swaps varied between one and five years, with re-fixing periods of three to six months. Average fixed and variable rates are, respectively, the weighted-average actual and market rates for the interest rate hedges in place. Market rates are the rates prevailing at

December 31, 2012

or


, as appropriate.



Willis Group Holdings plc

(i)

Represents the net present value of the expected cash flows discounted at current market rates of interest or quoted market rates as appropriate.

Liquidity Risk

Our objective is to ensure we have the ability to generate sufficient cash either from internal or external sources, in a timely and cost-effective manner, to meet our commitments as they fall due. Our management of liquidity risk is embedded within our overall risk management framework. Scenario analysis is continually undertaken to ensure that our resources can meet our liquidity requirements. These resources are supplemented by access to $522 million under three revolving credit facilities. We undertake short-term foreign exchange swaps for liquidity purposes.

See ‘Liquidity’ section under Item 7, 'Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations'.

Credit Risk and Concentrations of Credit Risk

Credit risk represents the loss that would be recognized at the reporting date if counterparties failed to perform as contracted and from movements in interest rates and foreign exchange rates. The Company currently does not anticipate non-performance by its counterparties. The Company generally does not require collateral or other security to support financial instruments with credit risk; however, it is the Company's policy to enter into master netting arrangements with counterparties as practical.

Concentrations of credit risk that arise from financial instruments exist for groups of customers or counterparties when they have similar economic characteristics that would cause their ability to meet contractual obligations to be similarly affected by changes in economic or other conditions. Financial instruments on the balance sheet that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable and derivatives which are recorded at fair value.

The Company maintains a policy providing for the diversification of cash and cash equivalent investments and places such investments in an extensive number of financial institutions to limit the amount of credit risk exposure. These financial institutions are monitored on an ongoing basis for credit quality predominantly using information provided by credit agencies.



Market risk

Concentrations of credit risk with respect to receivables are limited due to the large number of clients and markets in which the Company does business, as well as the dispersion across many geographic areas. Management does not believe significant risk exists in connection with the Company's concentrations of credit as of December 31, 2012.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

Fair Value Measurement and Disclosure

In May 2011, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ('FASB') issued Accounting Standards Update ('ASU') No. 2011-04, Fair Value Measurement: Amendments to Achieve Common Fair Value Measurement and Disclosure Requirements in U.S. GAAP and IFRSs. The new guidance was issued to provide a consistent definition of fair value and ensure that fair value measurements and disclosure requirements are similar between US GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards ('IFRS'). The guidance changes certain fair value measurement principles and enhances the disclosure requirements for fair value measurements.This guidance is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2011 and has been applied prospectively.

Other Comprehensive Income

In June 2011, the FASB issued ASU No. 2011-05, Presentation of Comprehensive Income to revise the manner in which entities present comprehensive income in their financial statements. These changes require that components of comprehensive income be presented in either a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements. The amendments do not change the items that must be reported in other comprehensive income or when an item of other comprehensive income must be reclassified to net income.This guidance is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2011 and has been applied retrospectively.

ASU No. 2011-05 also requires entities to present on the face of the financial statements reclassification adjustments for items that are reclassified from other comprehensive income to net income in the statement(s) where the components of net income and the components of other comprehensive income are presented. In December 2011, the FASB issued ASU No. 2011-12 in order to defer those changes in ASU No. 2011-05 that relate to the presentation of reclassification adjustments.  In February 2013, the FASB issued ASU No. 2013-02, Reporting of Amounts Reclassified Out of Accumulated Other Comprehensive (ASU 2013-02). This guidance is the culmination of the FASB's deliberation on reporting reclassification adjustments from accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI). The amendments in ASU 2013-02 do not change the current requirements for reporting net income or other comprehensive income but do require disclosure of amounts reclassified out of AOCI in its entirety, by component, on the face of the statement of operations or in the notes thereto. Amounts that are not required to be reclassified in their entirety to net income must be cross-referenced to other disclosures that provide additional detail. This standard is effective prospectively for annual and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2012. The Company is evaluating the effect the adoption of ASU 2013-02 will have on its consolidated financial statements effective from first quarter 2013.



Notes to the financial statements

Goodwill impairment testing

In September 2011, the FASB issued ASU No. 2011-08,

Intangibles — Goodwill and Other: Testing Goodwill for Impairment

. The new guidance was issued to reduce complexity and costs by allowing an entity the option to make a qualitative evaluation about the likelihood of goodwill impairment to determine whether it should calculate the fair value of a reporting unit.

This guidance is effective for interim and annual goodwill impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2011.

The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on the financial statements.

Significant Accounting Policies

These consolidated financial statements conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (‘US GAAP’). Presented below are summaries of significant accounting policies followed in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements.

Certain reclassifications have been made to prior year amounts to conform to current year presentation.

Principles of Consolidation

The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Willis Group Holdings and its subsidiaries, which are controlled through the ownership of a majority voting interest. Intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated on consolidation.

Foreign Currency Translation

Transactions in currencies other than the functional currency of the entity are recorded at the rates of exchange prevailing at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities in currencies other than the functional currency are translated at the rates of exchange prevailing at the balance sheet date and the related transaction gains and losses are reported in the statements of operations. Certain intercompany loans are determined to be of a long-term investment nature. The Company records transaction gains and losses from remeasuring such loans as a component of other comprehensive income.

Upon consolidation, the results of operations of subsidiaries and associates whose functional currency is other than the US dollar are translated into US dollars at the average exchange rate and assets and liabilities are translated at year-end exchange rates. Translation adjustments are presented as a separate component of other comprehensive income in the financial statements and are included in net income only upon sale or liquidation of the underlying foreign subsidiary or associated company.

Use of Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with US GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities as of the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the year. In the preparation of these consolidated financial statements, estimates and assumptions have been made by management concerning: the valuation of intangible assets and goodwill (including those acquired through business combinations); the selection of useful lives of fixed and intangible assets; impairment testing; provisions necessary for accounts receivable, commitments and contingencies and accrued liabilities; long-term asset returns, discount rates and mortality rates in order to estimate pension liabilities and pension expense; income tax valuation allowances; and other similar evaluations. Actual results could differ from the estimates underlying these consolidated financial statements.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents primarily consist of time deposits with original maturities of three months or less.

Fiduciary Assets and Fiduciary Liabilities

In its capacity as an insurance agent or broker, the Company collects premiums from insureds and, after deducting its commissions, remits the premiums to the respective insurers; the Company also collects claims or refunds from insurers which it then remits to insureds.



Willis Group Holdings plc

2.    BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)

Fiduciary Receivables

Fiduciary receivables represent uncollected premiums from insureds and uncollected claims or refunds from insurers.

Fiduciary Funds

Fiduciary funds represent unremitted premiums received from insureds and unremitted claims or refunds received from insurers. Fiduciary funds are generally required to be kept in certain regulated bank accounts subject to guidelines which emphasize capital preservation and liquidity. Such funds are not available to service the Company’s debt or for other corporate purposes. Notwithstanding the legal relationships with insureds and insurers, the Company is entitled to retain investment income earned on fiduciary funds in accordance with industry custom and practice and, in some cases, as supported by agreements with insureds.

In certain instances, the Company advances premiums, refunds or claims to insurance underwriters or insureds prior to collection. Such advances are made from fiduciary funds and are reflected in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as fiduciary assets.

Fiduciary Liabilities

The obligations to remit these funds to insurers or insureds are recorded as fiduciary liabilities on the Company’s consolidated balance sheets. The period for which the Company holds such funds is dependent upon the date the insured remits the payment of the premium to the Company and the date the Company is required to forward such payment to the insurer. Balances arising from insurance brokerage transactions are reported as separate assets or liabilities.

Accounts Receivable

Accounts receivable are stated at estimated net realizable values. Allowances are recorded, when necessary, in an amount considered by management to be sufficient to meet probable future losses related to uncollectible accounts.

Fixed Assets

Fixed assets are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Expenditures for improvements are capitalized; repairs and maintenance are charged to expenses as incurred. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method based on the estimated useful lives of assets.

Depreciation on buildings and long leaseholds is

calculated over the lesser of 50 years or the lease term.

Depreciation on leasehold improvements is calculated over the lesser of the useful life of the assets or the remaining lease term. Depreciation on furniture and equipment is

calculated based on a range of 3 to 10 years.

Freehold land is not depreciated.

Recoverability of Fixed Assets

Long-lived assets are tested for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstance indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount of a long-lived asset is not recoverable and exceeds its fair value. Recoverability is determined based on the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset or asset group. Long-lived assets and certain identifiable intangible assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell.

Operating Leases

Rentals payable on operating leases are charged straight line to expenses over the lease term as the rentals become payable.



Notes to the financial statements

2.    BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of businesses acquired over the fair value of identifiable net assets at the dates of acquisition. The Company reviews goodwill for impairment annually and whenever facts or circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable. In testing for impairment, the fair value of each reporting unit is compared with its carrying value, including goodwill. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the amount of an impairment loss, if any, is calculated by comparing the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill. An impairment charge of

$492 million

was recorded in the fourth quarter of 2012 as further disclosed in Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements.

Acquired intangible assets are amortized over the following periods:

Amortizable intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable.

Investments in Associates

Investments are accounted for using the equity method of accounting if the Company has the ability to exercise significant influence, but not control, over the investee. Significant influence is generally deemed to exist if the

Company has an equity ownership in the voting stock of the investee between 20 and 50 percent

, although other factors, such as representation on the Board of Directors and the impact of commercial arrangements, are considered in determining whether the equity method of accounting is appropriate. Under the equity method of accounting the investment is carried at cost of acquisition, plus the Company’s equity in undistributed net income since acquisition, less any dividends received since acquisition.

The Company periodically reviews its investments in associates for which fair value is less than cost to determine if the decline in value is other than temporary. If the decline in value is judged to be other than temporary, the cost basis of the investment is written down to fair value. The amount of any write-down is included in the statements of operations as a realized loss.

All other equity investments where the Company does not have the ability to exercise significant influence are accounted for by the cost method. Such investments are not publicly traded.

Derivative Financial Instruments

The Company uses derivative financial instruments for other than trading purposes to alter the risk profile of an existing underlying exposure. Interest rate swaps are used to manage interest risk exposures. Forward foreign currency exchange contracts are used to manage currency exposures arising from future income and expenses. The fair values of derivative contracts are recorded in other assets and other liabilities. The effective portions of changes in the fair value of derivatives that qualify for hedge accounting as cash flow hedges are recorded in other comprehensive income. Amounts are reclassified from other comprehensive income into earnings when the hedged exposure affects earnings. If the derivative is designated as and qualifies as an effective fair value hedge, the changes in the fair value of the derivative and of the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk are both recognized in earnings. The amount of hedge ineffectiveness recognized in earnings is based on the extent to which an offset between the fair value of the derivative and hedged item is not achieved. Changes in fair value of derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting, together with any hedge ineffectiveness on those that do qualify, are recorded in other operating expenses or interest expense as appropriate.

Income Taxes

The Company recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for the estimated future tax consequences of events attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating and capital loss and tax credit carry forwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted rates in



Willis Group Holdings plc

2.    BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)

effect for the year in which the differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of changes in tax rates is recognized in the statement of operations in the period in which the enactment date changes. Deferred tax assets are reduced through the establishment of a valuation allowance at such time as, based on available evidence, it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The Company adjusts valuation allowances to measure deferred tax assets at the amount considered realizable in future periods if the Company’s facts and assumptions change. In making such determination, the Company considers all available positive and negative evidence, including future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, projected future taxable income, tax planning strategies and recent financial operations.

Positions taken in the Company’s tax returns may be subject to challenge by the taxing authorities upon examination. The Company recognizes the benefit of uncertain tax positions in the financial statements when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on examination by the tax authorities upon lapse of the relevant statute of limitations, or when positions are effectively settled. The benefit recognized is the largest amount of tax benefit that is

greater than 50 percent likely to be realized on settlement with the tax authority, assuming full knowledge of the position and all relevant facts.

The Company adjusts its recognition of these uncertain tax benefits in the period in which new information is available impacting either the recognition or measurement of its uncertain tax positions. These differences will be reflected as increases or decreases to income tax expense in the period in which they are determined.

Changes in tax laws and rates could also affect recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities in the future. Management is not aware of any such changes that would have a material effect on the Company’s results of operations, cash flows or financial position.

The Company recognizes interest and penalties relating to unrecognized tax benefits within income taxes.

Provisions for Liabilities

The Company is subject to various actual and potential claims, lawsuits and other proceedings. The Company records liabilities for such contingencies including legal costs when it is probable that a liability has been incurred before the balance sheet date and the amount can be reasonably estimated. To the extent such losses can be recovered under the Company’s insurance programs, estimated recoveries are recorded when losses for insured events are recognized and the recoveries are likely to be realized. Significant management judgment is required to estimate the amounts of such contingent liabilities and the related insurance recoveries. The Company analyzes its litigation exposure based on available information, including consultation with outside counsel handling the defense of these matters, to assess its potential liability. Contingent liabilities are not discounted.

Pensions

The Company has two principal defined benefit pension plans which cover approximately half of employees in the United States and United Kingdom. Both these plans are now closed to new entrants. New employees in the United Kingdom are offered the opportunity to join a defined contribution plan and in the United States are offered the opportunity to join a 401(k) plan. In addition, there are smaller plans in certain other countries in which the Company operates, including a non-qualified plan in the US.. Elsewhere, pension benefits are typically provided through defined contribution plans.

Defined benefit plans

The net periodic cost of the Company’s defined benefit plans are measured on an actuarial basis using the projected unit credit method and several actuarial assumptions the most significant of which are the discount rate and the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. Other material assumptions include rates of participant mortality, the expected long-term rate of compensation and pension increases and rates of employee termination. Gains and losses occur when actual experience differs from actuarial assumptions.

If such gains or losses exceed ten percent of the greater of plan assets or plan liabilities

the Company amortizes those gains or losses over the average remaining service period or average remaining life expectancy as appropriate of the plan participants.

In accordance with US GAAP the Company records on the balance sheet the funded status of its pension plans based on the projected benefit obligation.

2.    BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)

Defined contribution plans

Contributions to the Company’s defined contribution plans are recognized as they fall due. Differences between contributions payable in the year and contributions actually paid are shown as either other assets or other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets.

Share-Based Compensation

The Company accounts for share-based compensation as follows:

•

the cost resulting from all equity awards is recognized in the financial statements at fair value estimated at the grant date;

•

the fair value is recognized (generally as compensation cost) over the requisite service period for all awards that vest; and

•

compensation cost is not recognized for awards that do not vest because service or performance conditions are not satisfied.

Revenue Recognition

Revenue includes insurance commissions, fees for services rendered, certain commissions receivable from insurance carriers, investment income and other income.

Brokerage income and fees negotiated in lieu of brokerage are recognized at the later of policy inception date or when the policy placement is complete. Commissions on additional premiums and adjustments are recognized when approved by or agreed between the parties and collectability is reasonably assured.

Fees for risk management and other services are recognized as the services are provided. Consideration for negotiated fee arrangements for an agreed period covering multiple insurance placements, the provision of risk management and/or other services are allocated to all deliverables on the basis of their relative selling prices. The Company establishes contract cancellation reserves where appropriate: at December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, such amounts were not material.

Investment income is recognized as earned.

Other income comprises gains on disposal of intangible assets, which primarily arise on the disposal of books of business. Although the Company is not in the business of selling intangible assets, from time to time the Company will dispose of a book of business (a customer list) or other intangible assets that do not produce adequate margins or fit with the Company’s strategy.

Cash Retention Awards

For the past several years, certain cash retention awards under the Company's annual incentive programs included a feature which required the recipient to repay a proportionate amount of the annual award if the employee voluntarily left the Company before a specified date, which was generally three years following the award. As previously disclosed, the Company made the cash payment to the recipient in the year of grant and recognized the payment in expense ratably over the period it was subject to repayment, beginning in the quarter in which the award was made. The unamortized portion of cash retention awards was recorded within 'other current assets' and 'other non-current assets' in the consolidated balance sheet.

The following table sets out the amount of cash retention awards made and the related amortization of those awards for the years ended

In December 2012, the Company decided to eliminate the repayment requirement from the past annual cash retention awards and, as a result, recognized a one-time, non-cash, pre-tax charge of

$200 million

which represents the write-off of the unamortized balance of past awards.

There were however, a number of off-cycle awards with a fixed guarantee attached, for which the Company has not waived the repayment requirement. The unamortized portion of these awards amounted to

$9 million

at December 31, 2012.

In addition, the Company has replaced annual cash retention awards with annual cash bonuses which will not include a repayment requirement. The Company has accrued an additional

$252 million

for these 2012 cash bonuses to be paid in 2013.

Unamortized cash retention awards totaled

2012 Equity Incentive Plan

This plan, which was established on April 25, 2012,  provides for the granting of ISOs, time-based or performance-based non-statutory stock options, share appreciation rights ('SARs'), restricted shares, time-based or performance-based restricted share units ('RSUs'), performance-based awards and other share-based grants or any combination thereof (collectively referred to as 'Awards') to employees, officers, directors and consultants ('Eligible Individuals') of the Company and any of its subsidiaries (the 'Willis Group'). The Board of Directors also adopted a sub-plan under the 2012 plan to provide an employee sharesave scheme in the UK.

There are

13,776,935

shares available for grant under this plan.  In addition, Shares subject to awards that were granted under the Willis Group Holdings 2008 Share Purchase and Option Plan, that terminate, expire or lapse for any reason will be made available for future Awards under this Plan. Options are exercisable on a variety of dates, including from the second, third, fourth or fifth anniversary of grant. Unless terminated sooner by the Board of Directors, the 2012 Plan will expire 10 years after the date of its adoption. That termination will not affect the validity of any grants outstanding at that date.

2008 Share Purchase and Option Plan

This plan, which was established on

April 23, 2008

, provides for the granting of time and performance-based options, restricted stock units and various other share-based grants at fair market value to employees of the Company. The 2008 plan was terminated as at 25 April 2012 and no further grants will be made under this plan. Any shares available for grant under the 2008 plan were included in the 2012 Equity Incentive Plan availability.

Options are exercisable on a

variety of dates, including from the third, fourth or fifth anniversary of grant

.

2001 Share Purchase and Option Plan

This plan, which was established on

May 3, 2001

, provides for the granting of time-based options, restricted stock units and various other share-based grants at fair market value to employees of the Company. The Board of Directors has adopted several sub-plans under the 2001 plan to provide employee sharesave schemes in the UK, Ireland and internationally. The 2001 Plan (and all sub-plans) expired on

May 3, 2011

and no further grants will be made under the plan. Options are exercisable on a

variety of dates, including from the first, second, third, sixth or eighth anniversary of grant

, although for certain options the exercisable date may accelerate depending on the achievement of certain performance goals.

HRH Option Plans

Options granted under the Hilb Rogal and Hamilton Company 2000 Stock Incentive Plan (‘HRH 2000 Plan’) and the Hilb Rogal & Hobbs Company 2007 Stock Incentive Plan (the ‘HRH 2007 Plan’) were converted into options to acquire shares of Willis Group Holdings. No further grants are to be made under the HRH 2000 Plan. Willis is authorized to grant equity awards under the HRH 2007 Plan until 2017 to employees who were formerly employed by HRH and to new employees who have joined Willis or one of its subsidiaries since October 1, 2008, the date that the acquisition of HRH was completed.

Employee Stock Purchase Plans

The Company has adopted the Willis Group Holdings 2001 North America Employee Share Purchase Plan, which expired on

May 31, 2011

and the Willis Group Holdings 2010 North America Employee Stock Purchase Plan, which expires on 31 May, 2020. They provide certain eligible employees to the Company’s subsidiaries in the US and Canada the ability to contribute payroll deductions to the purchase of Willis Shares at the end of each offering period.

Option Valuation Assumptions

The fair value of each option is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model that uses the assumptions noted in the following table. Expected volatility is based on historical volatility of the Company’s stock. The Company uses the simplified method set out in Accounting Standard Codification (‘ASC’) 718-10-S99 to derive the expected term of options granted. The risk-free rate for periods within the expected life of the option is based on the US Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant.

The significant components of deferred income tax assets and liabilities and their balance sheet classifications are as follows:



Willis Group Holdings plc

7.    INCOME TAXES (Continued)

At

December 31, 2012

the Company had valuation allowances of

$221 million

(


:

$102 million

) to reduce its deferred tax assets to estimated realizable value. The valuation allowances at

December 31, 2012

relate to deferred tax assets arising from UK capital loss carryforwards (

$42 million

) and other net operating losses (

$7 million

), which have no expiration date, and to the deferred tax assets in the US (

$125 million

) and deferred tax assets arising from specific US State net operating losses (

$47 million

). US Federal net operating losses will expire between 2028 and 2031 and US State net operating losses will expire by 2030. Capital loss carryforwards can only be offset against future UK capital gains.

At

December 31, 2012

the Company had deferred tax assets of

$230 million

(


:

$330 million

), net of the valuation allowance. Management believes, based upon the level of historical taxable income and projections for future taxable income, it is more likely than not that the Company will realize the benefits of these deductible differences, net of the valuation allowance. However, the amount of the deferred tax asset considered realizable could be adjusted in the future if estimates of taxable income are revised.

The Company recognizes deferred tax balances related to the undistributed earnings of subsidiaries when the Company expects that it will recover those undistributed earnings in a taxable manner, such as through receipt of dividends or sale of the investments. The Company does not, however, provide for income taxes on the unremitted earnings of certain other subsidiaries where, in management’s opinion, such earnings have been indefinitely reinvested in those operations, or will be remitted either in a tax free liquidation or as dividends with taxes substantially offset by foreign tax credits. It is not practical to determine the amount of unrecognized deferred tax liabilities for temporary differences related to these investments.

Unrecognized tax benefits

Total unrecognized tax benefits as at

December 31, 2012

, totaled

$37 million

. During the next 12 months it is reasonably possible that the Company will recognize approximately

$7 million

of tax benefits related to the release of provisions

for potential inter company pricing adjustments

no longer required due to either settlement through negotiation or closure of the statute of limitations on assessment.

A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amounts of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows:

All UK tax returns have been filed timely and are in the normal process of being reviewed, with HM Revenue & Customs making inquiries to obtain additional information. There are no material ongoing inquiries in relation to filed UK returns. In other jurisdictions the Company is no longer subject to examinations prior to 2003.

EARNINGS PER SHARE

Basic and diluted earnings per share are calculated by dividing net income attributable to Willis Group Holdings by the average number of shares outstanding during each period. The computation of diluted earnings per share reflects the potential dilution that could occur if dilutive securities and other contracts to issue shares were exercised or converted into shares or resulted in the issue of shares that then shared in the net income of the Company.

In periods where losses are reported the weighted average shares outstanding excludes potentially issuable shares described above, because their inclusion would be antidilutive.

For the year ended

The Company recognized acquired intangible assets of

$20 million

$17 million

was in respect of customer relationships, which are being amortized over an expected life of


years. The remaining intangible assets relate to non-compete agreements and the Avalon trade name which are being amortized over

five

years and

three

years, respectively.  Goodwill of

$10 million

was recognized on the transaction.

FIDUCIARY ASSETS

The Company collects premiums from insureds and, after deducting its commissions, remits the premiums to the respective insurers; the Company also collects claims or refunds from insurers which it then remits to insureds. Uncollected premiums from insureds and uncollected claims or refunds from insurers (‘fiduciary receivables’) are recorded as fiduciary assets on the Company’s consolidated balance sheet. Unremitted insurance premiums, claims or refunds (‘fiduciary funds’) are also recorded within fiduciary assets.

Fiduciary assets therefore comprise both receivables and funds held in a fiduciary capacity.

Fiduciary funds, consisting primarily of time deposits with original maturities of less than or equal to three months, were

$1,796 million

as of

December 31, 2012

(

GOODWILL

Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of businesses acquired over the fair value of identifiable net assets at the dates of acquisition. Goodwill is not amortized but is subject to impairment testing annually and whenever facts or circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable.

The Company has determined that its reporting units are consistent with its operating segments: North America; International and Global. Goodwill is allocated to these reporting units based on the original purchase price allocation for acquisitions within the reporting units. When a business entity is sold, goodwill is allocated to the disposed entity based on the fair value of that entity compared to the fair value of the reporting unit in which it is included.

The changes in the carrying amount of goodwill by segment for the years ended

December 31, 2012

and


are as follows:

Effective January 1, 2011, the Company changed its internal reporting structure: Global Markets International, previously reported within the International segment, is now reported in the Global segment; and Mexico Retail, which was previously reported within the International segment, is now reported in the North America segment. As a result of these changes, goodwill of

$60 million

has been reallocated from the International segment into the Global segment for Global Markets International, and

$1 million

has been reallocated from the International segment into the North America segment for Mexico Retail. Goodwill has been reallocated between segments using the relative fair value allocation approach.

The table above shows goodwill at December 31, 2012 net of accumulated impairment losses of

$492 million

. The gross balance and accumulated impairment losses (which relate to our North American reporting unit) were

$3,319 million

and

$492 million

, and

$3,295 million

and $

nil

at December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. The net accumulated impairment losses for Global and International were both $

nil

at December 31, 2012 (2011: $

nil

).

2012 Impairment Review

The Company reviews goodwill for impairment annually. In the first step of the impairment test, the fair value of each reporting unit is compared with its carrying value, including goodwill. If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the amount of an impairment loss, if any, is calculated in the second step of the impairment test by comparing the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill.

The Company completed its annual goodwill impairment test as of October 1, 2012 and concluded that an impairment charge was required to reduce the carrying value of the goodwill associated with the Company's North America reporting unit. The



Notes to the financial statements

13.    GOODWILL (Continued)

goodwill impairment charge for the North America reporting unit amounted to

$492 million

. There was no impairment for the Global and International reporting units, as the fair values of these units were significantly in excess of their carrying value.

North America Impairment Review

Under the income approach, the fair value of the North America reporting unit was determined based on the present value of estimated future cash flows. The fair value measurements used unobservable inputs in a discounted cash flow model based on the Company's most recent forecasts. Such projections were based on management's estimates of revenue growth rates and operating margins, taking into consideration industry and market conditions, and the uncertainty related to the business's ability to realise the projected cash flows. The discount rate was based on the weighted-average cost of capital adjusted for the relevant risk associated with market participant expectations and characteristics of the individual reporting unit.

As the fair value of the reporting unit was less than its carrying value, the second step of the impairment test was performed to measure the amount of any impairment loss. In the second step, the North America reporting unit's fair value was allocated to all of the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit, including any unrecognized intangible assets. The fair value of intangible assets associated with the North America reporting unit included customer relationship intangible assets, which were valued using a multiple period excess earnings approach involving discounted future projections of associated revenue streams.

The decline in the fair value of the North America reporting unit, as well as differences between fair values and carrying values for other assets and liabilities in the second step of the goodwill impairment test, resulted in an implied fair value of goodwill substantially below the carrying value of the goodwill for the reporting unit. As a result, the Company recorded a goodwill impairment charge of

$492 million

as of October 1, 2012.

As previously disclosed, the North America reporting unit had been hampered by the declining Loan Protector business results, the effect of the soft economy in the U.S., which has significantly impacted the Construction and Human Capital sectors, and declining retention rates primarily related to merger and acquisition activity and lost legacy HRH businesses.

The decline in the estimated fair value of the reporting unit resulted from lower projected revenue growth rates and profitability levels as well as an increase in the discount rate used to calculate the discounted cash flows. The increase in the discount rate was due to increases in the risk-free rate and small company premium offset by a reduction to the expected market rate of return. The lower projected profitability levels reflect changes in assumptions related to organic revenue growth and cost rates which can be attributed to the declines discussed above and also includes consideration of the uncertainty related to the business's ability to execute on the projected cash flows.

ownership interest. Between 1997 and December 2009 this interest was increased by a series of incremental investments to

49 percent

.

On December 17, 2009, the Company completed a leveraged transaction with the original family shareholders of Gras Savoye and Astorg Partners, a private equity fund, to reorganize the capital of Gras Savoye (‘December 2009 leveraged transaction’). The Company, the original family shareholders and Astorg now own equal stakes of

30 percent

in the capital structure of Gras Savoye and have equal representation of one third of the voting rights on its board. The remaining shareholding is held by a large pool of Gras Savoye managers and minority shareholders.

A put option that was in place prior to the December 2009 leveraged transaction, and which could have increased the Company’s interest to

90 percent

, has been canceled and the Company now has a new call option to purchase

100 percent

of the capital of Gras Savoye. If the Company does not waive the new call option before April 30, 2014, then it must exercise the new

PENSION PLANS

The Company maintains two principal defined benefit pension plans that cover the majority of our employees in the United States and United Kingdom. Both of these plans are now closed to new entrants and with effect from May 15, 2009, the Company closed the US defined benefit plan to future accrual. New employees in the United Kingdom are offered the opportunity to join a defined contribution plan and in the United States are offered the opportunity to join a 401(k) plan. In addition to the Company’s UK and US defined benefit pension plans, the Company has several smaller defined benefit pension plans in certain other countries in which it operates including a US non-qualified plan. Elsewhere, pension benefits are typically provided through defined contribution plans. It is the Company’s policy to fund pension costs as required by applicable laws and regulations.

At

The following schedule provides other information concerning the Company’s UK and US defined benefit pension plans:

The expected return on plan assets was determined on the basis of the weighted-average of the expected future returns of the various asset classes, using the target allocations shown below. The expected returns on UK plan assets are: UK and foreign equities

9.03 percent

, debt securities

4.57 percent

and real estate

6.53 percent

. The expected returns on US plan assets are: US and foreign equities

10.40 percent

and debt securities

4.10 percent

.

The Company’s pension plan asset allocations based on fair values were as follows:

In the UK the pension trustees in consultation with the Company maintain a diversified asset portfolio and this together with contributions made by the Company is expected to meet the pension scheme’s liabilities as they become due. The UK plan’s assets are divided into


separate portfolios according to asset class and managed by


investment managers. The broad target allocations are UK and foreign equities (

44 percent

), debt securities (

27 percent

), hedge funds (

24 percent

) and real estate (

5 percent

). In the US the Company’s investment policy is to maintain a diversified asset portfolio, which together with contributions made by the Company is expected to meet the pension scheme’s liabilities as they become due. The US plan’s assets are currently invested in


funds representing most standard equity and debt security classes. The broad target allocations are US and foreign equities (

50 percent

) and debt securities (

50 percent

).

Fair Value Hierarchy

The fair value hierarchy has three levels based on the reliability of the inputs used to determine fair value:

•

Level 1: refers to fair values determined based on quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets;

•

Level 2: refers to fair values estimated using observable market based inputs or unobservable inputs that are corroborated by market data; and

•

Level 3: includes fair values estimated using unobservable inputs that are not corroborated by market data.

The UK plan’s real estate investment comprises UK property and infrastructure investments which are valued by the fund manager taking into account cost, independent appraisals and market based comparable data. The UK plan’s hedge fund investments are primarily invested in various ‘fund of funds’ and are valued based on net asset values calculated by the fund and are not publicly available. Liquidity is typically monthly and is subject to liquidity of the underlying funds.

Debt issuance

On July 11, 2012, a new revolving credit facility of

15 million

Chinese Yuan Renminbi 'RMB' (

$2 million

) was put in place which bears interest at

110 percent

of the applicable short term interest rate an RMB loan having a term equal to the tenor of that drawing as published by the People's Bank of China 'PBOC' prevailing as at the drawdown date of that drawing. The facility expires on July 11, 2013. As at December 31, 2012

¥

) had been drawn down on the facility. This facility is solely for the use of our Chinese subsidiary and is available for general working capital purposes.

In December 2011 we refinanced our bank facility, comprising a 5-year

$300 million

term loan and a 5-year

$500 million

revolving credit facility. The

$300 million

term loan replaced the remaining

$328 million

balance on our

$700 million

5-year term loan facility and the

$500 million

revolving facility replaced our

$300 million

and our

$200 million

revolving credit facilities. Unamortized debt issuance costs of

$10 million

relating to these facilities were written off in December 2011 following completion of the refinancing.

The 5-year term loan facility expiring 2016 bears interest at

LIBOR plus 1.50%

and is repayable in quarterly installments and a final repayment of

$225 million

is due in the fourth quarter of 2016. In 2012, we made

$11 million

$300 million

of

4.125%

senior notes due 2016 and

$500 million

of

12.875%

senior notes due 2016 including a make-whole payment (representing a slight discount to the contractual make-whole amount) of

$158 million

. Following the repurchase the Company wrote off

$13 million

of unamortized debt issuance costs.

During the year ended December 31, 2010, the Company entered into a series of interest rate swaps for a total notional amount of

$350 million

to receive a fixed rate and pay a variable rate on a semi-annual basis, with a maturity date of

July 15, 2015

5.625%

senior notes due 2015. The fair values of the interest rate swaps are included within other assets or other liabilities and the fair value of the hedged element of the senior notes is included within long-term debt.

On November 7, 2012, a further revolving facility of

$20 million

was renewed which bears interest at

LIBOR plus 1.55% until 2014 and LIBOR plus 1.700% thereafter

. The facility expires on

Pensions

Contractual obligations for our pension plans reflect the contributions we expect to make over the next five years into our US and UK plans. These contributions are based on current funding positions and may increase or decrease dependent on the future performance of the two plans.

In the UK, we are required to agree a funding strategy for our UK defined benefit plan with the plan's trustees. In March 2012, the Company agreed to a revised schedule of contributions towards on-going accrual of benefits and deficit funding contributions the Company will make to the UK plan over the six years ended December 31, 2017.  Contributions in each of the next five years are expected to total approximately

$81 million

, of which approximately

$23 million

relates to on-going contributions calculated as

15.9

percent of active plan members' pensionable salary and approximately

$58 million

that relates to contributions towards the funding deficit.

In addition, further contributions will be payable based on a profit share calculation (equal to

20 percent

of EBITDA in excess of

$900 million

per annum as defined by the revised schedule of contributions) and an exceptional return calculation (equal to

10 percent

of any exceptional returns made to shareholders, for example, share buybacks, and special dividends). Upon finalization of these calculations the Company expects to make a further contribution in 2013 of

$10 million

, calculated as

10 percent

of the

$100 million

share buy-back program completed during 2012. Aggregate contributions under the deficit funding contribution and the profit share calculation are capped at

£312 million

(

$507 million

) over the six years ended December 31, 2017.

The schedule of contributions is automatically renegotiated after three years and at any earlier time jointly agreed by the Company and the Trustee.

In addition, approximately

$12 million

will be paid annually into the UK defined benefit plan related to employee's salary sacrifice contributions.

The total contracted contributions for all plans in 2013 are expected to be approximately

$142 million

, excluding approximately

$12 million

in respect of the salary sacrifice scheme.

Guarantees

Guarantees issued by certain of Willis Group Holdings’ subsidiaries with respect to the senior notes and revolving credit facilities are discussed in Note 20 — Debt in these consolidated financial statements.

Certain of Willis Group Holdings’ subsidiaries have given the landlords of some leasehold properties occupied by the Company in the United Kingdom and the United States guarantees in respect of the performance of the lease obligations of the subsidiary holding the lease. The operating lease obligations subject to such guarantees amounted to

$829 million

and

$828 million

, respectively.

In addition, the Company has given guarantees to bankers and other third parties relating principally to letters of credit amounting to

and

$7 million

at

and


, respectively. Willis Group Holdings also guarantees certain of its UK and Irish subsidiaries’ obligations to fund the UK and Irish defined benefit plans.

Other contractual obligations

For certain subsidiaries and associates, the Company has the right to purchase shares (a call option) from co-shareholders at various dates in the future. In addition, the co-shareholders of certain subsidiaries and associates have the right to sell their shares (a put option) to the Company at various dates in the future. Generally, the exercise price of such put options and call options is formula-based (using revenues and earnings) and is designed to reflect fair value. Based on current projections of profitability and exchange rates and assuming the put options are exercised, the potential amount payable from these options is not expected to exceed

$19 million

(


:

$72 million

).

In July 2010, the Company made a capital commitment of

$25 million

to Trident V Parallel Fund, LP, an investment fund managed by Stone Point Capital. This replaced a capital commitment of

$25 million

that had been made to Trident V, LP in December 2009. As at

December 31, 2012

there have been approximately

$10 million

of capital contributions.

In May 2011, the Company made a capital commitment of

$10 million

to Dowling Capital Partners I, LP. As at

, payable from


onwards.

Claims, Lawsuits and Other Proceedings

In the ordinary course of business, the Company is subject to various actual and potential claims, lawsuits, and other proceedings relating principally to alleged errors and omissions in connection with the placement of insurance and reinsurance. Similar to other corporations, the Company is also subject to a variety of other claims, including those relating to the Company's employment practices. Some of the claims, lawsuits and other proceedings seek damages in amounts which could, if assessed, be significant.

Errors and omissions claims, lawsuits, and other proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business are covered in part by professional indemnity or other appropriate insurance. The terms of this insurance vary by policy year and self-insured risks have increased significantly in recent years. Regarding self-insured risks, the Company has established provisions which are believed to be adequate in the light of current information and legal advice, and the Company adjusts such provisions from time to time according to developments.

On the basis of current information, the Company does not expect that the actual claims, lawsuits and other proceedings, to which the Company is subject, or potential claims, lawsuits, and other proceedings relating to matters of which it is aware, will ultimately have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. Nonetheless, given the large or indeterminate amounts sought in certain of these actions, and the inherent unpredictability of litigation and disputes with insurance companies, it is possible that an adverse outcome in certain matters could, from time to time, have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations or cash flows in particular quarterly or annual periods.

The Company has been named as a defendant in 12 similar lawsuits relating to the collapse of The Stanford Financial Group ('Stanford'), for which Willis of Colorado, Inc. acted as broker of record on certain lines of insurance. The complaints in these actions generally allege that the defendants actively and materially aided Stanford's alleged fraud by providing Stanford with certain letters regarding coverage that they knew would be used to help retain or attract actual or prospective Stanford client investors. The complaints further allege that these letters, which contain statements about Stanford and the insurance policies that the defendants placed for Stanford, contained untruths and omitted material facts and were drafted in this manner to help Stanford promote and sell its allegedly fraudulent certificates of deposit.

No. 3:09-CV-01274-N, was filed on July 2, 2009 in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas against Willis Group Holdings plc, Willis of Colorado, Inc. and a Willis associate, among others. On April 1, 2011, plaintiffs filed the operative Third Amended Class Action Complaint individually and on behalf of a putative, worldwide class of Stanford investors, adding Willis Limited as a defendant and alleging claims under Texas statutory and common law and seeking damages in excess of

$1 billion

, punitive damages and costs. On May 2, 2011, the defendants filed motions to dismiss the Third Amended Class Action Complaint, arguing,

inter alia

, that the plaintiffs’ claims are precluded by the Securities Litigation Uniform Standards Act of 1998 (‘SLUSA’).

On May 10, 2011, the court presiding over the Stanford-related actions in the Northern District of Texas entered an order providing that it would consider the applicability of SLUSA to the Stanford-related actions based on the decision in a separate Stanford action not involving a Willis entity,

Roland v. Green

, Civil Action No. 3:10-CV-0224-N. On August 31, 2011, the court issued its decision in

Roland

, dismissing that action with prejudice under SLUSA.

On October 27, 2011, the court in

Troice

entered an order (i) dismissing with prejudice those claims asserted in the Third Amended Class Action Complaint on a class basis on the grounds set forth in the

Roland

decision discussed above and (ii) dismissing without prejudice those claims asserted the Third Amended Class Action Complaint on an individual basis. Also on October 27, 2011, the court entered a final judgment in the action.

On October 28, 2011, the plaintiffs in

Troice

filed a notice of appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. Subsequently,

Troice, Roland

and a third action captioned

Troice, et al. v. Proskauer Rose LLP

, Civil Action No. 3:09-CV-01600-N, which also was dismissed on the grounds set forth in the

Roland

decision discussed above and on appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, were consolidated for purposes of briefing and oral argument. Following the completion of briefing and oral argument, on March 19, 2012, the Fifth Circuit reversed and remanded the actions. On April 2, 2012, the defendants-appellees filed petitions for rehearing en banc.  On April 19, 2012, the petitions for rehearing en banc were denied. On July 18, 2012, defendants-appellees filed a petition for writ of certiorari with the United States Supreme Court regarding the Fifth Circuit's reversal in

Troice.

On January 18, 2013, the Supreme Court granted our petition and will hear our appeal.  Opening briefs are due in early May 2013, and we expect oral argument in October and a decision in late 2013 or early 2014.

European Commission Sector Inquiry

In 2006, the European Commission ('EC') issued questionnaires pursuant to its Sector Inquiry (or, in respect of Norway, the European Free Trade Association Surveillance Authority ('EFTAS')), related to insurance business practices, including compensation arrangements for brokers, to at least 150 European brokers including our operations in nine European countries. The Company filed responses to the questionnaires. On September 25, 2007, the EC and EFTAS issued a joint report expressing concerns over potential conflicts of interest in the industry relating to remuneration and binding authorities and also over the nature of the coinsurance market.

The Company cooperated with both the EC and the EFTAS to resolve issues raised in their final joint report regarding coinsurance. In 2012, the EC  appointed Ernst & Young to conduct a review of the coinsurance market and Ernst & Young  approached one broking firm in each Member State. Three of our European subsidiaries (UK, Spain and the Netherlands) recently either met with Ernst & Young or received questionnaires from them on this matter in 2012.

T

he EC  published Ernst & Young's report on February 11, 2013, which described the nature and benefits of the coinsurance and subscription markets.  The EC intends to consult further on these findings during 2013 before determining next steps.

Regulatory Investigation

In 2011, we and the UK Financial Services Authority (the 'FSA') announced a settlement for lapses by Willis Limited, our UK brokerage subsidiary, in its implementation and documentation of its controls to counter the risks of improper payments being made to non-FSA authorized overseas third parties engaged to help win business, particularly in high risk jurisdictions.

As a result of a FSA settlement in 2011, we are conducting a further internal review of certain high-risk payments made by our UK subsidiary between 2005 and 2009. We do not believe that this further internal review will result in any material fines or sanctions, but there can be no assurance that any resolution will not have an adverse impact on our ability to conduct our business in certain jurisdictions. While we believe that our current systems and controls are adequate and in accordance with all applicable laws and regulations, we cannot assure that such systems and controls will prevent any violations of applicable laws and regulations.

SUPPLEMENTAL DISCLOSURES OF CASH FLOW INFORMATION

Supplemental disclosures regarding cash flow information and non-cash flow investing and financing activities are as follows:

26.

DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES

Fair value of derivative financial instruments

In addition to the note below, see Note 27 - Fair Value Measurements for information about the fair value hierarchy of derivatives.

Primary risks managed by derivative financial instruments

The main risks managed by derivative financial instruments are interest rate risk and foreign currency risk. The Company’s board of directors reviews and approves policies for managing each of these risks as summarized below.

The Company enters into derivative transactions (principally interest rate swaps and forward foreign currency contracts) in order to manage interest rate and foreign currency risks arising from the Company’s operations and its sources of finance. The Company does not hold financial or derivative instruments for trading purposes.

Interest Rate Risk — Investment Income

As a result of the Company’s operating activities, the Company receives cash for premiums and claims which it deposits in short-term investments denominated in US dollars and other currencies. The Company earns interest on these funds, which is included in the Company’s financial statements as investment income. These funds are regulated in terms of access and the instruments in which they may be invested, most of which are short-term in maturity.

In order to manage interest rate risk arising from these financial assets, the Company entered into interest rate swaps to receive a fixed rate of interest and pay a variable rate of interest denominated in the various currencies related to the short-term investments. The use of interest rate contracts essentially converted groups of short-term variable rate investments to fixed rate investments. The fair value of these contracts was recorded in other assets and other liabilities. For contracts that qualified as cash flow hedges for accounting purposes, the effective portions of changes in fair value were recorded as a component of other comprehensive income, to the extent that the hedge relationships were highly effective.



Notes to the financial statements

26.    DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES (Continued

)

From the fourth quarter of 2011, the Company stopped entering into any new hedging transactions relating to interest rate risk from investments, given the flat yield curve environment at that time. Further to this, during second quarter 2012, the Company closed out its legacy position for these interest rate swap contracts.

The fair value of these swaps at the close out date was

$16 million

, representing a cash settlement amount on termination.  In connection with the terminated swaps, the Company retained a gain of

$15 million

in other comprehensive income as the forecasted short-term investment transactions in relation to which the swaps qualified as cash flow hedges are still considered probable.  These amounts will be reclassified into earnings consistent with when the forecasted transactions affect earnings. We expect approximately

$5 million

of the gain to be recognized in the income statement in 2013.

At

December 31, 2012

and


, the Company had the following derivative financial instruments that were designated as cash flow hedges of interest rate risk:

_________________________________

(i)

Notional amounts represent US dollar equivalents translated at the spot rate as of December 31.

Interest Rate Risk — Interest Expense

The Company’s operations are financed principally by

$2,050 million

fixed rate senior notes and

$289 million

under a


-year term loan facility.

During the year ended December 31, 2010, the Company entered into a series of interest rate swaps for a total notional amount of

$350 million

to receive a fixed rate and pay a variable rate on a semi-annual basis, with a maturity date of

July 15, 2015

. At the year end the weighted average fixed rate was

2.71%

and variable rate was

0.75%

. The Company has designated and accounts for these instruments as fair value hedges against its

$350 million

5.625%

senior notes due 2015. The fair values of the interest rate swaps are included within other assets or other liabilities and the fair value of the hedged element of the senior notes is included within long-term debt.

The Company also has access to

$522 million

under three revolving credit facilities; as of

December 31, 2012

$

nil

was drawn on these facilities. The 5-year term loan facility bears interest at

LIBOR

plus

1.50%

. Drawings under the revolving

$500 million

credit facility bear interest at

LIBOR

plus

1.50%

. These margins apply while the Company’s debt rating remains BBB-/Baa3. Should the Company’s debt rating change, then the margin will change in accordance with the credit facilities agreements.

At

December 31, 2012

and


, the Company’s interest rate swaps were all designated as hedging instruments.



Willis Group Holdings plc

26.    DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES (Continued

Foreign Currency Risk

The Company’s primary foreign exchange risks arise:

•

from changes in the exchange rate between US dollars and pounds sterling as its London market operations earn the majority of their revenues in US dollars and incur expenses predominantly in pounds sterling, and may also hold a significant net sterling asset or liability position on the balance sheet. In addition, the London market operations earn significant revenues in Euros and Japanese yen; and

•

from the translation into US dollars of the net income and net assets of its foreign subsidiaries, excluding the London market operations which are US dollar denominated.

The foreign exchange risks in its London market operations are hedged as follows:

•

to the extent that forecast pound sterling expenses exceed pound sterling revenues, the Company limits its exposure to this exchange rate risk by the use of forward contracts matched to specific, clearly identified cash outflows arising in the ordinary course of business; and

•

to the extent the UK operations earn significant revenues in Euros and Japanese yen, the Company limits its exposure to changes in the exchange rate between the US dollar and these currencies by the use of forward contracts matched to a percentage of forecast cash inflows in specific currencies and periods. In addition, we are also exposed to foreign exchange risk on any net sterling asset or liability position in our London market operations.

The fair value of foreign currency contracts is recorded in other assets and other liabilities. For contracts that qualify as accounting hedges, changes in fair value resulting from movements in the spot exchange rate are recorded as a component of other comprehensive income whilst changes resulting from a movement in the time value are recorded in interest expense. For contracts that do not qualify for hedge accounting, the total change in fair value is recorded in interest expense. Amounts held in comprehensive income are reclassified into earnings when the hedged exposure affects earnings.

At

December 31, 2012

and


, the Company’s foreign currency contracts were all designated as hedging instruments except for those relating to short-term cash flows and hedges of certain intercompany loans.

The table below summarizes by major currency the contractual amounts of the Company’s forward contracts to exchange foreign currencies for pounds sterling in the case of US dollars and US dollars for Euro and Japanese yen. Foreign currency notional amounts are reported in US dollars translated at contracted exchange rates.

_________________________________

(i)

Forward exchange contracts range in maturity from 2013 to 2014.

In addition to forward exchange contracts we undertake short-term foreign exchange swaps for liquidity purposes, these are not designated as hedges and do not qualify for hedge accounting. Both the fair value and the year to date gain/loss at

December 31, 2012

and


were immaterial.

During the year ended December 31, 2012, the Company entered into foreign currency hedges of certain intercompany loan balances.  These derivatives were not designated as hedging instruments and were for a total notional amount of

$63 million

, principally representing pound sterling sales.  In respect of these transactions, a nominal amount has been recognized as an asset within other current assets and a nominal gain has been recognized in income within other operating expenses for 2012.

in this assessment. In instances where the timing of expected cash flows can be matched exactly to the maturity of the foreign exchange contract, then changes in fair value attributable to movement in the forward points are also included.

At

the Company estimates there will be

$13 million

of net derivative gains reclassified from accumulated comprehensive income into earnings within the next twelve months.

and 2010.

All components of each derivative’s gain or loss were included in the assessment of hedge effectiveness.

Credit Risk and Concentrations of Credit Risk

Credit risk represents the loss that would be recognized at the reporting date if counterparties failed to perform as contracted and from movements in interest rates and foreign exchange rates. The Company currently does not anticipate non-performance by its counterparties. The Company generally does not require collateral or other security to support financial instruments with credit risk; however, it is the Company's policy to enter into master netting arrangements with counterparties as practical.

Concentrations of credit risk that arise from financial instruments exist for groups of customers or counterparties when they have similar economic characteristics that would cause their ability to meet contractual obligations to be similarly affected by changes in economic or other conditions. Financial instruments on the balance sheet that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable and derivatives which are recorded at fair value.

The Company maintains a policy providing for the diversification of cash and cash equivalent investments and places such investments in an extensive number of financial institutions to limit the amount of credit risk exposure. These financial institutions are monitored on an ongoing basis for credit quality predominantly using information provided by credit agencies.

Concentrations of credit risk with respect to receivables are limited due to the large number of clients and markets in which the Company does business, as well as the dispersion across many geographic areas. Management does not believe significant risk exists in connection with the Company's concentrations of credit as of December 31, 2012.



Notes to the financial statements

27.

FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS

The Company has categorized its assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring and non-recurring basis into a three-level fair value hierarchy, based on the reliability of the inputs used to determine fair value as follows:

•

Level 1: refers to fair values determined based on quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets;

•

Level 2: refers to fair values estimated using observable market based inputs or unobservable inputs that are corroborated by market data; and

•

Level 3: includes fair values estimated using unobservable inputs that are not corroborated by market data.

The following methods and assumptions were used by the Company in estimating its fair value disclosure for financial instruments:

Long-term debt excluding the fair value hedge-Fair values are based on quoted market values and so classified as Level 1 measurements.

Derivative financial instruments-Market values have been used to determine the fair value of interest rate swaps and forward foreign exchange contracts based on estimated amounts the Company would receive or have to pay to terminate the agreements, taking into account the current interest rate environment or current foreign currency forward rates.

Recurring basis

The following table presents, for each of the fair-value hierarchy levels, the Company's assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis.

Changes in the fair value of the underlying hedged debt instrument since inception of the hedging relationship are included in long-term debt.

The estimated fair value of the Company’s financial instruments held or issued to finance the Company’s operations is summarized below.

The fair value amounts shown below are not necessarily indicative of the amounts that the Company would realize upon disposition nor do they indicate the Company’s intent or ability to dispose of the financial instrument.



Notes to the financial statements

27.    FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS (Continued)

Non-recurring basis

The remeasurement of goodwill is classified as non-recurring level 3 fair value assessment due to the significance of unobservable inputs developed using company-specific information. The Company recognized an impairment charge in its North America reporting unit during 2012. The pre-tax impairment charge of

$492

million was recognized as a result of the Company's annual goodwill impairment testing performed as of October 1, 2012, which reduced the carrying value of the North America reporting unit goodwill as of that date of

$1,782

million to its implied fair value of

$1,290

million.

The Company used the income approach to measure the fair value of the North America reporting unit which involves calculating the fair value of a reporting unit based on the present value of the estimated future cash flows. Cash flow projections were based on management's estimates of revenue growth rates and operating margins, taking into consideration industry and market conditions and the uncertainty related to the business's ability to execute on the projected cash flows. The discount rate used was based on the weighted-average cost of capital adjusted for the relevant risk associated with the market participant expectations of characteristics of the individual reporting units. The unobservable inputs used to fair value this reporting unit include projected revenue growth rates, profitability and the market participant assumptions within the discount rate.

The inputs used to measure the fair value of the intangibles assets of the North America reporting unit in step two of the impairment test were largely unobservable, and accordingly, are also classified as Level 3. The fair value was estimated using a multiple period excess earnings method, which is based on management's cash flow projections of revenue growth rates, operating margins and expected customer attrition, taking into consideration industry and market conditions. The discount rate used in the fair value calculations for the intangibles was based on a weighted average cost of capital adjusted for the relevant risk associated with those assets. The unobservable inputs used in these valuations include projected revenue growth rates, and the market participant assumptions within the discount rate. For more information on this impairment measured as a nonrecurring fair value adjustment, see Note 13 - Goodwill.

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

As of

, the Company carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of the Company’s management, including the Chief Executive Officer  and the Group Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(e). Based upon that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and the Group Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of that date, the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) are effective.

There have been no changes in the Company's internal controls over financial reporting during the quarter ended December 31, 2012 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal control over financial reporting.

Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of

December 31, 2012

, based on the criteria related to internal control over financial reporting described in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on our evaluation, management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of

December 31, 2012

.

Our independent registered public accountants, Deloitte LLP, who have audited and reported on our financial statements, have undertaken an assessment of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Deloitte’s report is presented below.

February 28, 2013.



REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Willis Group Holdings Public Limited Company, Dublin, Ireland

We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Willis Group Holdings Public Limited Company and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of

December 31, 2012

, based on criteria established in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the company’s principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the company’s board of directors, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of

December 31, 2012

, based on the criteria established in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended

December 31, 2012

of the Company and our report dated February 28, 2013 expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements.
