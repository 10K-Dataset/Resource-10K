Willis Group Holdings plc

PART I

Item 1 — Business

History and Development of the Company

Willis Group Holdings is the ultimate holding company for the Group. We trace our history to 1828 and are one of the largest insurance brokers in the world.

Willis Group Holdings was incorporated in Ireland on September 24, 2009 to facilitate the change of the place of incorporation of the parent company of the Group from Bermuda to Ireland (the ‘Redomicile’). At December 31, 2009, the common shares of Willis-Bermuda were canceled, the Willis-Bermuda common shareholders received, on a one-for-one basis, new ordinary shares of Willis Group Holdings, and Willis Group Holdings became the ultimate parent company for the Group.

For administrative convenience, we utilize the offices of a subsidiary company as our principal executive offices. The address is:

Willis Group Holdings Public Limited Company

c/o Willis Group Limited

The Willis Building

51 Lime Street

London EC3M 7DQ

England

Tel: +44 20 3124 6000

For several years, we have focused on our core retail and specialist broking operations. In 2008, we acquired HRH, at the time the eighth largest insurance and risk management intermediary in the United States. The acquisition almost doubled our North America revenues and created critical mass in key markets including California, Florida, Texas, Illinois, New York, Boston, New Jersey and Philadelphia. In addition, we have made a number of smaller acquisitions around the world and increased our ownership in several of our associates and existing subsidiaries, which were not wholly-owned, where doing so strengthened our retail network and our specialty businesses.

Available Information

The Company files annual, quarterly and current reports, proxy statements and other information with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the ‘SEC’).

General

We provide a broad range of insurance brokerage, reinsurance and risk management consulting services to our clients worldwide. We have significant market positions in the United States, in the United Kingdom and, directly and through our



About Willis

associates, in many other countries. We are a recognized leader in providing specialized risk management advisory and other services on a global basis to clients in various industries including aerospace, marine, construction and energy.

In our capacity as an advisor and insurance broker, we act as an intermediary between our clients and insurance carriers by advising our clients on their risk management requirements, helping clients determine the best means of managing risk, and negotiating and placing insurance with insurance carriers through our global distribution network.

We assist clients in the assessment of their risks, advise on the best ways of transferring suitable risk to the global insurance and reinsurance markets and then execute the transactions at the most appropriate available price, terms and conditions for our clients. Our global distribution network enables us to place the risk in the most appropriate insurance or reinsurance market worldwide.

We also offer clients a broad range of services to help them to identify and control their risks. These services range from strategic risk consulting (including providing actuarial analysis), to a variety of due diligence services, to the provision of practical on-site risk control services (such as health and safety or property loss control consulting) as well as analytical and advisory services (such as hazard modeling and reinsurance optimization studies). We assist clients in planning how to manage incidents or crises when they occur. These services include contingency planning, security audits and product tampering plans. We are not an insurance company and therefore we do not underwrite insurable risks for our own account.

We derive most of our revenues from commissions and fees for brokerage and consulting services and do not determine the insurance premiums on which our commissions are generally based. Commission levels generally follow the same trend as premium levels as they are derived from a percentage of the premiums paid by the insureds. Fluctuations in these premiums charged by the insurance carriers can therefore have a direct and potentially material impact on our results of operations.

We and our associates serve a diverse base of clients including major multinational and middle-market companies in a variety of industries, as well as public institutions and individual clients. Many of our client relationships span decades. We have approximately 21,700 employees around the world (including approximately 3,700 at our associate companies) and a network of in excess of 400 offices in nearly 120 countries.

We believe we are one of only a few insurance brokers in the world possessing the global operating presence, broad product expertise and extensive distribution network necessary to meet effectively the global risk management needs of many of our clients.

We have also invested in associate companies; our significant associates at December 31, 2013 were GS & Cie Groupe ('Gras Savoye'), a French organization (30 percent holding) and Al-Futtaim Willis Co. LLC, organized under the laws of Dubai (49 percent holding). In connection with many of our investments we retain the right to increase our ownership over time, typically to a majority or 100 percent ownership position.

We believe the combined total revenues of our International subsidiaries and associates provide an indication of the spread and capability of our International network. These operations generated approximately

30 percent

of the Group’s total consolidated commissions and fees in


.

Customers

Our clients operate on a global and local scale in a multitude of businesses and industries throughout the world and generally range in size from major multinational corporations to middle-market companies. Further, many of our client relationships span decades, for instance our relationship with The Tokio Marine and Fire Insurance Company Limited dates back over 100 years. No one client accounted for more than 10 percent of revenues for fiscal year


. Additionally, we place insurance with approximately 2,500 insurance carriers, none of which individually accounted for more than 10 percent of the total premiums we placed on behalf of our clients in


.

Competition

We face competition in all fields in which we operate, based on global capability, product breadth, innovation, quality of service and price. We compete with Marsh & McLennan and Aon, the two other major providers of global risk management services, as well as with numerous specialist, regional and local firms. Competition for business is intense in all of our business lines and in every insurance market, and Marsh & McLennan and Aon have substantially greater market share than we do. Competition on premium rates has also exacerbated the pressures caused by a continuing reduction in demand in some classes of business. For example, rather than purchase additional insurance through brokers, some insureds have been retaining a greater proportion of their risk portfolios than previously. Industrial and commercial companies increasingly rely upon their own subsidiary insurance companies, known as captive insurance companies, self-insurance pools, risk retention groups, mutual insurance companies and other mechanisms for funding their risks, rather than buy insurance. Additional competitive pressures arise from the entry of new market participants, such as banks, accounting firms and insurance carriers themselves, offering risk management or transfer services.

A particular area of competitive pressure is market-derived income (MDI), which is revenue that insurance intermediaries increasingly have been obtaining from insurance carriers. Contingent commissions are one type of MDI where insurance carriers remunerate intermediates based on either the volume or profitability of risks placed with the carrier. While we have recently stated that we will apply a set of criteria to evaluate on a case-by-case basis whether we will take MDI, and in what form, to date we have not accepted contingent commissions from carriers other than in our Human Capital practice. To our knowledge, we are the only insurance broker that takes this stance. To the extent that our competitors accept volume- or profit-based continent commissions we may suffer lower revenue, reduced operating margins, and loss of market share which could materially and adversely affect our business.



About Willis

Regulation

Our business activities are subject to legal requirements and governmental and quasi-governmental regulatory supervision in virtually all countries in which we operate. Also, such regulations may require individual or company licensing to conduct our business activities. While these requirements may vary from location to location they are generally designed to protect our clients by establishing minimum standards of conduct and practice, particularly regarding the provision of advice and product information as well as financial criteria. Our three most significant regulatory regions are described below:

United States

Our activities in connection with insurance brokerage services within the United States are subject to regulation and supervision by state authorities. Although the scope of regulation and form of supervision may vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, insurance laws in the United States are often complex and generally grant broad discretion to supervisory authorities in adopting regulations and supervising regulated activities. That supervision generally includes the licensing of insurance brokers and agents and the regulation of the handling and investment of client funds held in a fiduciary capacity. Our continuing ability to provide insurance brokerage in the jurisdictions in which we currently operate is dependent upon our compliance with the rules and regulations promulgated from time to time by the regulatory authorities in each of these jurisdictions.

European Union

The European Union Insurance Mediation Directive introduced rules to enable insurance and reinsurance intermediaries to operate and provide services within each member state of the EU on a basis consistent with the EU single market and customer protection aims. Each EU member state in which we operate is required to ensure that the insurance and reinsurance intermediaries resident in their country are registered with a statutory body in that country and that each intermediary meets professional requirements in relation to their competence, good repute, professional indemnity cover and financial capacity.

United Kingdom

In the United Kingdom, our business was previously regulated by the Financial Services Authority ('FSA'). Under legislation enacted by the UK Parliament, the regulation of our business transitioned from the FSA to the Financial Conduct Authority ('FCA') on April 1, 2013. The FCA has a wide range of rule-making, investigatory and enforcement powers, and conducts monitoring visits to assess our compliance with regulatory requirements.

The FCA has a sole strategic objective: to protect and enhance confidence in the UK financial system. Its operational objectives are to: secure an appropriate degree of protection for consumers; promote efficiency and choice in the market for financial services; and protect and enhance the integrity of the UK financial system. The FCA also has a duty to act in a way that promotes competition, and to minimize the extent to which regulated businesses may be used for a purpose connected with financial crime. Finally, the FCA has new powers in product intervention. For instance, it can instruct firms to withdraw or amend misleading financial promotions.

Other

Certain of our activities are governed by other regulatory bodies, such as investment and securities licensing authorities. In the United States, our Willis Capital Markets & Advisory business operates through our wholly-owned subsidiary Willis Securities, Inc., a US-registered broker-dealer and investment advisor, member FINRA/SIPC, primarily in connection with investment banking-related services and advising on alternative risk financing transactions. Willis Capital Markets provides advice on securities or investments in the EU through our wholly-owned subsidiary Willis Capital Markets & Advisory Limited, which is authorized and regulated by the FCA.

Our failure, or that of our employees, to satisfy the regulators that we comply with their requirements or the legal requirements governing our activities, can result in disciplinary action, fines, reputational damage and financial harm.

All companies carrying on similar activities in a given jurisdiction are subject to regulations which are not dissimilar to the requirements for our operations in the United States and United Kingdom. We do not consider that these regulatory requirements adversely affect our competitive position.

See Part I, Item 1A-Risk Factors ‘Legal and Regulatory Risks’ for discussion of how actions by regulatory authorities or changes in legislation and regulation in the jurisdictions in which we operate may have an adverse effect on our business.

Risk Factors

Risks Relating to our Business and the Insurance Industry

This section describes material risks affecting the Group’s business. These risks could materially affect the Group’s business, its revenues, operating income, net income, net assets, liquidity and capital resources and ability to achieve its financial targets and, accordingly should be read in conjunction with any forward-looking statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Competitive Risks

Worldwide economic conditions could have an adverse effect on our business, prospects, operating results, financial condition and cash flows.

Our business and operating results are materially affected by worldwide economic conditions. Current global economic conditions, including those associated with the ongoing Eurozone crisis, coupled with low customer and business confidence may have a significant negative impact on the buying behavior of some of our clients as their businesses suffer from these conditions. Since 2008, many of our operations have been impacted by the weakened economic climate. A growing number of insolvencies associated with an economic downturn could adversely affect our brokerage business through the loss of clients or by hampering our ability to place insurance and reinsurance business. In addition, an increase in mergers and acquisitions can also result in the loss of clients. While it is difficult to predict the consequences of any further deterioration in global economic conditions on our business, any significant reduction or delay by our clients in purchasing insurance or making payment of premiums could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, the potential for a significant insurer to fail, be downgraded or withdraw from writing certain lines of insurance coverages that we offer our clients could negatively impact overall capacity in the industry, which could then reduce the placement of certain lines and types of insurance and reduce our revenues and profitability. The potential for an insurer to fail or be downgraded could also result in errors and omissions claims by clients.

The credit and economic conditions of certain European Union countries remain fragile and may contribute to instability in the global credit and financial markets. If credit conditions worsen or financial market volatility increases in the Eurozone, it is possible that it could have a negative effect on the global economy as a whole, and our business, operating results and financial condition. If the Eurozone crisis continues or further deteriorates, there will likely be a negative effect on our European business, as well as the businesses of our European clients. Further, were the Euro to be withdrawn entirely, or the Eurozone were to be dissolved as a common currency area, the legal and contractual consequences for holders of Euro-denominated obligations would be determined by laws in effect at such time. A significant devaluation of the Euro would cause the value of our financial assets that are denominated in Euros to be significantly reduced. Any of these conditions could ultimately harm our overall business, prospects, operating results, financial condition and cash flows.

We may not be able to fully realize the anticipated benefits of our new growth strategy.

At our 2013 Investor Conference, we stated that our goal is, over a medium-term period of five years, to deliver mid-teens total shareholder return, deliver consistent revenue growth in the mid-single digits and target revenue growth to outpace expense growth by more than 70 basis points. We emphasized that such results could fluctuate on a quarterly basis.

In order to achieve these goals, we are implementing certain revenue growth strategies and continue to strive to manage our cost base. For example, we announced a series of actions that include, among other things, the appointments of new global industry and product heads, the creation of a new Global Human Capital & Benefits Practice, a geographic realignment of the firm’s leadership team in North America and the merger of our UK retail and Global Specialty businesses. In light of the potential operational risks associated with these new initiatives, we cannot be certain whether we will be able to realize benefits from current revenue generating or cost-saving initiatives and ultimately realize our objectives. There can be no assurance that our actual results will meet these financial goals.

We do not control the premiums on which our commissions are based, and volatility or declines in premiums may seriously undermine our profitability.

We derive most of our revenues from commissions and fees for brokerage and consulting services and do not determine the insurance premiums on which our commissions are generally based. Commission levels generally follow the same trend as premium levels, as they are a percentage of the premiums paid by the insureds. Fluctuations in the premiums charged by the insurance carriers can therefore have a direct and potentially material impact on our results of operations. Due to the cyclical



Willis Group Holdings plc

nature of the insurance market and the impact of other market conditions on insurance premiums, commission levels may vary widely between accounting periods. A period of low or declining premium rates, generally known as a 'soft' or 'softening' market, generally leads to downward pressure on commission revenues and can have a material adverse impact on our commission revenues and operating margin. A 'hard' or 'firming' market, during which premium rates rise, generally has a favorable impact on our commission revenues and operating margin. Rates, however, vary by geography, industry and client segment. We have been and continue to be negatively impacted by soft market conditions across certain sectors and geographic regions. In addition, insurance carriers may seek to reduce their expenses by reducing the commission rates payable to insurance agents or brokers such as ourselves. The reduction of these commission rates, along with general volatility and/or declines in premiums, may significantly undermine our profitability.

Competition in our industry is intense, and if we are unable to compete effectively, we may suffer lower revenue, reduced operating margins and lose market share which could materially and adversely affect our business.

We face competition in all fields in which we operate, based on global capability, product breadth, innovation, quality of service and price. We compete with Marsh & McLennan and Aon, the two major global providers of global risk management services, as well as with numerous specialist, regional and local firms. Competition for business is intense in all of our business lines and in every insurance market, and Marsh & McLennan and Aon have substantially greater market share than we do. Competition on premium rates has also exacerbated the pressures caused by a continuing reduction in demand in some classes of business. For example, rather than purchase additional insurance through brokers, some insureds have been retaining a greater proportion of their risk portfolios than previously. Industrial and commercial companies increasingly rely upon their own subsidiary insurance companies, known as captive insurance companies, self-insurance pools, risk retention groups, mutual insurance companies and other mechanisms for funding their risks, rather than buy insurance. Additional competitive pressures arise from the entry of non-traditional market participants, such as banks, accounting firms and insurance carriers themselves, offering risk management or transfer services. If we are unable to compete effectively, we may suffer lower revenue, reduced operating margins and lose market share which could materially and adversely affect our business.

The loss of our Chief Executive Officer or a number of our senior management or a significant number of our brokers could significantly impede our financial plans, growth, marketing and other objectives.

The loss of our Chief Executive Officer, a number of our senior management or a significant number of our brokers could significantly impede our financial plans, growth, marketing and other objectives. Our success depends to a substantial extent not only on the ability and experience of our Chief Executive Officer, Dominic Casserley, and other members of our senior management, but also on the individual brokers and teams that service our clients and maintain client relationships. The insurance and reinsurance brokerage industry has in the past experienced intense competition for the services of leading individual brokers and brokerage teams, and we have lost key individuals and teams to competitors. We believe that our future success will depend in part on our ability to attract and retain additional highly skilled and qualified personnel and to expand, train and manage our employee base. We may not continue to be successful in doing so because the competition for qualified personnel in our industry is intense.

Investment in innovative product offerings may fail to yield sufficient return to cover their investment.

From time to time, we may enter new lines of business or offer new products and services within existing lines of business. There are substantial risks and uncertainties associated with these efforts, including the investment of significant time and resources, the possibility that these efforts will be unprofitable, and the risk of additional liabilities associated with these efforts. Failure to successfully manage these risks in the development and implementation of new lines of business and new products and services could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results for operations. External factors, such as compliance with regulations, competitive alternatives and shifting market preferences, may also impact the successful implementation of a new line of business. In addition, we can provide no assurance that the entry into new lines of business or development of new products and services will be successful.

We are continually developing and investing in new and innovative offerings that we believe will address needs that we identify in the market. Nevertheless, the ability of these efforts to produce meaningful value is dependent on a number of other factors, some of which are outside of our control. For example, we have recently launched G360, a suite of facilities for our specialty insurance clients which we expect will provide faster placement and claims agreements for our clients, and promote greater price competition in the specialty insurance market. The success of G360 will depend on client participation, market reaction as well as other factors both inside and outside our control. Additionally, our Global Human Capital and Benefits Practice has invested substantial time and resources in launching The Willis Advantage under the belief that this exchange will serve a useful role to help corporations and individuals in the US manage their growing health care expenses. But in order for The



Risk factors

Willis Advantage to be successful, health care insurers and corporate and individual participants must deem it suitable to participate in, and such decisions are based on their own particular circumstances.

Our business performance and growth plans could be negatively affected if we are not able to effectively apply technology to drive value for our clients through technology-based solutions or gain internal efficiencies through the effective application of technology and related tools.

Our success depends, in part, on our ability to develop and implement technology solutions that anticipate and keep pace with rapid and continuing changes in technology, industry standards and client preferences. We may not be successful in anticipating or responding to these developments in a timely and cost-effective manner, and our ideas may not be accepted in the marketplace. Additionally, the effort to gain technological expertise and develop new technologies in our business requires us to incur significant expenses. Our competitors are seeking to develop competing technologies, and their success in this space may impact our ability to differentiate our services to our clients through the use of unique technological solutions. If we cannot offer new technologies as quickly as our competitors or if our competitors develop more cost-effective technologies, it could have a material adverse effect on our ability to obtain and complete client engagements.

Legal and Regulatory Risks

Our compliance systems and controls cannot guarantee that we comply with all applicable federal and state or foreign laws and regulations, and actions by regulatory authorities or changes in applicable laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate may have an adverse effect on our business

.

Our activities are subject to extensive regulation under the laws of the United States, the United Kingdom, the European Union and its member states, and the other jurisdictions in which we operate. Indeed, over the last few years, there has been a substantial increase in focus on and developments in these laws and regulations. Compliance with laws and regulations that apply to our operations is complex and may increase our cost of doing business. These laws and regulations include insurance and financial industry regulations, economic and trade sanctions and laws against financial crimes, including client money and money laundering, bribery or other corruption, such as the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the UK Bribery Act and other anti-competitive regulations. In most jurisdictions, governmental and regulatory authorities have the ability to interpret and amend these laws and regulations and impose penalties for non-compliance, including sanctions, civil remedies, monetary fines, injunctions, revocation of licenses or approvals, suspension of individuals, limitations on business activities or redress to clients. While we believe that we currently maintain good relationships with our regulators and that our current systems and controls are adequate and in accordance with all applicable laws and regulations, we cannot assure that such systems and controls will prevent any violations of applicable laws and regulations.

Our business, results of operations, financial condition or liquidity may be materially adversely affected by actual and potential claims, lawsuits, investigations and proceedings.

We are subject to various actual and potential claims, lawsuits, investigations and other proceedings relating principally to alleged errors and omissions in connection with the placement of insurance and reinsurance in the ordinary course of business. Because we often assist our clients with matters, including the placement of insurance coverage and the handling of related claims, involving substantial amounts of money, errors and omissions claims against us may arise which allege our potential liability for all or part of the amounts in question.

Claimants can seek large damage awards and these claims can involve potentially significant defense costs. Such claims, lawsuits and other proceedings could, for example, include allegations of damages for our employees or sub-agents improperly failing to place coverage or notify claims on behalf of clients, to provide insurance carriers with complete and accurate information relating to the risks being insured or to appropriately apply funds that we hold for our clients on a fiduciary basis. Errors and omissions claims, lawsuits and other proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business are covered in part by professional indemnity or other appropriate insurance. The terms of this insurance vary by policy year and self-insured risks have increased significantly in recent years. In respect of self-insured risks, we have established provisions against these items which we believe to be adequate in the light of current information and legal advice, and we adjust such provisions from time to time according to developments. Our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity may be adversely affected if in the future our insurance coverage proves to be inadequate or unavailable or there is an increase in liabilities for which we self-insure. Our ability to obtain professional indemnity insurance in the amounts and with the deductibles we desire in the future may be adversely impacted by general developments in the market for such insurance or our own claims experience.

We are also subject to actual and potential claims, lawsuits, investigations and proceedings outside of errors and omissions claims. An example of material claims for which we are subject that are outside of the error and omissions claims context relate



Willis Group Holdings plc

to those arising out of the collapse of The Stanford Financial Group, for which we acted as brokers of record on certain lines of insurance.

The ultimate outcome of these matters cannot be ascertained and liabilities in indeterminate amounts may be imposed on us. It is thus possible that future results of operations or cash flows for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by an unfavorable resolution of these matters. In addition, these matters continue to divert management and personnel resources away from operating our business. Even if we do not experience significant monetary costs, there may also be adverse publicity associated with these matters that could result in reputational harm to the insurance brokerage industry in general or to us in particular that may adversely affect our business, client or employee relationships.

Accepting market derived income (MDI) may cause regulatory or other scrutiny, which may have a material and adverse effect on our business, and our position on contingent commissions may put us at a competitive disadvantage.

Insurance intermediaries have traditionally been remunerated by commission or fees paid by clients. Intermediaries also obtain revenue from insurance carriers. This is commonly known as market derived income or 'MDI'. MDI takes a variety of forms, including volume- or profit-based contingent commissions, facilities administration charges, business development agreements, and fees for providing certain data to carriers. We have recently stated that we will apply a set of criteria to evaluate on a case-by-case basis whether we will take MDI, and in what form.

MDI creates various risks. Intermediaries have a duty to act in the best interests of their clients and payments from carriers can incentivize intermediaries to put carriers’ interests ahead of their clients. Accordingly, MDI may be subject to scrutiny by various regulators under conflict of interest, anti-trust, unfair competition, and anti-bribery laws and regulations. While accepting MDI is a lawful and acceptable business practice, and while we will comply with all applicable laws and regulations, we cannot predict whether our position will cause regulatory or other scrutiny.

Additionally, as noted above, contingent commissions are a form of MDI. Over the past five years, other than in our Human Capital practice, we have not accepted contingent commissions from carriers. To our knowledge, we are the only insurance broker that takes this stance. If we continue to not accept contingents and our competitors accept volume- or profit-based continent commissions we may suffer lower revenue, reduced operating margins, and loss of market share which could materially and adversely affect our business.

IT and Operational Risks

Interruption to or loss of our information processing capabilities or failure to effectively maintain and upgrade our information processing systems could cause material financial loss, loss of human resources, regulatory actions, reputational harm or legal liability.

Our business depends significantly on effective information systems. Our capacity to service our clients relies on effective storage, retrieval, processing and management of information. Our information systems also rely on the commitment of significant resources to maintain and enhance existing systems, develop and create new systems and products in order to keep pace with continuing changes in information processing technology or evolving industry and regulatory standards and to be at the forefront of a range of technology relevant to our business.

If the information we rely on to run our business were found to be inaccurate or unreliable or if we fail to maintain effective and efficient systems (including through a telecommunications failure, failure to replace or update redundant or obsolete computer applications or software systems or if we experience other disruptions), this could result in material financial loss, regulatory action, reputational harm or legal liability.



Risk factors

Our inability to successfully recover should we experience a disaster or other significant disruption to business continuity could have a material adverse effect on our operations.

Our ability to conduct business may be adversely affected, even in the short-term, by a disruption in the infrastructure that supports our business and the communities where we are located. This may include a disruption caused by restricted physical site access, terrorist activities, disease pandemics, or outages to electrical, communications or other services used by our company, our employees or third parties with whom we conduct business. Although we have certain disaster recovery procedures in place and insurance to protect against such contingencies, such procedures may not be effective and any insurance or recovery procedures may not continue to be available at reasonable prices and may not address all such losses or compensate us for the possible loss of clients occurring during any period that we are unable to provide services. Our inability to successfully recover should we experience a disaster or other significant disruption to business continuity could have a material adverse effect on our operations.

Data security breaches or improper disclosure of confidential company or personal data could result in material financial loss, loss of human capital, regulatory actions, reputational harm or legal liability.

Computer viruses, hackers and other external hazards could expose confidential company and personal data systems to security breaches. Additionally, one of our significant responsibilities is to maintain the security and privacy of our clients’ confidential and proprietary information and the personal data of their employees. These increased risks, and expanding regulatory requirements regarding data security, could expose us to data loss, monetary and reputational damages and significant increases in compliance costs.

We maintain policies, procedures and technological safeguards designed to protect the security and privacy of this information in our database. However, we cannot entirely eliminate the risk of data security breaches, improper access to or disclosure of confidential company or personally identifiable information. Our technology may fail to adequately secure the private information we maintain in our databases and protect it from theft, computer viruses, hackers or inadvertent loss. In such circumstances, we may be held liable to our clients, which could result in legal liability or impairment to our reputation resulting in increased costs or loss of revenue. Further database privacy, identity theft, and related computer and internet issues are matters of growing public concern and are subject to frequently changing rules and regulations. Our failure to adhere to or successfully implement processes in response to changing regulatory requirements in this area could result in legal liability or impairment to our reputation in the marketplace.

Our non-core operations, such as our Willis Capital Markets & Advisory business, pose certain underwriting, advisory or reputational risks and can have a significant adverse impact on our financial results.

We provide a broad range of brokerage, reinsurance and risk management consulting services to our clients worldwide. We also engage in certain non-core operations. For example, our Willis Capital Markets & Advisory business provides advice to insurance and reinsurance companies on a broad array of mergers and acquisition transactions as well as capital markets products, including acting as underwriter or agent for primary issuances, operating a secondary insurance-linked securities trading desk and engaging in general capital markets and strategic advisory work. These operations may pose certain underwriting, advisory or reputational risks to our core business.

In addition, these non-core operations, although not material to the Group as a whole may, in any period, have a material effect on our results of operations. For example, our Willis Capital Markets & Advisory business is transaction-based which can cause results to differ from period-to-period. In another example, our financial results in 2011 and first two quarters of 2012 were adversely impacted by the significant deterioration of the financial results of our Loan Protector business driven by the loss of clients through attrition and M&A activity, industry-wide commission pressures and a slowdown in foreclosures.

Financial Risks

Our outstanding debt could adversely affect our cash flows and financial flexibility

.

We had total consolidated debt outstanding of approximately $

2.3 billion

as of December 31, 2013 and our 2013 interest expense was $

126 million

. Although management believes that our cash flows will be sufficient to service this debt, there may be circumstances in which required payments of principal and/or interest on this debt could adversely affect our cash flows and this level of indebtedness may:

•

require us to dedicate a significant portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our debt, thereby reducing the availability of cash flow to fund capital expenditures, to pursue other acquisitions or investments in new technologies, to pay dividends and for general corporate purposes;



Willis Group Holdings plc

•

increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic conditions, including if we borrow at variable interest rates, which makes us vulnerable to increases in interest rates generally;

•

limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes or challenges relating to our business and industry; and

•

put us at a competitive disadvantage against competitors who have less indebtedness or are in a more favorable position to access additional capital resources.

The terms of our current financings also include certain limitations. For example, the agreements relating to the debt arrangements and credit facilities contain numerous operating and financial covenants, including requirements to maintain minimum ratios of consolidated EBITDA to consolidated cash interest expense and maximum levels of consolidated funded indebtedness in relation to consolidated EBITDA, in each case subject to certain adjustments.

A failure to comply with the restrictions under our credit facilities and outstanding notes could result in a default under the financing obligations or could require us to obtain waivers from our lenders for failure to comply with these restrictions. The occurrence of a default that remains uncured or the inability to secure a necessary consent or waiver could cause our obligations with respect to our debt to be accelerated and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.

Our pension liabilities may increase which could require us to make additional cash contributions to our pension plans reducing the cash available for other uses

.

We have two principal defined benefit plans: one in the United Kingdom and the other in the United States, and in addition, we have several smaller defined benefit pension plans in certain other countries in which we operate. Total cash contributions to these defined benefit pension plans in 2013 were $150 million, including employees' salary sacrifice contributions. In 2014, the Company expects to make cash contributions of approximately

$134 million

, including employees' salary sacrifice contributions, to these pension plans, although we may elect to contribute more. Future estimates are based on certain assumptions, including discount rates, interest rates, mortality, fair value of assets and expected return on plan assets.

In 2012, we agreed a revised funding strategy with the UK plan's trustee under which we are committed to make additional cash contributions in the event that our adjusted EBITDA exceeds certain thresholds, or we make exceptional returns for our shareholders, including share buybacks or special dividends. As a result, we may be committed to make additional contributions through to 2017 based on the prior year's performance. In addition, during 2014 we will be required to negotiate a new funding arrangement with the UK pension trustee, which may further change the contributions we are required to make during 2014 and beyond.

We have taken actions to manage our pension liabilities, including closing our UK and US plans to new participants and restricting final pensionable salaries. Future benefit accruals in the US pension plan were also stopped, or frozen, on May 15, 2009. Nevertheless, the determination of pension expense and pension funding is based on a variety of rules and regulations. Changes in these rules and regulations could impact the calculation of pension plan liabilities and the valuation of pension plan assets. They may also result in higher pension costs, additional financial statement disclosure, and accelerate and increase the need to fully fund our pension plans through increased cash contributions. Further, a significant decline in the value of investments that fund our pension plan, if not offset or mitigated by a decline in our liabilities, may significantly alter the values and actuarial assumptions used to calculate our future pension expense and we could be required to fund our plan with significant additional amounts of cash. In addition to the critical assumptions described above, our plans use certain assumptions about the life expectancy of plan participants and surviving spouses. Periodic revision of those assumptions can materially change the present value of future benefits and therefore the funded status of the plans and the resulting periodic pension expense. Changes in our pension benefit obligations, the related net periodic costs or credits, and the required level of future cash contributions, may occur in the future due to any variance of actual results from our assumptions and changes in the number of participating employees. The need to make additional cash contributions may reduce our financial flexibility and increase liquidity risk by reducing the cash available to meet our other obligations, including the payment obligations under our credit facilities and other long-term debt, or other needs of our business.

We could incur substantial losses, including with respect to our own cash and fiduciary cash held on behalf of insurance companies and clients, if one of the financial institutions we use in our operations failed.

The deterioration of the global credit and financial markets has created challenging conditions for financial institutions, including depositories and the financial strength of these institutions may continue to decline. We maintain significant cash balances at various US depository institutions that are significantly in excess of the US Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation insurance limits. We also maintain significant cash balances in foreign financial institutions. A significant portion of this fiduciary cash is held on behalf of insurance companies or clients. If one or more of the institutions in which we maintain



Risk factors

significant cash balances were to fail, our ability to access these funds might be temporarily or permanently limited, and we could face a material liquidity problem and potentially material financial losses. We could also be liable to claims made by the insurance companies or our clients regarding the fiduciary cash held on their behalf.

A downgrade to our corporate credit rating and the credit ratings of our outstanding debt may adversely affect our borrowing costs and financial flexibility and, under certain circumstances, may require us to offer to buy back some of our outstanding debt.

A downgrade in our corporate credit rating or the credit ratings of our debt would increase our borrowing costs including those under our credit facilities, and reduce our financial flexibility. In addition, certain downgrades would trigger a step-up in interest rates under the indentures for our 6.200% senior notes due 2017 and our 7.000% senior notes due 2019

,

which would increase our interest expense. If we need to raise capital in the future, any credit rating downgrade could negatively affect our financing costs or access to financing sources. This may in turn impact the assumptions when performing our goodwill impairment testing which may reduce the excess of fair value over carrying value of the reporting units.

In addition, under the indenture for our 4.625% senior notes due 2023 and our 6.125% senior notes due 2043, if we experience a ratings decline together with a change of control event, we would be required to offer to purchase our 4.625% senior notes due 2023 and our 6.125% senior notes due 2043 from holders unless we had previously redeemed those notes. We may not have sufficient funds available or access to funding to repurchase tendered notes in that event, which could result in a default under the notes. Any future debt that we incur may contain covenants regarding repurchases in the event of a change of control triggering event.

We face certain risks associated with the acquisition or disposition of businesses and lack of control over investments in associates.

In pursuing our corporate strategy, we may acquire or dispose of or exit businesses or reorganize existing investments. For example, we have a call option to acquire 100 percent of the capital of Gras Savoye. The success of our overall acquisition and disposition strategy is dependent upon our ability to identify appropriate opportunities, negotiate transactions on favorable terms and ultimately complete such transactions. Once we complete acquisitions or reorganizations there can be no assurance that we will realize the anticipated benefits of any transaction, including revenue growth, operational efficiencies or expected synergies. For example, if we fail to recognize some or all of the strategic benefits and synergies expected from a transaction, goodwill and intangible assets may be impaired in future periods.

In addition, we may not be able to integrate acquisitions successfully into our existing business, and we could incur or assume unknown or unanticipated liabilities or contingencies, which may impact our results of operations. If we dispose of or otherwise exit certain businesses, there can be no assurance that we will not incur certain disposition related charges, or that we will be able to reduce overheads related to the divested assets.

We also own an interest in a number of associates, such as Gras Savoye, where we do not exercise management control and we are therefore unable to direct or manage the business to realize the anticipated benefits that we can achieve through full integration.

If our goodwill becomes impaired, we may be required to record significant charges to earnings.

We have a substantial amount of goodwill on our balance sheet as a result of acquisitions we have completed. We review goodwill for impairment annually or whenever events or circumstances indicate impairment may have occurred.

Our annual goodwill impairment analysis is performed each year at October 1. In fiscal year 2012, we recognized an impairment charge of $492 million in the Consolidated Statement of Operations in relation to our North American business. At October 1, 2013, our analysis showed that the estimated fair values of each of our reporting units were in excess of the carrying values and therefore did not result in any impairment charge in 2013.

Application of the impairment test requires judgment, including the identification of reporting units, assignment of assets, liabilities and goodwill to reporting units and determination of fair value of each reporting unit. Notwithstanding the fact that we recognized an impairment charge in fiscal year 2012 for our North American reporting unit, the risk remains that a significant deterioration in a key estimate or assumption or a less significant deterioration to a combination of assumptions or the sale of a part of a reporting unit could result in an impairment charge in the future, which could have a significant adverse impact on our reported earnings.



Willis Group Holdings plc

For further information on our testing for goodwill impairment, see ‘Critical Accounting Estimates’ under Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.

We are a holding company and, therefore, may not be able to receive dividends or other distributions in needed amounts from our subsidiaries.

Willis Group Holdings is organized as a holding company that conducts no business of its own. We are dependent upon dividends and other payments from our operating subsidiaries to meet our obligations for paying principal and interest on outstanding debt obligations, for paying dividends to shareholders and for corporate expenses. Legal and regulatory restrictions, foreign exchange controls, as well as operating requirements of our subsidiaries, may limit our ability to obtain cash from these subsidiaries. For example, Willis Limited, our UK brokerage subsidiary regulated by the FCA, is currently required to maintain $126 million in unencumbered and available funds, of which at least $79 million must be in cash, for regulatory purposes. In the event our operating subsidiaries are unable to pay dividends and make other payments to Willis Group Holdings, we may not be able to service debt, pay obligations or pay dividends on ordinary shares.

International Risks

Our significant non-US operations, particularly our London market operations, expose us to exchange rate fluctuations and various risks that could impact our business.

A significant portion of our operations is conducted outside the United States. Accordingly, we are subject to legal, economic and market risks associated with operating in foreign countries, including devaluations and fluctuations in currency exchange rates; imposition of limitations on conversion of foreign currencies into pounds sterling or dollars or remittance of dividends and other payments by foreign subsidiaries; hyperinflation in certain foreign countries; imposition or increase of investment and other restrictions by foreign governments; and the requirement of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws.

We report our operating results and financial condition in US dollars. Our US operations earn revenue and incur expenses primarily in US dollars. In our London market operations, however, we earn revenue in a number of different currencies, but expenses are almost entirely incurred in pounds sterling. Outside the United States and our London market operations, we predominantly generate revenue and expenses in the local currency. The table gives an approximate analysis of revenues and expenses by currency in 2013.

Because of devaluations and fluctuations in currency exchange rates or the imposition of limitations on conversion of foreign currencies into US dollars, we are subject to currency translation exposure on the profits of our operations, in addition to economic exposure. Furthermore, the mismatch between pounds sterling revenues and expenses, together with any net sterling balance sheet position we hold in our US dollar denominated London market operations, creates an exchange exposure.

For example, as the pound sterling strengthens, the US dollars required to be translated into pounds sterling to cover the net sterling expenses increase, which then causes our results to be negatively impacted. However, any net sterling asset we are holding will be more valuable when translated into US dollars. Given these facts, the strength of the pound sterling relative to the US dollar has in the past had a material negative impact on our reported results. This risk could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition, cash flow and results of operations in the future.

Where needed, we deploy a hedging strategy to mitigate part of our operating exposure to exchange rate movements, but such mitigating attempts may not be successful. For more information on this strategy, see Part II Item 8 - 'Note 26 Derivative Financial Instruments and Hedging Activities'.

In conducting our businesses around the world, we are subject to political, economic, legal, market, nationalization, operational and other risks that are inherent in operating in many countries.

In conducting our businesses and maintaining and supporting our global operations, we are subject to political, economic, legal, market, nationalization, operational and other risks. Our businesses and operations continue to expand into new regions throughout the world, including emerging markets. The possible effects of economic and financial disruptions throughout the world could have an adverse impact on our businesses. These risks include:

•

the general economic and political conditions in foreign countries;



Risk factors

•

the imposition of controls or limitations on the conversion of foreign currencies or remittance of dividends and other payments by foreign subsidiaries;

•

imposition of withholding and other taxes on remittances and other payments from subsidiaries;

•

imposition or increase of investment and other restrictions by foreign governments;

•

fluctuations in our effective tax rate;

•

difficulties in controlling operations and monitoring employees in geographically dispersed and culturally diverse locations;

•

the potential costs and difficulties in complying, or monitoring compliance, with a wide variety of foreign laws (some of which may conflict with US or other sources of law), laws and regulations applicable to insurance brokers and US business operations abroad, including rules relating to the conduct of business, trade sanctions administered by the US Office of Foreign Assets Control, the EU, the UK and the UN, and the requirements of the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act as well as other anti-bribery and corruption rules and requirements in the countries in which we operate; and

•

the potential costs and difficulties in complying with local regulation for our operating subsidiaries across the globe.

Legislative and regulatory action could materially and adversely affect us and our effective tax rate may increase.

There is uncertainty regarding the tax policies of the jurisdictions where we operate (which include the potential legislative actions described below), and our effective tax rate may increase and any such increase may be material. Additionally, the tax laws of Ireland and other jurisdictions could change in the future, and such changes could cause a material change in our effective tax rate. For example, legislative action may be taken by the US Congress which, if ultimately enacted, could override tax treaties upon which we rely or could broaden the circumstances under which we would be considered a US resident, each of which could materially and adversely affect our effective tax rate and cash tax position. We cannot predict the outcome of any specific legislative proposals. However, if proposals were enacted that had the effect of limiting our ability to take advantage of tax treaties between Ireland and other jurisdictions (including the US), we could be subjected to increased taxation. In addition, any future amendments to the current income tax treaties between Ireland and other jurisdictions could subject us to increased taxation.

Irish law differs from the laws in effect in the United States and may afford less protection to holders of our securities.

It may not be possible to enforce court judgments obtained in the United States against us in Ireland based on the civil liability provisions of the US federal or state securities laws. In addition, there is some uncertainty as to whether the courts of Ireland would recognize or enforce judgments of US courts obtained against us or our directors or officers based on the civil liabilities provisions of the US federal or state securities laws or hear actions against us or those persons based on those laws. We have been advised that the United States currently does not have a treaty with Ireland providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters. Therefore, a final judgment for the payment of money rendered by any US federal or state court based on civil liability, whether or not based solely on US federal or state securities laws, would not be directly enforceable in Ireland. While not directly enforceable, it is possible for a final judgment for the payment of money rendered by any US federal or state court based on civil liability to be enforced in Ireland through common law rules. However, this process is subject to numerous established principles and would involve the commencement of a new set of proceedings in Ireland to enforce the judgment.

As an Irish company, Willis Group Holdings is governed by the Irish Companies Acts, which differ in some material respects from laws generally applicable to US corporations and shareholders, including, among others, differences relating to interested director and officer transactions and shareholder lawsuits. Likewise, the duties of directors and officers of an Irish company generally are owed to the company only. Shareholders of Irish companies generally do not have a personal right of action against directors or officers of the company and may exercise such rights of action on behalf of the Company only in limited circumstances. Accordingly, holders of Willis Group Holdings securities may have more difficulty protecting their interests than would holders of securities of a corporation incorporated in a jurisdiction of the United States.

Share Data

Our shares have been traded on the New York Stock Exchange (‘NYSE’) under the symbol ‘WSH’ since June 11, 2001. The high and low sale prices of our shares, as reported by the NYSE, are set forth below for the periods indicated.

On February 14, 2014, the last reported sale price of our shares as reported by the NYSE was $41.46 per share. As of February 14, 2014 there were approximately 1,242 shareholders on record of our shares.

Dividends

We normally pay dividends on a quarterly basis to shareholders of record on March 31, June 30, September 30 and December 31. The dividend payment dates and amounts are as follows:

There are no governmental laws, decrees or regulations in Ireland which will restrict the remittance of dividends or other payments to non-resident holders of the Company’s shares.



Willis Group Holdings plc

In circumstances where one of Ireland’s many exemptions from dividend withholding tax (‘DWT’) does not apply, dividends paid by the Company will be subject to Irish DWT (currently 20 percent). Residents of the US should be exempt from Irish DWT provided relevant documentation supporting the exemption has been put in place. While the US-Ireland Double Tax Treaty contains provisions reducing the rate of Irish DWT in prescribed circumstances, it should generally be unnecessary for US residents to rely on the provisions of this treaty due to the wide scope of exemptions from Irish DWT available under Irish domestic law. Irish income tax may also arise in respect of dividends paid by the Company. However, US residents entitled to an exemption from Irish DWT generally have no Irish income tax liability on dividends.

With respect to non-corporate US shareholders, certain dividends from a qualified foreign corporation may be subject to reduced rates of taxation. A foreign corporation is treated as a qualified foreign corporation with respect to dividends received from that corporation on shares that are readily tradable on an established securities market in the United States, such as our shares. Non-corporate US shareholders that do not meet a minimum holding period requirement for our shares during which they are not protected from the risk of loss or that elect to treat the dividend income as ‘investment income’ pursuant to section 163(d)(4) of the Code will not be eligible for the reduced rates of taxation regardless of our status as a qualified foreign corporation. In addition, the rate reduction will not apply to dividends if the recipient of a dividend is obligated to make related payments with respect to positions in substantially similar or related property. This disallowance applies even if the minimum holding period has been met. US shareholders should consult their own tax advisors regarding the application of these rules given their particular circumstances.

Item 7 —

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

This discussion includes references to non-GAAP financial measures as defined in

Regulation G of the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission ('SEC'). We

present such non-GAAP financial measures, specifically, organic growth in commissions

and fees, adjusted operating margin, adjusted operating income, adjusted net income

from continuing operations and adjusted earnings per diluted share from continuing

operations, as we believe such information is of interest to the investment community

because it provides additional meaningful methods of evaluating certain aspects of

the Company's operating performance from period to period on a basis that may not be

otherwise apparent on a GAAP basis. Organic growth in commissions and fees excludes

the impact of acquisitions and disposals, period over period movements in foreign currency , and

investment and other income from growth in revenues.

Adjusted operating income

,

adjusted operating margin, adjusted net income from continuing operations and

adjusted earnings per diluted share from continuing operations are calculated by

excluding the impact of certain specified items from operating income, net income or loss from continuing

operations, and earnings per diluted share from continuing operations, respectively, the most directly comparable GAAP measures. Our methods of calculating these measures may differ from those used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited. These financial measures

should be viewed in addition to, not in lieu of, the consolidated financial

statements for the year ended

December 31, 2013

This discussion includes forward-looking statements, including under the headings 'Executive Summary', 'Liquidity and Capital Resources', 'Critical Accounting Estimates' and 'Contractual Obligations'. Please see 'Forward-Looking Statements' for

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Business Overview

We provide a broad range of insurance broking, risk management and consulting services to our clients worldwide and organize our business into three segments: Global, North America and International.

Our Global business provides specialist brokerage and consulting services to clients worldwide arising from specific industries and activities including Aerospace; Energy; Marine; Construction, Property and Casualty; Financial and Executive Risks; Financial Solutions; Faber Global; Fine Art, Jewelry and Specie; Special Contingency Risks; Hughes-Gibbs; Willis Capital Markets & Advisory; Placement and Reinsurance.

North America and International comprise: our retail operations and provide services to small, medium and large corporations; and the Human Capital practice, our largest product-based practice group, provides health, welfare and human resources consulting and brokerage services.

In our capacity as advisor and insurance broker, we act as an intermediary between our clients and insurance carriers by advising our clients on their risk management requirements, helping clients determine the best means of managing risk, and negotiating and placing insurance with insurance carriers through our global distribution network.

We derive most of our revenues from commissions and fees for brokerage and consulting services and do not determine the insurance premiums on which our commissions are generally based. Commission levels generally follow the same trend as premium levels as they are derived from a percentage of the premiums paid by the insureds. Fluctuations in these premiums charged by the insurance carriers can therefore have a direct and potentially material impact on our results of operations.

Due to the cyclical nature of the insurance market and the impact of other market conditions on insurance premiums, commission revenues may vary widely between accounting periods. A period of low or declining premium rates, generally known as a 'soft' or 'softening' market, generally leads to downward pressure on commission revenues and can have a material adverse impact on our commission revenues and operating margin. A 'hard' or 'firming' market, during which premium rates rise, generally has a favorable impact on our commission revenues and operating margin. Rates, however, vary by geography, industry and client segment. As a result and due to the global and diverse nature of our business, we view rates holistically.



Willis Group Holdings plc

Market Conditions

Market conditions in our industry are generally defined by factors such as the strength of the economies in the various geographic regions in which we serve around the world, insurance rate movements, and insurance and reinsurance buying patterns of our clients.

The industry and market in general throughout 2011 and early 2012 experienced modest increase in catastrophe-exposed property insurance and reinsurance pricing levels driven by significant catastrophe losses including the Japanese earthquake and tsunami, the New Zealand earthquake and, late in 2012, Super Storm Sandy. Also during that period, direct carriers in North America, facing persistent low investment returns, started to modestly raise rates in certain products. This firming rate environment, however, generally did not extend beyond North America to impact our International retail business.

Early in 2013 the reinsurance market was generally flat, however, as the year progressed we saw changing market sentiment driven by changes in the sources of capital and increases in capital supply in the reinsurance market, most notably within the North American catastrophe-exposed property market. The influx of third party capital coupled with changes to reinsurance buying patterns and regulatory complexity is leading to growing complexity in the reinsurance market and a softening of prices.

This pattern of new capacity and market entrants coupled with strong underwriting performance in 2013, due to the absence of natural and man-made catastrophes, means that the trend of price softening is continuing as we enter 2014 and is extending to other lines of business, not just catastrophe exposed property.

The outlook for our business, operating results and financial condition continues to be challenging due to the global economic condition. There are signs of improving conditions both in the US, and within certain European Union countries, including a return to sustained GDP growth in certain countries. If conditions in the Global economy, including the US, the UK and the Eurozone deteriorate, there will likely be a negative effect on our business as well as the businesses of our clients.

In the face of this challenging economic environment we have adopted a strategy to invest selectively in growth areas, defined by geography, industry sector and client segment, and to better align our three segments so as to, among other things, bring our clients greater access to the Company's specialty areas and analytical capabilities. Our growth strategy also involves increasing our investment in, and deployment of, our analytical capabilities.

The


total expenses included $46 million related to the Expense Reduction Initiative (see 'Expense Reduction Initiative' section below) conducted earlier in the year. The


total expenses included a $492 million non-cash goodwill impairment charge related to our North American reporting unit, a $200 million write-off of unamortized cash retention awards following the decision to eliminate the repayment requirement of past awards, and a $252 million expense related to the accrual for 2012 cash bonuses paid in 2013. Foreign currency movements had a $9 million positive impact on total expenses in


.

Excluding the items noted above, total expenses in 2013 were $188 million, or 6.8 percent, higher than in 2012. The largest driver of this was the increase in salaries and benefits due to annual salary reviews, higher charges for share-based compensation and new hires and investments in targeted businesses and geographies. In addition to these, we recorded higher incentives as a result of growth in commissions and fees, and the change in remuneration policy. Other operating expenses also increased due to travel, accommodation and client entertaining costs to support business development, marketing costs, strategic review charges and higher professional fees.



Business discussion

The Company incurred a loss on extinguishment of debt of $60 million from the refinancing that was completed during 2013.

The tax rate for the full year was affected by an incremental US tax expense of $9 million recorded after taking into account the impact of adjustments to the valuation allowance placed against our US deferred tax assets.

Earnings from associates were down $5 million, net of tax, mainly due to costs of a reorganization program in our principal associate, Gras Savoye.

Net income attributable to Willis shareholders from continuing operations was $

365 million

or $

2.04

per diluted share in


compared to a loss of $

446 million

or $

2.58

per diluted share in


. The

$811 million

increase in net income compared to 2012 can be attributed primarily to the non-recurrence of the 2012 items discussed above and growth in commissions and fees partially offset by growth in expenses.


compared to


Total revenues in 2012 of $3,480 million increased by $33 million, or 1.0 percent, compared to 2011, including a $59 million or 1.7 percent negative impact from movements in foreign exchange. Organic growth in commissions and fees of 3.1 percent was driven by our International and Global operations. Our North America operations reported a decline of 0.6 percent in commissions and fees, due to lower revenues generated by Loan Protector, a specialty business acquired as part of the HRH business, and the continued adverse impact of difficult economic conditions in the US.

Total expenses in 2012 of $3,689 million increased $808 million compared to 2011, primarily due to the recognition of a $492 million non-cash goodwill impairment charge related to our North American reporting unit, a $200 million write-off of unamortized cash retention awards following the decision to eliminate the repayment requirement of past awards, and a $252 million expense related to the accrual for 2012 cash bonuses paid in 2013.

Excluding these expenses, total operating expenses declined $136 million, or 4.7 percent, principally due to $180 million expense recognized in 2011 related to the Operational Review and favorable movements in foreign exchange partially offset by increases in salary and benefits expenses linked to annual pay reviews, new hires and investments in targeted businesses and geographies.

Net loss attributable to Willis shareholders from continuing operations was $446 million or a loss of $2.58 per diluted share in 2012 compared to a profit of $203 million or $1.15 per diluted share in 2011. The $649 million decrease in net income compared to 2011 primarily reflects the increase in total expenses described above and the $113 million charge to establish a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets in our US operations, partially offset by the non-recurrence of the $131 million post-tax cost in 2011 relating to the make-whole amounts on the repurchase and redemption of $500 million of our senior debt and the write-off of related unamortized debt issuance costs and by the revenue growth achieved during the year. Net income in 2012 was also adversely impacted by a $7 million reduction in interest in earnings of associates, net of tax, mainly due to declining performance in our principal associate, Gras Savoye.

Adjusted Operating Income, Adjusted Net Income from Continuing Operations and Adjusted Earnings per Diluted Share from Continuing Operations

Our non-GAAP measures of adjusted operating income, adjusted net income from continuing operations and adjusted earnings per diluted share from continuing operations are calculated by excluding the impact of certain items (as detailed below) from operating income (loss), net income (loss) from continuing operations, and earnings per diluted share from continuing operations, respectively, the most directly comparable GAAP measures.

The following items are excluded from operating income (loss) and net income (loss) from continuing operations as applicable:

(i)

the additional incentive accrual recognized following the replacement of annual cash retention awards with annual cash bonuses which will not feature a repayment requirement;

(ii)

write-off of unamortized cash retention awards following the decision to eliminate the repayment requirement on past awards;

(iii)

goodwill impairment charge;

(iv)

valuation allowance against deferred tax assets;

(v)

write-off of uncollectible accounts receivable balance and associated legal fees arising in Chicago due to fraudulent overstatement of commissions and fees;

(vi)

costs associated with the 2011 Operational Review;

(vii)

significant legal and regulatory settlements which are managed centrally;

(viii)

gains and losses on the disposal of operations;

(ix)

insurance recoveries;

(x)

make-whole amounts on repurchase and redemption of senior notes and write-off of unamortized debt issuance costs;

(xi)

loss and fees related to the extinguishment of debt; and

(xii)

costs associated with the Expense Reduction Initiative.

We believe that excluding these items, as applicable, from operating income (loss), net income (loss) from continuing operations and earnings per diluted share from continuing operations provides a more complete and consistent comparative analysis of our results of operations. We use these and other measures to establish Group performance targets and evaluate the performance of our operations.

Potentially issuable shares were not included in the calculation of diluted earnings per share, GAAP basis, because the Company's net loss from continuing operations rendered their impact anti-dilutive.



Business discussion

Goodwill Impairment

Our annual goodwill impairment analysis is performed each year at October 1. At October 1,


our analysis showed the estimated fair value of each reporting unit was in excess of the carrying value, and therefore did not result in an impairment charge (


: $492 million;


: $nil).

In 2012 an impairment charge for the North America reporting unit was required and amounted to $492 million. There was no impairment for the Global and International reporting units, as the fair values of these units were significantly in excess of their carrying value.

Correction of Commissions and Fees Overstatement Relating to 2011 and Prior Periods

As previously disclosed, in early 2012 we identified through our internal financial control process and a subsequent internal investigation an uncollectible accounts receivable balance of approximately $40 million in Chicago from the fraudulent overstatement of Commissions and fees from the years 2005 to 2011.

We concluded that the total $40 million of overstatement did not materially affect our previously issued financial statements for any of the prior periods and we corrected the misstatement by recognizing a charge to Other operating expenses to write off the uncollectible receivable (a) of $13 million (including legal expenses) in the first quarter of 2012 and (b) of $22 million in the fourth quarter of 2011. In the fourth quarter 2011 we also reversed a $6 million balance of Commissions and fees which had been recorded during 2011 and $2 million of Salaries and benefits expense representing an over-accrual of production bonuses relating to the overstated revenue. During 2012, we recorded within Other operating expenses a $10 million insurance settlement from insurers in respect of our claim under Group insurance policies, for compensation paid out in the years 2005 to 2010 on the fraudulently overstated revenues discussed above.

The employees in question, who have been terminated, were not members of Willis executive management nor did they play a significant role in internal control over financial reporting. Based on the results of our investigation, which has now been completed, we do not believe that any client or carrier funds were misappropriated or that any other business units were affected.

We have enhanced our internal controls in relation to the business unit in question, including enhanced procedures over receipt of checks and application of cash, increased segregation of duties between the operating unit and the accounting and settlement function, and additional central sign off requirement on revenue recognition.

Expense Reduction Initiative

The Company recorded a pre-tax charge of $46 million in the first quarter of 2013 related to the previously announced assessment of the Company's organizational design. In connection with this assessment, we incurred the following pre-tax charges:

•

$29 million of severance and other staff related costs towards the elimination of 207 positions; and

•

$17 million of Other operating expenses and Depreciation resulting from the rationalization of property and systems.

The Company did not incur any further charges related to this review.

The actions taken resulted in total cost savings of approximately $20 million exclusive of the costs incurred in 2013. It is also anticipated that we will achieve prospective annualized cost savings of approximately $25 million to $30 million.

Cash Retention Awards

For the past several years, certain cash retention awards under the Company's annual incentive programs included a feature which required the recipient to repay a proportionate amount of the annual award if the employee voluntarily left the Company before a specified date, which was generally three years following the award. As previously disclosed, the Company made the cash payment to the recipient in the year of grant and recognized the payment in expense ratably over the period it was subject to repayment, beginning in the quarter in which the award was made. The unamortized portion of cash retention awards was recorded within 'other current assets' and 'other non-current assets' in the consolidated balance sheets.

The following table sets out the amount of cash retention awards made and the related amortization of those awards for the three years ended December 31,


.



Willis Group Holdings plc

In December 2012, the Company decided to eliminate the repayment requirement from past annual cash retention awards and, as a result, recognized a non-cash, pre-tax charge of

$200 million

which represents the write-off of the unamortized balance of past awards at that date.

There were, however, a number of off-cycle awards with a fixed period guarantee attached, for which we have not waived the repayment requirement. The unamortized portion of these awards amounted to

$15 million

at

December 31, 2013

(


:

$9 million

;


:

$196 million

).

In addition, in 2012, the Company replaced annual cash retention awards with annual cash bonuses which did not include a repayment requirement. As at

December 31, 2012

, the Company had accrued

$252 million

for these bonuses.

Pension Expense

We recorded a net periodic benefit income on our UK defined benefit pension plan in


of

$5 million

(

(

).

The periodic benefit income on the UK plan in


is flat compared to


as higher asset returns were offset by higher amortization of unrecognized actuarial losses and increased service costs.

The movement to

$5 million

income on the UK plan in


from a

$6 million

was primarily due to higher asset returns partially offset by higher amortization of unrecognized actuarial losses and increased interest cost.

On the US plan, the movement to a

REVIEW OF CONSOLIDATED RESULTS

The following table is a summary of our revenues, operating income (loss), operating margin, net income (loss) and diluted earnings per share (in millions, except per share data and percentages):



Willis Group Holdings plc

Consolidated Results for


compared to


Revenues

Total revenues by segment for


and


are shown below (millions, except percentages):

_________________

(a)

Organic commissions and fees growth excludes: (i) the impact of foreign currency translation; (ii) the first twelve months of net commission and fee revenues generated from acquisitions; and (iii) the net commission and fee revenues related to operations disposed of in each period presented.

(b)

North America commissions and fees in 2013 included the positive impact of a $5 million adjustment to align the recognition of revenue in the North America Personal Lines business with the rest of the Group.

(c)

International commissions and fees in 2013 included the negative impact of a $15 million adjustment to align the recognition of revenue in China with the rest of the Group.

Our methods of calculating these measures may differ from those used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited.

Total revenues increased by

$175 million

, or

5.0 percent

, in


compared to


. This was primarily due to

5.1 percent

growth in commissions and fees and an increase of

$3 million

in other income arising from the disposal of books of business, partially offset by a

$3 million

decrease in investment income due to continued falling yields on deposits.

Total commissions and fees in


were

$3,633 million

, up

$175 million

, or

5.1 percent

, from

$3,458 million

in


. This increase was due to organic growth of

4.9 percent

and growth through acquisitions and disposals of

0.5 percent

partially offset by negative foreign currency movements of $13 million or

0.3 percent

.

Organic growth of

4.9 percent

was driven by low double-digit new business growth tempered by lost business.

Commissions and fees were reduced by a net $9 million impact of two revenue recognition adjustments in the North America and International segments discussed below.

The Global segment reported

5.7 percent

growth in commissions and fees, comprising

5.6 percent

organic growth and a net

1.0 percent

growth from acquisitions and disposals mainly due to Prime Professions which was acquired in second quarter 2013. This growth was partially offset by a

0.9 percent

negative impact from foreign currency translation.

Organic commissions and fees growth of

5.6 percent

was led by high single-digit growth in Reinsurance, where all the divisions reported positive growth. Global Specialties reported mid single-digit growth primarily due to strong growth from Financial and Executive Risk, and P&C and Construction. Willis Capital Markets & Advisory performed solidly but was down compared to the very strong result it recorded in 2012 relating to meaningfully higher volumes of advisory fees and catastrophe bond deals.

The North America segment reported

5.4 percent

growth in commissions and fees compared to


. This comprised organic growth of

4.9 percent

and acquisitions of

0.6 percent

from Avalon Actuarial Inc., which was acquired at the end of fourth quarter 2012, partially offset by a negative

0.1 percent

impact from foreign currency translation. Organic growth in commissions and fees was positively impacted by a $5 million adjustment to align the recognition of revenue in the North America Personal Lines business with the rest of the Group.

Organic growth was driven by double-digit new business growth and increased client retention levels compared to


. Growth was achieved across all of our North America regions, led by the Metro, Midwest, Canada and CAPPPS regions.



Business discussion

Similarly, most of the major practice groups recorded positive growth including mid-single digit growth in our two largest practices, Human Capital and Construction.

The International segment reported

3.9 percent

growth in commissions and fees compared with


, comprising

4.1 percent

organic growth slightly offset by a

0.2 percent

negative impact from foreign currency translation. Organic growth in commissions and fees included the negative impact of a $15 million adjustment to align the recognition of revenue in China with the rest of the Group.

Organic growth was led by double-digit growth in our Latin America region and high single-digit growth in Eastern Europe. We reported low single-digit growth in Western Europe, despite the generally weak economic conditions within the region. Despite the negative impact of the $15 million revenue adjustment, we recorded good growth in Asia, predominantly in Hong Kong and Singapore. We also reported low single-digit growth in Australasia.

Organic commissions and fees growth by segment is discussed further in 'Review of Segmental Results', below.

Salaries and Benefits

Salaries and benefits were $

268 million

, or

10.8 percent

, lower in


compared with


. Foreign currency movements lowered salaries and benefits by $9 million, or 0.4 percent.

In


we recorded a $452 million charge as a result of the change in remuneration policy for future incentive awards and the elimination of the repayment requirement on past awards. Excluding the impact of this change and foreign currency movements, salaries and benefits were up by $193 million or 9.5 percent. This increase is primarily due to annual salary reviews, increased headcount due to targeted investments, increased incentives from the change in remuneration policy and growth in commissions and fees, and an additional charge to increase the 401(k) match. It also includes $29 million relating to the Expense Reduction Initiative that was undertaken in first quarter 2013 (see 'Executive Summary - Expense Reduction Initiative' section above for further details).

Other Expenses

Other operating expenses

were $

35 million

, or

6.0 percent

, higher in


compared with


. The

$35 million

increase includes $12 million of costs that were incurred in first quarter 2013 as part of our Expense Reduction Initiative (see 'Executive Summary - Expense Reduction Initiative' above for details).

The remaining $23 million increase was primarily due to higher business development costs, consulting and professional fees to assist us in our growth initiatives, and marketing costs.

Depreciation expense

was

$94 million

in


, compared with

$79 million

in


. The increase of

$15 million

includes $5 million which was incurred in first quarter 2013 relating to the rationalization of property and systems as part of our Expense Reduction Initiative (see 'Executive Summary - Expense Reduction Initiative' above for details). The remaining $10 million increase is primarily due to a number of significant information technology related projects becoming operational during the year and the write-off of replaced systems and other assets.

Amortization of intangible assets

was

$55 million

in


, a reduction of

$4 million

compared to


. The decrease primarily reflects the ongoing reduction in the HRH acquisition amortization.

Net gain on disposal of operations

of

$2 million

was related principally to the disposal of our share in an Iberian associate.

Loss on Extinguishment of Debt

The Company incurred total losses on extinguishment of debt of

$60 million

during the year ended December 31, 2013. This was made up of a tender premium of

$65 million

, the write-off of unamortized debt issuance costs of

$2 million

and a credit for the reduction of the fair value adjustment on 5.625% senior notes due 2015 of

$7 million

.



Willis Group Holdings plc

Income Taxes

The effective tax rate on ordinary income for 2013 was 20 percent, compared with 25 percent for 2012. The effective tax rate on ordinary income is calculated before the impact of certain discrete items. Discrete items occurring in 2013 with a significant impact on the tax rate were:

•

an incremental US tax expense of $9 million recorded after the taking into account the impact of adjustments to the valuation allowance placed against US deferred tax assets, US costs of $16 million associated with the Expense Reduction Initiative, and US costs of $61 million associated with the extinguishment of debt;

•

further non-US costs of $30 million associated with the Expense Reduction Initiative that are generally relieved at a rate higher than the underlying rate;

•

a net benefit of $4 million associated with a reduction in the corporation tax rate being applied to temporary tax differences in the UK;

•

a net benefit of $7 million associated with a change in the recognition of unrecognized tax benefits outside of the US; and

•

a net expense of $1 million associated with tax on profits of prior periods to bring in line the Company’s tax provision to filed tax positions.

Including the impact of discrete items, the tax rate for 2013 was 24 percent. This compares to a tax charge of $101 million recorded on the net loss from continuing operations of $337 million in 2012.

Interest in Earnings of Associates, net of Tax

The majority of our interest in earnings of associates relates to our share of ownership of Gras Savoye, the leading broker in France. Interest in earnings of associates, net of tax, in


was $

nil

compared to

$5 million

in


. The decline was mainly driven by lower net income recorded in Gras Savoye due to the costs recognized in relation to a reorganization program undertaken in the year designed to drive growth in revenues and operational efficiencies.

Business discussion

Total revenues increased by

$33 million

, or

1.0 percent

, in


compared to


, including

3.1 percent

growth in organic commissions and fees partially offset by a $59 million, or

1.8 percent

, negative impact from foreign exchange and a

$13 million

decrease in investment income due to continued falling yields on deposits.

Total commissions and fees in


were

$3,458 million

, up

$44 million

, or

1.3 percent

, from

$3,414 million

in


. Foreign currency movements negatively impacted commissions and fees by

1.8 percent

. Organic commissions and fees growth was

3.1 percent

.

New business growth was in the double-digits and there were modest benefits in the year from improving rates in certain business lines and geographies; these positive movements were however, offset by a slight increase in lost business.

The Global segment reported

4.8 percent

growth in commissions and fees, comprising

6.1 percent

organic growth in commissions and fees and a

1.3 percent

negative impact from foreign currency translation. Organic commissions and fees growth of

6.1 percent

was led by high single-digit growth across Reinsurance and Willis Faber & Dumas. Global Specialties reported low single-digit growth as strong growth from our Marine, Energy, Financial Solutions, and Construction specialties were partially offset by declines in Aerospace, which continues to be hampered by competitive pricing and a soft rate environment.

The North America segment reported a

0.6 percent

decline in organic commissions and fees, compared to


. Whilst new business levels were higher than in


resulting in growth in certain regions and business segments, these were more than offset by lower Loan Protector revenues, the impact of the weakened economy, which negatively impacted our Construction and Human Capital practice groups, and a modest decrease in client retention levels.

The International segment reported essentially flat growth in commissions and fees compared with 2011, comprising

4.9 percent

organic commissions and fees growth and a

4.8 percent

negative impact from foreign currency translation. Organic growth in commissions and fees was led by double digit growth in our Latin America region, supported by high single-digit growth in Asia and Eastern Europe. Our Western Europe operations reported low single-digit growth despite the continued weakness of economies within the Eurozone.

Investment income in


at

$18 million

was

$13 million

lower than in


, primarily due to declining net yields on cash and cash equivalents. Organic commissions and fees growth by segment is discussed further in 'Review of Segmental Results', below.

Salaries and Benefits

Salaries and benefits increased by

$388 million

, or

18.6 percent

, in


compared with


. Foreign currency movements lowered salaries and benefits by $34 million, or 1.6 percent. The year-on-year net favorable impact from foreign currency translation was driven primarily by the movement of the US dollar against the pound sterling (in which our London Market based operations incur the majority of their expenses).

Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, salaries and benefits increased by $422 million, or 20.2 percent, compared with 2011 primarily due to the $452 million expense recognized as a result of the change in remuneration policy for future incentive awards and the elimination of the repayment requirement on past awards; an approximate $55 million increase in salaries, including associated taxes and benefits, resulting from new hires and annual pay reviews; increases in incentives linked to production; long term incentive plans and the amortization of cash retention awards. These increases were partially offset by the $135 million expense recognized in salaries and benefits associated with the 2011 Operational Review and lower defined benefit pension plan expenses.

Other Expenses

Other operating expenses

were

$75 million

, or

11.4 percent

, lower in


compared with


. Foreign currency movements positively impacted expenses by $35 million, or 5.3 percent.

Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, other operating expenses decreased by $40 million or 6.1 percent compared with 2011 primarily due to the non-recurrence of the $73 million expense recognized in other operating expenses associated with the 2011 Operational Review and the $10 million insurance recovery in 2012 related to the previously disclosed fraudulent activity, partially offset by increases in certain other costs, including provisioning for bad debts and higher technology expenditure.



Willis Group Holdings plc

Depreciation expense

was

$79 million

in


, compared with

$74 million

in


. The increase is primarily due to a number of information technology related projects becoming operational at the end of 2011 and during first half 2012 partially offset by $5 million depreciation charge incurred in 2011 related to the Operational Review.

Amortization of intangible assets

was

$59 million

in


, a reduction of $9 million compared to


. The decrease primarily reflects the ongoing reduction in the HRH acquisition amortization.

Goodwill impairment

charge was

$492 million

in


. This was a non-cash charge recognized related to the impairment of the carrying value of the North America reporting unit's goodwill. For further information on our testing for goodwill impairment, see 'Critical Accounting Estimates', below.

Net loss on disposal of operations

of

$3 million

was related principally to the dissolution of a joint venture operation in India and loss recognized on disposal of Mauritian reinsurance operation.

Interest Expense

Interest expense was

$128 million

in


compared to

$156 million

in


. The decrease in interest expense primarily reflects the non-recurrence of a $10 million write-off of debt fees in 2011 related to the refinancing of the term loan and revolving credit facility and savings as a result of the lower coupon payable and reduced fee amortization on our new debt issued in March 2011 and December 2011.

Income Taxes

The effective tax rate on ordinary income for 2012 was 25 per cent, compared with 24 per cent for 2011, with the increase driven primarily by higher than anticipated US state income tax expense, the benefit from the higher tax rates at which costs associated with the 2011 Operational Review are relieved and from a different geographic mix of earnings. The effective tax rate on ordinary income is calculated before the impact of certain discrete items. Discrete items occurring in 2012 with a significant impact on the tax rate are:

•

a tax credit of $34 million on the $492 million charge related to the impairment of the carrying value of the North America reporting unit's goodwill. The tax credit arises in relation to that part of the charge that is attributable to tax deductible goodwill;

•

tax related to the $252 million charge for the additional incentive accrual arising from a change in remuneration policy which is generally relieved at a higher rate than the underlying rate;

•

tax related to the $200 million charge for the write-off of unamortized retention awards which is generally relieved at a higher rate than the underlying rate;

•

a valuation allowance of $125 million made against US deferred tax assets recorded following cumulative losses being incurred in the US. The cumulative losses are primarily attributable to exceptional charges associated with the 2011 Operational review, the impairment of North America goodwill and the additional incentive costs associated with the change in remuneration policy. Of the total valuation allowance, $113 million was recorded in the income statement and $12 million in other comprehensive income;

•

a non-deductible charge of $11 million for a settlement with former partners related to the termination of a joint venture arrangement in India;

•

adjustments made in respect of tax on profits of prior periods to bring in line the Company's tax provisions to filed tax positions; and

•

the net tax impact of the $3 million loss on disposal of operations.

Including the impact of discrete items, a tax charge of $101 million was recorded on a net loss from continuing operations before interest in earnings of associates of $337 million. This compares to a tax rate of 13 percent in 2011.



Business discussion

Interest in Earnings of Associates, net of Tax

The majority of our interest in earnings of associates relates to our share of ownership of Gras Savoye, the leading broker in France. Interest in earnings of associates, net of tax, in


was

$5 million

compared to

$12 million

in


. The decline was mainly driven by a reduction in net income reported by our principal associate, Gras Savoye.

Similar to many businesses located in the Eurozone, Gras Savoye's operations are being pressured by the economic conditions. In addition, Gras Savoye appointed a new CEO and began undergoing a business review that was designed to drive growth in revenues and improve operational efficiencies.

Discontinued Operations, net of Tax

There were no discontinued operations in 2012.

In 2011 the Company disposed of Global Special Risks, LLC, Faber & Dumas Canada Ltd and the trade and assets of Maclean, Oddy & Associates, Inc. The gain (net of tax) on this disposal was

$2 million

.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

Liquidity

We believe that our balance sheet and strong cash flow provide us with the platform and flexibility to remain committed to our cash allocation strategy of:

•

investing in the business for growth;

•

value-creating merger and acquisition activity;

•

generating a steadily rising dividend; and

•

the repurchase of shares.

Our principal sources of liquidity are cash from operations, available cash and cash equivalents and amounts available under our three revolving credit facilities, excluding the UK facility which is solely for use by our main regulated UK entity in certain exceptional circumstances.

Our principal short-term uses of liquidity and capital resources are operating expenses, capital expenditures, shareholder returns, funding defined benefit pension plans and the repurchase of shares.

Our long-term liquidity requirements consist of the principal amount of outstanding notes; borrowings under our 7-year term loan and revolving credit facilities; and our pension contributions as discussed below.

As at December 31, 2013 cash and cash equivalents were $796 million, an increase of $296 million compared to December 31, 2012. Included within cash and cash equivalents is $707 million available for corporate purposes and $89 million held within our regulated UK entities for regulatory capital adequacy requirements.

Cash flows from operating activities increased to $561 million in 2013 from $525 million in 2012. In addition, funds were also provided from the disposal of fixed and intangible assets $12 million (2012: $5 million), $155 million proceeds from the issue of shares (2012: $53 million), and $20 million proceeds from the disposal of operations (2012: $nil).

As at December 31, 2013 there was $nil drawn down on the revolving credit facilities (2012: $nil).

The primary uses of funds during 2013 included $346 million of cash incentive award payments relating to 2012, $193 million related to payments of dividends, $150 million cash contributions, including employees' salary sacrifice contributions, to our defined benefit schemes, capital expenditures of $112 million related to leasehold improvements, information technology and transformation projects, $30 million for the acquisition of Prime Professions and CBC Broker Srl, and a $4 million cash payment to acquire the remaining noncontrolling interest in our Colombia reinsurance operation.



Willis Group Holdings plc

Based on current market conditions and information available to us at this time, we believe that we have sufficient liquidity to meet our cash needs for the next twelve months.

The Company is authorized to buy back its ordinary shares by way of redemption, and intends to buy back $200 million shares in 2014 to offset the increase in shares from the exercise of employee stock options.

The impact of movements in liquidity, debt and EBITDA in 2013 had a negative impact on the interest coverage ratio and a positive impact on the leverage ratio. Both ratios remain well within the requirements of the revolving credit facility covenants.

Debt

Total debt, total equity and the capitalization ratio at

December 31, 2013

and


were as follows (in millions, except percentages):

On July 23, 2013 we entered into an amendment to our existing credit facilities to extend both the amount of financing and the maturity date of the facilities. As a result of this amendment, our revolving credit facility was increased from

$500 million

to

$800 million

. The maturity date on both the revolving credit facility and the

$300 million

term loan was extended to

July 23, 2018

, from

December 16, 2016

. At the amendment date we owed

$281 million

on the term loan and there was no change to this amount as a result of the refinancing.

The 7-year term loan facility expiring 2018 bears interest at

LIBOR plus 1.50%

and is repayable in quarterly installments and a final repayment of

$186 million

is due in the third quarter of 2018. In 2013, we made

$15 million

of mandatory repayments against this 7-year term loan. Drawings under the

$800 million

revolving credit facility bear interest at

LIBOR plus 1.50%

. These margins apply while the Company’s debt rating remains BBB-/Baa3. As of December 31, 2013

$nil

was outstanding under this revolving credit facility (December 31, 2012:

$nil

).

On August 15, 2013 the Company issued

$250 million

of

4.625%

senior notes due 2023 and

$275 million

of

6.125%

senior notes due 2043. The effective interest rates of these senior notes are

4.696%

and

6.154%

, respectively, which include the impact of the discount upon issuance.

On July 25, 2013 the Company commenced an offer to purchase for cash any and all of its

5.625%

senior notes due 2015 and a portion of its

6.200%

senior notes due 2017 and its

7.000%

senior notes due 2019 for an aggregate purchase price of up to

$525 million

. On August 22, 2013 the proceeds from the issue of the senior notes due 2023 and 2043 were used to fund the purchase of

$202 million

of

5.625%

senior notes due 2015,

$206 million

of

6.200%

senior notes due 2017 and

$113 million

of

7.000%

senior notes due 2019.

The Company incurred total losses on extinguishment of debt of

$60 million

during the year ended December 31, 2013. This was made up of a tender premium of

$65 million

, the write-off of unamortized debt issuance costs of

$2 million

and a credit for the reduction of the fair value adjustment on 5.625% senior notes due 2015 of

$7 million

.

The agreements relating to our 7-year term loan facility expiring 2018 and the revolving

$800 million

credit facility contain requirements to maintain maximum levels of consolidated funded indebtedness in relation to consolidated EBITDA and minimum level of consolidated EBITDA to consolidated cash interest expense, subject to certain adjustments. In addition, the agreements relating to our credit facilities and senior notes include, in the aggregate covenants relating to the delivery of financial statements, reports and notices, limitations on liens, limitations on sales and other disposals of assets, limitations on indebtedness and other liabilities, limitations on sale and leaseback transactions, limitations on mergers and other fundamental changes, maintenance of property, maintenance of insurance, nature of business, compliance with applicable laws, maintenance of corporate existence and rights, payment of taxes and access to information and properties. At

December 31, 2013

, the Company was in compliance with all covenants.

These refinancing actions have lengthened our debt maturity profile. At

December 31, 2013

, we had $nil outstanding under the $800 million facility (December 31, 2012: $nil), the UK $20 million facility (December 31, 2012: $nil) and the RMB facility



Business discussion

(December 31, 2012: $nil). At

December 31, 2013

the only mandatory debt repayments falling due over the next 12 months are scheduled repayments on our 7-year term loan totaling $15 million.

Pensions

UK plan

The Company made cash contributions of $88 million in 2013 (2012: $80 million) into the UK defined benefit pension plan, and $12 million (2012: $12 million) in respect of employees' salary sacrifice contributions.

Contributions to the UK defined benefit pension plan in 2014 are expected to total

$83 million

, of which approximately

$23 million

relates to on-going contributions calculated as 15.9 percent of active plan members’ pensionable salaries and approximately

$60 million

relates to contributions towards funding the deficit. Additionally

$12 million

will be made in respect of employees' salary sacrifice contributions.

In addition, further contributions may be payable based on a profit share calculation (equal to 20 percent of EBITDA in excess of $900 million per annum as defined by the revised schedule of contributions) and an exceptional return calculation (equal to 10 percent of any exceptional returns made to shareholders, for example, share buybacks and special dividends). Aggregate contributions under the deficit funding contribution and the profit share calculation are capped at

£312 million

(

$517 million

) over the six years ended December 31, 2017.

The schedule of contributions is automatically renegotiated after three years and at any earlier time jointly agreed by the Company and the Trustee. During 2014 we will be required to negotiate a new funding arrangement which may change the contributions we are required to make in the future.

US plan

We made cash contributions to our US defined benefit plan of $40 million in 2013 and in 2012.

We will make cash contributions of approximately

$30 million

to the US plan in


.

Other defined benefit pension plans

We made cash contributions to our other defined benefit pension plans of $10 million in 2013 and

$11 million

2012.

In 2014, we expect to contribute approximately

$9 million

to these schemes.

Cash flow

Summary consolidated cash flow information (in millions):

This summary consolidated cash flow should be viewed in addition to, not in lieu of, the Company’s consolidated financial statements.

Consolidated Cash Flow for


compared to


Operating Activities

Net cash provided by operating activities in 2013 increased by $36 million to $561 million compared with 2012.

The

$561 million

cash from operations comprises net income of

$377 million

, net

$313 million

of non-cash adjustments to reconcile net income to cash provided by operating activities and working capital movements

The non-cash adjustments included depreciation, amortization of intangible assets, share-based compensation, gain on derivative instruments, provision for deferred income taxes and the tender premium on early redemption of our debt, which is presented as a financing cash item.

Movements in working capital included

$346 million

of incentive payments and

$150 million

cash contributions (including $12 million for employees’ salary sacrifice) to our defined benefit pension schemes. Additionally, there was a

$116 million

increase in accounts receivable, as revenue recognized in 2013 was greater than cash collection, and

$445 million

positive movement in other liabilities which included incentives accrued during 2013 that will be paid in 2014.

The $36 million increase in cash provided by operating activities in 2013 compared to 2012 was primarily driven by favorable movements in working capital versus the prior year.

Investing Activities

Net cash used in investing activities in 2013 was

$120 million

including, capital expenditure of

$112 million

, cash used to purchase subsidiaries, intangible assets and other investments of $44 million partly offset by

$12 million

cash received from the sale of fixed and intangible assets and $24 million of proceeds from the disposal of operations and the sale of the Company’s holding in a Spanish associate company.

Financing Activities

Net cash used in financing activities in 2013 was $137 million primarily due to total dividends paid, including dividends paid to noncontrolling interests, of $203 million, a net $72 million outflow in relation to the refinancing in the third quarter 2013, discussed below, and $15 million of mandatory repayments against the term loan offset by cash receipts of $155 million from the issue of shares.



Business discussion

The refinancing during 2013 resulted in a net cash outflow of $72 million which included: $521 million cash paid to repurchase $202 million of 5.625% senior notes due 2015, $206 million of 6.200% senior notes due 2017 and $113 million of 7.000% senior notes due 2019, the tender premium of $65 million and debt issuance costs of $8 million; this was primarily funded by $522 million cash inflow from senior notes issued, discussed earlier, and free operating cash flows.

Consolidated Cash Flow for 2012 compared to 2011

Operating Activities

Total net cash provided by continuing operating activities was $525 million in 2012, compared with $441 million in 2011. The increase of $84 million primarily reflects a $100 million reduction in cash outflows relating to the 2011 Operational Review and a higher volume of collections made on higher revenues and accounts receivable compared with 2011, partially offset by the modest decline in operating earnings, adjusted for non-cash items; and the $11 million year-on-year increase in payments for cash retention awards.

Investing Activities

Total net cash used in continuing investing activities was $172 million in 2012 compared to $101 million in 2011. The $71 million increase in net outflow was due to higher capital spend, including; the fit-out and refurbishment of certain leasehold properties, including the completion of the European Data Center; development and implementation of a number of information technology projects including, financial systems and trading platforms; a $23 million increase in payments to acquire subsidiaries, primarily related to the acquisition of Avalon Actuarial, Inc, a Canadian actuarial consulting firm; and the non-recurrence of proceeds from the disposal of certain businesses during 2011.

Financing Activities

Total net cash used in continuing financing activities was $291 million in 2012 compared to $214 million in 2011. The $77 million increase in cash used was the result of the $100 million cash outflow relating to the repurchase of 2.8 million shares during 2012 and the $30 million year-on-year increase in payments made to acquire noncontrolling interests including, Gras Savoye Re, and our Columbian retail operation; partially offset by the reduction in repayments of debt, net of the refinancing during 2011.

Consolidated Cash Flow for 2011 compared to 2010

Operating Activities

Total net cash provided by continuing operating activities was $441 million in 2011 compared with $491 million in 2010. The decrease of $50 million primarily reflects the $57 million year-on-year increase in accounts receivable, reflecting increased revenue but also slower collections in the US due to current economic conditions; cash outflows of approximately $120 million relating to the 2011 Operational Review; and the $24 million year-on-year increase in payments for cash retention awards. These were partly offset by realized cash savings resulting from the 2011 Operational Review and other working capital movements.

Investing Activities

Total net cash used in continuing investing activities was $101 million in 2011 compared to $94 million in 2010. The $101 million net outflow was mainly due to capital spend including fit-out of our Nashville office and IT project investments.

Financing Activities

Total net cash used in continuing financing activities was $214 million in 2011 compared with $293 million in 2010. We issued $800 million of new debt in March 2011 and net proceeds of approximately $787 million were used to repurchase and redeem $500 million of 12.875% senior notes due 2016. As part of this debt refinancing we made a $158 million make-whole payment on the redemption of our 12.875% senior notes due 2016. Other significant financing activities in 2011 included refinancing our bank facility in December 2011, dividend payments of $180 million and receipt of $60 million from the issue of shares.

Fiduciary funds

As an intermediary, we hold funds generally in a fiduciary capacity for the account of third parties, typically as the result of premiums received from clients that are in transit to insurers and claims due to clients that are in transit from insurers. We report premiums, which are held on account of, or due from, clients as assets with a corresponding liability due to the insurers. Claims held by, or due to, us which are due to clients are also shown as both assets and liabilities.

Fiduciary funds are generally required to be kept in certain regulated bank accounts subject to guidelines which emphasize capital preservation and liquidity; such funds are not available to service the Company’s debt or for other corporate purposes. Notwithstanding the legal relationships with clients and insurers, the Company is entitled to retain investment income earned on fiduciary funds in accordance with industry custom and practice and, in some cases, as supported by agreements with insureds. As of

Share buybacks

The Company is authorized to buy back shares, by way of redemption, and will consider whether to do so from time to time, based on many factors, including market conditions. The Company is authorized to purchase up to one billion shares from time to time in the open market (such open market purchases would be effected as redemptions under Irish law) and it may also redeem its shares through negotiated trades with persons who are not affiliated with the Company as long as the cost of the acquisition of the Company's shares does not exceed $824 million.

As of February 14, 2014 there remains approximately $824 million available to purchase common shares under the current authorization.

The Company intends to buy back $200 million in shares in 2014 to offset the increase in shares outstanding resulting from the exercise of employee stock options. The buybacks will be made in the open market or through privately-negotiated transactions, from time to time, depending on market conditions.

The share buy back program may be modified, extended or terminated at any time by the Board of Directors.

REVIEW OF SEGMENTAL RESULTS

We organize our business into three segments: Global, North America and International. Our Global business provides specialist brokerage and consulting services to clients worldwide for risks arising from specific industries and activities. North America and International comprise our retail operations and provide services to small, medium and major corporations.

The following table is a summary of our operating results by segment for the three years ended

December 31, 2013

(in millions except percentages):

Global

Our Global operations comprise Global Specialties, Willis Re, Placement, and Willis Capital Markets & Advisory (WCMA).

The following table sets out revenues, operating income, organic commissions and fees growth and operating margin for the three years ended

Commissions and fees of

$1,188 million

were

$64 million

, or

5.7 percent

, higher in


compared with

5.6 percent

and

1.0 percent

growth from acquisitions and disposals, most notably from the acquisition of Prime Professions in second quarter 2013, partially offset by a

0.9 percent

negative impact from foreign currency movements.

The

5.6 percent

organic growth in commissions and fees was driven by strong new business growth and higher client retention levels compared with the year ago period, partially offset by lost business. Rates had no material impact on commissions and fees.

Willis Re reported high single-digit growth, with North America leading the way with double-digit results. New business was strong across all three divisions and we reported increased client retention levels compared to the prior year.

Specialty reported mid single-digit growth, with solid performance in our Financial and Executive Risk, and P&C and Construction. Growth from new business was solid and we saw increased client retention levels compared to 2012.



Willis Group Holdings plc

Willis Capital Markets & Advisory performed solidly but was down compared to the very strong result it recorded in 2012 relating to meaningfully higher volumes of advisory fees and catastrophe bond deals.

Client retention levels improved to

Expenses

Total operating expenses of

$857 million

were

$100 million

, or

13.2 percent

, higher for


compared with


. Excluding the $8 million, or 1.1 percent, impact of favorable foreign currency movements, total operating expenses increased $108 million or 14.3 percent.

The year-on-year growth in expenses was primarily due to higher salaries and benefits as a result of increased incentives

from the change in remuneration policy and growth in commissions and fees. In addition, this increase also included the impact of the increase in headcount relative to the prior year, annual salary reviews and higher charges for share-based compensation.

Other expenses also increased compared to 2012 due to higher travel, accommodation and client entertaining costs to support business development and increased professional fees related to the strategic review of the segment.

Operating margin

Full year operating margin was

28.0 percent

in


and

32.9 percent

1.3 percent

negative impact on commissions and fees; organic growth was

6.1 percent

.

Organic growth included positive growth across Reinsurance, Global Specialties, Willis Faber & Dumas and WCMA, as strong new business and higher one-off transactions, primarily in WCMA, were partially offset by increases in lost business.

Organic growth in Global Specialties was led by strong performances from Energy, Marine, Financial Solutions and Construction Specialties reflecting single-digit net new business. This growth was partially offset by declines in Aerospace, which continued to be negatively impacted by competitive pricing and rate decreases.

Reinsurance reported mid single-digit growth in 2012, as growth in the International, Specialty and North America divisions was partially offset by the non-recurrence of a fee related to a 2011 profitability initiative. Rates had a modest positive impact on commission and fees in the year.

Willis Faber & Dumas also reported mid-single digit growth in 2012.WCMA is a transaction-oriented business and its results are more variable than some of our other businesses. In 2012 we reported significantly higher organic commissions and fees than in 2011. Growth in the WCMA business was positively impacted by a higher volume of advisory and catastrophe bond deals closing during the year.

Operating margin

Operating margin was

negative impact from foreign currency movements.

Commissions and fees included a positive $5 million adjustment to align the recognition of revenue in the North America Personal Lines business with the rest of the Group.

The

4.9 percent

organic growth in commissions and fees was driven by strong new business growth and higher client retention levels compared with the year ago period, partially offset by lost business. Rates had a small positive impact on the full year's commissions and fees.

Growth was achieved across all our North America regions, led by the Metro, Midwest, Canada and CAPPPS regions. This was attributed to new business growth as well as increased client retention rates in almost all regions.

Similarly, most of the major practice groups recorded positive growth. Our two largest practices, Human Capital and Construction, recorded mid single-digit growth and in our other practices we recorded high single-digit growth in Real Estate and low single-digit growth in Financial & Executive Risks, Healthcare and Manufacturing.

Expenses

Total operating expenses of

$1,117 million

were

$44 million

or

4.1 percent

The year-on-year growth is primarily due to higher salaries and benefits most notably as a result of annual salary reviews. Salaries and benefits were also impacted by a higher incentives charge as a result of higher commissions and fees and the



Willis Group Holdings plc

change in remuneration policy, and additional 401(k) match and medical charges, partially offset by lower charges for share-based compensation and pensions.

In addition, there was an increase in other expenses due to a $6 million write-off of a receivable related to a non-E&O settlement, professional fees related to the strategic review of the segment, and higher travel and accommodation expense to support revenue growth and client retention, partially offset by a $4 million insurance premium accrual reversal.

Foreign currency movements had no material impact on expenses.

The decline in the financial performance of our Loan Protector business had a 0.8 percent negative impact on North America organic growth in commissions and fees and negatively impacted the segment's revenue by $10 million. The Loan Protector decline was driven by the loss of clients through attrition and M&A activity, industry-wide commission pressures and a slowdown in business in its specialized market in the US in

Latin America reported double-digit growth arising primarily from Brazil and Venezuela which was partially offset by a double-digit decline in Colombia.

Asia reported low-single digit growth. We recorded good growth throughout the region especially in Hong Kong and Korea, however the negative $15 million revenue recognition adjustment partially offset these results.

Eastern Europe reported high single-digit growth arising primarily from Russia tempered by a mid-single digit decline in Poland.

Western Europe reported low single-digit growth. Despite difficult economic conditions, Italy and Iberia produced mid-single digit growth partially offset by mid single-digit declines in Ireland and the Netherlands.

Willis Group Holdings plc

This increase was due primarily to higher salaries and benefits as a result of new hires, annual salary reviews, higher incentives due to the change in remuneration policy and an increased charge for share-based compensation.

In addition to this, we incurred professional fees related to the strategic review of the segment, higher travel and accommodation expense to support business development, and a $5 million VAT related charge. These charges were partially offset by a reduced bad debt expense and non-recurring 2012 legal claims settlements.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES

Our accounting policies are described in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Management considers that the following accounting estimates or assumptions are the most important to the presentation of our financial condition or operating performance:

•

pension expense (discount rates, expected asset returns and mortality);

•

intangible assets and goodwill impairment (determination of reporting units, fair value of reporting units and annual goodwill impairment analysis);

•

income taxes; and

•

commitments, contingencies and accrued liabilities.

Management has discussed its critical accounting estimates and associated disclosures with our Audit Committee.

Pension expense

We maintain defined benefit pension plans for employees in the US and UK. Both of these plans are now closed to new entrants and, with effect from May 15, 2009 we closed our US defined benefit plan to future accrual. New employees in the UK are offered the opportunity to join a defined contribution plan and in the US are offered the opportunity to join a 401(k) plan. We also have smaller defined benefit plans in Ireland, Germany, Norway and the Netherlands, a non-qualified plan in the US and an unfunded plan in the UK. These smaller defined benefit plans have combined total assets of

$168 million

and a combined net liability for pension benefits of

$27 million

as of

December 31, 2013

. Elsewhere, pension benefits are typically provided through defined contribution plans.

We recorded a

$5 million

and a

$4 million

net periodic benefit income on our UK and US defined benefit pension scheme respectively in


, compared with a net periodic benefit income of $5 million on the UK scheme and a net periodic benefit cost of $3 million on the US scheme in


. On our international defined benefit pension plans, US non-qualified plan and UK unfunded plan, we recorded a net periodic benefit cost of

$5 million

in


, compared with

$4 million

in


.

Based on

December 31, 2013

assumptions (except for one update - the expected rate of return in the UK pension plan changed from 7.25% to 7.00%), we expect the net pension credit in


will increase $7 million for the UK plan. The net pension credit will increase by $4 million for the US plan and the net pension charge will decrease by $1 million for the other plans.

We make a number of assumptions when determining our pension liabilities and pension expense which are reviewed annually by senior management and changed where appropriate. The discount rate will be changed annually if underlying rates have moved whereas the expected long-term return on assets will be changed less frequently as longer term trends in asset returns emerge or long term target asset allocations are revised. Other material assumptions include rates of participant mortality, the expected long-term rate of compensation and pension increases and rates of employee termination. Our approach to determining appropriate assumptions for our UK and US pension plans is set out below.

(a)

Except for the expected rate of return updated to 7%.

(b)

With all other assumptions held constant.

(c)

Assumes all plan participants are one year younger.



Business discussion

Discount rate

During 2013 we continued to use a duration-based approach, which more closely matches the actual timing of expected cash flows to the applicable discount rate. The selected rate used to discount UK plan liabilities in 2013 was

4.40%

consistent with the

4.40%

used at

December 31, 2012

. During 2013, sterling high-quality corporate bond yields had risen slightly at shorter to median durations but fallen at longer durations however, the rate consistent with expected maturity of the plan's liabilities was unchanged.

Expected and actual asset returns

Expected long-term rates of return on plan assets are developed from the expected future returns of the various asset classes using the target asset allocations. The expected long-term rate of return used for determining the net UK pension expense in


was

7.25%

(


:

7.50%

), equivalent to an expected return in


of $191 million (


: $181 million). Effective January 1, 2014, the expected long-term rate of return was decreased to 7.00%. The decrease in the expected long-term rate of return followed a change in the underlying target asset mix, which reflects the actions taken during 2013 in accordance with the de-risking strategy proposed by the Trustees which will lead to a strategic target asset allocation with a greater weighting to non-return seeking assets.

The expected and actual returns on UK plan assets for the three years ended

December 31, 2013

were as follows:

Mortality

The mortality assumption used during 2013 is the 90/105% PNA00 table for males and females, and is unchanged from the assumptions used during 2012.

As an indication of the longevity assumed, our calculations assume that a UK male retiree aged 65 at

December 31, 2013

would have a life expectancy of 24 years.

December 31, 2013

was

4.76%

Mortality

The mortality assumption at

: RP-2000 Mortality Table (blended for annuitants and non-annuitants), projected by Scale AA to 2020 for annuitants and 2028 for non-annuitants).

As an indication of the longevity assumed, our calculations assume that a US male retiree aged 65 at

December 31, 2013

, would have a life expectancy of 19 years.

Intangible assets

Intangible assets represent the excess of cost over the value of net tangible assets of businesses acquired. We classify our intangible assets into three categories;

•

Goodwill;

•

‘Customer and Marketing Related’ which includes client lists, client relationships, trade names and non-compete agreements; and

•

‘Contract-based, Technology and Other’ which includes all other purchased intangible assets.

Client relationships acquired on the HRH acquisition are amortized over twenty years in line with the pattern in which the economic benefits of the client relationships are expected to be consumed. Over 80% of the client relationships intangible will have been amortized after 10 years. Non-compete agreements acquired in connection with the HRH acquisition were amortized over two years on a straight line basis. Intangible assets acquired in connection with other acquisitions are amortized over their estimated useful lives on a straight line basis. Goodwill is not subject to amortization.

We review purchased intangible assets with finite lives for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of these intangible assets is assessed based on the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the continued use of the asset. If the undiscounted future cash flows are less than the carrying amount, the purchased intangible assets with finite lives are considered to be impaired. The amount of the impairment is measured as the difference between the carrying value and the fair value.

Goodwill impairment review

We test goodwill for impairment annually or whenever events or circumstances indicate impairment may have occurred.

The goodwill impairment test is a two step analysis. Step One requires the fair value of each reporting unit to be compared to its carrying value. If the fair value of a reporting unit is determined to be greater than the carrying value of the reporting unit, goodwill is not considered impaired and no further testing is necessary. If the fair value of a reporting unit is less than the carrying value, we perform Step Two. Step Two requires the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill to be compared with the carrying amount of that goodwill. Determining the implied fair value of goodwill requires a valuation of the reporting unit’s tangible and intangible assets and liabilities in a manner similar to the allocation of the purchase price in a business combination. Any excess of the value of a reporting unit over the amounts assigned to its assets and liabilities is referred to as the implied fair value of goodwill. If the carrying amount of reporting unit goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess.



Business discussion

Application of the impairment test requires judgment, including the identification of reporting units, assignment of assets, liabilities and goodwill to reporting units and determination of fair value of each reporting unit.

Determination of reporting units

We have determined our reporting units to be consistent with our operating segments: North America; International and Global. Goodwill is allocated to these reporting units based on the original purchase price allocation for acquisitions within the reporting units.

Fair value of reporting units

The fair value of each reporting unit is estimated using a discounted cash flow methodology and, in aggregate, validated against our market capitalization.

Determining the fair value of a reporting unit is judgmental in nature and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions include estimations of future cash flows which are dependent on internal forecasts, long-term rate of growth for our business and determination of our weighted average cost of capital.

We base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable but that are unpredictable and inherently uncertain. Therefore changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value and result in goodwill impairment.

In addition, we make certain judgments and assumptions in allocating shared assets and liabilities to determine the carrying values for each of our reporting units.

Annual goodwill impairment analysis

Our annual goodwill impairment analysis is performed each year at October 1. At October 1, 2013 our analysis showed the estimate fair value of each reporting unit was in excess of carrying value, and therefore did not result in an impairment charge.

The goodwill impairment analysis as of October 1, 2012 concluded that an impairment charge was required to reduce the carrying value of the goodwill associated with the Company's North America reporting unit. The goodwill impairment charge for the North America reporting unit amounted to $492 million. There was no impairment for the Global and International reporting units, as the fair values of these units were significantly in excess of their carrying value.

Under the income approach, the fair value of the North America reporting unit was determined based on the present value of estimated future cash flows. The fair value measurements used unobservable inputs in a discounted cash flow model based on the Company's most recent forecasts. Such projections were based on management's estimates of revenue growth rates and operating margins, taking into consideration industry and market conditions, and the uncertainty related to the reporting unit's ability to execute on the projected cash flows with consideration of market comparables where appropriate. The discount rate was based on the weighted-average cost of capital adjusted for the relevant risk associated with market participant expectations of characteristics of the individual reporting units.

As the fair value of the reporting unit was less than its carrying value, the second step of the impairment test was performed to measure the amount of any impairment loss. In the second step, the North America reporting unit's fair value was allocated to all of the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit, including any unrecognized intangible assets. The fair value of intangible assets associated with the North America reporting unit included customer relationship intangible assets, which were valued using a multiple period excess earnings approach involving discounted future projections of associated revenue streams.

The decline in the fair value of the North America reporting unit, as well as differences between fair values and carrying values for other assets and liabilities in the second step of the goodwill impairment test, resulted in an implied fair value of goodwill substantially below the carrying value of the goodwill for the reporting unit. As a result, the Company recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $492 million in 2012.

As previously disclosed, the North America reporting unit had been hampered by the declining Loan Protector business results, the effect of the soft economy in the U.S., which had significantly impacted the Construction and Human Capital sectors, and declining retention rates primarily related to M&A activity and lost legacy HRH business.

The decline in the estimated fair value of the reporting unit resulted from lower projected revenue growth rates and profitability levels as well as an increase in the discount rate used to calculate the discounted cash flows. The increase in the discount rate was due to increases in the risk-free rate and small company premium offset by a reduction to the expected market rate of



Willis Group Holdings plc

return. The lower projected profitability levels reflect changes in assumptions related to organic revenue growth and cost rates which can be attributed to the declines discussed above and also includes consideration of the uncertainty related to the business's ability to execute on the projected cash flows.

Income taxes

We recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the estimated future tax consequences of events attributable to differences between the financial statements carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating and capital loss and tax credit carry-forwards. We estimate deferred tax assets and liabilities and assess the need for any valuation allowances using tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to be recovered or settled taking into account our business plans and tax planning strategies.

At

December 31, 2013

, we had gross deferred tax assets of

$383 million

(


:

$451 million

) against which a valuation allowance of

$196 million

(


:

$221 million

) had been recognized. To the extent that:

•

the actual future taxable income in the periods during which the temporary differences are expected to reverse differs from current projections;

•

assumed prudent and feasible tax planning strategies fail to materialize;

•

new tax planning strategies are developed; or

•

material changes occur in actual tax rates or loss carry-forward time limits,

we may adjust the deferred tax asset considered realizable in future periods. Such adjustments could result in a significant increase or decrease in the effective tax rate and have a material impact on our net income.

Positions taken in our tax returns may be subject to challenge by the taxing authorities upon examination. We recognize the benefit of uncertain tax positions in the financial statements when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on examination by the tax authorities. The benefit recognized is the largest amount of tax benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized on settlement with the tax authority, assuming full knowledge of the position and all relevant facts. The Company adjusts its recognition of these uncertain tax benefits in the period in which new information is available impacting either the recognition or measurement of its uncertain tax positions. In


, there was a net increase in uncertain tax positions of $4 million compared to a net increase of $21 million in


. The Company recognizes interest relating to unrecognized tax benefits and penalties within income taxes. Accrued interest and penalties are included within the related tax liability line in the consolidated balance sheet.

Commitments, contingencies and accrued liabilities

We purchase professional indemnity insurance for errors and omissions claims. The terms of this insurance vary by policy year and self-insured risks have increased significantly over recent years. We have established provisions against various actual and potential claims, lawsuits and other proceedings relating principally to alleged errors and omissions in connection with the placement of insurance and reinsurance in the ordinary course of business. Such provisions cover claims that have been reported but not paid and also claims that have been incurred but not reported. These provisions are established based on actuarial estimates together with individual case reviews and are believed to be adequate in the light of current information and legal advice.

Debt obligations and facilities

The Company’s debt and related interest obligations at

December 31, 2013

are shown in the above table.

On July 23, 2013 we entered into an amendment to our existing credit facilities to extend the amount of financing of the facilities. As a result of this amendment, our revolving credit facility was increased from

$500 million

to

$800 million

. As at

December 31, 2013

The only mandatory repayments of debt over the next 12 months are the scheduled repayment of

$15 million

current portion of the Company’s 7-year term loan. We also have the right, at our option, to prepay indebtedness under the credit facility without further penalty and to redeem the senior notes at our option by paying a ‘make-whole’ premium as provided under the applicable debt instrument.

Operating leases

The Company leases certain land, buildings and equipment under various operating lease arrangements. Original non-cancellable lease terms typically are between 10 and 20 years and may contain escalation clauses, along with options that permit early withdrawal. The total amount of the minimum rent is expensed on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.

Pensions

Contractual obligations for our pension plans reflect the contributions we expect to make over the next five years into our US and UK, plans. These contributions are based on current funding positions and may increase or decrease dependent on the future performance of the two plans.

UK plan

During

: $80 million;


: $81 million), additionally

$12 million

(


:

$12 million

;


:

$11 million

) was paid into the plan in respect of employees' salary sacrifice contributions.

In March 2012, the Company agreed to a revised schedule of contributions towards on-going accrual of benefits and deficit funding contributions the Company will make to the UK plan over the six years ended December 31, 2017. Contributions in each of the next four years are expected to total approximately $83 million, of which approximately $23 million relates to on-going contributions calculated as 15.9 percent of active plan members' pensionable salary and approximately $60 million that relates to contributions towards the funding deficit.

In addition, further contributions will be payable based on a profit share calculation (equal to 20 percent of EBITDA in excess of $900 million per annum as defined by the revised schedule of contributions) and an exceptional return calculation (equal to 10 percent of any exceptional returns made to shareholders, for example, share buybacks, and special dividends). Upon finalization of these calculations the Company made a further contribution in 2013 of $10 million, calculated as 10 percent of the $100 million share buy-back program completed during 2012. Aggregate contributions under the deficit funding contribution and the profit share calculation are capped at

£312 million

(

$517 million

) over the six years ended December 31, 2017.

The schedule of contributions is automatically renegotiated after three years and at any earlier time jointly agreed by the Company and the Trustee. During 2014 we will be required to negotiate a new funding arrangement which may further change the contributions we are required to make in the future.

Guarantees

Guarantees issued by certain of Willis Group Holdings’ subsidiaries with respect to the senior notes and revolving credit facilities are discussed in Note 20 — 'Debt' in these consolidated financial statements.

Certain of Willis Group Holdings’ subsidiaries have given the landlords of some leasehold properties occupied by the Company in the United Kingdom and the United States guarantees in respect of the performance of the lease obligations of the subsidiary holding the lease. The operating lease obligations subject to such guarantees amounted to

$828 million

and

$829 million

at

December 31, 2013

and


, respectively. The capital lease obligations subject to such guarantees amounted to

$11 million

as at

December 31, 2013

(2012:

$nil

).

In addition, the Company has given guarantees to bankers and other third parties relating principally to letters of credit amounting to

$11 million

and

$10 million

at

December 31, 2013

and


, respectively. Willis Group Holdings also guarantees certain of its UK and Irish subsidiaries’ obligations to fund the UK and Irish defined benefit plans.

Other Contractual Obligations

For certain subsidiaries and associates, the Company has the right to purchase shares (a call option) from co-shareholders at various dates in the future. In addition, the co-shareholders of certain subsidiaries and associates have the right to sell their shares (a put option) to the Company at various dates in the future. Generally, the exercise price of such put options and call options is formula-based (using revenues and earnings) and is designed to reflect fair value. Based on current projections of profitability and exchange rates and assuming the put options are exercised, the potential amount payable from these options is not expected to exceed

$12 million

(


:

$19 million

).

In July 2010, the Company made a capital commitment of $25 million to Trident V Parallel Fund, LP, an investment fund managed by Stone Point Capital. This replaced a capital commitment of $25 million that had been made to Trident V, LP in December 2009. As at

December 31, 2013

there have been approximately

$15 million

of capital contributions.

In May 2011, the Company made a capital commitment of $10 million to Dowling Capital Partners I, LP. As at

December 31, 2013

there have been approximately

$4 million

of capital contributions.

Other contractual obligations at

December 31, 2013

, also include certain capital lease obligations totaling

$63 million

(


: $53 million), primarily in respect of the Company's Nashville property.

NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

Other Comprehensive Income

In June 2011, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2011-05, Presentation of Comprehensive Income to revise the manner in which entities present comprehensive income in their financial statements. These changes require that components of comprehensive income be presented in either a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements. The amendments do not change the items that must be reported in other comprehensive income or when an item of other comprehensive income must be reclassified to net income.This guidance is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2011 and has been applied retrospectively.



Willis Group Holdings plc

ASU No. 2011-05 also requires entities to present on the face of the financial statements reclassification adjustments for items that are reclassified from other comprehensive income to net income in the statement(s) where the components of net income and the components of other comprehensive income are presented. In December 2011, the FASB issued ASU No. 2011-12 in order to defer those changes in ASU No. 2011-05 that relate to the presentation of reclassification adjustments. In February 2013, the FASB issued ASU No. 2013-02, Reporting of Amounts Reclassified Out of Accumulated Other Comprehensive (ASU 2013-02). This guidance is the culmination of the FASB's deliberation on reporting reclassification adjustments from accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI). The amendments in ASU 2013-02 do not change the current requirements for reporting net income or other comprehensive income but do require disclosure of amounts reclassified out of AOCI in its entirety, by component, on the face of the statement of operations or in the notes thereto. Amounts that are not required to be reclassified in their entirety to net income must be cross-referenced to other disclosures that provide additional detail. This guidance is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2012 and has been applied retrospectively.

Presentation of Unrecognized Tax Benefits

In July 2013, the FASB issued ASU No. 2013-11, Presentation of an Unrecognized Tax Benefit When a Net Operating Loss Carryforward, a Similar Tax Loss or a Tax Credit Carryforward Exists a consensus of the FASB Emerging Issues Task Force. The ASU does not affect the recognition or measurement of uncertain tax positions under US GAAP.

However, under the ASU, unrecognized tax benefits, or portions of unrecognised tax benefits, must be presented in the financial statements as a reduction to deferred tax assets when a net operating loss carryforward, a similar tax loss or a tax credit carryforward exists except when:

•

a net operating loss carryforward, a similar tax loss or a tax credit carryfoward is not available at the reporting date under the governing tax laws to settle taxes that would result from the disallowance of the tax position; or

•

the entity does not intend to use the deferred tax asset for this purpose, provided that the tax law permits a choice.

If either of these conditions exists, an entity should present an unrecognized tax benefit in the financial statements as a liability and should not net the unrecognized tax benefit with a deferred tax asset.

The amendments under the ASU:

•

are effective prospectively for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2013 although early adoption is permitted; and

•

should be applied to all unrecognized tax benefits that exist as of the effective date although entities may choose to apply the amendments retrospectively to each prior reporting period presented.

The Company has decided to not adopt this guidance early. However, as an indication of the likely balance sheet reclassification based on the position at December 31, 2013, the Company had recognized

$22 million

of unrecognized tax benefits within Other non-current liabilities that would be reclassified to Non-current deferred tax assets. The Company has not yet determined whether it will apply the amendments to the prior reporting period for its first quarter 2014 reporting.

Other than the changes described above, there were no new accounting standards issued during


that would impact on the Company’s reporting.

OFF BALANCE SHEET TRANSACTIONS

Apart from commitments, guarantees and contingencies, as disclosed in Note 22 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company has no off-balance sheet arrangements that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a material effect on the Company’s financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.



Market risk

Item 7A —

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk

Financial Risk Management

We are exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. In order to manage the risk arising from these exposures, we enter into a variety of interest rate and foreign currency derivatives. We do not hold financial or derivative instruments for trading purposes.

A discussion of our accounting policies for financial and derivative instruments is included in Note 2 — 'Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies' of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, and further disclosure is provided in Note 26 — 'Derivative Financial Instruments and Hedging Activities'.

Foreign Exchange Risk Management

Because of the large number of countries and currencies we operate in, movements in currency exchange rates may affect our results.

We report our operating results and financial condition in US dollars. Our US operations earn revenue and incur expenses primarily in US dollars. Outside the United States, we predominantly generate revenues and expenses in the local currency with the exception of our London market operations which earns revenues in several currencies but incurs expenses predominantly in pounds sterling.

The table below gives an approximate analysis of revenues and expenses by currency in


.

Our principal exposures to foreign exchange risk arise from:

•

our London market operations; and

•

translation.

London market operations

In our London market operations, we earn revenue in a number of different currencies, principally US dollars, pounds sterling, Euros and Japanese yen, but incur expenses almost entirely in pounds sterling.

We hedge this risk as follows:

•

to the extent that forecast pounds sterling expenses exceed pound sterling revenues, we limit our exposure to this exchange rate risk by the use of forward contracts matched to specific, clearly identified cash outflows arising in the ordinary course of business; and

•

to the extent our London market operations earn significant revenues in Euros and Japanese yen, we limit our exposure to changes in the exchange rate between the US dollar and these currencies by the use of forward contracts matched to a percentage of forecast cash inflows in specific currencies and periods. In addition, we are also exposed to foreign exchange risk on any net sterling asset or liability position in our London market operations.

However, where the foreign exchange risk relates to any sterling pension assets benefit or liability for pensions benefit, we do not hedge the risk. Consequently, if our London market operations have a significant pension asset or liability, we may be exposed to accounting gains and losses if the US dollar and pounds sterling exchange rate changes. We do, however, hedge the pounds sterling contributions into the pension plan.

Translation risk

Outside our US and London market operations, we predominantly earn revenues and incur expenses in the local currency. When we translate the results and net assets of these operations into US dollars for reporting purposes, movements in exchange rates will affect reported results and net assets. For example, if the US dollar strengthens against the Euro, the reported results of our Eurozone operations in US dollar terms will be lower.



Willis Group Holdings plc

With the exception of foreign currency hedges for certain intercompany loans, that are not designated as hedging instruments, we do not hedge translation risk.

The table below provides information about our foreign currency forward exchange contracts, which are sensitive to exchange rate risk. The table summarizes the US dollar equivalent amounts of each currency bought and sold forward and the weighted average contractual exchange rates. All forward exchange contracts mature within three years.

_________________

(i)

Represents the difference between the contract amount and the cash flow in US dollars which would have been receivable had the foreign currency forward exchange contracts been entered into on

December 31, 2013

or


at the forward exchange rates prevailing at that date.

Income earned within foreign subsidiaries outside of the UK is generally offset by expenses in the same local currency but the Company does have exposure to foreign exchange movements on the net income of these entities.

Interest rate risk management

Our operations are financed principally by $2,054 million fixed rate senior notes issued by the Group and $274 million under a 7-year term loan facility. Of the fixed rate senior notes, $148 million are due 2015, $300 million are due 2016, $394 million are due 2017, $187 million are due 2019, $500 million are due 2021, $250 million are due 2023, and $275 million are due 2043. The 7-year term loan facility is repayable in quarterly installments and a final repayment of $186 million is due in the second quarter of 2018. As of

December 31, 2013

we had access to $822 million under three revolving credit facilities and, as at this date, no amount was outstanding under those facilities. The interest rate applicable to the bank borrowing is variable according to the period of each individual drawdown.

We are also subject to market risk from exposure to changes in interest rates based on our investing activities where our primary interest rate risk arises from changes in short-term interest rates in both US dollars and pounds sterling.



Market risk

As a result of our operating activities, we receive cash for premiums and claims which we deposit in short-term investments denominated in US dollars and other currencies. We earn interest on these funds, which is included in our consolidated financial statements as investment income. These funds are regulated in terms of access and the instruments in which they may be invested, most of which are short-term in maturity. In order to manage interest rate risk arising from these financial assets, we entered into interest rate swaps to receive a fixed rate of interest and pay a variable rate of interest in the various currencies related to the short-term investments. The use of interest rate contracts essentially converted groups of short-term variable rate investments to fixed rates. However, in the fourth quarter of 2011, we stopped renewing hedged positions on their maturity given the flat yield curve environment. Further to this, during second quarter 2012, the Company closed out its legacy position for these interest rate swap contracts.

During the year ended December 31, 2010, the Company entered into a series of interest rate swaps for a total notional amount of $350 million to receive a fixed rate and pay a variable rate on a semi-annual basis, with a maturity date of July 15, 2015. The Company had previously designated these instruments as fair value hedges against its $350 million 5.625% senior notes due 2015 and had accounted for them accordingly until the first quarter of 2013 at which point these swaps, although remaining as economic hedges, no longer qualified for hedge accounting. During the three months ended September 30, 2013 the Company closed out the above interest rate swaps and received a cash settlement of $13 million on termination.

The table below provides information about our derivative instruments and other financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates. For interest rate swaps, the table presents notional principal amounts and average interest rates analyzed by expected maturity dates. Notional principal amounts are used to calculate the contractual payments to be exchanged under the contracts. The duration of interest rate swaps varied between one and five years, with re-fixing periods of three to six months. Average fixed and variable rates are, respectively, the weighted-average actual and market rates for the interest rate hedges in place. Market rates are the rates prevailing at

December 31, 2013

or


, as appropriate.

_________________

(i)

Represents the net present value of the expected cash flows discounted at current market rates of interest or quoted market rates as appropriate.



Willis Group Holdings plc

Liquidity Risk

Our objective is to ensure we have the ability to generate sufficient cash either from internal or external sources, in a timely and cost-effective manner, to meet our commitments as they fall due. Our management of liquidity risk is embedded within our overall risk management framework. Scenario analysis is continually undertaken to ensure that our resources can meet our liquidity requirements. These resources are supplemented by access to $822 million under three revolving credit facilities. We undertake short-term foreign exchange swaps for liquidity purposes.

See ‘Liquidity and Capital Resources’ section under Item 7, 'Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations'.

Credit Risk and Concentrations of Credit Risk

Credit risk represents the loss that would be recognized at the reporting date if counterparties failed to perform as contracted and from movements in interest rates and foreign exchange rates. The Company currently does not anticipate non-performance by its counterparties. The Company generally does not require collateral or other security to support financial instruments with credit risk; however, it is the Company's policy to enter into master netting arrangements with counterparties as practical.

Concentrations of credit risk that arise from financial instruments exist for groups of customers or counterparties when they have similar economic characteristics that would cause their ability to meet contractual obligations to be similarly affected by changes in economic or other conditions. Financial instruments on the balance sheet that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable and derivatives which are recorded at fair value.

The Company maintains a policy providing for the diversification of cash and cash equivalent investments and places such investments in an extensive number of financial institutions to limit the amount of credit risk exposure. These financial institutions are monitored on an ongoing basis for credit quality predominantly using information provided by credit agencies.

Concentrations of credit risk with respect to receivables are limited due to the large number of clients and markets in which the Company does business, as well as the dispersion across many geographic areas. Management does not believe significant risk exists in connection with the Company's concentrations of credit as of December 31,

ASU No. 2011-05 also requires entities to present on the face of the financial statements reclassification adjustments for items that are reclassified from other comprehensive income to net income in the statement(s) where the components of net income and the components of other comprehensive income are presented. In December 2011, the FASB issued ASU No. 2011-12 in order to defer those changes in ASU No. 2011-05 that relate to the presentation of reclassification adjustments. In February 2013, the FASB issued ASU No. 2013-02, Reporting of Amounts Reclassified Out of Accumulated Other Comprehensive (ASU 2013-02).

Presentation of Unrecognized Tax Benefits

In July 2013, the FASB issued ASU No. 2013-11, Presentation of an Unrecognized Tax Benefit When a Net Operating Loss Carryforward, a Similar Tax Loss or a Tax Credit Carryforward Exists a consensus of the FASB Emerging Issues Task Force. The ASU does not affect the recognition or measurement of uncertain tax positions under US GAAP.

However, under the ASU, unrecognized tax benefits, or portions of unrecognised tax benefits, must be presented in the financial statements as a reduction to deferred tax assets when a net operating loss carryforward, a similar tax loss or a tax credit carryforward exists except when:

•

a net operating loss carryforward, a similar tax loss or a tax credit carryfoward is not available at the reporting date under the governing tax laws to settle taxes that would result from the disallowance of the tax position; or

•

the entity does not intend to use the deferred tax asset for this purpose, provided that the tax law permits a choice.

If either of these conditions exists, an entity should present an unrecognized tax benefit in the financial statements as a liability and should not net the unrecognized tax benefit with a deferred tax asset.



Willis Group Holdings plc

2.    BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)

The amendments under the ASU:

•

are effective prospectively for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2013 although early adoption is permitted; and

•

should be applied to all unrecognized tax benefits that exist as of the effective date although entities may choose to apply the amendments retrospectively to each prior reporting period presented.

The Company has decided to not adopt this guidance early. However, as an indication of the likely balance sheet reclassification based on the position at December 31, 2013, the Company had recognized

$22 million

of unrecognized tax benefits within Other non-current liabilities that would be reclassified to Non-current deferred tax assets. The Company has not yet determined whether it will apply the amendments to the prior reporting period for its first quarter 2014 reporting.

Significant Accounting Policies

These consolidated financial statements conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (‘US GAAP’). Presented below are summaries of significant accounting policies followed in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements.

Certain reclassifications have been made to prior year amounts to conform to current year presentation.

Principles of Consolidation

The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Willis Group Holdings and its subsidiaries, which are controlled through the ownership of a majority voting interest. Intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated on consolidation.

Foreign Currency Translation

Transactions in currencies other than the functional currency of the entity are recorded at the rates of exchange prevailing at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities in currencies other than the functional currency are translated at the rates of exchange prevailing at the balance sheet date and the related transaction gains and losses are reported in the statements of operations. Certain intercompany loans are determined to be of a long-term investment nature. The Company records transaction gains and losses from remeasuring such loans as a component of other comprehensive income.

Upon consolidation, the results of operations of subsidiaries and associates whose functional currency is other than the US dollar are translated into US dollars at the average exchange rate and assets and liabilities are translated at year-end exchange rates. Translation adjustments are presented as a separate component of other comprehensive income in the financial statements and are included in net income only upon sale or liquidation of the underlying foreign subsidiary or associated company.

Use of Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with US GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities as of the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the year. In the preparation of these consolidated financial statements, estimates and assumptions have been made by management concerning: the valuation of intangible assets and goodwill (including those acquired through business combinations); the selection of useful lives of fixed and intangible assets; impairment testing; provisions necessary for accounts receivable, commitments and contingencies and accrued liabilities; long-term asset returns, discount rates and mortality rates in order to estimate pension liabilities and pension expense; income tax valuation allowances; and other similar evaluations. Actual results could differ from the estimates underlying these consolidated financial statements.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents primarily consist of time deposits with original maturities of three months or less.



Notes to the financial statements

2.    BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)

Fiduciary Assets and Fiduciary Liabilities

In its capacity as an insurance agent or broker, the Company collects premiums from insureds and, after deducting its commissions, remits the premiums to the respective insurers; the Company also collects claims or refunds from insurers which it then remits to insureds.

Fiduciary Receivables

Fiduciary receivables represent uncollected premiums from insureds and uncollected claims or refunds from insurers.

Fiduciary Funds

Fiduciary funds represent unremitted premiums received from insureds and unremitted claims or refunds received from insurers. Fiduciary funds are generally required to be kept in certain regulated bank accounts subject to guidelines which emphasize capital preservation and liquidity. Such funds are not available to service the Company’s debt or for other corporate purposes. Notwithstanding the legal relationships with insureds and insurers, the Company is entitled to retain investment income earned on fiduciary funds in accordance with industry custom and practice and, in some cases, as supported by agreements with insureds.

In certain instances, the Company advances premiums, refunds or claims to insurance underwriters or insureds prior to collection. Such advances are made from fiduciary funds and are reflected in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as fiduciary assets.

Fiduciary Liabilities

The obligations to remit these funds to insurers or insureds are recorded as fiduciary liabilities on the Company’s consolidated balance sheets. The period for which the Company holds such funds is dependent upon the date the insured remits the payment of the premium to the Company and the date the Company is required to forward such payment to the insurer. Balances arising from insurance brokerage transactions are reported as separate assets or liabilities.

Accounts Receivable

Accounts receivable are stated at estimated net realizable values. Allowances are recorded, when necessary, in an amount considered by management to be sufficient to meet probable future losses related to uncollectible accounts.

Fixed Assets

Fixed assets are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Expenditures for improvements are capitalized; repairs and maintenance are charged to expenses as incurred. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method based on the estimated useful lives of assets.

Depreciation on buildings and long leaseholds is

calculated over the lesser of 50 years or the lease term.

Depreciation on leasehold improvements is calculated over the lesser of the useful life of the assets or the remaining lease term. Depreciation on furniture and equipment is

calculated based on a range of 3 to 10 years.

Freehold land is not depreciated.

Recoverability of Fixed Assets

Long-lived assets are tested for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstance indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount of a long-lived asset is not recoverable and exceeds its fair value. Recoverability is determined based on the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset or asset group. Long-lived assets and certain identifiable intangible assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell.

Operating Leases

Rentals payable on operating leases are charged straight line to expenses over the lease term as the rentals become payable.



Willis Group Holdings plc

2.    BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of businesses acquired over the fair value of identifiable net assets at the dates of acquisition. The Company reviews goodwill for impairment annually and whenever facts or circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable. In testing for impairment, the fair value of each reporting unit is compared with its carrying value, including goodwill. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the amount of an impairment loss, if any, is calculated by comparing the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill.

Acquired intangible assets are amortized over the following periods:

Amortizable intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable.

Investments in Associates

Investments are accounted for using the equity method of accounting if the Company has the ability to exercise significant influence, but not control, over the investee. Significant influence is generally deemed to exist if the

Company has an equity ownership in the voting stock of the investee between 20 and 50 percent

, although other factors, such as representation on the Board of Directors and the impact of commercial arrangements, are considered in determining whether the equity method of accounting is appropriate. Under the equity method of accounting the investment is carried at cost of acquisition, plus the Company’s equity in undistributed net income since acquisition, less any dividends received since acquisition.

The Company periodically reviews its investments in associates for which fair value is less than cost to determine if the decline in value is other than temporary. If the decline in value is judged to be other than temporary, the cost basis of the investment is written down to fair value. The amount of any write-down is included in the statements of operations as a realized loss.

All other equity investments where the Company does not have the ability to exercise significant influence are accounted for by the cost method. Such investments are not publicly traded.

Derivative Financial Instruments

The Company uses derivative financial instruments for other than trading purposes to alter the risk profile of an existing underlying exposure. Interest rate swaps are used to manage interest risk exposures. Forward foreign currency exchange contracts are used to manage currency exposures arising from future income and expenses. The fair values of derivative contracts are recorded in other assets and other liabilities. The effective portions of changes in the fair value of derivatives that qualify for hedge accounting as cash flow hedges are recorded in other comprehensive income. Amounts are reclassified from other comprehensive income into earnings when the hedged exposure affects earnings. If the derivative is designated as and qualifies as an effective fair value hedge, the changes in the fair value of the derivative and of the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk are both recognized in earnings. The amount of hedge ineffectiveness recognized in earnings is based on the extent to which an offset between the fair value of the derivative and hedged item is not achieved. Changes in fair value of derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting, together with any hedge ineffectiveness on those that do qualify, are recorded in other operating expenses or interest expense as appropriate.

Income Taxes

The Company recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for the estimated future tax consequences of events attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating and capital loss and tax credit carry forwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and



Notes to the financial statements

2.    BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)

liabilities of changes in tax rates is recognized in the statement of operations in the period in which the change is enacted. Deferred tax assets are reduced through the establishment of a valuation allowance at such time as, based on available evidence, it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The Company adjusts valuation allowances to measure deferred tax assets at the amount considered realizable in future periods if the Company’s facts and assumptions change. In making such determination, the Company considers all available positive and negative evidence, including future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, projected future taxable income, tax planning strategies and recent financial operations.

Positions taken in the Company’s tax returns may be subject to challenge by the taxing authorities upon examination. The Company recognizes the benefit of uncertain tax positions in the financial statements when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on examination by the tax authorities upon lapse of the relevant statute of limitations, or when positions are effectively settled. The benefit recognized is the largest amount of tax benefit that is

greater than 50 percent likely to be realized on settlement with the tax authority, assuming full knowledge of the position and all relevant facts.

The Company adjusts its recognition of these uncertain tax benefits in the period in which new information is available impacting either the recognition or measurement of its uncertain tax positions. These differences will be reflected as increases or decreases to income tax expense in the period in which they are determined.

Changes in tax laws and rates could also affect recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities in the future. Management is not aware of any such changes that would have a material effect on the Company’s results of operations, cash flows or financial position.

The Company recognizes interest and penalties relating to unrecognized tax benefits within income taxes.

Provisions for Liabilities

The Company is subject to various actual and potential claims, lawsuits and other proceedings. The Company records liabilities for such contingencies including legal costs when it is probable that a liability has been incurred before the balance sheet date and the amount can be reasonably estimated. To the extent such losses can be recovered under the Company’s insurance programs, estimated recoveries are recorded when losses for insured events are realized. Significant management judgment is required to estimate the amounts of such contingent liabilities and the related insurance recoveries. The Company analyzes its litigation exposure based on available information, including consultation with outside counsel handling the defense of these matters, to assess its potential liability. Contingent liabilities are not discounted.

Pensions

The Company has two principal defined benefit pension plans which cover approximately half of employees in the United States and United Kingdom. Both these plans are now closed to new entrants. New employees in the United Kingdom are offered the opportunity to join a defined contribution plan and in the United States are offered the opportunity to join a 401(k) plan. In addition, there are smaller plans in certain other countries in which the Company operates, including a non-qualified plan in the United States. Elsewhere, pension benefits are typically provided through defined contribution plans.

Defined benefit plans

The net periodic cost of the Company’s defined benefit plans are measured on an actuarial basis using the projected unit credit method and several actuarial assumptions the most significant of which are the discount rate and the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. Other material assumptions include rates of participant mortality, the expected long-term rate of compensation and pension increases and rates of employee termination. Gains and losses occur when actual experience differs from actuarial assumptions.

If such gains or losses exceed ten percent of the greater of plan assets or plan liabilities

the Company amortizes those gains or losses over the average remaining service period or average remaining life expectancy as appropriate of the plan participants.

In accordance with US GAAP the Company records on the balance sheet the funded status of its pension plans based on the projected benefit obligation.



Willis Group Holdings plc

2.    BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)

Defined contribution plans

Contributions to the Company’s defined contribution plans are recognized as they fall due. Differences between contributions payable in the year and contributions actually paid are shown as either other assets or other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets.

Share-Based Compensation

The Company accounts for share-based compensation as follows:

•

the cost resulting from all equity awards is recognized in the financial statements at fair value estimated at the grant date;

•

the fair value is recognized (generally as compensation cost) over the requisite service period for all awards that vest; and

•

compensation cost is not recognized for awards that do not vest because service or performance conditions are not satisfied.

Revenue Recognition

Revenue includes insurance commissions, fees for services rendered, certain commissions receivable from insurance carriers, investment income and other income.

Brokerage income and fees negotiated in lieu of brokerage are recognized at the later of policy inception date or when the policy placement is complete. Commissions on additional premiums and adjustments are recognized when approved by or agreed between the parties and collectability is reasonably assured.

Fees for risk management and other services are recognized as the services are provided. Consideration for negotiated fee arrangements for an agreed period covering multiple insurance placements, the provision of risk management and/or other services are allocated to all deliverables on the basis of their relative selling prices. The Company establishes contract cancellation reserves where appropriate: at

December 31, 2013

,


and


, such amounts were not material.

During the year ended December 31, 2013, the Company aligned the recognition of revenue in China and its North America Personal Lines business with the rest of the Group. The impact of these realignments was not material for prior periods and, consequently, the impacts of the realignments have been made in 2013.

Investment income is recognized as earned.

Other income comprises gains on disposal of intangible assets, which primarily arise on the disposal of books of business. Although the Company is not in the business of selling intangible assets, from time to time the Company will dispose of a book of business (a customer list) or other intangible assets that do not produce adequate margins or fit with the Company’s strategy.

of which

$28 million

related to severance costs, in relation to an Expense Reduction Initiative in the first quarter. These costs related to


positions that have been eliminated.

During 2011, the Company incurred additional severance costs of

$89 million

relating to the Company's 2011 Operational Review. These costs relate to approximately

1,200

positions that were eliminated.

Cash Retention Awards

For the past several years, certain cash retention awards under the Company's annual incentive programs included a feature which required the recipient to repay a proportionate amount of the annual award if the employee voluntarily left the Company before a specified date, which was generally three years following the award. As previously disclosed, the Company made the cash payment to the recipient in the year of grant and recognized the payment in expense ratably over the period it was subject to repayment, beginning in the quarter in which the award was made. The unamortized portion of cash retention awards was recorded within 'other current assets' and 'other non-current assets' in the consolidated balance sheet.

The following table sets out the amount of cash retention awards made and the related amortization of those awards for the years ended

December 31, 2013

,

:

In December 2012, the Company decided to eliminate the repayment requirement from the past annual cash retention awards and, as a result, recognized a one-time, non-cash, pre-tax charge of

$200 million

which represented the write-off of the unamortized balance of past awards at that date.

There were however, a number of off-cycle awards with a fixed guarantee attached, for which the Company has not waived the repayment requirement. The unamortized portion of retention awards amounted to

$15 million

In addition, Shares subject to awards that were granted under the Willis Group Holdings 2008 Share Purchase and Option Plan, that terminate, expire or lapse for any reason will be made available for future Awards under this Plan. Options are exercisable on a variety of dates, including from the second, third, fourth or fifth anniversary of grant. Unless terminated sooner by the Board of Directors, the 2012 Plan will expire 10 years after the date of its adoption. That termination will not affect the validity of any grants outstanding at that date.

2008 Share Purchase and Option Plan

This plan, which was established on

April 23, 2008

, provides for the granting of time and performance-based options, restricted stock units and various other share-based grants at fair market value to employees of the Company. The 2008 plan was terminated as at

April 25, 2012

and no further grants will be made under this plan. Any shares available for grant under the 2008 plan were included in the 2012 Equity Incentive Plan availability.

Option Valuation Assumptions

The fair value of each option is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model that uses the assumptions noted in the following table. Expected volatility is based on historical volatility of the Company’s stock. The Company uses the simplified method set out in Accounting Standard Codification (‘ASC’) 718-10-S99 to derive the expected term of options granted as it does not have sufficient historical exercise data to provide a reasonable basis upon which to

estimate expected term. The risk-free rate for periods within the expected life of the option is based on the US Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant.

A summary of option activity under the plans at

December 31, 2013

The significant components of deferred income tax assets and liabilities and their balance sheet classifications are as follows:



Notes to the financial statements

7.    INCOME TAXES (Continued)

As a result of certain realization requirements of ASC 718 Compensation - Stock Compensation, the table of deferred tax assets and liabilities shown above does not include certain deferred tax assets of

$8 million

(


: $

nil

), that arose directly from tax deductions related to equity compensation greater than compensation recognized for financial reporting. Equity will be increased by

$8 million

if and when such deferred tax assets are ultimately realized. The Company uses a 'with and without' basis when determining when excess tax benefits have been realized.

At

December 31, 2013

the Company had valuation allowances of

$196 million

(


:

$221 million

) to reduce its deferred tax assets to estimated realizable value. The valuation allowances at

December 31, 2013

relate to deferred tax assets arising from UK capital loss carryforwards (

$43 million

) and other net operating losses (

$4 million

), which have no expiration date, and to the deferred tax assets in the US (

$149 million

). US Federal net operating losses will expire between 2028 and 2032 and US State net operating losses will expire by 2032. Capital loss carryforwards can only be offset against future UK capital gains.

The amount charged to tax expense in the table above differs from the effect of $

nil

disclosed in the rate reconciliation primarily because the movement in this table includes effects of state taxes, which are disclosed separately in the rate reconciliation. The impact of Other movements is primarily recorded in other comprehensive income.

At

December 31, 2013

the Company had deferred tax assets of

$187 million

(


:

$230 million

), net of the valuation allowance. Management believes, based upon the level of historical taxable income and projections for future taxable income, it is more likely than not that the Company will realize the benefits of these deductible differences, net of the valuation allowance. However, the amount of the deferred tax asset considered realizable could be adjusted in the future if estimates of taxable income are revised.

The Company recognizes deferred tax balances related to the undistributed earnings of subsidiaries when the Company expects that it will recover those undistributed earnings in a taxable manner, such as through receipt of dividends or sale of the investments. The Company does not, however, provide for income taxes on the unremitted earnings of certain other subsidiaries where, in management’s opinion, such earnings have been indefinitely reinvested in those operations, or will be remitted either in a tax free liquidation or as dividends with taxes substantially offset by foreign tax credits. It is not practical to determine the amount of unrecognized deferred tax liabilities for temporary differences related to these investments.

Unrecognized tax benefits

Total unrecognized tax benefits as at

December 31, 2013

, totaled

$41 million

. During the next 12 months it is reasonably possible that the Company will recognize approximately

$1 million

of tax benefits related to the release of provisions for potential inter company pricing adjustments no longer required due to either settlement through negotiation or closure of the statute of limitations on assessment.

A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amounts of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows:

$12 million

of the unrecognized tax benefits at

December 31, 2013

would, if recognized, favorably affect the effective tax rate in future periods.

The Company files tax returns in the various tax jurisdictions in which it operates. The 2009 US tax year closed in 2013 upon the expiration of the statute of limitations on assessment. Although tax years 2008 and 2009 are closed, the IRS could make adjustments (but not assess additional tax) up to the amount of the net operating losses carried forward from those years. US tax returns have been filed timely. The Company has not extended the federal statute of limitations for assessment in the US.

All UK tax returns have been filed timely and are in the normal process of being reviewed, with HM Revenue & Customs making inquiries to obtain additional information. There are no material ongoing inquiries in relation to filed UK returns. In other jurisdictions the Company is no longer subject to examinations prior to 2004.

EARNINGS PER SHARE

Basic and diluted earnings per share are calculated by dividing net income attributable to Willis Group Holdings by the average number of shares outstanding during each period. The computation of diluted earnings per share reflects the potential dilution that could occur if dilutive securities and other contracts to issue shares were exercised or converted into shares or resulted in the issue of shares that then shared in the net income of the Company.

In periods where losses are reported the weighted average shares outstanding excludes potentially issuable shares described above, because their inclusion would be antidilutive.

FIDUCIARY ASSETS

The Company collects premiums from insureds and, after deducting its commissions, remits the premiums to the respective insurers; the Company also collects claims or refunds from insurers which it then remits to insureds. Uncollected premiums



Willis Group Holdings plc

from insureds and uncollected claims or refunds from insurers (‘fiduciary receivables’) are recorded as fiduciary assets on the Company’s consolidated balance sheet. Unremitted insurance premiums, claims or refunds (‘fiduciary funds’) are also recorded within fiduciary assets.

Fiduciary assets therefore comprise both receivables and funds held in a fiduciary capacity.

Fiduciary funds, consisting primarily of time deposits with original maturities of less than or equal to three months, were

$1,662 million

as of

December 31, 2013

(


:

$1,796 million

GOODWILL

Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of businesses acquired over the fair value of identifiable net assets at the dates of acquisition. Goodwill is not amortized but is subject to impairment testing annually and whenever facts or circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable.

The Company has determined that its reporting units are consistent with its operating segments: North America; International and Global. Goodwill is allocated to these reporting units based on the original purchase price allocation for acquisitions within the reporting units. When a business entity is sold, goodwill is allocated to the disposed entity based on the fair value of that entity compared to the fair value of the reporting unit in which it is included.

The changes in the carrying amount of goodwill by segment for the years ended

December 31, 2013

and


are as follows:

_________________________________

(i)

North America —

$1 million

(


:

$nil

) tax benefit arising on the exercise of fully vested HRH stock options which were issued as part of the acquisition of HRH in 2008.

Impairment Review

The Company reviews goodwill for impairment annually. In the first step of the impairment test, the fair value of each reporting unit is compared with its carrying value, including goodwill. If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the amount of an impairment loss, if any, is calculated in the second step of the impairment test by comparing the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill.

The Company's goodwill impairment test for


has not resulted in an impairment charge (


:

$492 million

;


: $

nil

).

In 2012, the Company concluded that an impairment charge was required to reduce the carrying value of the goodwill associated with the Company's North America reporting unit. The goodwill impairment charge for the North America reporting



Willis Group Holdings plc

13.    GOODWILL (Continued)

unit amounted to

$492 million

. There was no impairment for the Global and International reporting units, as the fair values of these units were significantly in excess of their carrying value.

The decline in the fair value of the North America reporting unit, as well as differences between fair values and carrying values for other assets and liabilities in the second step of the goodwill impairment test, resulted in an implied fair value of goodwill substantially below the carrying value of the goodwill for the reporting unit. As a result, the Company recorded a goodwill impairment charge of

$492 million

as of October 1, 2012.

As previously disclosed, the North America reporting unit had been hampered by the declining Loan Protector business results, the effect of the soft economy in the U.S., which had significantly impacted the Construction and Human Capital sectors, and declining retention rates primarily related to merger and acquisition activity and lost legacy HRH businesses.

The decline in the estimated fair value of the reporting unit resulted from lower projected revenue growth rates and profitability levels as well as an increase in the discount rate used to calculate the discounted cash flows. The increase in the discount rate was due to increases in the risk-free rate and small company premium offset by a reduction to the expected market rate of return. The lower projected profitability levels reflected changes in assumptions related to organic revenue growth and cost rates which could be attributed to the declines discussed above and also included consideration of the uncertainty related to the business's ability to execute on the projected cash flows.

INVESTMENTS IN ASSOCIATES

The Company holds a number of investments which it accounts for using the equity method. The Company’s approximate interest in the outstanding stock of the more significant associates is as follows:

The Company’s principal investment as of

December 31, 2013

and


is GS & Cie Groupe (‘Gras Savoye’), France’s leading insurance broker.

The Company’s original investment in Gras Savoye was made in 1997, when it acquired a

33 percent

ownership interest. Between 1997 and December 2009 this interest was increased by a series of incremental investments to

49 percent

.

On December 17, 2009, the Company completed a leveraged transaction with the original family shareholders of Gras Savoye and Astorg Partners, a private equity fund, to reorganize the capital of Gras Savoye (‘December 2009 leveraged transaction’). The Company, the original family shareholders and Astorg now own equal stakes of

30 percent

in the capital structure of Gras Savoye and have equal representation of one third of the voting rights on its board. The remaining shareholding is held by a large pool of Gras Savoye managers and minority shareholders.

A put option that was in place prior to the December 2009 leveraged transaction, and which could have increased the Company’s interest to

90 percent

, has been amended and the Company now has a call option to purchase

100 percent

of the capital of Gras Savoye. If the Company does not waive the call option before April 30, 2015, then it must exercise the call option in 2016 or the other shareholders may initiate procedures to sell Gras Savoye. Except with the unanimous consent of the supervisory board and other customary exceptions, the parties are prohibited from transferring any shares of Gras Savoye until 2016. At the end of this period, shareholders are entitled to pre-emptive and tag-along rights.

In 2011 the Company’s ownership of Gras Savoye reduced from

31 percent

to

30 percent

following issuance of additional share capital as part of an employee share incentive scheme.

The carrying amount of the Gras Savoye investment as of

December 31, 2013

includes goodwill of

$84 million

(


:

$83 million

) and interest bearing vendor loans and convertible bonds issued by Gras Savoye of

$46 million

and

$110 million

respectively (

PENSION PLANS

The Company maintains two principal defined benefit pension plans that cover approximately half of our employees in the United States and United Kingdom. Both of these plans are now closed to new entrants and with effect from May 15, 2009, the Company closed the US defined benefit plan to future accrual. New employees in the United Kingdom are offered the opportunity to join a defined contribution plan and in the United States are offered the opportunity to join a 401(k) plan. In addition to the Company’s UK and US defined benefit pension plans, the Company has several smaller defined benefit pension plans in certain other countries in which it operates including a US non-qualified plan and an unfunded plan in the UK. Elsewhere, pension benefits are typically provided through defined contribution plans. It is the Company’s policy to fund pension costs as required by applicable laws and regulations.

At

December 31, 2013

, the Company recorded, on the Consolidated Balance Sheets:

•

a pension benefit asset of

The following schedule provides other information concerning the Company’s UK and US defined benefit pension plans:

The expected return on plan assets was determined on the basis of the weighted-average of the expected future returns of the various asset classes, using the target allocations shown below. The expected returns on UK plan assets are: UK and foreign equities

9.27 percent

, debt securities

4.42 percent

7.86 percent

and real estate

6.53 percent

. The expected returns on US plan assets are: US and foreign equities

10.40 percent

and debt securities

4.10 percent

.

The Company’s pension plan asset allocations based on fair values were as follows:

In the UK the pension trustees in consultation with the Company maintain a diversified asset portfolio and this together with contributions made by the Company is expected to meet the pension scheme’s liabilities as they become due. The UK plan’s assets are divided into


separate portfolios according to asset class and managed by


investment managers. The broad target allocations are UK and foreign equities (

31.5 percent

), debt securities (

45 percent

), hedge funds (

17.5 percent

) and real estate (

6 percent

). In the US the Company’s investment policy is to maintain a diversified asset portfolio, which together with contributions made by the Company is expected to meet the pension scheme’s liabilities as they become due. The US plan’s assets are currently invested in


funds representing most standard equity and debt security classes. The broad target allocations are US and foreign equities (

50 percent

) and debt securities (

50 percent

).

Fair Value Hierarchy

The fair value hierarchy has three levels based on the reliability of the inputs used to determine fair value:

•

Level 1: refers to fair values determined based on quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets;

•

Level 2: refers to fair values estimated using observable market based inputs or unobservable inputs that are corroborated by market data; and

•

Level 3: includes fair values estimated using unobservable inputs that are not corroborated by market data.

The UK plan’s real estate investment comprises UK property and infrastructure investments which are valued by the fund manager taking into account cost, independent appraisals and market based comparable data. The UK plan’s hedge fund investments are primarily invested in various ‘fund of funds’ and are valued based on net asset values calculated by the fund and are not publicly available. Liquidity is typically monthly and is subject to liquidity of the underlying funds.

The following benefit payments, which reflect expected future service, as appropriate, are estimated to be paid by the UK and US defined benefit pension plans:

Willis North America has a 401(k) plan covering all eligible employees of Willis North America and its subsidiaries. The plan allows participants to make pre-tax contributions which the Company, at its discretion may match. During 2009, the Company had decided not to make any matching contributions other than for former HRH employees whose contributions were matched up to

Debt issuance

On July 23, 2013 we entered into an amendment to our existing credit facilities to extend both the amount of financing and the maturity date of the facilities. As a result of this amendment, our revolving credit facility was increased from

$500 million

to

$800 million

. The maturity date on both the revolving credit facility and the

$300 million

term loan was extended to

July 23, 2018

, from

December 16, 2016

. At the amendment date we owed

$281 million

on the term loan and there was no change to this amount as a result of the refinancing.

The 7-year term loan facility expiring 2018 bears interest at

LIBOR plus 1.50%

and is repayable in quarterly installments and a final repayment of

$186 million

is due in the third quarter of 2018. In 2013, we made

$15 million

of mandatory repayments against this 7-year term loan. Drawings under the

$800 million

revolving credit facility bear interest at

LIBOR plus 1.50%

. These margins apply while the Company’s debt rating remains BBB-/Baa3. As of December 31, 2013

$nil

6.200%

senior notes due 2017 and its

7.000%

senior notes due 2019 for an aggregate purchase price of up to

The Company incurred total losses on extinguishment of debt of

$60 million

during the year ended December 31, 2013. This was made up of a tender premium of

$65 million

, the write-off of unamortized debt issuance costs of

$2 million

and a credit for the reduction of the fair value adjustment on 5.625% senior notes due 2015 of

$7 million

.

The agreements relating to our 7-year term loan facility expiring 2018 and the revolving

$800 million

credit facility contain requirements to maintain maximum levels of consolidated funded indebtedness in relation to consolidated EBITDA and minimum level of consolidated EBITDA to consolidated cash interest expense, subject to certain adjustments. In addition, the agreements relating to our credit facilities and senior notes include, in the aggregate covenants relating to the delivery of financial statements, reports and notices, limitations on liens, limitations on sales and other disposals of assets, limitations on indebtedness and other liabilities, limitations on sale and leaseback transactions, limitations on mergers and other fundamental changes, maintenance of property, maintenance of insurance, nature of business, compliance with applicable laws, maintenance of corporate existence and rights, payment of taxes and access to information and properties. At

December 31, 2013

, the Company was in compliance with all covenants.

During the year ended December 31, 2010, the Company entered into a series of interest rate swaps for a total notional amount of

$350 million

to receive a fixed rate and pay a variable rate on a semi-annual basis, with a maturity date of

July 15, 2015

. The Company had previously designated these instruments as fair value hedges against its

$350 million

5.625%

senior notes due 2015 and accounted for them accordingly until the first quarter of 2013 at which point these swaps, although remaining as economic hedges, no longer qualified for hedge accounting.

During the year ended December 31, 2013, the Company closed out the above interest rate swaps and received a cash settlement of

$13 million

on termination.

Following the partial extinguishment of the

5.625%

senior notes due 2015 on August 15, 2013, the Company has recorded a credit of

$7 million

to remove a corresponding partial amount of the fair value adjustment to the carrying values of the notes originally recognized in connection with the interest rate swaps. The remaining

$5 million

fair value adjustment as at that date will be amortized through interest expense over the period to maturity.

On November 7, 2012, a further revolving credit facility of

$20 million

, available solely for the use of our main UK regulated entity and available for use in certain circumstances, was renewed. The facility bears interest at

LIBOR plus 1.55% until 2014 and LIBOR plus 1.700% thereafter

. The facility expires on

November 6, 2015

. As at

December 31, 2013

no drawings had been made on the facility. The facility is secured against the freehold of the UK regulated entity’s freehold property in Ipswich.

On July 11, 2013, a revolving credit facility of

15 million

Chinese Yuan Renminbi 'RMB' (

$2 million

Debt obligations and facilities

The Company’s debt and related interest obligations at

December 31, 2013

are shown in the above table.

On July 23, 2013 we entered into an amendment to our existing credit facilities to extend the amount of financing of the facilities. As a result of this amendment, our revolving credit facility was increased from

Pensions

Contractual obligations for our pension plans reflect the contributions we expect to make over the next five years into our US and UK plans. These contributions are based on current funding positions and may increase or decrease dependent on the future performance of the two plans.

In the UK, we are required to agree a funding strategy for our UK defined benefit plan with the plan's trustees. In March 2012, the Company agreed to a revised schedule of contributions towards on-going accrual of benefits and deficit funding contributions the Company will make to the UK plan over the six years ended December 31, 2017. Contributions in each of the next four years are expected to total approximately

$83 million

, of which approximately

$23 million

relates to on-going contributions calculated as

15.9 percent

of active plan members' pensionable salary and approximately

$60 million

that relates to contributions towards the funding deficit.

In addition, further contributions will be payable based on a profit share calculation (equal to

20 percent

of EBITDA in excess of

$900 million

per annum as defined by the revised schedule of contributions) and an exceptional return calculation (equal to

10 percent

of any exceptional returns made to shareholders, for example, share buybacks, and special dividends). Aggregate contributions under the deficit funding contribution and the profit share calculation are capped at

£312 million

(

$517 million

) over the six years ended December 31, 2017.

During 2014 we will be required to negotiate a new funding arrangement which may further change the contributions we are required to make during 2014 and beyond.

In addition, approximately

$12 million

will be paid annually into the UK defined benefit plan related to employee's salary sacrifice contributions.

The total contracted contributions for all plans in 2014 are expected to be approximately

$122 million

, excluding approximately

$12 million

in respect of the salary sacrifice scheme.

Guarantees

Guarantees issued by certain of Willis Group Holdings’ subsidiaries with respect to the senior notes and revolving credit facilities are discussed in Note 20 — Debt in these consolidated financial statements.

Certain of Willis Group Holdings’ subsidiaries have given the landlords of some leasehold properties occupied by the Company in the United Kingdom and the United States guarantees in respect of the performance of the lease obligations of the subsidiary holding the lease. The operating lease obligations subject to such guarantees amounted to

$828 million

and

$829 million

at

December 31, 2013

and


, respectively. The capital lease obligations subject to such guarantees amounted to

$11 million

as at

December 31, 2013

(2012:

).

In addition, the Company has given guarantees to bankers and other third parties relating principally to letters of credit amounting to

$11 million

and

$10 million

at

December 31, 2013

and


, respectively. Willis Group Holdings also guarantees certain of its UK and Irish subsidiaries’ obligations to fund the UK and Irish defined benefit plans.

Other contractual obligations

For certain subsidiaries and associates, the Company has the right to purchase shares (a call option) from co-shareholders at various dates in the future. In addition, the co-shareholders of certain subsidiaries and associates have the right to sell their shares (a put option) to the Company at various dates in the future. Generally, the exercise price of such put options and call options is formula-based (using revenues and earnings) and is designed to reflect fair value. Based on current projections of profitability and exchange rates and assuming the put options are exercised, the potential amount payable from these options is not expected to exceed

$12 million

(


:

$19 million

).

In July 2010, the Company made a capital commitment of

$25 million

to Trident V Parallel Fund, LP, an investment fund managed by Stone Point Capital. This replaced a capital commitment of

$25 million

that had been made to Trident V, LP in December 2009. As at

December 31, 2013

there have been approximately

$15 million

of capital contributions.

In May 2011, the Company made a capital commitment of

$10 million

to Dowling Capital Partners I, LP. As at

December 31, 2013

there had been approximately

$4 million

of capital contributions.

Other contractual obligations at

December 31, 2013

, also include certain capital lease obligations totaling

$63 million

(


:

$53 million

), primarily in respect of the Company's Nashville property.

Claims, Lawsuits and Other Proceedings

In the ordinary course of business, the Company is subject to various actual and potential claims, lawsuits, and other proceedings relating principally to alleged errors and omissions in connection with the placement of insurance and reinsurance. Similar to other corporations, the Company is also subject to a variety of other claims, including those relating to the Company’s employment practices. Some of the claims, lawsuits and other proceedings seek damages in amounts which could, if assessed, be significant.

Errors and omissions claims, lawsuits, and other proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business are covered in part by professional indemnity or other appropriate insurance. The terms of this insurance vary by policy year and self-insured risks have increased significantly in recent years. Regarding self-insured risks, the Company has established provisions which are believed to be adequate in the light of current information and legal advice, and the Company adjusts such provisions from time to time according to developments.

On the basis of current information, the Company does not expect that the actual claims, lawsuits and other proceedings to which the Company is subject, or potential claims, lawsuits, and other proceedings relating to matters of which it is aware, will ultimately have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. Nonetheless, given the large or indeterminate amounts sought in certain of these actions, and the inherent unpredictability of litigation and disputes with insurance companies, it is possible that an adverse outcome in certain matters could, from time to time, have a material adverse effect on the Company’s results of operations or cash flows in particular quarterly or annual periods.

The material actual or potential claims, lawsuits, and other proceedings, of which the Company is currently aware, are:

Stanford Financial Group Litigation

The Company has been named as a defendant in 13 similar lawsuits relating to the collapse of The Stanford Financial Group (‘Stanford’), for which Willis of Colorado, Inc. acted as broker of record on certain lines of insurance. The complaints in these actions generally allege that the defendants actively and materially aided Stanford’s alleged fraud by providing Stanford with certain letters regarding coverage that they knew would be used to help retain or attract actual or prospective Stanford client investors. The complaints further allege that these letters, which contain statements about Stanford and the insurance policies that the defendants placed for Stanford, contained untruths and omitted material facts and were drafted in this manner to help Stanford promote and sell its allegedly fraudulent certificates of deposit.

The 13 actions are as follows:

•

Troice, et al. v. Willis of Colorado, Inc., et al.

, C.A. No. 3:9-CV-1274-N, was filed on July 2, 2009 in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas against Willis Group Holdings plc, Willis of Colorado, Inc. and a Willis associate, among others. On April 1, 2011, plaintiffs filed the operative Third Amended Class Action Complaint individually and on behalf of a putative, worldwide class of Stanford investors, adding Willis Limited as a defendant and alleging claims under Texas statutory and common law and seeking damages in excess of

$1 billion

, punitive damages and costs. On May 2, 2011, the defendants filed motions to dismiss the Third Amended Class Action Complaint, arguing,

inter alia

, that the plaintiffs’ claims are precluded by the Securities Litigation Uniform Standards Act of 1998 (‘SLUSA’).

On May 10, 2011, the court presiding over the Stanford-related actions in the Northern District of Texas entered an order providing that it would consider the applicability of SLUSA to the Stanford-related actions based on the decision in a separate Stanford action not involving a Willis entity,

Roland v. Green

, Civil Action No. 3:10-CV-0224-N. On August 31, 2011, the court issued its decision in

Roland

, dismissing that action with prejudice under SLUSA.

On October 27, 2011, the court in

Troice

entered an order (i) dismissing with prejudice those claims asserted in the Third Amended Class Action Complaint on a class basis on the grounds set forth in the

Roland

decision discussed above and (ii) dismissing without prejudice those claims asserted in the Third Amended Class Action Complaint on an individual basis. Also on October 27, 2011, the court entered a final judgment in the action.

On October 28, 2011, the plaintiffs in

Troice

filed a notice of appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. Subsequently,

Troice, Roland

and a third action captioned

Troice, et al. v. Proskauer Rose LLP

decision discussed above and on appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, were consolidated for purposes of briefing and oral argument. Following the completion of briefing and oral argument, on March 19, 2012, the Fifth Circuit reversed and remanded the actions. On April 2, 2012, the defendants-appellees filed petitions for rehearing en banc. On April 19, 2012, the petitions for rehearing en banc were denied. On July 18, 2012, defendants-appellees filed a petition for writ of certiorari with the United States Supreme Court regarding the Fifth Circuit's reversal in Troice. On January 18, 2013, the Supreme Court granted our petition. Opening briefs were filed on May 3, 2013 and the Supreme Court heard oral argument on October 7, 2013. On February 26, 2014, the Supreme Court affirmed the Fifth Circuit’s decision.

SUPPLEMENTAL DISCLOSURES OF CASH FLOW INFORMATION

Supplemental disclosures regarding cash flow information and non-cash flow investing and financing activities are as follows:

26.

DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES

Fair value of derivative financial instruments

In addition to the note below, see Note 27 - Fair Value Measurements for information about the fair value hierarchy of derivatives.

Primary risks managed by derivative financial instruments

The main risks managed by derivative financial instruments are interest rate risk and foreign currency risk. The Company’s Board of Directors reviews and approves policies for managing each of these risks as summarized below.

The Company enters into derivative transactions (principally interest rate swaps and forward foreign currency contracts) in order to manage interest rate and foreign currency risks arising from the Company’s operations and its sources of finance. The Company does not hold financial or derivative instruments for trading purposes.

Interest Rate Risk — Investment Income

As a result of the Company’s operating activities, the Company receives cash for premiums and claims which it deposits in short-term investments denominated in US dollars and other currencies. The Company earns interest on these funds, which is included in the Company’s financial statements as investment income. These funds are regulated in terms of access and the instruments in which they may be invested, most of which are short-term in maturity.

In order to manage interest rate risk arising from these financial assets, the Company entered into interest rate swaps to receive a fixed rate of interest and pay a variable rate of interest denominated in the various currencies related to the short-term investments. The use of interest rate contracts essentially converted groups of short-term variable rate investments to fixed rate investments. The fair value of these contracts was recorded in other assets and other liabilities. For contracts that qualified as cash flow hedges for accounting purposes, the effective portions of changes in fair value were recorded as a component of other comprehensive income, to the extent that the hedge relationships were highly effective.



Willis Group Holdings plc

26.    DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES (Continued

)

From the fourth quarter of 2011, the Company stopped entering into any new hedging transactions relating to interest rate risk from investments, given the flat yield curve environment at that time. Further to this, during second quarter 2012, the Company closed out its legacy position for these interest rate swap contracts.

The fair value of these swaps at the close out date was

$16 million

, representing a cash settlement amount on termination. In connection with the terminated swaps, the Company retained a gain of

$15 million

in other comprehensive income as the forecasted short-term investment transactions in relation to which the swaps qualified as cash flow hedges are still considered probable. These amounts are reclassified into earnings consistent with when the forecasted swap transactions affect earnings. We expect approximately

$5 million

of the gain to be recognized in the consolidated statement of operations in


.

At

December 31, 2013

and


, the Company had no derivative financial instruments that were designated as cash flow hedges of interest rate risk in investments.

Interest Rate Risk — Interest Expense

The Company's operations are financed principally by

$2,054 million

fixed rate senior notes and

$274 million

under a


-year term loan facility. The Company has access to

$800 million

under its main revolving credit facility expiring July 23, 2018, and

$22 million

under

two

further revolving credit facilities. As of

December 31, 2013

$nil

was drawn on these facilities.

The


-year term loan facility bears interest at

LIBOR

plus

1.50%

and drawings under the revolving credit facility bear interest at

LIBOR

plus

1.50%

. These margins apply while the Company’s debt rating remains BBB-/Baa3. Should the Company’s debt rating change, then the margin will change in accordance with the credit facilities agreements. The fixed rate senior notes bear interest at various rates as detailed in Note 20 — ‘Debt’.

During the year ended December 31, 2010, the Company entered into a series of interest rate swaps for a total notional amount of

$350 million

to receive a fixed rate and pay a variable rate on a semi-annual basis, with a maturity date of

July 15, 2015

. The Company had previously designated these instruments as fair value hedges against its

$350 million

5.625%

senior notes due 2015 and had accounted for them accordingly until the first quarter of 2013 at which point these swaps, although remaining as economic hedges, no longer qualified for hedge accounting.

During the year ended December 31, 2013, the Company closed out the above interest rate swaps and received a cash settlement of

$13 million

on termination.

Following the partial extinguishment of the

5.625%

senior notes due 2015 on August 15, 2013, we have recorded a credit of

$7 million

to remove a corresponding partial amount of the fair value adjustment to the carrying values of the notes originally recognized in connection with the interest rate swaps. The remaining

$5 million

fair value adjustment as at that date will be amortized through interest expense over the period to maturity.

To hedge against the potential variability in benchmark interest rates in advance of the anticipated debt issuance, the Company entered into two short-term treasury locks during the three months ended June 30, 2013. These were closed out during the three months ended September 30, 2013 following the issue of the new senior notes described in Note 20 - 'Debt'. The fair value of these treasury locks at the close out date was

$21 million

, received as a cash settlement on termination.

The Company had designated the Treasury locks as effective hedges of the anticipated transaction and had recognized a gain of

$19 million

in other comprehensive income in relation to the effective element that qualified for hedge accounting. This amount will be reclassified into earnings consistent with the recognition of interest expense on the

4.625%

senior notes due 2023 and the

6.125%

senior notes due 2043. In addition, the Company recognized a

$2 million

gain in interest expense for the portion of the treasury locks determined as ineffective.

Foreign Currency Risk

The Company’s primary foreign exchange risks arise:

•

from changes in the exchange rate between US dollars and pounds sterling as its London market operations earn the majority of their revenues in US dollars and incur expenses predominantly in Pounds sterling, and may also hold a significant net sterling asset or liability position on the balance sheet. In addition, the London market operations earn significant revenues in Euros and Japanese yen; and

•

from the translation into US dollars of the net income and net assets of its foreign subsidiaries, excluding the London market operations which are US dollar denominated.

The foreign exchange risks in its London market operations are hedged as follows:

•

to the extent that forecast Pound sterling expenses exceed Pound sterling revenues, the Company limits its exposure to this exchange rate risk by the use of forward contracts matched to specific, clearly identified cash outflows arising in the ordinary course of business; and

•

to the extent the UK operations earn significant revenues in Euros and Japanese yen, the Company limits its exposure to changes in the exchange rate between the US dollar and these currencies by the use of forward contracts matched to a percentage of forecast cash inflows in specific currencies and periods. In addition, we are also exposed to foreign exchange risk on any net sterling asset or liability position in our London market operations.

The fair value of foreign currency contracts is recorded in other assets and other liabilities. For contracts that qualify as accounting hedges, changes in fair value resulting from movements in the spot exchange rate are recorded as a component of other comprehensive income whilst changes resulting from a movement in the time value are recorded in interest expense. For contracts that do not qualify for hedge accounting, the total change in fair value is recorded in interest expense. Amounts held in comprehensive income are reclassified into earnings when the hedged exposure affects earnings.

At

December 31, 2013

and


, the Company’s foreign currency contracts were all designated as hedging instruments except for those relating to short-term cash flows and hedges of certain intercompany loans.

The table below summarizes by major currency the contractual amounts of the Company’s forward contracts to exchange foreign currencies for Pounds sterling in the case of US dollars and US dollars for euro and Japanese yen. Foreign currency notional amounts are reported in US dollars translated at contracted exchange rates.

_________________________________

(i)

Forward exchange contracts range in maturity from 2014 to 2015.

In addition to forward exchange contracts we undertake short-term foreign exchange swaps for liquidity purposes. These are not designated as hedges and do not qualify for hedge accounting. The fair values at

December 31, 2013

and


were immaterial.

During the year ended December 31, 2013, the Company entered into a number of foreign currency transactions in order to hedge certain intercompany loans. These derivatives were not designated as hedging instruments and were for a total notional amount of

$228 million

(

December 31, 2012

:

$63 million

). In respect of these transactions, an immaterial amount has been recognized as an asset within other current assets and a nominal gain has been recognized in income within other operating expenses for the period.

In instances where the timing of expected cash flows can be matched exactly to the maturity of the foreign exchange contract, then changes in fair value attributable to movement in the forward points are also included.

Fair Value Hedges

The Company had previously designated interest rate swaps as fair value hedges against its

$350 million

5.625%

senior notes due 2015 and accounted for them accordingly until the first quarter of 2013 at which point these swaps, although remaining as economic hedges, no longer qualified for hedge accounting.

Credit Risk and Concentrations of Credit Risk

Credit risk represents the loss that would be recognized at the reporting date if counterparties failed to perform as contracted and from movements in interest rates and foreign exchange rates. The Company currently does not anticipate non-performance by its counterparties. The Company generally does not require collateral or other security to support financial instruments with credit risk.

Concentrations of credit risk that arise from financial instruments exist for groups of customers or counterparties when they have similar economic characteristics that would cause their ability to meet contractual obligations to be similarly affected by changes in economic or other conditions. Financial instruments on the balance sheet that potentially subject the Company to



Willis Group Holdings plc

26.    DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES (Continued

)

concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable and derivatives which are recorded at fair value.

The Company maintains a policy providing for the diversification of cash and cash equivalent investments and places such investments in an extensive number of financial institutions to limit the amount of credit risk exposure. These financial institutions are monitored on an ongoing basis for credit quality predominantly using information provided by credit agencies.

Concentrations of credit risk with respect to receivables are limited due to the large number of clients and markets in which the Company does business, as well as the dispersion across many geographic areas. Management does not believe significant risk exists in connection with the Company's concentrations of credit as of December 31, 2013.

FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS

The Company has categorized its assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring and non-recurring basis into a three-level fair value hierarchy, based on the reliability of the inputs used to determine fair value as follows:

•

Level 1: refers to fair values determined based on quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets;

•

Level 2: refers to fair values estimated using observable market based inputs or unobservable inputs that are corroborated by market data; and

•

Level 3: includes fair values estimated using unobservable inputs that are not corroborated by market data.

The following methods and assumptions were used by the Company in estimating its fair value disclosure for financial instruments:

Long-term debt excluding the fair value hedge-Fair values are based on quoted market values and so classified as Level 1 measurements.

Derivative financial instruments-Market values have been used to determine the fair value of interest rate swaps and forward foreign exchange contracts based on estimated amounts the Company would receive or have to pay to terminate the agreements, taking into account the current interest rate environment or current foreign currency forward rates.

Recurring basis

The following table presents, for each of the fair-value hierarchy levels, the Company's assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis.



Willis Group Holdings plc

27.    FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS (Continued)

_________________________________

(i)

Changes in the fair value of the underlying hedged debt instrument since inception of the hedging relationship are included in long-term debt.

The estimated fair value of the Company’s financial instruments held or issued to finance the Company’s operations is summarized below. Certain estimates and judgments were required to develop the fair value amounts. The fair value amounts shown below are not necessarily indicative of the amounts that the Company would realize upon disposition nor do they indicate the Company’s intent or ability to dispose of the financial instrument.

Non-recurring basis

The remeasurement of goodwill is classified as non-recurring level 3 fair value assessment due to the significance of unobservable inputs developed using company-specific information. The Company recognized an impairment charge in its North America reporting unit during 2012. The pre-tax impairment charge of

$492 million

was recognized as a result of the Company's annual goodwill impairment testing performed as of October 1, 2012, which reduced the carrying value of the North America reporting unit goodwill as of that date of

$1,782 million

to its implied fair value of

$1,290 million

.

The Company used the income approach to measure the fair value of the North America reporting unit which involves calculating the fair value of a reporting unit based on the present value of the estimated future cash flows. Cash flow projections were based on management's estimates of revenue growth rates and operating margins, taking into consideration industry and market conditions and the uncertainty related to the business's ability to execute on the projected cash flows. The discount rate used was based on the weighted-average cost of capital adjusted for the relevant risk associated with the market participant



Notes to the financial statements

27.    FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS (Continued)

expectations of characteristics of the individual reporting units. The unobservable inputs used to fair value this reporting unit include projected revenue growth rates, profitability and the market participant assumptions within the discount rate.

The inputs used to measure the fair value of the intangibles assets of the North America reporting unit in step two of the impairment test were largely unobservable, and accordingly, are also classified as Level 3. The fair value was estimated using a multiple period excess earnings method, which is based on management's cash flow projections of revenue growth rates, operating margins and expected customer attrition, taking into consideration industry and market conditions. The discount rate used in the fair value calculations for the intangibles was based on a weighted average cost of capital adjusted for the relevant risk associated with those assets. The unobservable inputs used in these valuations include projected revenue growth rates, and the market participant assumptions within the discount rate. For more information on this impairment measured as a nonrecurring fair value adjustment, see Note 13 - Goodwill.

December 31, 2013

, based on the criteria related to internal control over financial reporting described in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on our evaluation, management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of

December 31, 2013

.

Our independent registered public accountants, Deloitte LLP, who have audited and reported on our financial statements, have undertaken an assessment of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Deloitte’s report is presented below.

February 27, 2014.



Willis Group Holdings plc

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Willis Group Holdings Public Limited Company,

Dublin, Ireland

We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Willis Group Holdings Public Limited Company and subsidiaries (the 'Company') as of

December 31, 2013

, based on criteria established in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework (1992)

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the company’s principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the company’s board of directors, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of

December 31, 2013

, based on the criteria established in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework (1992)

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended

December 31, 2013

of the Company and our report dated February  27, 2014 expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements.
