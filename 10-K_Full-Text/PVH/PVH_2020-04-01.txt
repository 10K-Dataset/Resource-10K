Company Overview

We are one of the largest global apparel companies in the world. We have over 40,000 associates operating in more than 40 countries and generated $9.9 billion in revenues in 2019. We manage a diversified brand portfolio, including

brands,

as well as the digital-centric

America and the Caribbean),

,

Kenneth Cole Reaction

,

Unlisted, a Kenneth Cole Production, MICHAEL Michael Kors

,

Michael Kors Collection, DKNY

and

Chaps

. Our brand portfolio also consists of various other owned, licensed and, to a lesser extent, private label brands. We entered into a definitive agreement on January 9, 2020 to sell our Speedo North America business to Pentland Group PLC (“Pentland”), parent company of Speedo International Limited, which licenses the

Speedo

brand to us, and we will no longer license the

Speedo

trademark upon closing of the sale (the “Speedo transaction”). The Speedo transaction is expected to close in the first quarter of 2020, subject to customary closing conditions, including clearance under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, which has been received.

We design and market branded dress shirts, neckwear, sportswear (casual apparel), jeanswear, performance apparel, intimate apparel, underwear, swimwear, swim products, handbags, accessories, footwear and other related products. Our brands are positioned to sell globally at various price points and in multiple channels of distribution. This enables us to offer products to a broad range of consumers, while minimizing competition among our brands and reducing our reliance on any one demographic group, product category, price point, distribution channel or region. We also license the use of our trademarks to third parties and joint ventures for product categories and in regions where we believe our licensees’ expertise can better serve our brands. During 2019, our directly operated businesses in North America consisted principally of wholesale sales under our

and certain of our heritage brands trademarks. Our directly operated businesses outside of North America consisted principally of our wholesale and retail sales in Europe and the Asia-Pacific region under our

TOMMY HILFIGER

trademarks; our wholesale and retail sales in Europe, the Asia-Pacific region and Latin America under our

CALVIN KLEIN

trademarks; and the operation of digital commerce sites under the

TOMMY HILFIGER

and

CALVIN KLEIN

trademarks. Our licensing activities principally related to the licensing worldwide of our

TOMMY HILFIGER

and

CALVIN KLEIN

trademarks for a broad array of product categories and for use in numerous discrete jurisdictions.

We have evolved from our 1881 roots to become a diversified global company through a combination of strategic acquisitions, including the Calvin Klein, Tommy Hilfiger, and Warnaco acquisitions, and by successfully growing our brands globally across all channels of distribution. We have also acquired several regional licensed businesses and will continue to explore strategic acquisitions of licensed businesses, trademarks and companies that we believe are additive to our overall business.

We entered into agreements on July 3, 2019 to terminate early the licenses for the global Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger North America socks and hosiery businesses (the “Socks and Hosiery transaction”) in order to consolidate the socks and hosiery businesses for all of our brands in the United States and Canada in a newly formed joint venture, PVH Legwear LLC (“PVH Legwear”), in which we own a 49% economic interest, and bring in-house the international Calvin Klein socks and hosiery wholesale businesses. The Socks and Hosiery transaction closed on December 2, 2019. PVH Legwear was formed with a wholly owned subsidiary of our former Heritage Brands socks and hosiery licensee. PVH Legwear licenses from us the rights to distribute and sell

socks and hosiery.

We acquired the Tommy Hilfiger retail business in Central and Southeast Asia from our previous licensee in that market (the “TH CSAP acquisition”) on July 1, 2019. As a result of the TH CSAP acquisition, we now operate directly the Tommy Hilfiger retail business in the Central and Southeast Asia market.

We acquired the approximately 78% ownership interests in Gazal Corporation Limited (“Gazal”) that we did not already own (the “Australia acquisition”) on May 31, 2019. Prior to the closing, we, along with Gazal, jointly owned and managed a joint venture, PVH Brands Australia Pty. Limited (“PVH Australia”), which licensed and operated businesses in Australia, New Zealand and other parts of Oceania under the

TOMMY HILFIGER

,

CALVIN KLEIN

and

Van Heusen

brands, along with other owned and licensed brands. PVH Australia came under our full control as a result of the Australia acquisition and we now operate directly those businesses.

We entered into a licensing agreement on May 30, 2019 with G-III Apparel Group, Ltd. (“G-III”) for the design, production and wholesale distribution of

CALVIN KLEIN JEANS

women’s jeanswear collections in the United States and Canada (the “G-III license”), which resulted in the discontinuation of our directly operated Calvin Klein North America women’s jeanswear wholesale business in 2019.


We acquired the

Geoffrey Beene

tradename from Geoffrey Beene, LLC (“Geoffrey Beene”) on April 20, 2018. Prior to the acquisition, we had licensed the rights to design, market and distribute

Geoffrey Beene

dress shirts and neckwear from Geoffrey Beene.

We acquired True & Co., a direct-to-consumer intimate apparel digital commerce retailer, on March 30, 2017. This acquisition enabled us to participate further in the fast-growing online channel and provided a platform to increase innovation, data-driven decisions and speed in the way we serve our consumers across our channels of distribution.

We aggregate our reportable segments for purposes of discussion in this Report into three main businesses: (i) Tommy Hilfiger, which consists of the Tommy Hilfiger North America and Tommy Hilfiger International segments; (ii) Calvin Klein, which consists of the Calvin Klein North America and Calvin Klein International segments; and (iii) Heritage Brands, which consists of the Heritage Brands Wholesale and Heritage Brands Retail segments.

Segment Data

,” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this report contains information with respect to revenue, income before interest and taxes, assets, depreciation and amortization, and capital expenditures related to each segment, as well as information regarding our revenue generated by distribution channel and based on geographic location, and the geographic locations where our net property, plant and equipment is held.

Our 2019 revenue was $9.9 billion, of which over 50% was generated outside of the United States. Our global designer lifestyle brands,

TOMMY HILFIGER

and

CALVIN KLEIN

,

together generated approximately 85% of our revenue during 2019.

Tommy Hilfiger Business

We believe that we can continue to grow global retail sales of

TOMMY HILFIGER

product through a number of initiatives, which include:

•

Driving brand heat and conversion by delivering dynamic consumer engagement initiatives that include brand ambassadors, capsule collections, consumer activations and experiential events.

•

Delivering compelling products that reflect

TOMMY HILFIGER

’s accessible premium positioning and classic American cool aesthetic, with a focus on sustainability and social innovation.

•

Category expansion within womenswear, accessories, denim and underwear.

•

Regional expansion, particularly in the Asia-Pacific region.

•

Digitizing the complete brand experience, from design to our showrooms for wholesale customers, to our online and in-store experiences.

Calvin Klein Business

We believe growth opportunities exist to drive further global retail sales of

CALVIN KLEIN

product and improvements in the operating margin of our Calvin Klein business over time, including through:

•

Reigniting the brand and driving conversion with consumer engagement initiatives that include brand ambassadors, capsule collections, consumer activations and experiential events.

•

Delivering compelling products that reflect

CALVIN KLEIN

’s accessible premium positioning and seductive aesthetic, with a focus on sustainable product creation.

•

Product improvement and expansion, particularly within men’s and women’s sportswear, jeanswear, accessories and women’s intimates.

•

Regional expansion, particularly in Europe and the Asia-Pacific region.

•

Further digitizing the brand by growing online sales and expanding omni-channel capabilities.

•

Identifying operating efficiencies across the business to drive improvements in our operating margins.

Heritage Brands Business

Our Heritage Brands business represents our original business, where we developed our core competencies, and is an important complement to our global designer brand businesses. In addition to capturing market share and generating healthy cash flows, we will continue to look for further ways to optimize the Heritage Brands portfolio. Our strategic initiatives for our Heritage Brands business include:

•

Leveraging and enhancing each brand’s position in the market to drive market share gains, with a focus on the most profitable brands.

•

Delivering trend-right products at an attractive value proposition, with a focus on new technologies, features and sustainability.

•

Optimizing distribution, particularly in the mass market retailers and digital commerce, with a focus on driving profitable volume.

•

Enhancing profitability by optimizing our portfolio, capitalizing on supply chain opportunities, reducing costs and maintaining a critical focus on inventory management.


Other Strategic Opportunities

We believe we have an attractive and diverse portfolio of brands with growth potential. Nonetheless, we will continue to explore strategic acquisitions of companies or trademarks and licensing opportunities that we believe are additive to our overall business, including to address product category expertise and brand positioning and design perspective needs. We take a disciplined approach to acquisitions, seeking brands with broad consumer recognition that we can grow profitably and expand by leveraging our infrastructure and core competencies and, where appropriate, by extending the brand through licensing.

Seasonality

Our business generally follows a seasonal pattern. Our wholesale businesses tend to generate higher levels of sales in the first and third quarters, while our retail businesses tend to generate higher levels of sales in the fourth quarter. Royalty, advertising and other revenue tends to be earned somewhat evenly throughout the year, although the third quarter has the highest level of royalty revenue due to higher sales by licensees in advance of the holiday selling season. We expect this seasonal pattern will generally continue. Working capital requirements vary throughout the year to support these seasonal patterns and business trends.

Design

Our business depends on our ability to stimulate and respond to consumer tastes and demands, as well as on our ability to remain competitive in the areas of quality and delivering a compelling price value proposition.

Our in-house design teams are significant contributors to the continued strength of our brands. Each of our branded businesses employs its own teams of designers and merchandisers that develop products representing its brand’s aesthetics, while also being mindful of consumers’ tastes, lifestyle needs and current fashion trends. To reflect consumer variances in each of our regional markets, the businesses tailor their products and offerings to appeal to local tastes, fit differences or other preferences, while maintaining the cohesive creative vision for each brand. Our teams have expanded their use of 3D design technology to enhance our design capabilities, which reduces the need for samples early in the design process and the time needed to bring products to market.

Product Sourcing

Our capabilities for worldwide procurement and sourcing enable us to deliver to our customers competitive and high quality goods at an attractive value and on a timely basis. We have an extensive established network of worldwide sourcing partners that enables us to meet our customers’ needs in an efficient manner without relying on any one vendor or factory or on vendors or factories in any one country. Our products were produced in over 1,200 factories in approximately 50 countries during 2019. All but one of these factories were operated by independent manufacturers, with most being located in Asia.

We source finished products and, to a limited extent, raw materials and trim. Raw materials and trim include fabric, buttons, thread, labels and similar components. Finished products consist of manufactured and fully assembled products ready for shipment to our customers and our stores. Raw material, trim, and finished product commitments are generally made two to six months prior to production. We believe we are one of the largest users of shirting fabric in the world. We believe that an ample number of alternative suppliers exist should we need to secure additional or replacement production capacity and raw materials.

Our purchases from our suppliers are effected through individual purchase orders specifying the price, quantity, delivery date and destination of the items to be produced. Sales are monitored regularly at both the retail and wholesale levels and modifications in production can be made either to increase or reduce inventories. We look to establish long-term supplier relationships in the appropriate locations throughout the world to meet our needs and we place our orders in a manner designed to limit the risk that a production disruption at any one facility could cause a serious inventory problem, while seeking to maximize the pricing opportunities.

The manufacturers of our products are required to meet our quality, human rights, safety, environmental and cost requirements. Our global supply chain teams, offices and buying agents enable us to monitor the quality of the goods manufactured by, and the delivery performance of, our suppliers and work with our global compliance teams to ensure the enforcement of our human rights and labor standards and other code of conduct requirements through our ongoing extensive training, approval and monitoring system. They also monitor and track the primary cost inputs to the finished product to ensure that we pay the most appropriate cost for our finished goods.


We continue to explore new areas of production that can grow with our businesses. Our country of origin strategy provides a flexible approach to product sourcing, which enables us to maximize regional opportunities and mitigate our potential exposure to risks associated with new duties, tariffs, surcharges, or other import controls or restrictions. While China remains an important sourcing country for us, we have reduced our exposure to the country over time by growing our sourcing base in other parts of Asia, as well as Africa. Many of these efforts have been with our existing factory partners. Additionally, we began producing finished products in Ethiopia during 2017 to evolve our supply chain and become more dynamic. Production is through a joint venture, PVH Arvind Manufacturing Private Limited Company (“PVH Ethiopia”), that we formed with Arvind Limited (“Arvind”). The goods produced are primarily distributed in the United States through our Heritage Brands business.

We also continue to develop strategies that can enhance the operational efficiency of our supply chain and unlock gross margin opportunities. We have incorporated 3D technology to enhance our design capabilities, which reduce our lead times, improve our planning abilities and eliminate the need for early samples in the design process. Speed is another critical focus area across the Company. We have implemented various speed models, core replenishment and read and react capabilities for select categories to enhance our operations and make our business model more dynamic and responsive, while also increasing service levels, reducing inventory exposure and improving quality and consumer value. We believe the enhancement of our supply chain efficiencies and working capital management through the effective use of our distribution network and overall infrastructure will allow us to control costs better and provide improved service to our customers.

Corporate Responsibility

As an industry leader and one of the largest branded apparel companies in the world, we recognize that we have a responsibility to address our social and environmental impacts. Corporate responsibility is central to how we conduct business and it is a crucial consideration embodied in all of the strategic business decisions that we make.

In 2019, we built upon our long-standing commitment to corporate responsibility by launching

Forward Fashion

, our evolved vision for the future that provides a new level of ambition and transparency across our corporate responsibility program and reinforces our long-standing commitment to sustainable business. Our

Forward Fashion

strategy supports the standards released by the Global Fashion Agenda in its

CEO Agenda 2019

, which reflect global developments and focus on climate change as a core priority. We are committed to the goals outlined in our

Forward

Fashion

strategy and are taking action in a number of ways, including joining key pledges and industry groups that align with our strategy.

Our three strategic focus areas are:

•

Reduce negative impacts — Our ambition is for our products and business operations to generate zero waste, zero carbon emissions and zero hazardous chemicals. This means protecting our environment by reducing energy use and powering our business through renewable sources, diverting the waste we send to landfills, eliminating water pollution from our wet processors, and fostering and harnessing innovation to design and manufacture products that eliminate product waste.

•

Increase positive impacts — Our ambition is for 100% of our products and packaging to be ethically and sustainably sourced from suppliers who respect human rights and are good employers.

•

Improve lives across our value chain — Our ambition is to improve the lives of the over one million people across our value chain

,

focusing on education and opportunities for women and children, ensuring access to clean water, investing in health and education initiatives, and continuing to champion inclusion and diversity.

We issue an annual report on our corporate responsibility efforts that can be found on our corporate website.

Warehousing, Distribution and Logistics

Our products are shipped from manufacturers to our wholesale and retail warehousing and distribution centers for inspection, sorting, packing and shipment. Centers range in size and our main facilities, some of which are operated by independent third parties, are located in the United States, the Netherlands, Canada, China, Japan, South Korea, Brazil and Australia. Our warehousing and distribution centers are designed to provide responsive service to our customers and our retail stores on a cost-effective basis.

Our backlog of customer orders totaled $1.693 billion and $1.652 billion as of

February 2, 2020

and

February 3, 2019

, respectively. The size of our order backlog depends upon a number of factors, including the timing of the market weeks for our


particular lines, during which a significant percentage of our orders are received, and the timing of the shipments, which varies from year-to-year with consideration for holidays, consumer trends, concept plans, and the usage of our basic stock replenishment programs. As a consequence, a comparison of the size of our order backlog from period to period may not be meaningful, nor may it be indicative of eventual shipments.

Material Customers

Our largest customers account for significant portions of our revenue. Sales to our five largest customers were 18.4% of our revenue in 2019 and 18.9% of our revenue in each of 2018 and 2017. No single customer accounted for more than 10% of our revenue in 2019, 2018 or 2017.

Advertising and Promotion

Our marketing programs are an integral component of the success of our brands and the products offered under them. We intend for each of our brands to be a leader in its respective market segment, with strong consumer awareness, relevance and consumer loyalty. We believe that our brands are successful in their respective market segments because we have strategically positioned each brand to target a distinct consumer demographic. Advertisements generally portray a lifestyle representation of our category offerings rather than a specific item. We design and market our products to complement each other, satisfy lifestyle needs, emphasize product features important to our target consumers, deliver a strong price/value proposition and encourage consumer loyalty.

A significant component of our marketing programs is digital media, including our digital commerce platforms and social media channels, which allow us to expand our reach to customers and enable us to provide timely information in an entertaining fashion to consumers about our products, special events, promotions and store locations. Tommy Hilfiger’s digital commerce site,

tommy

.com, and Calvin Klein’s digital commerce site,

calvinklein

.com, serve as marketing vehicles to complement the ongoing development of the

TOMMY HILFIGER

and

CALVIN KLEIN

lifestyle brands, respectively, in addition to offering a broad array of apparel and licensed products. We also operate five Heritage Brands digital commerce sites in the United States:

VanHeusen

.com,

IZOD

.com,

styleBureau

.com,

TrueAndCo.

com and

SpeedoUSA

.com.

We also advertise through print media (including fashion, entertainment/human interest, business, men’s, women’s and sports magazines and newspapers), on television, through outdoor signage and through in-store point of sale materials, as well as participate in cooperative advertising programs with our retail partners. In addition, we advertise our brands through sport sponsorships and product tie-ins. We believe that our use of high-profile brand ambassadors and well-known social media influencers across our marketing programs helps drive our brand awareness and cultural relevance.

With respect to our retail outlet stores, the majority of which are located in premium outlet centers in the United States and Canada, we generally rely upon local outlet mall developers to promote traffic for their centers. Outlet center developers employ multiple formats, including signage, print advertising, direct marketing, radio and television advertising, and special promotions.

Tommy Hilfiger Business

We believe that

TOMMY HILFIGER

is one of the world’s leading lifestyle brands and is internationally recognized for celebrating the essence of classic American cool style with a preppy twist. Tommy Hilfiger employs advertising, marketing and communications staff, including an in-house creative team, as well as outside agencies, to implement its global marketing and communications strategy across all channels of distribution. The Tommy Hilfiger marketing and communications team develops and coordinates

TOMMY HILFIGER

advertising for all regions and product lines, licensees and regional distributors. Advertisements for

TOMMY HILFIGER

brand products appear primarily in social media outlets, fashion and lifestyle magazines, newspapers, outdoor media and cinema and on television. The digital and online focus of marketing for the

TOMMY HILFIGER

brands is integral to its campaigns and continues to increase. Additionally, the marketing and communications team coordinates personal appearances by Mr. Tommy Hilfiger, including at runway shows and brand events as part of its efforts. Tommy Hilfiger maintains multiple showroom facilities and sales offices around the world. Nearly all of its showrooms are digitized, offering a more engaging, integrated and seamless buying experience for its wholesale partners.

Celebrity partnerships continued to be a cornerstone of our

TOMMY HILFIGER

consumer engagement efforts in 2019 using a balance of global and regional brand ambassadors.

TOMMY HILFIGER

’s partnership with British Formula One

TM

racing driver and five-time Formula One

TM

World Champion

Lewis Hamilton, which began in 2018, continued to drive momentum in 2019, including through an experiential event during Fall 2019 Milan Fashion Week, where consumers were able


to experience the

TOMMY

HILFIGER

fashion show and view the

TommyXLewis

collaborative collection on different platforms.

TOMMY HILFIGER

also

has a multi-year strategic partnership with four-time World Champions Mercedes-AMG Petronas Motorsport as their Official Apparel Partner.

Tommy Hilfiger also delivered engaging partnerships geared toward the female consumer, enlisting Zendaya as a brand ambassador beginning in Spring 2019, helping raise the brand’s profile. The collaboration continued through our TOMMYNOW fashion show, starring

TommyXZendaya

in Fall 2019, which resulted in

TOMMY HILFIGER

being the #1 most talked about fashion brand at New York Fashion Week on Twitter.

Calvin Klein Business

CALVIN KLEIN

is a global lifestyle brand built on iconic essentials and powered by bold, progressive ideals.

CALVIN KLEIN

continues to generate compelling brand and cultural relevancy by evolving and driving consumer engagement. The

CALVIN KLEIN

brands are unified by a dedicated brand purpose with a focus on “defying the boundaries of self-expression.”

We established a Consumer Marketing Organization (the “CMO”) in 2019, which encompasses the business’s marketing, communications, social media, celebrity dressing and special events, while also building personalized relationships and tailoring the overall consumer experience through highly specialized teams. We believe that this enhanced marketing approach will better meet our consumers’ needs as we adapt to their rapidly changing demands.

We celebrated five decades of iconic brand history with a special capsule collection in 2019, which was accompanied by a marketing campaign featuring Justin Bieber back in his

CALVIN KLEIN

UNDERWEAR

, alongside wife Hailey Bieber, musicians A$AP Rocky and Troye Sivan, and models Kendall Jenner and Liu Wen. We hosted events across Europe, Asia, Brazil, Mexico and Peru as part of the celebration. As well, core to the brand purpose, we created unique product moments, including a

CALVIN KLEIN

Pride capsule collection — a celebration of self-expression, confidence and inclusivity. The collection, which featured jeans, underwear, swimwear and accessories, was sold globally across all distribution channels.

We continued to evolve our marketing strategy, shifting to a digital and video-first mindset by creating branded content and curated experiences to leverage across social media platforms. A highlight of 2019 was

CALVIN KLEIN

’s official sponsorship of the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival in California, where our Spring 2019 campaign came to life through an immersive experience offering the opportunity to interact with both product and branded content. The activation was recognized by

Brandweek

with its Constellation Award for best luxury/fashion team.

Calvin Klein also continued to leverage strategic partnerships by balancing global and regional brand ambassadors. Singer-actor Lay Zhang was named

CALVIN KLEIN

’s first-ever Chinese global ambassador, underscoring the significant long-term opportunity to grow

CALVIN KLEIN

’s footprint and gain market share across the region. In collaboration with the partnership, we hosted several experiential events, including a surprise performance for fans in Shanghai.

Heritage Brands Business

In our Heritage Brands business, we continued a partnership for

Van Heusen

with the UFC

®

that featured MMA fighter Stephen Thompson as brand ambassador. We also continued our largest media campaign to-date for

IZOD

that features Green Bay Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers and comedian Colin Jost from

Saturday Night Live

.

We continue to promote our Heritage Brands business through sport sponsorships. Four-time PGA Tour winner Marc Leishman serves as brand ambassador for

IZOD

Golf

, which includes wearing

IZOD Golf

apparel on-course. Olympic gold medalists and World No. 1 ranked men’s double tennis team, Bob and Mike Bryan continue to serve as brand ambassadors for

IZOD

. In addition, we have an all-brand, regional sponsorship relationship with the New York Giants.

brands, as well as related trademarks (

e.g.

, the interlocking “

IZOD

and the

TOMMY HILFIGER

flag logo and crest design) and lesser-known names. These trademarks are registered for use in each of the primary countries where our products are sold and additional applications for registration of these and other trademarks are made in jurisdictions to accommodate new marks, uses in additional trademark classes or additional categories of goods or expansion into new countries.

Mr. Tommy Hilfiger is prohibited in perpetuity from using, or authorizing others to use, the

TOMMY HILFIGER

marks (except for the use by Mr. Hilfiger of his name personally and in connection with certain specified activities). In addition, we are prohibited in perpetuity from selling products not ordinarily sold under the names of prestige designer businesses or prestige global lifestyle brands without Mr. Hilfiger’s consent, from engaging in new lines of business materially different from such types of lines of business without Mr. Hilfiger’s consent, or from disparaging or intentionally tarnishing the

TOMMY HILFIGER

-related marks or Mr. Hilfiger’s personal name.

We own the

CALVIN KLEIN

marks and derivative marks in all trademark classes and for all product categories through our ownership of Calvin Klein Trademark Trust (“the Trust”), which is the sole and exclusive title owner of substantially all registrations of the

CALVIN KLEIN

trademarks. The sole purpose of the Trust is to hold these marks. Calvin Klein maintains and protects the marks on behalf of the Trust. The Trust licenses to Calvin Klein and Warnaco on an exclusive, irrevocable, perpetual and royalty-free basis the use of the marks.

Mr. Calvin Klein retains the right to use his name, on a non-competitive basis, with respect to his right of publicity, unless those rights are already being used in the Calvin Klein business. Mr. Klein has also been granted a royalty-free worldwide right to use the

CALVIN KLEIN

mark with respect to certain personal businesses and activities, subject to certain limitations designed to protect the image and prestige of the

CALVIN KLEIN

brands and to avoid competitive conflicts.

Our trademarks are the subject of registrations and pending applications throughout the world for use on a variety of apparel, footwear and related products, as well as licensed product categories, and we continue to expand our worldwide usage and registration of new and related trademarks. In general, trademarks remain valid and enforceable as long as the marks continue to be used in connection with the products and services with which they are identified and, as to registered tradenames, the required registration renewals are filed. In markets where products bearing any of our brands are not sold by us or any of our licensees or other authorized users, our rights to the use of trademarks may not be clearly established.

Our trademarks and other intellectual property rights are valuable assets and we vigorously seek to protect them on a worldwide basis against infringement. We are susceptible to others imitating our products and infringing on our intellectual property rights. This is especially the case with respect to the

TOMMY HILFIGER

and

CALVIN KLEIN

brands, as these brands enjoy significant worldwide consumer recognition and their generally higher pricing (as compared to our heritage brands) provides significant opportunity and incentive for counterfeiters and infringers. We have broad, proactive enforcement programs that we believe have been generally effective in controlling the sale of counterfeit products in the United States and in major markets abroad.

Competition

The apparel industry is competitive as a result of its fashion orientation, mix of large and small producers, low barriers to entry, the flow of domestic and imported merchandise and the wide diversity of retailing methods. We compete with numerous domestic and foreign designers, brands owners, manufacturers and retailers of apparel, accessories and footwear, including, in certain circumstances, the private label brands of our wholesale customers. Additionally, with the shift in consumer shopping preferences driving growth in the digital channel, there are more companies in the apparel sector and an increased level of transparency in pricing and product comparisons, which impacts purchasing decisions. As well, as consumers are increasingly focused on circularity with respect to apparel, companies that enable consumers to rent or purchase pre-owned apparel also impact purchasing decisions.

We believe we are well-positioned to compete in the apparel industry on the basis of style, quality, price and service. Our business depends on our ability to stimulate consumer tastes and demands, as well as on our ability to remain competitive in these areas. Our diversified portfolio of brands and products and our use of multiple channels of distribution have allowed us to develop a business that produces results that are not dependent on any one demographic group, merchandise preference, distribution channel or region. We have developed a portfolio of brands that appeals to a broad spectrum of consumers. Our owned brands have long histories and enjoy high recognition and awareness within their respective consumer segments. We


develop our owned and licensed brands to complement each other and to generate strong consumer loyalty. The worldwide recognition of the

TOMMY HILFIGER

and

CALVIN KLEIN

brands generally provide us with significant global opportunities and the opportunity to develop businesses that target different consumer groups at higher price points and in higher-end distribution channels than our heritage brands.

Imports and Import Restrictions

A substantial portion of our products is imported into the United States, Canada, Europe, the Asia-Pacific region and Latin America. These products are subject to various customs laws, which may impose tariffs, as well as quota restrictions. In addition, each of the countries in which our products are sold has laws and regulations covering imports. The United States and other countries in which our products are sold may impose, from time to time, new duties, tariffs, surcharges, or other import controls or restrictions, including the imposition of a “safeguard quota,” or adjust presently prevailing duty or tariff rates or levels. We, therefore, maintain a program of intensive monitoring of import restrictions and developments. We seek to minimize, where possible, our potential exposure to import related risks through, among other measures, adjustments in product design and fabrication, shifts of production among countries, including consideration of countries with tariff preference and free trade agreements, and manufacturers, and geographical diversification of our sources of supply. In some instances, production of a specific product category (

e.g.

, swim goggles), component parts or raw materials may be highly concentrated in one country.

The United States and China are involved in a trade dispute that has seen the imposition in 2019 of significant additional tariffs on the products we sell that are imported into the United States from China. Please see our risk factor “

We primarily use foreign suppliers for our products and raw materials, which poses risks to our business operations

”

in Item 1A, “Risk Factors,” for further discussion.

Environmental Matters

Our facilities and operations are subject to various environmental, health and safety laws and regulations. In addition, we may incur liability under environmental statutes and regulations with respect to the contamination of sites that we own or operate or previously owned or operated (including contamination caused by prior owners and operators of such sites, abutters or other persons) and the off-site disposal of hazardous materials. We believe our operations are in compliance with the terms of all applicable laws and regulations and our compliance with these laws and regulations has not had, and is not expected to have, a material effect on our capital expenditures, cash flows, earnings or competitive position.

Employees

As of

February 2, 2020

, we employed approximately 21,500 persons on a full-time basis and approximately 18,500 persons on a part-time basis. Approximately 2% of our employees were represented for the purpose of collective bargaining by four different unions in the United States. Additional persons, some represented by these four unions, are employed from time to time based upon our manufacturing schedules and retailing seasonal needs. Our collective bargaining agreements generally are for three-year terms. In some international markets, a significant percentage of employees are covered by governmental labor arrangements. We believe that our relations with our employees are good.

Item 1A. Risk Factors

The following risk factors should be read in conjunction with the other information set forth in this Annual Report on Form 10-K when evaluating our business and the forward-looking statements contained within this report. The occurrence of one or more of the circumstances or events described below could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial may occur or become material and may also adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.

A substantial portion of our revenue and gross profit is derived from a small number of large wholesale customers and the loss of any of these customers or significant financial difficulties in their businesses could substantially reduce our revenue.

A few of our customers account for significant portions of our revenue. Sales to our five largest customers were 18.4% of our revenue in 2019 and 18.9% of our revenue in each of 2018 and 2017. No single customer accounted for more than 10% of our revenue in 2019, 2018 or 2017. Collectively, Macy’s, Inc. (“Macy’s”) and J. C. Penney Corporation, Inc. (“J. C. Penney”), two of our ten largest customers in 2019, have closed approximately 275 stores since 2016 and Macy’s announced plans to close 125 additional stores over the next three years. These store closings have resulted and may continue to result in a decrease in the total amount of purchases made by Macy’s and J. C. Penney. A continued decline in purchases made over the next several years could have a materially adverse effect on our United States wholesale business.

We had an agreement with Macy’s pursuant to which Macy’s was the exclusive department store distributor in the United States of men’s sportswear under the

TOMMY HILFIGER

brand; G-III, a licensee of the

TOMMY HILFIGER

brand, had a similar arrangement with Macy’s for women’s sportswear under the

TOMMY HILFIGER

brand. As a result of these strategic alliances, the success of Tommy Hilfiger’s North American men’s wholesale business and its licensed women’s wholesale business with G-III were substantially dependent on these relationships and on the ability of Macy’s to maintain and increase sales of

TOMMY HILFIGER

products. Both exclusive arrangements were terminated effective for the Spring 2019 selling season. We cannot assure you that Macy’s will continue to order the same volume of

TOMMY HILFIGER

products from us, G-III or our other

TOMMY HILFIGER

licensees, or that other department stores will purchase

TOMMY HILFIGER

products in sufficient volume to offset any reduction in sales to Macy’s in the future. This could result in a decline in overall revenue and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.

We do not have long-term agreements with any of our customers and purchases generally occur on an order-by-order basis. A decision by any of our major customers, whether motivated by marketing strategy, competitive conditions, financial difficulties or otherwise, to decrease significantly the amount of merchandise purchased from us or our licensing or other partners, or to change their manner of doing business with us or our licensing or other partners, could substantially reduce our revenue and materially adversely affect our profitability. The retail industry’s recent history has seen a great deal of consolidation, particularly in the United States, and other ownership changes, as well as management changes and store closing programs, and we expect such changes to be ongoing. Store closing programs, such as those described above, decrease the number of stores carrying our products, while the remaining stores may purchase a smaller amount of our products and may reduce the retail floor space designated for our brands. In the future, retailers may further consolidate, undergo restructurings or reorganizations, realign their affiliations or reposition their stores’ target markets or marketing strategies. Any of these types of actions could decrease the number of stores that carry our products or increase the ownership concentration within the retail industry. These changes could decrease our opportunities in the market, increase our reliance on a smaller number of large customers and decrease our negotiating strength with our customers. These factors could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.

We may not be able to continue to develop and grow our Tommy Hilfiger and Calvin Klein businesses.

A significant portion of our business strategy involves growing our Tommy Hilfiger and Calvin Klein businesses. Our achievement of revenue and profitability growth from Tommy Hilfiger and Calvin Klein will depend largely upon our ability to:

•

continue to maintain and enhance the distinctive brand identities of the

TOMMY HILFIGER

and

CALVIN KLEIN

brands;

•

continue to maintain good working relationships with Tommy Hilfiger’s and Calvin Klein’s licensees;

•

continue to enter into new, or renew or extend existing, licensing agreements for the

TOMMY HILFIGER

and

CALVIN KLEIN

brands; and


•

continue to strengthen and expand the Tommy Hilfiger and Calvin Klein businesses.

We cannot assure you that we can successfully execute any of these actions or our growth strategy for these businesses, nor can we assure you that the launch of any additional product lines or businesses by us or our licensees or that the continued offering of these lines will achieve the degree of consistent success necessary to generate profits or positive cash flow. Our ability to successfully carry out our growth strategy may be affected by, among other things, our ability to enhance our relationships with existing customers to obtain additional selling space or add additional product lines, our ability to develop new relationships with retailers, economic and competitive conditions, changes in consumer spending patterns and changes in consumer tastes and style trends. If we fail to continue to develop and grow the Tommy Hilfiger or Calvin Klein business, our financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected.

The success of our Tommy Hilfiger and Calvin Klein

businesses depends on the value of our “TOMMY HILFIGER” and “CALVIN KLEIN” brands and, if the value of either of those brands were to diminish, our business could be adversely affected.

Our success depends on our brands and their value. The

TOMMY HILFIGER

name is integral to the existing Tommy Hilfiger business, as well as to our strategies for continuing to grow and expand the business. Mr. Hilfiger, who remains active in the business, is closely identified with the

TOMMY HILFIGER

brand and any negative perception with respect to Mr. Hilfiger could adversely affect the

TOMMY HILFIGER

brands. In addition, under Mr. Hilfiger’s employment agreement, if his employment is terminated for any reason, his agreement not to compete with the Tommy Hilfiger business will expire two years after such termination. Although Mr. Hilfiger could not use any

TOMMY HILFIGER

trademark in connection with a competitive business, his association with a competitive business could adversely affect the Tommy Hilfiger business. We also have exposure with respect to the

CALVIN KLEIN

brands, which are integral to the existing Calvin Klein business and could be adversely affected if Mr. Klein’s public image or reputation were to be tarnished.

Our business is heavily dependent on the ability and desire of consumers to travel and shop.

Reduced consumer traffic and purchasing, whether in our own retail stores or in the stores of our wholesale customers, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Reductions could result from economic conditions, fuel shortages, increased fuel prices, travel restrictions, travel concerns and other circumstances, including adverse weather conditions, natural disasters, war, terrorist attacks or the perceived threat of war or terrorist attacks. Disease epidemics and other health-related concerns, such as the current COVID-19 outbreak, also could result in (and, in the case of the COVID-19 outbreak, has resulted in) closed stores, reduced consumer traffic and purchasing, as consumers become ill or limit or cease shopping in order to avoid exposure, or governments impose mandatory business closures, travel restrictions or the like to prevent the spread of disease. Additionally, political or civil unrests and demonstrations also could affect consumer traffic and purchasing, as was the case with the recent protests in Hong Kong SAR.

Our U.S. retail store operations are a material contributor to our revenue and earnings. The majority of our United States retail stores are located away from major residential centers or near vacation destinations, making travel a critical factor in their success. These retail businesses historically also have had a significant portion of their revenue and earnings attributable to sales to international tourists. In addition to the factors discussed above, international tourism to the United States could be reduced, as could the extent to which international tourists shop at our retail stores, during times of a strengthening United States dollar, particularly the euro, the Brazilian real, the Canadian dollar, the Mexican peso, the Korean won and the Chinese yuan renminbi. A reduction in international tourist traffic or spending therefore could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. In fact in 2019, we did experience a significant decrease in sales to international tourists, which we believe was attributable in part to the strength of the United States dollar and which negatively impacted sales and earnings for our Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger retail businesses in the United States.

Other factors that could affect the success of our stores include:

•

the location of the store or mall, including the location of a particular store within the mall;

•

the other tenants occupying space at the mall;

•

increased competition in areas where the stores are located;

•

the amount of advertising and promotional dollars spent on attracting consumers to the store or mall;

•

the changing patterns of consumer shopping behavior;

•

increased competition from online retailers; and


•

the diversion of sales from our retail stores due to our digital commerce sites.

Acquisitions may not be successful in achieving intended benefits, cost savings and synergies.

One component of our growth strategy has been to make acquisitions, such as the Tommy Hilfiger, Calvin Klein and Warnaco acquisitions. Prior to completing any acquisition, our management team identifies expected synergies, cost savings and growth opportunities but, due to legal and business limitations, we may not have access to all necessary information. The integration process may be complex, costly and time-consuming. The potential difficulties of integrating the operations of an acquired business and realizing our expectations for an acquisition, including the benefits that may be realized, include, among other things:

•

failure to implement our business plan for the combined business;

•

delays or difficulties in completing the integration of acquired companies or assets;

•

higher than expected costs, lower than expected cost savings or a need to allocate resources to manage unexpected operating difficulties;

•

unanticipated issues in integrating manufacturing, logistics, information, communications and other systems;

•

unanticipated changes in applicable laws and regulations affecting the acquired business;

•

unanticipated changes in the combined business due to potential divestitures or other requirements imposed by antitrust regulators;

•

retaining key customers, suppliers and employees;

•

retaining and obtaining required regulatory approvals, licenses and permits;

•

operating risks inherent in the acquired business;

•

diversion of the attention and resources of management;

•

consumers’ failure to accept product offerings by us or our licensees;

•

assumption of liabilities not identified in due diligence;

•

the impact on our or an acquired business’ internal controls and compliance with the requirements under applicable regulation; and

•

other unanticipated issues, expenses and liabilities.

We have completed acquisitions that have not performed as well as initially expected and cannot assure you that any acquisition will not have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.

Future economic conditions, including volatility in the financial and credit markets may adversely affect our business.

Economic conditions in the past have adversely affected, and in the future may adversely affect, our business, our customers and licensees and their businesses, and our financing and other contractual arrangements, including, for example, as a result of the current COVID-19 outbreak. Such conditions, among other things, have resulted, and in the future may result, in financial difficulties leading to restructurings, bankruptcies, liquidations and other unfavorable events for our customers and licensees, may cause such customers to reduce or discontinue orders of our products and licensed products sold by our licensees, and may result in customers being unable to pay us for products they have purchased from us and licensees being unable to pay us for royalties owed to us. Financial difficulties of customers and licensees may also affect the ability of our customers and licensees to access credit markets or lead to higher credit risk relating to receivables from customers and licensees.

Future volatility in the financial and credit markets, including the recent volatility due, in part, to the current COVID-19 outbreak, could make it more difficult for us to obtain financing or refinance existing debt when the need arises, including upon maturity, which for our senior unsecured credit facilities is currently scheduled for April 2024, or on terms that would be acceptable to us.


Our business is exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and control regulations.

Our Tommy Hilfiger and Calvin Klein businesses each have substantial international components that expose us to significant foreign exchange risk. Our Heritage Brands business also has international components but those components are not significant to the business. Changes in exchange rates between the United States dollar and other currencies can impact our financial results in two ways: a translational impact and a transactional impact.

The translational impact refers to the impact that changes in exchange rates can have on our results of operations and financial position. The functional currencies of our foreign subsidiaries are generally the applicable local currencies. Our consolidated financial statements are presented in United States dollars. The results of operations in local foreign currencies are translated into United States dollars using an average exchange rate over the representative period and our assets and liabilities in local foreign currencies are translated into United States dollars using the closing exchange rate at the balance sheet date. Foreign exchange differences that arise from the translation of our foreign subsidiaries’ assets and liabilities into United States dollars are recorded as foreign currency translation adjustments in other comprehensive (loss) income. Accordingly, our results of operations and other comprehensive (loss) income will be unfavorably impacted during times of a strengthening United States dollar, particularly against the euro, the Brazilian real, the Australian dollar, the Japanese yen, the Korean won, the British pound sterling, the Canadian dollar and the Chinese yuan renminbi, and favorably impacted during times of a weakening United States dollar against those currencies.

A transactional impact on financial results is common for apparel companies operating outside the United States that purchase goods in United States dollars, as is the case with most of our foreign operations. As with translation, our results of operations will be unfavorably impacted during times of a strengthening United States dollar as the increased local currency value of inventory results in a higher cost of goods in local currency when the goods are sold and favorably impacted during times of a weakening United States dollar as the decreased local currency value of inventory results in a lower cost of goods in local currency when the goods are sold. We also have exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates related to certain intercompany transactions and selling, general and administrative (commonly referred to as “SG&A”) expenses. We currently use and plan to continue to use foreign currency forward exchange contracts or other derivative instruments to mitigate the cash flow or market value risks associated with these inventory and intercompany transactions, but we are unable to entirely eliminate these risks.

We are also exposed to foreign exchange risk in connection with our licensing businesses. Most of our licensing agreements require the licensee to report sales to us in the licensee’s local currency but to pay us in United States dollars based on the exchange rate as of the last day of the contractual selling period. Thus, while we are not generally exposed to exchange rate gains and losses between the end of the selling period and the date we collect payment, we are exposed to changes in exchange rates during and up to the last day of the selling period. In addition, certain of our other foreign licensing agreements expose us to changes in exchange rates up to the date we collect payment or convert local currency payments into United States dollars. As a result, during times of a strengthening United States dollar, our foreign royalty revenue will be negatively impacted, and during times of a weakening United States dollar, our foreign royalty revenue will be favorably impacted.

We also have exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates related to our €950 million aggregate principal amount of euro-denominated senior notes. During times of a strengthening United States dollar against the euro, we could be required to use a lower amount of our cash flows from operations to pay interest and make long-term debt repayments on our euro-denominated senior notes, whereas during times of a weakening United States dollar against the euro, we could be required to use a greater amount of our cash flows from operations to pay interest and make long-term debt repayments on these notes.

We conduct business, directly or through licensees and other partners, in countries that are or have been subject to exchange rate control regulations and have, as a result, experienced difficulties in receiving payments owed to us when due, with amounts left unpaid for extended periods of time. Although the amounts to date have been immaterial to our results, as our international businesses grow and if controls are enacted or enforced in additional countries, there can be no assurance that such controls would not have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.


Our level of debt could impair our financial condition and ability to operate.

We had outstanding as of

February 2, 2020

an aggregate principal amount of $2.725 billion of indebtedness under our senior unsecured credit facilities, our senior unsecured notes and our unsecured debentures. In March 2020, we increased our aggregate borrowings outstanding under our senior unsecured revolving credit facilities, other short-term revolving credit facilities and unsecured commercial paper note program from $50 million at February 2, 2020 to approximately $930 million, in order to increase our cash position and preserve financial flexibility in responding to the impacts of the COVID-19 outbreak on our business. Our level of debt could have important consequences to investors, including:

•

requiring a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations be used for the payment of interest on our debt, thereby reducing the funds available to us for our operations or other capital needs;

•

limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate because our available cash flow after paying principal and interest on our debt may not be sufficient to make the capital and other expenditures necessary to address these changes;

•

increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions because, during periods in which we experience lower earnings and cash flow, such as during the current COVID-19 outbreak, we will be required to devote a proportionally greater amount of our cash flow to paying principal and interest on our debt;

•

limiting our ability to obtain additional financing in the future to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, contributions to our pension plans and general corporate requirements;

•

placing us at a competitive disadvantage to other relatively less leveraged competitors that have more cash flow available to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, share repurchases, dividend payments, contributions to pension plans and general corporate requirements; and

•

with respect to any borrowings we make at variable interest rates, including under our senior unsecured credit facilities, leaving us vulnerable to increases in interest rates to the extent the borrowings are not subject to an interest rate swap agreement.

In addition, our interest rate swap agreements as well as a portion of the borrowings under our senior unsecured credit facilities that have variable interest rates are tied to the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”). In July 2017, the Financial Conduct Authority in the United Kingdom announced that it would phase out LIBOR as a benchmark by the end of 2021. It is unclear whether new methods of calculating LIBOR will be established such that it continues to exist after 2021, or whether different benchmark rates used to price indebtedness will develop. We cannot predict the consequences and timing of these developments, which could include an increase in interest expense and may also require the amendment of contracts that reference LIBOR.

We primarily use foreign suppliers for our products and raw materials, which poses risks to our business operations.

The majority of our apparel, footwear and accessories are produced by and purchased or procured from independent manufacturers located in countries in Asia, South America, Europe, the Middle East, North America, Africa, Central America and the Caribbean. Although no single supplier or country is or is expected to become critical to our production needs, any of the following could materially and adversely affect our ability to produce or deliver our products and, as a result, have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations:

•

political or labor instability or military conflict involving any of the countries in which we, our contractors, or our suppliers operate, which could cause a delay in the transportation of our products and raw materials to us and an increase in transportation costs;

•

heightened terrorism security concerns, which could subject imported or exported goods to additional, more frequent or more thorough inspections, leading to delays in deliveries or impoundments of goods for extended periods or could result in decreased scrutiny by customs officials for counterfeit goods, leading to lost sales, increased costs for our anti-counterfeiting measures and damage to the reputation of our brands;

•

a significant decrease in availability or increase in cost of raw materials, including commodities (particularly cotton), or the ability to use raw materials produced in a country that is a major provider due to political, human rights, labor, environmental, animal cruelty or other concerns

•

a significant decrease in factory and shipping capacity or increase in demand for such capacity;

•

a significant increase in wage and shipping costs;


•

natural disasters, which could result in closed factories and scarcity of raw materials;

•

disease epidemics and health related concerns, such as the current COVID-19 outbreak, which could result in (and in the case of the COVID-19 outbreak, has resulted in certain of the following) closed factories, reduced workforces, scarcity of raw materials and scrutiny or embargoing of goods produced in infected areas;

•

migration and development of manufacturers, which could affect where our products are or are planned to be produced;

•

imposition of regulations, quotas and safeguards relating to imports and our ability to adjust timely to changes in trade regulations, which, among other things, could limit our ability to produce products in cost-effective countries that have the labor and expertise needed; and

•

imposition of duties, taxes and other charges on imports.

The United States government imposed tariffs in 2019 and 2018 on a variety of imports from China into the United States, including certain categories of apparel, footwear and accessories. These additional tariffs, which were included in a trade agreement signed by the United States and China in January 2020, are not expected to be decreased, at least not in the near term, and in the future the United States could impose additional tariffs or increase existing tariffs on goods imported from China into the United States. China is the largest sourcing country of apparel, footwear and accessories for us globally and for most of our licensees. We imported approximately $215 million of inventory into the United States from China in 2019. Accordingly, any tariffs on apparel, footwear and accessories imported from China into the United States result in an increase in our cost of goods sold for that product. We are looking at alternative sourcing options but we may not be able to shift production of inventory bound for the United States from China to other countries. In addition, higher costs in sourcing from other countries, including because others in the industry are looking to move production for the same reason, may make the move price-prohibitive. We may not be able to pass the entire cost increase resulting from the tariffs onto consumers or could choose not to. Any increase in prices to consumers could have an adverse impact on our direct sales to consumers, as well as sales by our wholesale customers and our licensees. Any adverse impact on such sales or increase in our cost of goods sold could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.

If our manufacturers, the manufacturers used by our licensees, or our licensees themselves fail to use legal and ethical business practices, our business could suffer.

We require our manufacturers, the manufacturers used by our licensees and the licensees themselves to operate in compliance with applicable laws, rules and regulations regarding working conditions, employment practices and environmental compliance. Additionally, we impose upon our business partners operating guidelines that require additional obligations in those areas in order to promote ethical business practices. We audit, or have third parties audit, the operations of these independent parties to determine compliance. We were a member of the Accord on Fire and Building Safety in Bangladesh and are a member of its successor, the mission of each of which is to improve fire and building safety in Bangladesh’s apparel factories. We also collaborate with factories, suppliers, industry participants and other engaged stakeholders to improve the lives of our factory workers and others in our sourcing communities. However, we do not control our manufacturers, the manufacturers used by our licensees, or our licensees themselves, or their labor, manufacturing and other business practices.

If any of these manufacturers or licensees violates labor, environmental, building and fire safety, or other laws or implements labor, manufacturing or other business practices that are generally regarded as unethical, the shipment of finished products to us could be interrupted, orders could be canceled and relationships could be terminated. Further, we could be prohibited from importing goods by governmental authorities. In addition, we could be the focus of adverse publicity and our reputation could be damaged. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our revenue and, consequently, our results of operations.

We are dependent on third parties to source and manufacture our products and any disruption in our relationships with these parties or in their businesses may materially adversely affect our businesses.

We rely upon independent third parties for the manufacturing of the vast majority of our apparel, footwear and accessories. A manufacturer’s failure to ship products to us in a timely manner, which has occurred, and may occur in the future, as a result of the current COVID-19 outbreak, or to meet required quality standards could cause us to miss the delivery date requirements of our customers for those products. As a result, customers could cancel their orders, refuse to accept deliveries or demand reduced prices. Any of these actions taken by our customers could have a material adverse effect on our revenue and, consequently, our results of operations.


We use third party buying offices for a portion of our product sourcing. Any interruption in the operations of these buying offices, or the failure of these buying offices to perform effectively their services for us, could result in material delays, reductions of shipments and increased costs. Furthermore, such events could harm our wholesale and retail relationships. Any disruption in our relationships with these buying offices or in their businesses could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows, business, financial condition and results of operations.

We are dependent on a limited number of distribution facilities. If one becomes inoperable, our business, financial condition and operating results could be negatively impacted.

We operate a limited number of distribution facilities and also engage independently operated distribution facilities around the world to warehouse and ship products to our customers and our retail stores, as well as perform related logistics services. Our ability to meet the needs of our wholesale customers and of our retail stores depends on the proper operation of our primary facilities. If any of our primary facilities were to shut down or otherwise become inoperable or inaccessible, including as a result of disease epidemics and other health-related concerns, such as the current COVID-19 outbreak, we could have a substantial loss of inventory or disruptions of deliveries to our customers and our stores, incur significantly higher costs or experience longer lead times associated with the distribution of our products during the time it takes to reopen or replace the facility. This could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.

A portion of our revenue is dependent on royalties and licensing.

The operating profit associated with our royalty, advertising and other revenue is significant because the operating expenses directly associated with administering and monitoring an individual licensing or similar agreement are minimal. Therefore, the loss of a significant licensee, whether due to the termination or expiration of the relationship, the cessation of the licensee’s operations or otherwise (including as a result of financial difficulties of the licensee), without an equivalent replacement, or a significant decline in our licensees’ sales, for example as occurred as a result of the current COVID-19 outbreak, could materially impact our profitability.

While we generally have significant control over our licensees’ products and advertising, we rely on them for, among other things, operational and financial controls over their businesses. Our licensees’ failure to successfully market licensed products or our inability to replace our existing licensees could materially and adversely affect our revenue both directly from reduced royalty, advertising and other revenue received and indirectly from reduced sales of our other products. Risks are also associated with our licensees’ ability to obtain capital, execute their business plans, timely deliver quality products, manage their labor relations, maintain relationships with their suppliers, manage their credit risk effectively and maintain relationships with their customers.

Our licensing business makes us susceptible to the actions of third parties over whom we have limited control.

We rely on our licensees to preserve the value of our brands. Although we attempt to protect our brands through, among other things, approval rights over design, production quality, packaging, merchandising, distribution, advertising and promotion of our products, we cannot assure you that we can control our licensees’ use of our brands. The misuse of our brands by a licensee could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

We may be unable to protect our trademarks and other intellectual property rights.

Our trademarks and other intellectual property rights are important to our success and our competitive position. We are susceptible to others imitating our products and infringing on our intellectual property rights, especially with respect to the

TOMMY HILFIGER

and

CALVIN KLEIN

brands, as they enjoy significant worldwide consumer recognition and the generally premium pricing of

TOMMY HILFIGER

and

CALVIN KLEIN

brand products creates additional incentive for counterfeiters and infringers. Imitation or counterfeiting of our products or infringement of our intellectual property rights could diminish the value of our brands or otherwise adversely affect our revenue. We cannot assure you that the actions we take to establish and protect our trademarks and other intellectual property rights will be adequate to prevent imitation of our products by others. We cannot assure you that other third parties will not seek to invalidate our trademarks or block sales of our products as a violation of their own trademarks and intellectual property rights. In addition, we cannot assure you that others will not assert rights in, or ownership of, trademarks and other intellectual property rights of ours or in marks that are similar to ours or marks that we license or market or that we will be able to successfully resolve these types of conflicts to our satisfaction. In some cases, there may be trademark owners who have prior rights to our marks because the laws of certain foreign countries may not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the United States. In other cases, there may be holders who have


prior rights to similar trademarks. We have in the past been and currently are involved both domestically and internationally in proceedings relating to a company’s claim of prior rights to some of our trademarks or marks similar to some of our brands.

We face intense competition in the apparel industry.

Competition is intense in the apparel industry. We compete with numerous domestic and foreign designers, brand owners, manufacturers and retailers of apparel, accessories and footwear, some of which have greater resources than we do. We also face increased competition from online retailers in the digital channel, which is characterized by low barriers to entry. In addition, in certain instances, we compete directly with our wholesale customers, as they also sell their own private label products in their stores and online. We compete within the apparel industry primarily on the basis of:

•

anticipating and responding to changing consumer tastes, demands and shopping preferences in a timely manner and developing attractive, quality products;

•

maintaining favorable brand recognition and relevance, including through digital brand engagement and online and social media presence;

•

appropriately pricing products and creating an acceptable value proposition for customers;

•

providing strong and effective marketing support;

•

ensuring product availability and optimizing supply chain efficiencies with third party manufacturers and retailers; and

•

obtaining sufficient retail floor space at retail and effective presentation of our products at retail, on digital commerce sites operated by our department store customers and pure play digital commerce retailers, and on our digital commerce sites.

The failure to compete effectively or to keep pace with rapidly changing markets could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Our profitability may decline as a result of increasing pressure on margins.

The apparel industry, particularly in the United States (our largest market), is subject to significant pricing pressure caused by many factors, including intense competition, consolidation in the retail industry, pressure from retailers and changes in consumer demand including, for example, as a result of the current COVID-19 outbreak. These factors may cause us to reduce our sales prices to retailers and consumers, which could cause our profitability to decline if we are unable to appropriately manage inventory levels or offset price reductions with sufficient reductions in product costs or operating expenses. This could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, liquidity and financial condition.

If we are unable to manage our inventory effectively and accurately forecast demand for our products, our results of operations could be materially adversely affected.

We have made and continue to make investments in our supply chain management systems and processes that enable us to respond more rapidly to changes in sales trends and consumer demands and enhance our ability to manage inventory. However, we cannot assure you that we will be able to anticipate and respond successfully to changing consumer tastes and style trends or economic conditions and, as a result, we may not be able to manage inventory levels to meet our future order requirements. If we are unable to or fail to accurately forecast consumer demand, including, for example, as a result of the current COVID-19 outbreak, we may experience excess inventory levels or a shortage of product required to meet demand. Inventory levels in excess of consumer demand may result in inventory write-downs and the sale of excess inventory at discounted prices, which could have a material adverse effect on the reputation of our brands and our profitability. If we underestimate consumer demand for our products, we may not have sufficient inventories of product to meet consumer requirements in a timely manner, which could result in lost revenues, as well as damage to our reputation and relationships.

We rely significantly on information technology. Our business and reputation could be adversely impacted if our computer systems, or systems of our business partners and service providers, are disrupted or cease to operate effectively or if we or they are subject to a data security or privacy breach.

Our ability to manage and operate our business effectively depends significantly on information technology systems, including systems operated by third parties and us and systems that communicate with third parties, including website and mobile applications through which we communicate with our consumers and our employees. We process, transmit, store and maintain information about consumers, employees, and other individuals in the ordinary course of business, including through our digital


commerce operations. This includes personally identifiable information protected under applicable laws and the collection and processing of customers’ credit and debit card numbers and reliance on systems maintained by third parties with whom we contract to provide payment processing. The failure of any system to operate effectively or disruption in these systems, which may occur as a result of circumstances beyond our control including fire, natural disasters, power outages and systems disruptions, could require significant remediation costs and adversely impact our operations.

We take, and require third party providers to take, measures to protect data but have no control over their efforts and are limited in our ability to assess their systems and processes. Furthermore, while we invest, and believe our service providers invest, considerable resources in protecting systems and information, we all are still subject to security events, including but not limited to cybercrimes and cybersecurity attacks, such as those perpetrated by sophisticated and well-resourced bad actors attempting to disrupt operations or access or steal data. Security events may not be detected for an extended period of time, which could compound the scope and extent of the damages and problems. Such security events could disrupt our business, severely damage our reputation and our relationship with consumers, and expose us to risks of litigation and liability, which may not be covered by insurance or may result in costs in excess of the insurance coverage we maintain.

We regularly implement new systems and hardware and are currently undertaking a major multi-year SAP S/4 implementation to upgrade of our platforms and systems worldwide. The implementation of new software and hardware involves risks and uncertainties that could cause disruptions, delays or deficiencies in the design, implementation or application of these systems including:

•

adversely impacting our operations;

•

increased costs;

•

disruptions in our ability to effectively source, sell or ship our products;

•

delays in collecting payments from our customers; and

•

adversely affecting our ability to timely report our financial results.

Our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected as a result of these implementations. In addition, intended improvements may not be realized. Our business partners and service providers face the same risks, which could also adversely impact our business and operations.

We are subject to data privacy and security laws and regulations, the number and complexity of which are increasing globally. We may be the subject of enforcement or other legal actions despite our compliance efforts.

We collect, use, store, and otherwise process or rely upon access to data, including personally identifiable information, of consumers, employees, and other individuals in the daily conduct of our business, including through our digital commerce operations. There have been significant developments in the area of data privacy and cybersecurity law and regulation. Significant new laws, such as the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation, the Brazilian General Data Protection Law and the California Consumer Privacy Act, are continuously being proposed and enacted around the world. These laws and regulations have caused and could continue to cause us to change the way we operate, including in a less efficient manner, in order to comply with local requirements. We have a privacy compliance program but our compliance efforts are not an assurance that we will not be the subject of regulatory or other legal actions. We could expend significant management and associate time and incur significant cost investigating and defending ourselves against the claims in any such matter, which matters also could result in us being the subject of significant fines, judgments or settlements. In addition, any such claim could give rise to significant reputational damage, whether or not we are ultimately successful in defending ourselves.

The loss of members of our executive management and other key employees could have a material adverse effect on our business.

We depend on the services and management experience of our executive officers, who have substantial experience and expertise in our business. We also depend on other key executives in various areas of our businesses and operations. Competition for qualified personnel in the apparel industry is intense and competitors may use aggressive tactics to recruit our key employees. The unexpected loss of services of one or more of these individuals could have a material adverse effect on us.


A significant shift in the relative sources of our earnings, adverse decisions of tax authorities or changes in tax treaties, laws, rules or interpretations could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flow.

We have direct operations in many countries and the applicable tax rates vary by jurisdiction. As a result, our overall effective tax rate could be materially affected by the relative level of earnings in the various taxing jurisdictions to which our earnings are subject. In addition, the tax laws and regulations in the countries where we operate may be subject to change. Moreover, there may be changes from time to time in interpretation and enforcement of tax law. As a result, we may pay additional taxes if tax rates increase or if tax laws, regulations or treaties in the jurisdictions where we operate are modified by the authorities in an adverse manner.

In addition, various national and local taxing authorities periodically examine us and our subsidiaries. The resolution of an examination or audit may result in us paying more than the amount that we may have reserved for a particular tax matter, which could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows, business, financial condition and results of operations for any affected reporting period.

We and our subsidiaries are engaged in a number of intercompany transactions. Although we believe that these transactions reflect arm’s length terms and that proper transfer pricing documentation is in place, which should be respected for tax purposes, the transfer prices and conditions may be scrutinized by local tax authorities, which could result in additional tax liabilities.

If we are unable to fully utilize our deferred tax assets, our profitability could be reduced.

Our deferred income tax assets are valuable to us. These assets include tax loss and foreign tax credit carryforwards in various jurisdictions. Realization of deferred tax assets is based on a number of factors, including whether there will be adequate levels of taxable income in future periods to offset the tax loss and foreign tax credit carryforwards in jurisdictions where such assets have arisen. Valuation allowances are recorded in order to reduce the deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized in the future. In assessing the adequacy of our valuation allowances, we consider various factors including reversal of deferred tax liabilities, forecasted future taxable income and potential tax planning strategies. These factors could reduce the value of the deferred tax assets, which could have a material effect on our profitability.

Volatility in securities markets, interest rates and other economic factors could increase substantially our defined benefit pension costs and liabilities.

We have significant obligations under our defined benefit pension plans. The funded status of our pension plans is dependent on many factors, including returns on invested plan assets and the discount rate used to measure pension obligations. Unfavorable returns on plan assets, which, for example, may result from recent market volatility due, in part, to the COVID-19 outbreak, a lower discount rate or unfavorable changes in the applicable laws or regulations could materially change the timing and amount of pension funding requirements, which could reduce cash available for our business.

Our operating performance also may be significantly impacted by the amount of expense recorded for our pension plans. Pension expense recorded throughout the year is calculated using actuarial valuations that incorporate assumptions and estimates about financial market, economic and demographic conditions. Differences between estimated and actual results give rise to gains and losses that are recorded immediately in pension expense, generally in the fourth quarter of the year. These gains and losses can be significant and can create volatility in our operating results.

Our balance sheet includes a significant amount of intangible assets and goodwill. A decline in the estimated fair value of an intangible asset or of a reporting unit could result in an impairment charge recorded in our operating results, which could be material.

Goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested for impairment annually and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate the carrying amount may be impaired. Also, we review our amortizable intangible assets for impairment if an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate the carrying amount may not be recoverable. If the carrying amount of our goodwill or another intangible asset were to exceed its fair value, the asset would be written down to its fair value, with the impairment charge recognized as a noncash expense in our operating results. Adverse changes in future market conditions or weaker operating results compared to our expectations, including, for example, as a result of the current COVID-19 outbreak, may impact our projected cash flows and estimates of weighted average cost of capital, which could result in a potentially material impairment charge if we are unable to recover the carrying value of our goodwill and other intangible assets.


As of

February 2, 2020

, we had approximately $3.678 billion of goodwill and $3.481 billion of other identifiable intangible assets on our balance sheet, which together represented 53% of our total assets. No impairment was recorded in 2019 based on our annual goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets impairment tests. However, during the fourth quarter of 2019, we entered into a definitive agreement to sell our Speedo North America business, which prompted the need for us to perform an interim impairment assessment of our

Speedo

perpetual license right. As a result of this interim test, the perpetual license right was determined to be impaired and an impairment charge of $116.4 million was recorded. The Speedo transaction was also a triggering event that prompted the need for us to perform an interim goodwill impairment test for the Heritage Brands Wholesale reporting unit, the reporting unit that includes the Speedo North America business. No goodwill impairment resulted from this interim test.

Our balance sheet includes a significant amount of long-lived assets in our retail stores, including operating lease right-of-use assets and property, plant and equipment. A decline in the current and projected cash flows in our retail stores could result in impairment charges, which could be material.

Long-lived assets, such as operating lease right-of-use assets and property, plant and equipment in our retail stores, are tested for impairment if an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate the carrying amount may not be recoverable. If the carrying amount of a long-lived asset were to exceed its fair value, the asset would be written down to its fair value and an impairment charge recognized as a noncash expense in our operating results. Adverse changes in future market conditions or weaker operating results compared to our expectations, including, for example, as a result of the current COVID-19 outbreak, may impact our projected cash flows and estimates of weighted average cost of capital, which could result in a potentially material impairment charge if we are unable to recover the carrying value of our long-lived assets.

Provisions in our certificate of incorporation and our by-laws and Delaware General Corporation Law could make it more difficult to acquire us and may reduce the market price of our common stock.

Our certificate of incorporation and by-laws contain provisions requiring stockholders who seek to introduce proposals at a stockholders meeting or nominate a person to become a director to provide us with advance notice and certain information, as well as meet certain ownership criteria; permitting the Board of Directors to fill vacancies on the Board; and authorizing the Board to issue shares of preferred stock without approval of our stockholders. These provisions could have the effect of deterring changes of control.

In addition, Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law imposes restrictions on mergers and other business combinations between us and any holder of 15% or more of our common stock. The existence of this provision may have an anti-takeover effect with respect to transactions not approved in advance by the Board.

The United Kingdom’s withdrawal from the European Union could harm our business and financial results.

Voters in the United Kingdom approved a referendum to withdraw from the European Union (commonly referred to as “Brexit”). The United Kingdom formally withdrew from the European Union on January 31, 2020 and is now in a period of transition until December 31, 2020. During the transition period, the United Kingdom’s trading relationship with the European Union is expected to remain largely the same while the two parties negotiate a trade agreement as well as other aspects of the United Kingdom’s relationship with the European Union. The uncertainty surrounding the terms of the United Kingdom’s future relationship with the European Union after December 31, 2020 and its consequences could adversely impact consumer and investor confidence and the level of consumer purchases of discretionary items and retail products, including our products. The eventual terms upon which the withdrawal occurs (which could leave the United Kingdom without a trade agreement with the European Union) also could significantly disrupt the free movement of goods, services and people between the United Kingdom and the European Union and may result in increased legal and regulatory complexities and higher costs of conducting business in Europe. Volatility in the value of the British pound sterling, the euro and other European currencies could also result. Any of these effects, among others, could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.

ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES

___________________

(1)

Our Board of Directors has authorized over time since 2015 an aggregate $2.0 billion stock repurchase program through June 3, 2023, of which $750 million was authorized on March 26, 2019. Repurchases under the program may be made from time to time over the period through open market purchases, accelerated share repurchase programs, privately negotiated transactions or other methods, as we deem appropriate. Purchases are made based on a variety of factors, such as price, corporate requirements and overall market conditions, applicable legal requirements and limitations, trading restrictions under our insider trading policy and other relevant factors. The program may be modified by the Board of Directors, including to increase or decrease the repurchase limitation or extend, suspend, or terminate the program, at any time, without prior notice.

(2)

Our 2006 Stock Incentive Plan provides us with the right to deduct or withhold, or require employees to remit to us, an amount sufficient to satisfy any applicable tax withholding requirements applicable to stock-based compensation awards. To the extent permitted, employees may elect to satisfy all or part of such withholding requirements by tendering previously owned shares or by having us withhold shares having a fair market value equal to the minimum statutory tax withholding rate that could be imposed on the transaction. Included in this table are shares withheld during the

fourth quarter of 2019

principally in connection with the settlement of restricted stock units to satisfy tax withholding requirements, in addition to the shares repurchased as part of the stock repurchase program discussed above.

Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

OVERVIEW

The following discussion and analysis is intended to help you understand us, our operations and our financial performance. It should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes, which are included elsewhere in this report.

We are one of the largest global apparel companies in the world and, in March 2020, we marked our 100-year anniversary as a listed company on the New York Stock Exchange. We manage a diversified brand portfolio, including

TOMMY HILFIGER

,

CALVIN KLEIN

,

Van Heusen

,

IZOD

,

ARROW

,

Speedo

(licensed in perpetuity for North America and the Caribbean),

Warner’s

,

Olga

,

True&Co.

and

Geoffrey Beene

. Our brand portfolio also consists of various other owned, licensed and, to a lesser extent, private label brands. We entered into a definitive agreement on January 9, 2020 to sell our Speedo North America business to Pentland and, upon closing of the sale, we will no longer license the

Speedo

trademark. The Speedo transaction is expected to close in the first quarter of 2020. The closing is subject to customary closing conditions, including clearance under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, which has been received.

Our business strategy is to position our brands to sell globally at various price points and in multiple channels of distribution. This enables us to offer products to a broad range of consumers, while minimizing competition among our brands and reducing our reliance on any one demographic group, product category, price point, distribution channel or region. We also license the use of our trademarks to third parties and joint ventures for product categories and in regions where we believe our licensees’ expertise can better serve our brands.

Our revenue was $9.9 billion in 2019, of which over 50% was generated outside of the United States. Our global lifestyle brands,

TOMMY HILFIGER

and

CALVIN KLEIN

, together generated approximately 85% of our revenue.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

COVID-19 Outbreak

The COVID-19 outbreak is having a significant impact on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations in 2020.

Virus-related concerns, reduced travel, temporary store closures and government-imposed restrictions have resulted in sharply reduced traffic and consumer spending trends and sales stoppages in our retail stores and in the stores of our wholesale customers in virtually all key markets during the first quarter of 2020. In addition, our supply chain had been disrupted and may experience future disruptions as a result of either closed factories or factories with reduced workforces. Our licensees’ sales and their supply chain are also being negatively impacted by the COVID-19 outbreak, which in turn negatively impacts our royalty revenue.

There is significant uncertainty about the duration and extent of the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak; however, there will be a significant negative impact to our 2020 revenue and net income.

Further, our fourth quarter of 2019 earnings were negatively impacted compared to the prior year period by $22 million of additional inventory reserves that we recorded in anticipation of the lower sales trends projected in 2020 as a result of the onset of the COVID-19 outbreak.

Operations Overview

We generate net sales from (i) the wholesale distribution to retailers, franchisees, licensees and distributors of dress shirts, neckwear, sportswear (casual apparel), jeanswear, performance apparel, intimate apparel, underwear, swimwear, swim products, handbags, accessories, footwear and other related products under owned and licensed trademarks, including through digital commerce sites operated by our wholesale partners and pure play digital commerce retailers, and (ii) the sale of certain of these products through (a) approximately 1,830 Company-operated free-standing retail store locations worldwide under our

TOMMY HILFIGER

,

CALVIN KLEIN

and certain of our heritage brands trademarks, (b) approximately 1,500 Company-operated shop-in-shop/concession locations worldwide under our

TOMMY HILFIGER

and

CALVIN KLEIN

trademarks, and (c) digital commerce sites in over 30 countries under our

TOMMY HILFIGER

and

CALVIN KLEIN

trademarks and in the United States through our directly operated digital commerce sites for

Speedo

,

True&Co

.,

Van Heusen

, and

IZOD

, as well as our


styleBureau

.com site. Additionally, we generate royalty, advertising and other revenue from fees for licensing the use of our trademarks. We manage our operations through our operating divisions, which are presented as

six

reportable segments: (i) Tommy Hilfiger North America; (ii) Tommy Hilfiger International; (iii) Calvin Klein North America; (iv) Calvin Klein International; (v) Heritage Brands Wholesale; and (vi) Heritage Brands Retail.

We have entered into the following transactions that have impacted our results of operations and the comparability among the years, including our 2020 expectations as compared to 2019, as discussed below:

•

We entered into a definitive agreement on January 9, 2020 to sell our Speedo North America business to Pentland for $170 million in cash, subject to a working capital adjustment, as described above. We recorded a pre-tax noncash loss of $142 million in the fourth quarter of 2019 related to the Speedo transaction and expected deconsolidation of the net assets of the business, consisting of (i) a noncash impairment of our perpetual license right for the

Speedo

trademark and (ii) a noncash loss to reduce the carrying value of the business to its estimated fair value, less costs to sell.

•

We entered into agreements on July 3, 2019 to terminate early the licenses for the global Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger North America socks and hosiery businesses in order to consolidate the socks and hosiery businesses for all of our brands in the United States and Canada in a newly formed joint venture, PVH Legwear, in which we own a 49% economic interest, and to bring in-house the international Calvin Klein socks and hosiery wholesale businesses. PVH Legwear was formed with a wholly owned subsidiary of our former Heritage Brands socks and hosiery licensee, and licenses from us the rights to distribute and sell

TOMMY HILFIGER

,

CALVIN KLEIN

,

IZOD

,

Van Heusen

and

Warner’s

socks and hosiery beginning in December 2019. We recorded a pre-tax charge of $60 million during 2019 in connection with these agreements.

•

We completed the Australia and TH CSAP acquisitions in the second quarter of 2019. The Australia acquisition closed on May 31, 2019. Prior to the closing, we, along with Gazal, jointly owned and managed a joint venture, PVH Australia, which licensed and operated businesses under the

TOMMY HILFIGER

,

CALVIN KLEIN

and

Van Heusen

brands, along with other owned and licensed brands. PVH Australia came under our full control as a result of the Australia acquisition and we now operate directly those businesses. The aggregate net purchase price for the shares acquired was $59 million, net of cash acquired and after taking into account the proceeds from the divestiture to a third party of an office building and warehouse owned by Gazal in June 2019. We completed the TH CSAP acquisition on July 1, 2019 for $74 million, as a result of which we now operate directly the Tommy Hilfiger retail business in the Central and Southeast Asia market. Please see Note 3, “Acquisitions,” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this report for further discussion.

In connection with the Australia and TH CSAP acquisitions, we recorded an aggregate net pre-tax gain of $83 million during 2019, including (i) a noncash gain of $113 million to write up our existing equity investments in Gazal and PVH Australia to fair value, partially offset by (ii) $21 million of pre-tax costs, primarily consisting of noncash valuation adjustments and one-time expenses recorded on our equity investments in Gazal and PVH Australia prior to the Australia acquisition closing, and (iii) a $9 million expense recorded in interest expense, net resulting from the remeasurement of our mandatorily redeemable non-controlling interest that was recognized in connection with the Australia acquisition.

•

We entered into a licensing agreement on May 30, 2019 with G-III for the design, production and wholesale distribution of

CALVIN KLEIN JEANS

women’s jeanswear collections in the United States and Canada, which resulted in the discontinuation of our directly operated Calvin Klein North America women’s jeanswear wholesale business in 2019.

•

We refinanced on April 29, 2019 our senior credit facilities and recorded pre-tax debt modification and extinguishment charges of $5 million. Please see the section entitled “Liquidity and Capital Resources” below for further discussion.

•

We closed our

TOMMY HILFIGER

flagship and anchor stores in the United States (the “TH U.S. store closures”)

in the first quarter of 2019

and recorded pre-tax costs of $55 million, primarily consisting of noncash lease asset impairments. Please see Note 12, “Fair Value Measurements,” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this report for further discussion of the noncash lease asset impairments.

•

We announced on January 10, 2019 a restructuring in connection with strategic changes for our

Calvin Klein business (the “Calvin Klein restructuring”). The strategic changes included (i) the closure of the

CALVIN KLEIN 205 W39 NYC

brand (formerly

Calvin Klein Collection

), (ii) the closure of the flagship store on Madison Avenue in New York, New


York

(collectively with (i), the “CK Collection closure”)

, (iii) the restructuring of the Calvin Klein creative and design teams globally, and (iv) the consolidation of operations for the men’s Calvin Klein Sportswear and Calvin Klein Jeans businesses. All costs related to this restructuring were incurred by the end of 2019.

We recorded pre-tax costs of $103 million during 2019 in connection with the Calvin Klein restructuring, consisting of a $30 million noncash lease asset impairment resulting from the closure of the flagship store on Madison Avenue in New York, New York, $26 million of contract termination and other costs, $26 million of severance, $9 million of other noncash asset impairments and $13 million of inventory markdowns

. We recorded pre-tax costs of $41 million in the fourth quarter of 2018, consisting of $27 million of severance, $7 million of noncash asset impairments, $4 million of contract termination and other costs and $2 million of inventory markdowns. Please see

Note 18

, “

Exit Activity Costs

,” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this report for further discussion.

•

We acquired on April 20, 2018 the

Geoffrey Beene

tradename from Geoffrey Beene for $17 million, of which $16 million was paid in cash. Prior to the acquisition, we had licensed the rights to design, market and distribute

Geoffrey Beene

dress shirts and neckwear from Geoffrey Beene.

•

We issued on December 21, 2017 €600 million euro-denominated principal amount of 3 1/8% senior notes due December 15, 2027. We redeemed on January 5, 2018 our $700 million principal amount of 4 1/2% senior notes due December 15, 2022 (using the proceeds of the senior notes due December 15, 2027) and recorded pre-tax debt extinguishment charges of $24 million. Please see the section entitled “Liquidity and Capital Resources” below for further discussion.

•

We amended on December 20, 2017 Mr. Tommy Hilfiger’s employment agreement, pursuant to which we made a cash buyout of a portion of the future payment obligation (the “Mr. Hilfiger amendment”). We recorded pre-tax charges of $83 million in 2017 in connection with the amendment.

•

We restructured our supply chain relationship with Li & Fung Trading Limited (“Li & Fung”) in a transaction that closed on September 30, 2017. Our non-exclusive buying agency agreement with Li & Fung was terminated in connection with this transaction (the “Li & Fung termination”). We recorded pre-tax charges of $54 million in 2017 in connection with the termination.

•

We acquired on September 1, 2017 the Tommy Hilfiger and Calvin Klein wholesale and concessions businesses in Belgium and Luxembourg from a former agent (the “Belgian acquisition”) for $12 million. As a result of this acquisition, we now operate directly our Tommy Hilfiger and Calvin Klein businesses in this region.

•

We acquired on March 30, 2017 True & Co., a direct-to-consumer intimate apparel digital-centric retailer, for $28 million, net of $400,000 of cash acquired. This acquisition enabled us to participate further in the fast-growing online channel and provided a platform to increase innovation, data-driven decisions and speed in the way we serve our consumers across our channels of distribution.

•

We completed the relocation of our Tommy Hilfiger office in New York in 2017 and recorded related pre-tax charges of $19 million, including noncash depreciation expense.

•

We purchased a group annuity in 2017 for certain participants of our retirement plans under which certain of our benefit obligations were transferred to an insurer. We recorded a pre-tax loss of $9 million in connection with the noncash settlement of such benefit obligations.

•

We acquired on April 13, 2016 the 55% ownership interests in our former joint venture for

TOMMY HILFIGER

in China that we did not already own (the “TH China acquisition”). As a result of the TH China acquisition, we now operate directly our Tommy Hilfiger business in this market. We recorded pre-tax charges of $24 million and $27 million in 2018 and 2017, respectively, primarily consisting of noncash amortization of short-lived assets.

Our Tommy Hilfiger and Calvin Klein businesses each have substantial international components that expose us to significant foreign exchange risk. Our Heritage Brands business also has international components but those components are not significant to the business. Our results of operations in local foreign currencies are translated into United States dollars using an average exchange rate over the representative period. Accordingly, our results of operations are unfavorably impacted during times of a strengthening United States dollar against the foreign currencies in which we generate significant revenue and earnings and favorably impacted during times of a weakening United States dollar against those currencies. Over 50% of our 2019 revenue was subject to foreign currency translation. The United States dollar strengthened against most major currencies


in the latter part of 2018 and in 2019, particularly the euro, which is the foreign currency in which we transact the most business. As a result, our 2019 revenue and net income decreased by approximately $215 million and $25 million, respectively, as compared to 2018 due to the impact of foreign currency translation. We currently expect a decrease in our revenue and net income in 2020 as compared to 2019 due to the impact of foreign currency translation.

There is also a transactional impact on our financial results because inventory typically is purchased in United States dollars by our foreign subsidiaries. As with translation, our results of operations will be unfavorably impacted during times of a strengthening United States dollar, as the increased local currency value of inventory results in a higher cost of goods in local currency when the goods are sold, and favorably impacted during times of a weakening United States dollar, as the decreased local currency value of inventory results in a lower cost of goods in local currency when the goods are sold. We use foreign currency forward exchange contracts to hedge against a portion of the exposure related to this transactional impact. The contracts cover at least 70% of the projected inventory purchases in United States dollars by our foreign subsidiaries. These contracts are generally entered into 12 months in advance of the related inventory purchases. Therefore, the impact of fluctuations of the United States dollar on the cost of inventory purchases covered by these contracts may be realized in our results of operations in the year following their inception, as the underlying inventory hedged by the contracts is sold. Our 2019 net income included a slight benefit as compared to 2018 as a result of this transactional impact. However, the unfavorable impact of a strengthening United States dollar against most major currencies in the latter part of 2018 and in 2019, particularly the euro, is expected to negatively impact our gross margin during 2020. Additionally, there is a transactional impact related to changes in SG&A expenses as a result of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. We currently expect a decrease in our net income in 2020 as compared to 2019 due to the transactional impact.

Further, we have exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates related to our €950 million aggregate principal amount of euro-denominated senior notes that we had issued in the United States. The strengthening of the United States dollar against the euro would require us to use a lower amount of our cash flows from operations to pay interest and make long-term debt repayments, whereas the weakening of the United States dollar against the euro would require us to use a greater amount of our cash flows from operations to pay interest and make long-term debt repayments. We designated the carrying amount of these euro-denominated senior notes that we had issued in the United States as net investment hedges of our investments in certain of our foreign subsidiaries that use the euro as their functional currency. As a result, the remeasurement of these foreign currency borrowings at the end of each period is recorded in equity.

Retail comparable store sales discussed below refer to sales from Company-operated retail stores that have been open and operated by us for at least 12 months, as well as sales from Company-operated digital commerce sites for those businesses and regions that have operated the related digital commerce site for at least 12 months. Sales from retail stores and Company-operated digital commerce sites that are closed or shut down during the year are excluded from the calculation of retail comparable store sales. Sales for retail stores that are relocated, materially altered in size or closed for a prolonged period of time and sales from Company-operated digital commerce sites that are materially altered are also excluded from the calculation of retail comparable store sales until such stores or sites have been in their new location or in their newly renovated state, as applicable, for at least 12 months. Retail comparable store sales are based on local currencies and comparable weeks. As a result of the 53rd week in 2017, the 2018 retail comparable store sales are more appropriately compared with the 52 week period ended February 4, 2018 (which excludes for this purpose the first week of 2017). As such, all 2018 retail comparable store sales are presented on this shifted basis.


The following table summarizes our income statements in 2019, 2018 and 2017:

Total Revenue

Total revenue was $9.909 billion in 2019, $9.657 billion in 2018 and $8.915 billion in 2017. Revenue in 2017 included the benefit of a 53rd week. The increase in revenue of $252 million, or 3%, in 2019 as compared to 2018 was due principally to the net effect of the following items:

•

The net addition of an aggregate $367 million of revenue, or an 8% increase over the prior year, attributable to our Tommy Hilfiger International and Tommy Hilfiger North America segments, which included a negative impact of $129 million, or 3%, related to foreign currency translation. Tommy Hilfiger International segment revenue increased 15% (including a 5% negative foreign currency impact),

driven principally by outperformance in Europe and the addition of revenue resulting from the Australia and TH CSAP acquisitions

. Tommy Hilfiger International comparable store sales increased 9%, including a benefit of 4% from sales on our digital commerce sites. Revenue in our Tommy Hilfiger North America segment decreased 1%, as growth in the North America wholesale business was more than offset

by a 6% decline in Tommy Hilfiger North America comparable store sales due to weakness in traffic and consumer spending trends, especially in stores located in international tourist locations.

•

The net reduction of an aggregate $63 million of revenue, or a 2% decrease compared to the prior year, attributable to our Calvin Klein International and Calvin Klein North America segments, which included a negative impact of $85 million, or 2%, related to foreign currency translation. Calvin Klein International segment revenue increased 3% (including a 4% negative foreign currency impact), as continued solid growth in Europe and the addition of revenue resulting from the Australia acquisition were partly offset by the negative impacts of (i) softness experienced in Asia due, in part, to the business disruptions caused by the protests in Hong Kong SAR and the trade tensions between the United States and China and (ii) the reduction of revenue resulting from the CK Collection closure. Calvin Klein International comparable store sales decreased 1%. Revenue in our Calvin Klein North America segment decreased 7%, driven by the effect of the G-III license and a 2% decrease in Calvin Klein North America comparable store sales due to weakness in traffic and consumer spending trends, especially in stores located in international tourist locations.

•

The reduction of an aggregate $52 million of revenue, or a 3% decrease compared the prior year, attributable to our Heritage Brands Retail and Heritage Brands Wholesale segments, primarily due to weakness in the North America wholesale business and a 2% decline in comparable store sales.


The increase in revenue of $742 million, or 8%, in 2018 as compared to 2017 was due principally to the effect of the following items:

•

The addition of an aggregate $451 million of revenue, or a 12% increase over the prior year, attributable to our Tommy Hilfiger International and Tommy Hilfiger North America segments, which included the addition of $49 million, or 1%, related to the impact of foreign currency translation. Tommy Hilfiger International segment revenue increased 15% (including a 2% positive foreign currency impact), driven by strong performance across all regions and channels. Tommy Hilfiger International comparable store sales increased 13%. Revenue in our Tommy Hilfiger North America segment increased 6%, principally attributable to strength in the wholesale business and a 5% increase in Tommy Hilfiger North America comparable store sales.

•

The addition of an aggregate $270 million of revenue, or an 8% increase over the prior year, attributable to our Calvin Klein International and Calvin Klein North America segments, which included the addition of $12 million related to the impact of foreign currency translation. Calvin Klein International segment revenue increased 10%, driven by growth in Europe and Asia. Calvin Klein International comparable store sales increased 5%. Revenue in our Calvin Klein North America segment increased 5% primarily as a result of growth in the wholesale business and a 1% increase in Calvin Klein North America comparable store sales.

•

The addition of an aggregate $21 million of revenue, or a 1% increase over the prior year, attributable to our Heritage Brands Retail and Heritage Brands Wholesale segments. Comparable store sales increased 1%.

There is significant uncertainty with respect to the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on our business and the businesses of our licensees and other business partners. We currently expect that revenue will decrease significantly in 2020 compared to 2019, inclusive of a negative impact related to foreign currency translation, primarily due to the negative impacts to our businesses caused by the COVID-19 outbreak. Revenue in 2020 is also expected to decrease by approximately $150 million due to the aggregate net effect of reductions resulting from (i) the Speedo transaction, which is expected to close in the first quarter of 2020, and (ii) the G-III license, which commenced in 2019, partially offset by an addition of revenue resulting from (iii) the Australia and TH CSAP acquisitions, which closed in the second quarter of 2019.

Gross Profit

Gross profit is calculated as total revenue less cost of goods sold and gross margin is calculated as gross profit divided by total revenue. Included as cost of goods sold are costs associated with the production and procurement of product, such as inbound freight costs, purchasing and receiving costs and inspection costs. Also included as cost of goods sold are the amounts recognized on foreign currency forward exchange contracts as the underlying inventory hedged by such forward exchange contracts is sold. Warehousing and distribution expenses are included in SG&A expenses. All of our royalty, advertising and other revenue is included in gross profit because there is no cost of goods sold associated with such revenue. As a result, our gross profit may not be comparable to that of other entities.

The following table shows our revenue mix between net sales and royalty, advertising and other revenue, as well as our gross margin for


,


and


:

Gross profit in 2019 was $5.388 billion, or 54.4% of total revenue, as compared to $5.308 billion, or 55.0% of total revenue, in 2018. The 60 basis point decrease in gross margin was principally driven by (i) a gross margin decline in our Tommy Hilfiger North America business due to more promotional selling as compared to the prior year, (ii) the impact of additional inventory reserves recorded in the fourth quarter of 2019 in anticipation of lower 2020 sales trends as a result of the onset of the COVID-19 outbreak, (iii) short-lived noncash inventory valuation adjustments recorded in connection with the Australia and TH CSAP acquisitions, and (iv) the negative impact of tariffs imposed on goods imported from China into the United States. These decreases were partially offset by the favorable impact of faster growth in our Tommy Hilfiger


International and Calvin Klein International segments than in our North America segments, as our International segments generally carry higher gross margins, as well as gross margin improvements realized in our Calvin Klein North America business.

Gross profit in 2018 was $5.308 billion, or 55.0% of total revenue, as compared to $4.894 billion, or 54.9% of total revenue, in 2017. The 10 basis point increase in gross margin was principally driven by (i) a favorable mix of business due to faster growth in our Tommy Hilfiger International and Calvin Klein International segments than in our North America segments, as our International segments generally carry higher gross margins, and (ii) gross margin improvement in our Tommy Hilfiger business. Partially offsetting these increases were gross margin declines in our Calvin Klein and Heritage Brands businesses principally due to more promotional selling.

We currently expect that gross margin in 2020 will decrease as compared to 2019 primarily due to (i) the need for increased promotional selling and inventory liquidation as a result of the COVID-19 outbreak and (ii) the unfavorable impact of the stronger United States dollar on our international businesses that purchase inventory in United States dollars, particularly our European businesses, as the increased local currency value of inventory results in higher cost of goods in local currency when the goods are sold. There is significant uncertainty with respect to the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on our business and the businesses of our licensees and other business partners.

SG&A Expenses

Our SG&A expenses were as follows:

SG&A expenses in 2019 were $4.715 billion, or 47.6% of total revenue, as compared to $4.433 billion, or 45.9% of total revenue in 2018. The 170 basis point increase in SG&A expenses as a percentage of total revenue was principally attributable to (i) an increase in costs incurred in connection with the Calvin Klein restructuring, (ii) the costs incurred in connection with the Socks and Hosiery transaction, and (iii) the costs incurred in connection with the TH U.S. store closures. Also contributing to the increase was a change in the mix of business due to faster growth in our Tommy Hilfiger International and Calvin Klein International segments than in our North America segments, as our International segments generally carry higher SG&A expenses as percentages of total revenue.

SG&A expenses in 2018 were $4.433 billion, or 45.9% of total revenue, as compared to $4.245 billion, or 47.6% of total revenue in 2017. The 170 basis point decrease in SG&A expenses as a percentage of total revenue was principally attributable to the absence in 2018 of costs that were recorded in 2017 in connection with (i) the Mr. Hilfiger amendment, (ii) the Li & Fung termination, and (iii) the relocation of our Tommy Hilfiger office in New York, including noncash depreciation expense. Also contributing to the decrease was a leveraging of expenses in the Tommy Hilfiger business. These decreases were partially offset by (i) a change in the mix of business due to faster growth in our Tommy Hilfiger International and Calvin Klein International segments than in our North America segments, as our International segments generally carry higher SG&A expenses as percentages of total revenue, (ii) the costs incurred in connection with the Calvin Klein restructuring and (iii) an increase in corporate expenses due, in part, to investments in digital and information technology initiatives.

In light of the negative impacts on our business resulting from the COVID-19 outbreak, we are taking measures to significantly reduce SG&A expenses in 2020. As such, we currently expect our SG&A expenses in 2020 will be significantly lower as compared to 2019, including as a result of the reductions resulting from these measures and the absence in 2020 of costs related to (i) the Calvin Klein restructuring, (ii) the Socks and Hosiery transaction and (iii) the TH U.S. store closures. However, we expect our SG&A expenses as a percentage of total revenue in 2020 will increase as compared to 2019 primarily due to a deleveraging of expenses driven by the expected decline in revenue resulting from the COVID-19 outbreak. There is significant uncertainty with respect to the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on our business and our SG&A expenses may be subject to significant material change, including as a result of noncash impairments of our property, plant and equipment, operating lease right-of-use assets, or goodwill and other intangible assets that we may recognize as a result of the COVID-19 outbreak.


Non-Service Related Pension and Postretirement Cost

Non-service related pension and postretirement cost in 2019 was $90 million as compared to $5 million in 2018. Non-service related pension and postretirement cost in 2019 and 2018 included actuarial losses on our retirement plans of $98 million and $15 million, respectively. Please see Note 13, “Retirement and Benefit Plans,” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this report for further discussion.

Non-service related pension and postretirement cost in 2018 was $5 million as compared to $3 million in 2017. Non-service related pension and postretirement cost in 2018 included a $15 million actuarial loss on our retirement plans. Non-service related pension and postretirement cost in 2017 included a $9 million loss recorded in connection with the noncash settlement of certain of our benefit obligations related to our retirement plans as a result of a group annuity purchased for certain participants under which such obligations were transferred to an insurer, as well as a $3 million actuarial loss on our retirement plans. Please see

Note 13

, “

Retirement and Benefit Plans

,” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this report for further discussion.

We currently expect that non-service related pension and postretirement (income) for 2020 will be approximately $15 million compared to non-service related pension and postretirement cost of $90 million in 2019. Our 2019 non-service related pension and postretirement cost included a $98 million actuarial loss on our retirement plans recorded in the fourth quarter. Non-service related pension and postretirement (income) cost recorded throughout the year is calculated using actuarial valuations that incorporate assumptions and estimates about financial market, economic and demographic conditions. Differences between estimated and actual results give rise to gains and losses that are recorded immediately in earnings, generally in the fourth quarter of the year, which can create volatility in our results of operations. Our expectation of 2020 non-service related pension and post-retirement income does not include the impact of an actuarial gain or loss. However, if recent market volatility due, in part, to the COVID-19 outbreak continues, we may incur a significant actuarial loss in 2020 as a result of the difference between actual and expected returns on plan assets or if there is a decline in discount rates. Our actual 2020 non-service related pension and postretirement (income) cost may be significantly different than our projections.

Debt Modification and Extinguishment Costs

We incurred costs totaling $5 million in 2019 in connection with the refinancing of our senior credit facilities. Please see the section entitled “Liquidity and Capital Resources” below for further discussion.

We incurred costs totaling $24 million in 2017 in connection with the early redemption of our $700 million 4 1/2% senior notes due December 15, 2022. Please see the section entitled “Liquidity and Capital Resources” below for further discussion.

Other Noncash Loss, Net

We recorded a pre-tax noncash loss of $142 million in the fourth quarter of 2019 related to the Speedo transaction and expected deconsolidation of the net assets of the Speedo North America business, consisting of a noncash impairment of our perpetual license right for the

Speedo

trademark, and a noncash loss to reduce the carrying value of the business to its estimated fair value, less costs to sell. Please see Note 4, “Assets Held For Sale,” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this report for further discussion.

We recorded a pre-tax noncash gain of $113 million in the second quarter of 2019 to write up our equity investments in Gazal and PVH Australia to fair value in connection with the Australia acquisition. Please see Note 3, “Acquisitions,” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this report for further discussion.

Equity in Net Income of Unconsolidated Affiliates

The equity in net income of unconsolidated affiliates was $10 million in 2019 as compared to $21 million in 2018 and $10 million in 2017. These amounts relate to our share of income (loss) from PVH Australia (prior to acquiring it on May 31, 2019 through the Australia acquisition), our joint venture for the

TOMMY HILFIGER, CALVIN KLEIN, Warner’s, Olga

and

Speedo

brands in Mexico, our joint ventures for the

TOMMY HILFIGER

brand in India and Brazil, our joint venture for the

CALVIN KLEIN

brand in India, and our newly formed PVH Legwear joint venture for the

TOMMY HILFIGER

,

CALVIN KLEIN

,

IZOD

,

Van Heusen

and

Warner’s

brands and other owned and licensed trademarks in the United States and Canada. (PVH Legwear began operations in December 2019.) Also included is our share of income (loss) from our investments in Karl Lagerfeld Holding B.V. (“Karl Lagerfeld”) and in Gazal (prior to acquiring it on May 31, 2019 through the Australia


acquisition). The equity in net income for 2019 decreased as compared to 2018, primarily due to having only a partial year of income from our investments in Gazal and PVH Australia and one-time expenses of $2 million recorded on our equity investments in Gazal and PVH Australia prior to the Australia acquisition closing. Our investments in the continuing joint ventures and Karl Lagerfeld are being accounted for under the equity method of accounting. Subsequent to the closing of the Australia acquisition, we began to consolidate the operations of Gazal and PVH Australia into our financial statements. Please see the section entitled “Investments in Unconsolidated Affiliates” within “Liquidity and Capital Resources” below for further discussion.

We currently expect that our equity in net income of unconsolidated affiliates for 2020 will include an increase in income on our investment in PVH Legwear as compared to 2019, as we recognize a full year of income in 2020, offset by a decrease in income on our investments due to the negative impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on our unconsolidated affiliates’ businesses in 2020.

Interest Expense, Net

Net interest expense decreased to $115 million in 2019 from $116 million in 2018 primarily due to lower interest rates on our senior unsecured credit facilities as compared to 2018, partially offset by the $9 million loss on remeasurement of our mandatorily redeemable non-controlling interest that was recognized in connection with the Australia acquisition. Please see the section entitled “Financing Arrangements” within “Liquidity and Capital Resources” below for further discussion.

Net interest expense decreased to $116 million in 2018 from $122 million in 2017 primarily due to (i) the net impact of the early redemption of our $700 million 4 1/2% senior notes in January 2018 and issuance of €600 million euro-denominated 3 1/8% senior notes in December 2017 and (ii) the cumulative impact of long-term debt repayments made during 2018 and 2017, partially offset by an increase in short-term borrowings and interest rates as compared to 2017. Please see the section entitled “Financing Arrangements” within “Liquidity and Capital Resources” below for further discussion.

We currently expect that net interest expense in 2020 will increase as compared to 2019. We have increased the aggregate borrowings outstanding under our senior unsecured revolving credit facilities, other short-term revolving credit facilities and unsecured commercial paper note program in 2020 to approximately $930 million in order to increase our cash position and preserve financial flexibility in responding to the impacts of the COVID-19 outbreak on our business, and we expect that we may further increase our borrowings under existing or new financing arrangements. There is significant uncertainty with respect to the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on our business and our interest expense may be subject to further significant increase.

Income Taxes

Income tax expense (benefit) was as follows:

The United States Tax Cuts and Job Act of 2017 (the “U.S. Tax Legislation”) was enacted on December 22, 2017. The U.S. Tax Legislation is comprehensive and significantly revised the United States tax code. The revisions that significantly impact us are (i) the reduction of the corporate income tax rate from 35.0% to 21.0%, (ii) the imposition of a one-time transition tax on earnings of foreign subsidiaries deemed to be repatriated, (iii) the implementation of a modified territorial tax system, (iv) the introduction of a tax on foreign income in excess of a deemed return on tangible assets of foreign corporations (known as “GILTI”) and a beneficial tax rate to be applied against foreign derived intangible income (known as “FDII”) and (v) the introduction of a base erosion anti-abuse tax measure (known as “BEAT”) that taxes certain payments between United States corporations and their subsidiaries.

We recorded a provisional net tax benefit of $53 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 in connection with the U.S. Tax Legislation, consisting of a $265 million benefit primarily from the remeasurement of our net United States deferred tax liabilities, partially offset by a $38 million valuation allowance on our foreign tax credits and a $174 million transition tax on earnings of foreign subsidiaries deemed to be repatriated. In the fourth quarter of 2018, we completed our final analysis of the impacts of the U.S. Tax Legislation and recorded a net tax benefit of $25 million to adjust the provisional amount recorded in 2017, during the measurement period allowed by the Securities and Exchange Commission. The $25 million net


tax benefit included the release of a $26 million valuation allowance on our foreign tax credits, partially offset by a $2 million expense related to the remeasurement of our net United States deferred tax liabilities.

We file income tax returns in more than 40 international jurisdictions each year. A substantial amount of our earnings are in international jurisdictions, particularly in the Netherlands and Hong Kong SAR, where income tax rates, coupled with special rates levied on income from certain of our jurisdictional activities, are lower than the United States statutory income tax rate, and reduced our consolidated effective income tax rate during 2019, 2018 and 2017. We expect to benefit from these special rates until 2022. The reduction in the United States statutory income tax rate from 35.0% to 21.0% as a result of the U.S. Tax Legislation did not have a significant impact on our overall effective tax rate due to our mix of earnings.

Our effective income tax rate for 2019 was lower than the 21.0% United States statutory income tax rate primarily due to (i) the favorable impact on certain liabilities for uncertain tax positions resulting from the expiration of applicable statutes of limitation and the settlement of a multi-year audit from an international jurisdiction, which together resulted in a benefit to our effective income tax rate of 11.8%, and (ii) the favorable impact of a tax exemption on the noncash gain recorded to write-up our existing equity investments in Gazal and PVH Australia to fair value in connection with the Australia acquisition, which resulted in a 5.4% benefit to our effective income tax rate.

The effective income tax rate for 2019 was 6.5% compared with 4.0% in 2018. The 2019 effective income tax rate was higher than the effective income tax rate for 2018 primarily due to (i) the absence of a 5.3% benefit to our 2018 effective income tax rate related to the remeasurement of certain of our net deferred tax liabilities in connection with the legislation enacted in the Netherlands known as the “2019 Dutch Tax Plan” and (ii) the absence of a 3.2% benefit to our 2018 effective income tax rate related to the U.S. Tax Legislation, partially offset by (iii) a favorable change in our uncertain tax positions activity of 8.1%, which includes the benefit to our 2019 effective income tax rate resulting from settlement of a multi-year audit from an international jurisdiction. The variance between the 2019 and 2018 effective income tax rates is also affected by the substantial change in our pre-tax income, which was $444 million in 2019 and $776 million in 2018. As a result, the effect that discrete tax amounts have on the effective income tax rate in each year is not comparable.

Our effective income tax rate for 2018 was lower than the 21.0% United States statutory income tax rate primarily due to (i) a $41 million benefit from the remeasurement of certain of our net deferred tax liabilities in connection with the enactment of the 2019 Dutch Tax Plan, which resulted in a benefit to our effective income tax rate of 5.3%, (ii) the favorable impact on certain liabilities for uncertain tax positions resulting from the expiration of applicable statutes of limitation, which resulted in a benefit to our effective income tax rate of 3.7%, (iii) a net tax benefit of $25 million recorded in 2018 to adjust the provisional amount recorded in 2017 in connection with the U.S. Tax Legislation, which resulted in a benefit to our effective income tax rate of 3.2%, and (iv) the benefit of overall lower tax rates in certain international jurisdictions where we file tax returns.

The effective income tax rate for 2018 was 4.0% compared with (5.1)% in 2017. The 2018 effective income tax rate was higher than the effective income tax rate for 2017 primarily due to (i) a lower net benefit recorded in connection with the U.S. Tax Legislation, which resulted in a 3.2% benefit to our 2018 effective income tax rate compared with a 10.4% benefit to our 2017 effective income tax rate, (ii) an unfavorable change in our uncertain tax positions activity of 3.8%, and (iii) the absence of a 3.0% benefit to our 2017 effective income tax rate resulting from an excess tax benefit from the exercise of stock options by our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. These unfavorable impacts to our effective income tax rate for 2018 were partially offset by a 5.3% benefit to our 2018 effective income tax rate from the remeasurement of certain of our net deferred tax liabilities in connection with the 2019 Dutch Tax Plan.

As a result of the U.S. Tax Legislation, which reduced the United States statutory income tax rate from 35.0% to 21.0% effective January 1, 2018, our United States statutory income tax rate for 2017 was a blended rate of 33.7%. Our effective income tax rate for 2017 was lower than the United States statutory income tax rate primarily due to (i) the provisional net benefit of $53 million recorded in connection with the U.S. Tax Legislation, which resulted in a benefit to our 2017 effective income tax rate of 10.4%, (ii) the benefit of overall lower tax rates in certain international jurisdictions where we file tax returns, and (iii) the overall benefit of certain discrete items, including the favorable impact on certain liabilities for uncertain tax positions and an excess tax benefit from the exercise of stock options by our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, which resulted in benefits to our 2017 effective income tax rate of 7.5% and 3.0%, respectively.

Given the significant uncertainty with respect to the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on our business and results of operations, we are not able to estimate our effective income tax rate in 2020.


Our tax rate is affected by many factors, including the mix of international and domestic pre-tax earnings, discrete events arising from specific transactions, and new regulations, as well as audits by tax authorities and the receipt of new information, which can cause us to change our estimate for uncertain tax positions. Please see

Redeemable Non-Controlling Interest

We have a joint venture in Ethiopia with Arvind Limited, in which we own a 75% interest. We consolidate the results of PVH Ethiopia in our consolidated financial statements. PVH Ethiopia was formed to operate a manufacturing facility that produces finished products for us for distribution primarily in the United States. The manufacturing facility began operations in 2017.

The net loss attributable to the redeemable non-controlling interest in PVH Ethiopia was immaterial in 2019, 2018 and 2017. We currently expect that the net loss attributable to the redeemable non-controlling interest for 2020 will also be immaterial. Please see

Redeemable Non-Controlling Interest

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

Cash Flow Summary

Cash and cash equivalents at

February 2, 2020

was $503 million, an increase of $51 million from the amount at

February 3, 2019

of $452 million. The change in cash and cash equivalents included the impact of (i) $325 million of common stock repurchases under the stock repurchase program, (ii) $71 million of long-term debt repayments, (iii) a $59 million net payment made in connection with the Australia acquisition, and (iv) a $74 million payment made in connection with the TH CSAP acquisition.

Cash flow in 2020 will be impacted by various factors in addition to those noted below in this “Liquidity and Capital Resources” section, including (i) mandatory long-term debt repayments of approximately $14 million, subject to exchange rate fluctuations, (ii) common stock repurchases under the stock repurchase program of $111

million, which reflects stock repurchases through March 2020 with no further repurchases planned for the remainder of 2020, and (iii) the expected proceeds of $170 million, subject to a working capital adjustment, related to the Speedo transaction, which is expected to close in the first quarter of 2020. In addition, in March 2020 we increased the aggregate borrowings outstanding under our senior unsecured revolving credit facilities, other short-term revolving credit facilities and unsecured commercial paper note program to approximately $930 million, in order to increase our cash position and preserve financial flexibility in responding to the impacts of the COVID-19 outbreak on our business. Given the dynamic nature of the COVID-19 outbreak, our estimates of cash flows in 2020 may be subject to material significant change, including as a result of the actual impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on our 2020 earnings, additional borrowings under existing or new financing arrangements, excess inventories, delays in collection of, or inability to collect on, certain trade receivables, and other working capital changes that we may experience as a result of the COVID-19 outbreak.

As of February 2, 2020, approximately $405 million of cash and cash equivalents was held by international subsidiaries. Our intent is to reinvest indefinitely substantially all of our earnings in foreign subsidiaries outside of the United States. However, if management decides at a later date to repatriate these earnings to the United States, we may be required to accrue and pay additional taxes, including any applicable foreign withholding tax and United States state income taxes. It is not practicable to estimate the amount of tax that might be payable if these earnings were repatriated due to the complexities associated with the hypothetical calculation.

Operations

Cash provided by operating activities was $1.020 billion in 2019 compared to $852 million in 2018. The increase in cash provided by operating activities as compared to the prior year was primarily driven by changes in working capital, including a favorable change in trade receivables and inventories, partially offset by a decrease in net income as adjusted for noncash charges.

In connection with our acquisition of Calvin Klein, we were obligated to pay Mr. Calvin Klein contingent purchase price payments based on 1.15% of total worldwide net sales (as defined in the acquisition agreement, as amended) of products bearing any of the

CALVIN KLEIN

brands with respect to sales made through February 12, 2018. A significant portion of the


sales on which the payments to Mr. Klein were made were wholesale sales by us and our licensees and other partners to retailers. Contingent purchase price payments totaled $16 million and $56 million

in 2018 and 2017, respectively. The final payment due to Mr. Klein was made in the second quarter of 2018.

Capital Expenditures

Our capital expenditures in 2019 were $345 million compared to $379 million in 2018. The capital expenditures in 2019 primarily related to (i) investments in new stores and store expansions, (ii) investments to upgrade and enhance our operating, supply chain and logistics systems and our digital commerce platforms and (iii) the expansion of our warehouse and distribution network in North America. We currently expect that capital expenditures for 2020 will decrease to approximately $190 million and will include only certain minimum required expenditures in our retail stores and expenditures for projects currently in progress, primarily related to (i) investments to support the multi-year upgrade of our platforms and systems worldwide and (ii) enhancements to our warehouse and distribution network. Given the dynamic nature of the COVID-19 outbreak, our estimates of capital expenditures in 2020 may be subject to change. Our capital expenditures may differ materially compared to our current expectations as a result.

Investments in Unconsolidated Affiliates

We own a 49% economic interest in our newly formed PVH Legwear joint venture. We made payments of $


million to PVH Legwear during


to contribute our share of the joint venture funding.

We held an approximately

22%

ownership interest in Gazal and a

50%

ownership interest in PVH Australia until the closing of the Australia acquisition on May 31, 2019. These investments were accounted for under the equity method of accounting. We derecognized our equity investments in Gazal and PVH Australia and began to consolidate the operations of Gazal and PVH Australia in our financial statements effective with the closing of the transaction. We received aggregate dividends of $6 million, $8 million and $4 million from Gazal and PVH Australia during


,


and


, respectively.

We acquired a 51% economic interest in a joint venture, Calvin Klein Arvind Fashion Private Limited (“CK India”) in 2013. We sold 1% of our interest for $400,000 in 2017, decreasing our economic interest in CK India to 50%. Prior to the sale, we were not deemed to hold a controlling interest in CK India as the shareholders agreement provided the partners with equal rights. CK India licenses from one of our subsidiaries the rights to the

CALVIN KLEIN

trademarks in India for certain product categories. We made payments of $2 million to CK India during 2017 to contribute our share of the joint venture funding.

We own a 50% economic interest in a joint venture, Tommy Hilfiger Arvind Fashion Private Limited (“TH India”). TH India licenses from one of our subsidiaries the rights to the

TOMMY HILFIGER

trademarks in India for certain product categories. Arvind, our joint venture partner in PVH Ethiopia and CK India, is also our joint venture partner in TH India. We made payments of $3 million to TH India during 2017 to contribute our share of the joint venture funding.

We formed with two other parties a joint venture, Tommy Hilfiger do Brasil S.A. (“TH Brazil”), in 2012, in which we have a 40% economic interest. We acquired an approximately 1% additional interest for $300,000 in 2017, increasing our economic interest in TH Brazil to approximately 41%. TH Brazil licenses from one of our subsidiaries the rights to the

TOMMY HILFIGER

trademarks in Brazil for certain product categories. We made payments of $3 million to TH Brazil during 2017 to contribute our share of the joint venture funding. We issued a note receivable to TH Brazil in 2016 for $12 million, of which $6 million was repaid in 2016 and the remaining balance, including accrued interest, was repaid in 2017.

We, along with Grupo Axo, S.A.P.I. de C.V., formed a joint venture (“PVH Mexico”) in 2016, in which we own a 49% economic interest. PVH Mexico licenses from certain of our wholly owned subsidiaries the rights to distribute and sell certain

TOMMY HILFIGER

CALVIN KLEIN

,

Warner’s

,

Olga

and

Loan to a Supplier

Wuxi Jinmao Foreign Trade Co., Ltd. (“Wuxi”), one of our finished goods inventory suppliers, has a wholly owned subsidiary with which we entered into a loan agreement in 2016. Under the agreement, Wuxi’s subsidiary borrowed a principal amount of $14 million for the development and operation of a fabric mill. Principal payments are due in semi-annual installments beginning March 31, 2018 through September 30, 2026. The outstanding principal balance of the loan bears interest at a rate of (i) 4.50% per annum until the sixth anniversary of the closing date of the loan and (ii) LIBOR plus 4.00% thereafter. We received principal payments of $400,000 and $200,000 during 2019 and 2018, respectively. The outstanding balance, including accrued interest, was $13 million and $14 million as of

February 2, 2020

and

February 3, 2019

, respectively.

Dividends

Our common stock has historically paid annual dividends, which totaled $0.15 per share in each of 2019, 2018 and 2017. Dividends on common stock totaled $11 million in 2019 and $12 million in each of 2018 and 2017.

We declared a $0.0375 per share dividend payable to our common stockholders of record as of March 4, 2020, in respect of which we made dividend payments totaling approximately $3 million on March 31, 2020. We have suspended our dividend policy in order to increase our cash position and preserve financial flexibility in responding to the impacts of the COVID-19 outbreak on our business. If we were to pay cash dividends totaling $0.15 per share on our common stock in 2020, such dividends would total approximately $11 million based on the number of shares of our common stock outstanding as of


February 2, 2020

, our estimate of stock to be issued during 2020 under our stock incentive plans and our estimate of stock repurchases during 2020.

Acquisition of Treasury Shares

Our Board of Directors has authorized over time since 2015 an aggregate $

2.0

billion stock repurchase program through June 3, 2023. Repurchases under the program may be made from time to time over the period through open market purchases, accelerated share repurchase programs, privately negotiated transactions or other methods, as we deem appropriate. Purchases are made based on a variety of factors, such as price, corporate requirements and overall market conditions, applicable legal requirements and limitations, trading restrictions under our insider trading policy and other relevant factors. The program may be modified by the Board of Directors, including to increase or decrease the repurchase limitation or extend, suspend, or terminate the program, at any time, without prior notice.

During 2019, 2018 and 2017, we purchased approximately 3.4 million shares, 2.2 million shares and 2.2 million shares, respectively, of our common stock under the program in open market transactions for $325 million, $300 million and $250 million, respectively. Purchases of $500,000 were accrued for in the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of

February 2, 2020

. Purchases of $2 million that were accrued for in the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of

February 4, 2018

were paid in 2018. The repurchased shares were held as treasury stock and $683 million of the authorization remained available for future share repurchases as of

February 2, 2020

.

Treasury stock activity also includes shares that were withheld principally in conjunction with the settlement of restricted stock units and performance share units to satisfy tax withholding requirements.

Mandatorily Redeemable Non-Controlling Interest

The Australia acquisition agreement provided for key members of Gazal and PVH Australia management to exchange a portion of their interests in Gazal for approximately

6%

of the outstanding shares in our previously wholly owned subsidiary that acquired

100%

of the ownership interests in the Australia business. We are obligated to purchase this

6%

interest within two years of the acquisition closing in two tranches as follows: tranche 1 –

50%

of the shares

one year after the closing

, but the holders had the option to defer half of this tranche to tranche 2; and tranche 2 – all remaining shares

two years after the closing

. With respect to tranche 1, the holders elected not to defer their shares to tranche 2 and as a result we are obligated to purchase all of the tranche 1 shares in the second quarter of 2020. The purchase price for the tranche 1 and tranche 2 shares is based on a multiple of the subsidiary’s adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (“EBITDA”) less net debt as of the end of the measurement year, and the multiple varies depending on the level of EBITDA compared to a target. The liability for the mandatorily redeemable non-controlling interest was $33.8 million as of February 2, 2020 based on exchange rates in effect on that date, of which $16.9 million is payable in the second quarter of 2020 for the purchase of the tranche 1 shares.

Financing Arrangements

Our capital structure was as follows at the end of 2019 and 2018:

In addition, we had $503 million and $452 million of cash and cash equivalents as of

February 2, 2020

and

February 3, 2019

, respectively.

Short-Term Borrowings

We have the ability to draw revolving borrowings under our senior unsecured credit facilities, as discussed in the section entitled “2019 Senior Unsecured Credit Facilities” below. We had no borrowings outstanding under these facilities as of


February 2, 2020

. The maximum amount of revolving borrowings outstanding under these facilities during


was $


million. We had $


million outstanding under our prior senior secured credit facilities as of

February 3, 2019

as discussed in the section entitled “2016 Senior Secured Credit Facilities” below. The weighted average interest rate on the funds borrowed as of

February 3, 2019

was

4.45

%.

Additionally, we have the availability to borrow under short-term lines of credit, overdraft facilities and short-term revolving credit facilities denominated in various foreign currencies. These facilities, which now include a facility in Australia as a result of the Australia acquisition, provided for borrowings of up to $


million based on exchange rates in effect on

February 2, 2020

and are utilized primarily to fund working capital needs. We had $


million and $


million outstanding under these facilities as of

February 2, 2020

and

February 3, 2019

, respectively. The $50 million of borrowings outstanding as of

February 2, 2020

included borrowings under the facility in Australia. The weighted average interest rate on funds borrowed as of

February 2, 2020

and

February 3, 2019

was

2.56

% and

0.21

%, respectively. The maximum amount of borrowings outstanding under these facilities during


was $99 million.

Commercial Paper

We established on November 5, 2019 an unsecured commercial paper note program in the United States primarily to fund working capital needs. The program enables us to issue, from time to time, unsecured commercial paper notes with maturities that vary but do not exceed 397 days from the date of issuance. We had no borrowings outstanding under the commercial paper note program as of February 2, 2020. The maximum amount of borrowings outstanding under the program during 2019 was $370 million.

The commercial paper program allows for borrowings of up to $


million to the extent that we have borrowing capacity under our United States dollar-denominated revolving credit facility, as discussed in the section entitled “2019 Senior Unsecured Credit Facilities” below. Accordingly, the combined aggregate amount of (i) borrowings outstanding under the commercial paper note program and (ii) the revolving borrowings outstanding under the United States dollar-denominated revolving credit facility at any one time cannot exceed $675 million. The maximum aggregate amount of borrowings outstanding under the commercial paper program and the United States dollar-denominated revolving credit facility during 2019 was $567 million, which reflects a brief period of higher aggregate borrowings at the time that we launched the commercial paper program.

Finance Lease Obligations

Our cash payments for finance lease obligations totaled $5 million in each of 2019, 2018 and 2017.

2016 Senior Secured Credit Facilities

On May 19, 2016, we entered into an amendment to our senior secured credit facilities (as amended, the “2016 facilities”). We replaced the 2016 facilities with new senior unsecured credit facilities on April 29, 2019 as discussed in the section entitled “2019 Senior Unsecured Credit Facilities” below. The 2016 facilities, as of the date they were replaced, consisted of a $2.347 billion United States dollar-denominated Term Loan A facility and senior secured revolving credit facilities consisting of (i) a $475 million United States dollar-denominated revolving credit facility, (ii) a $25 million United States dollar-denominated revolving credit facility available in United States dollars and Canadian dollars and (iii) a €186 million euro-denominated revolving credit facility available in euro, British pound sterling, Japanese yen and Swiss francs.

2019 Senior Unsecured Credit Facilities

We refinanced the 2016 facilities on April 29, 2019 (the “Closing Date”) by entering into senior unsecured credit facilities (the “2019 facilities”), the proceeds of which, along with cash on hand, were used to repay all of the outstanding borrowings under the 2016 facilities, as well as the related debt issuance costs.

The 2019 facilities consist of a $1.093 billion United States dollar-denominated Term Loan A facility (the “USD TLA facility”), a €500 million euro-denominated Term Loan A facility (the “Euro TLA facility” and together with the USD TLA facility, the “TLA facilities”) and senior unsecured revolving credit facilities consisting of (i) a $675 million United States dollar-denominated revolving credit facility, (ii) a CAD $70 million Canadian dollar-denominated revolving credit facility available in United States dollars or Canadian dollars, (iii) a €200 million euro-denominated revolving credit facility available in euro, British pound sterling, Japanese yen, Swiss francs, Australian dollars and other agreed foreign currencies and (iv) a $50 million United States dollar-denominated revolving credit facility available in United States dollars or Hong Kong dollars. The


2019 facilities are due on April 29, 2024. In connection with the refinancing of our senior credit facilities, we paid debt issuance costs of $10 million (of which $3 million was expensed as debt modification costs and $7 million is being amortized over the term of the debt agreement) and recorded debt extinguishment costs of $2 million to write off previously capitalized debt issuance costs.

Each of the senior unsecured revolving facilities, except for the $50 million United States dollar-denominated revolving credit facility available in United States dollars or Hong Kong dollars, also include amounts available for letters of credit and have a portion available for the making of swingline loans. The issuance of such letters of credit and the making of any swingline loan reduces the amount available under the applicable revolving credit facility. So long as certain conditions are satisfied, we may add one or more senior unsecured term loan facilities or increase the commitments under the senior unsecured revolving credit facilities by an aggregate amount not to exceed $1.5 billion. The lenders under the 2019 facilities are not required to provide commitments with respect to such additional facilities or increased commitments.

We had loans outstanding of $1.570 billion, net of debt issuance costs and based on applicable exchange rates, under the TLA facilities and $20 million of outstanding letters of credit under the senior unsecured revolving credit facilities as of

February 2, 2020

. We had no borrowings outstanding under the senior unsecured revolving credit facilities as of February 2, 2020.

The terms of the TLA facilities require us to make quarterly repayments of amounts outstanding under the 2019 facilities, which commenced with the calendar quarter ended September 30, 2019. Such required repayment amounts equal 2.50% per annum of the principal amount outstanding on the Closing Date for the first eight calendar quarters following the Closing Date, 5.00% per annum of the principal amount outstanding on the Closing Date for the four calendar quarters thereafter and 7.50% per annum of the principal amount outstanding on the Closing Date for the remaining calendar quarters, in each case paid in equal installments and in each case subject to certain customary adjustments, with the balance due on the maturity date of the TLA facilities. The outstanding borrowings under the 2019 facilities are prepayable at any time without penalty (other than customary breakage costs). Any voluntary repayments we make would reduce the future required repayment amounts.

We made payments of $71 million on our term loans under the 2019 facilities and we repaid the 2016 facilities in connection with the refinancing of the senior credit facilities during 2019. We made payments of $150 million and $250 million during 2018 and 2017, respectively, on our term loans under the 2016 facilities.

The United States dollar-denominated borrowings under the 2019 facilities bear interest at a rate equal to an applicable margin plus, as determined at our option, either (a) a base rate determined by reference to the greater of (i) the prime rate, (ii) the United States federal funds effective rate plus 1/2 of 1.00% and (iii) a one-month reserve adjusted Eurocurrency rate plus 1.00% or (b) an adjusted Eurocurrency rate, calculated in a manner set forth in the 2019 facilities.

The Canadian dollar-denominated borrowings under the 2019 facilities bear interest at a rate equal to an applicable margin plus, as determined at our option, either (a) a Canadian prime rate determined by reference to the greater of (i) the rate of interest per annum that Royal Bank of Canada establishes as the reference rate of interest in order to determine interest rates for loans in Canadian dollars to its Canadian borrowers and (ii) the average of the rates per annum for Canadian dollar bankers' acceptances having a term of one month or (b) an adjusted Eurocurrency rate, calculated in a manner set forth in the 2019 facilities.

Borrowings available in Hong Kong dollars under the 2019 facilities bear interest at a rate equal to an applicable margin plus an adjusted Eurocurrency rate, calculated in a manner set forth in the 2019 facilities.

The borrowings under the 2019 facilities in currencies other than United States dollars, Canadian dollars or Hong Kong dollars bear interest at a rate equal to an applicable margin plus an adjusted Eurocurrency rate, calculated in a manner set forth in the 2019 facilities.

The current applicable margin with respect to the TLA facilities and each revolving credit facility is 1.375% for adjusted Eurocurrency rate loans and 0.375% for base rate or Canadian prime rate loans. The applicable margin for borrowings under the TLA facilities and the revolving credit facilities is subject to adjustment (i) after the date of delivery of the compliance certificate and financial statements, with respect to each of our fiscal quarters, based upon our net leverage ratio or (ii) after the date of delivery of notice of a change in our public debt rating by Standard & Poor’s or Moody’s.


We entered into interest rate swap agreements designed with the intended effect of converting notional amounts of our variable rate debt obligation to fixed rate debt. Under the terms of the agreements, for the outstanding notional amount, our exposure to fluctuations in the one-month LIBOR is eliminated and we pay a fixed rate plus the current applicable margin. The following interest rate swap agreements were entered into or in effect during 2019, 2018 and 2017:

The notional amounts of the outstanding interest rate swaps that commenced in February 2018 and February 2019 are adjusted according to pre-set schedules during the terms of the swap agreements such that, based on our projections for future debt repayments, our outstanding debt under the USD TLA facility is expected to always equal or exceed the combined notional amount of the then-outstanding interest rate swaps.

4 1/2% Senior Notes Due 2022

We had outstanding $700 million principal amount of 4 1/2% senior notes due December 15, 2022. We redeemed these notes on January 5, 2018 in connection with the issuance of €600 million euro-denominated principal amount of 3 1/8% senior notes due December 15, 2027, as discussed below. We paid a premium of $16 million to the holders of these notes in connection with the redemption and recorded debt extinguishment costs of $8 million to write-off previously capitalized debt issuance costs associated with these notes during 2017.

7 3/4% Debentures Due 2023

We have outstanding $100 million of debentures due November 15, 2023 that accrue interest at the rate of 7 3/4%. The debentures are not redeemable at our option prior to maturity.

3 5/8% Euro Senior Notes Due 2024

We have outstanding €


million euro-denominated principal amount of 3 5/8% senior notes due July 15, 2024. Interest on the notes is payable in euros. We may redeem some or all of these notes at any time prior to April 15, 2024 by paying a “make whole” premium plus any accrued and unpaid interest. In addition, we may redeem some or all of these notes on or after April 15, 2024 at their principal amount plus any accrued and unpaid interest.

3 1/8% Euro Senior Notes Due 2027

We issued on December 21, 2017 €


million euro-denominated principal amount of 3 1/8% senior notes due December 15, 2027. Interest on the notes is payable in euros. We paid €


million (approximately $


million based on exchange rates in effect on the payment date) of fees during 2017 in connection with the issuance of these notes, which are amortized over the term of the notes. We may redeem some or all of these notes at any time prior to September 15, 2027 by paying a “make whole” premium plus any accrued and unpaid interest. In addition, we may redeem some or all of these notes on or after September 15, 2027 at their principal amount plus any accrued and unpaid interest.

Our financing arrangements contain financial and non-financial covenants and customary events of default. As of

February 2, 2020

, we were in compliance with all applicable financial and non-financial covenants under our financing arrangements.


As of

February 2, 2020

, our issuer credit was rated BBB- by Standard & Poor’s with a stable outlook and our corporate credit was rated Baa3 by Moody’s with a stable outlook, and our commercial paper was rated A-3 by Standard & Poor’s and P-3 by Moody’s. In assessing our credit strength, we believe that both Standard & Poor’s and Moody’s considered, among other things, our capital structure and financial policies, our consolidated balance sheet, our historical acquisition activity and other financial information, as well as industry and other qualitative factors.

, our contractual cash obligations by future period:

______________________

(1)

At

February 2, 2020

, the outstanding principal balance under senior unsecured Term Loan A facilities was $1.575 billion, which requires mandatory payments through April 29, 2024 (according to the mandatory repayment schedules). We also had outstanding $100 million of 7 3/4% debentures due November 15, 2023, $387 million of 3 5/8% senior unsecured euro notes due July 15, 2024 and $663 million of 3 1/8% senior unsecured euro notes due December 15, 2027.

Represents contractual commitments that are enforceable and legally binding for goods on order and not received or paid for as of

February 2, 2020

. Inventory purchase commitments also include fabric commitments with our suppliers, which secure a portion of our material needs for future seasons. Substantially all of these goods are expected to be received and the related payments are expected to be made in 2020. However, in light of the COVID-19 outbreak, some of these orders may be canceled. This amount does not include foreign currency forward exchange contracts that we have entered into to manage our exposure to exchange rate changes with respect to certain of these purchases. Please see

Note 11

, “

Derivative Financial Instruments

,” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this report for further information.

(4)

Our minimum contractual royalty payments arise under numerous license agreements we have with third parties, each of which has different terms. Agreements typically require us to make minimum payments to the licensors of the licensed trademarks based on expected or required minimum levels of sales of licensed products, as well as additional royalty payments based on a percentage of sales when our sales exceed such minimum sales. Certain of our license agreements require that we pay a specified percentage of net sales to the licensor for advertising and promotion of the licensed products, in some cases requiring a minimum amount to be paid. Any advertising payments, with the exception of minimum payments to licensors, are excluded from the minimum contractual royalty payments shown in the table. There is no guarantee that we will exceed the minimum payments under any of these license agreements.


(5)

We have an unfunded, non-qualified supplemental defined benefit plan covering certain retired executives under which the participants will receive a predetermined amount during the 10 years following the attainment of age 65, provided that prior to the termination of employment with us, the participant has been in such plan for at least 10 years and has attained age 55.

(6)

Information-technology, sponsorships and other commitments represent future cash obligations related to (i) information-technology related service agreements, (ii) sponsorship and advertising agreements, including agreements relating to our sponsorship of the Barclays Center, the Brooklyn Nets, Mercedes-AMG Petronas Motorsport in Formula One

TM

racing and certain other professional sports teams and athletes and other similar sponsorships, as well as agreements with celebrities, models and stylists and (iii) the mandatorily redeemable non-controlling interest that was recognized in connection with the Australia acquisition, of which the portion related to tranche 1 shares is payable in 2020 and has been included in the table above. Not included in the table above is the portion of the mandatorily redeemable non-controlling interest related to the tranche 2 shares that is payable in 2021, due to the uncertainty regarding the future cash outflows associated with this obligation. Please see

Not included in the above table are contributions to our qualified defined benefit pension plans, or payments to employees and retirees in connection with our unfunded supplemental executive retirement, supplemental pension and postretirement health plans. Contractual cash obligations for these plans cannot be determined due to the number of assumptions required to estimate our future benefit obligations, including return on assets, discount rate and future compensation increases. The liabilities associated with these plans, together with the liability for the non-qualified supplemental defined benefit plans included in the above table, are presented in

MARKET RISK

Financial instruments held by us as of

February 2, 2020

include cash and cash equivalents, short-term borrowings, long-term debt, foreign currency forward exchange contracts and interest rate swap agreements.

Note 12

, “

Fair Value Measurements

,” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this report outlines the fair value of our financial instruments as of

February 2, 2020

. Cash and cash equivalents held by us are affected by short-term interest rates, which are currently low. The potential for a significant decrease in short-term interest rates is low due to the currently low rates of return we are receiving on our cash and cash equivalents and, therefore, a further decrease would not have a material impact on our interest income. However, there is potential for a more significant increase in short-term interest rates, which could have a more material impact on our interest income. Given our balance of cash and cash equivalents at

February 2, 2020

, the effect of a 10 basis point change in short-term interest rates on our interest income would be approximately $500,000 annually. Borrowings under our 2019 facilities bear interest at a rate equal to an applicable margin plus a variable rate. As such, our 2019 facilities expose us to market risk for changes in interest rates. We have entered into interest rate swap agreements for the intended purpose of reducing our exposure to interest rate volatility. As of

February 2, 2020

, after taking into account the effect of our interest rate swap agreements that were in effect as of such date, approximately 55% of our long-term debt was at a fixed interest rate, with the remainder at variable interest rates. Given our long-term debt position at

February 2, 2020

, the effect of a 10 basis point change in interest rates on our variable interest expense would be approximately $1 million annually. Please see the section entitled “Liquidity and Capital Resources” above for further discussion of our credit facilities and interest rate swap agreements.

Our Tommy Hilfiger and Calvin Klein businesses each have substantial international components that expose us to significant foreign exchange risk. Our Heritage Brands business also has international components but those components are not significant to the business. Over 50% of our $9.909 billion of revenue in 2019 was generated outside of the United States. Changes in exchange rates between the United States dollar and other currencies can impact our financial results in two ways: a translational impact and a transactional impact.

The translational impact refers to the impact that changes in exchange rates can have on our results of operations and financial position. The functional currencies of our foreign subsidiaries are generally the applicable local currencies. Our consolidated financial statements are presented in United States dollars. The results of operations in local foreign currencies are translated into United States dollars using an average exchange rate over the representative period and the assets and liabilities in local foreign currencies are translated into United States dollars using the closing exchange rate at the balance sheet date. Foreign exchange differences that arise from the translation of our foreign subsidiaries’ assets and liabilities into United States dollars are recorded as foreign currency translation adjustments in other comprehensive (loss) income. Accordingly, our results of operations and other comprehensive (loss) income will be unfavorably impacted during times of a strengthening United States dollar, particularly against the euro, the Brazilian real, the Japanese yen, the Korean won, the British pound sterling, the Australian dollar, the Canadian dollar and the Chinese yuan renminbi, and favorably impacted during times of a weakening United States dollar against those currencies.

Our 2019 revenues and net income decreased by approximately $215 million and $25 million, respectively, as compared to 2018 due to the impact of foreign currency translation. We currently expect a decrease in our revenue and net income in 2020 as compared to 2019 due to the impact of foreign currency translation.

In addition, in 2019 we recognized unfavorable foreign currency translation adjustments of $158 million within other comprehensive (loss) income principally driven by a strengthening of the United States dollar against the euro of 4% since

February 3, 2019

. Our foreign currency translation adjustments recorded in other comprehensive (loss) income are significantly impacted by the substantial amount of goodwill and other intangible assets denominated in the euro, which represented 33% of our $7.2 billion total goodwill and other intangible assets as of

February 2, 2020

. This translational impact was partially mitigated by the change in the fair value of our net investment hedges discussed below.

A transactional impact on financial results is common for apparel companies operating outside the United States that purchase goods in United States dollars, as is the case with most of our foreign operations. As with translation, our results of operations will be unfavorably impacted during times of a strengthening United States dollar as the increased local currency value of inventory results in a higher cost of goods in local currency when the goods are sold and favorably impacted during times of a weakening United States dollar as the decreased local currency value of inventory results in a lower cost of goods in local currency when the goods are sold. We also have exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates related to certain intercompany transactions and SG&A expenses. We currently use and plan to continue to use foreign currency forward exchange contracts or other derivative instruments to mitigate the cash flow or market value risks associated with these


inventory and intercompany transactions, but we are unable to entirely eliminate these risks. The foreign currency forward exchange contracts cover at least 70% of the projected inventory purchases in United States dollars by our foreign subsidiaries.

We currently expect a decrease in our net income in 2020 as compared to 2019 due to the transactional impact.

Given our foreign currency forward exchange contracts outstanding at

February 2, 2020

, the effect of a 10% change in foreign currency exchange rates against the United States dollar would result in a change in the fair value of these contracts of approximately $105 million. Any change in the fair value of these contracts would be substantially offset by a change in the fair value of the underlying hedged items.

In order to mitigate a portion of our exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates related to the value of our investments in foreign subsidiaries denominated in the euro, we designated the carrying amount of our €950 million aggregate principal amount of euro-denominated senior notes that we had issued in the United States as net investment hedges of our investments in certain of our foreign subsidiaries that use the euro as their functional currency. The effect of a 10% change in the euro against the United States dollar would result in a change in the fair value of the net investment hedges of approximately $105 million. Any change in the fair value of the net investment hedges would be more than offset by a change in the value of our investments in certain of our European subsidiaries. Additionally, during times of a strengthening United States dollar against the euro, we would be required to use a lower amount of our cash flows from operations to pay interest and make long-term debt repayments on our euro-denominated senior notes, whereas during times of a weakening United States dollar against the euro, we would be required to use a greater amount of our cash flows from operations to pay interest and make long-term debt repayments on these notes.

Included in the calculations of expense and liabilities for our pension plans are various assumptions, including return on assets, discount rates, mortality rates and future compensation increases. Actual results could differ from these assumptions, which would require adjustments to our balance sheet and could result in volatility in our future pension expense. Holding all other assumptions constant, a 1% change in the assumed rate of return on assets would result in a change to 2020 net benefit cost related to the pension plans of approximately $7 million. Likewise, a 0.25% change in the assumed discount rate would result in a change to 2020 net benefit cost of approximately $45 million.

SEASONALITY

Our business generally follows a seasonal pattern. Our wholesale businesses tend to generate higher levels of sales in the first and third quarters, while our retail businesses tend to generate higher levels of sales in the fourth quarter. Royalty, advertising and other revenue tends to be earned somewhat evenly throughout the year, although the third quarter has the highest level of royalty revenue due to higher sales by licensees in advance of the holiday selling season. We expect this seasonal pattern will generally continue. Working capital requirements vary throughout the year to support these seasonal patterns and business trends.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES

Our consolidated financial statements are based on the selection and application of significant accounting policies, which require management to make significant estimates and assumptions. Our significant accounting policies are outlined in

Note 1

, “

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

,” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this report. We believe that the following are the more critical judgmental areas in the application of our accounting policies that currently affect our financial position and results of operations:

Sales allowances and returns

—We have arrangements with many of our department and specialty store customers to support their sales of our products. We establish accruals which, based on a review of the individual customer arrangements and the expected performance of our products in their stores, we believe will be required to satisfy our sales allowance obligations. We also establish accruals, which are based on historical experience, an evaluation of current sales trends and market conditions, and authorized amounts, that we believe are necessary to provide for sales allowances and inventory returns. Our historical accrual estimates have not differed materially from actual results. It is possible that the accrual estimates could vary from actual results, which would require adjustment to the allowance and returns accruals.


Inventories—

Inventories are comprised principally of finished goods and are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value, except for certain retail inventories in North America that are stated at the lower of cost or market using the retail inventory method. Cost for substantially all wholesale inventories in North America and certain wholesale and retail inventories in Asia is determined using the first-in, first-out method. Cost for all other inventories is determined using the weighted average cost method. We review current business trends, inventory aging and discontinued merchandise categories to determine adjustments which we estimate will be needed to liquidate existing clearance inventories and record inventories at either the lower of cost or net realizable value or the lower of cost or market using the retail inventory method, as applicable. We believe that all inventory write-downs required at

February 2, 2020

have been recorded. Our historical estimates of inventory reserves have not differed materially from actual results. If market conditions were to change, including as a result of the current COVID-19 outbreak, it is possible that the required level of inventory reserves would need to be adjusted.

Asset impairments

—We determined during each of 2019, 2018 and 2017 that long-lived assets, primarily in certain of our retail stores and shop-in-shops, were not recoverable, which resulted in us recording impairment charges. Additionally, during 2019 we determined that certain operating lease right-of-use assets were impaired primarily as a result of the closure of certain flagship and anchor stores in the United States. In order to calculate these impairment charges, we estimated the undiscounted future cash flows and the related fair value of each asset. Undiscounted future cash flows were estimated using current sales trends and other factors and, in the case of operating lease right-of-use assets, using estimated sublease income assumptions. If different assumptions had been used, the recorded impairment charges could have been significantly higher or lower.

Note 12

, “

Fair Value Measurements

,” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this report includes further discussion of the circumstances surrounding the impairments and the assumptions related to the impairment charges.

Allowance for doubtful accounts

—Trade receivables, as presented in our Consolidated Balance Sheets, are net of an allowance for doubtful accounts. An allowance for doubtful accounts is determined through an analysis of the aging of accounts receivable and assessments of collectibility based on historic trends, the financial condition of our customers and an evaluation of economic conditions. Because we cannot predict future changes in economic conditions and in the financial stability of our customers, actual future losses from uncollectible accounts may differ from our estimates and could impact our allowance for doubtful accounts.

Income taxes

—Deferred income tax balances reflect the effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases and are stated at enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when taxes are actually paid or recovered. Deferred tax assets are evaluated for future realization and reduced by a valuation allowance to the extent we believe a portion will not be realized. We consider many factors when assessing the likelihood of future realization of our deferred tax assets, including our recent earnings experience and expectations of future taxable income by taxing jurisdiction, the carryforward periods available to us for tax reporting purposes and other relevant factors. The actual realization of deferred tax assets may differ significantly from the amounts we have recorded.

During the ordinary course of business, there are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain.

Accounting for income taxes requires a two-step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions. The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if available evidence indicates it is more likely than not that the tax position will be fully sustained upon review by taxing authorities, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount with a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. For tax positions that are 50 percent or less likely of being sustained upon audit, we do not recognize any portion of that benefit in the financial statements. We consider many factors when evaluating and estimating our tax positions and tax benefits, which may require periodic adjustments and which may not accurately anticipate actual outcomes. Our actual results have differed materially in the past and could differ materially in the future from our current estimates.

The U.S. Tax Legislation was enacted on December 22, 2017. The U.S. Tax Legislation is comprehensive and significantly revised the United States tax code. Please see

Goodwill and other intangible assets

—

Goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested for impairment annually, at the beginning of the third quarter of each fiscal year, and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate that it is more likely than not that the carrying amount may be impaired. Impairment testing for goodwill is done at the reporting unit level. A reporting unit is defined as an operating segment or one level below the operating segment, called a component. However, two or more components of an operating segment will be aggregated and deemed a single reporting unit if the components have similar economic characteristics.


We assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform a more detailed quantitative impairment test for goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets. We may elect to bypass the qualitative assessment and proceed directly to the quantitative test for any reporting units or indefinite-lived intangible assets. Qualitative factors that we consider as part of our assessment include a change in our market capitalization and its implied impact on reporting unit fair value, a change in our weighted average cost of capital, industry and market conditions, macroeconomic conditions, trends in product costs and financial performance of our businesses. If we perform the quantitative test for any reporting units or indefinite-lived intangible assets, we generally use a discounted cash flow method to estimate fair value. The discounted cash flow method is based on the present value of projected cash flows. Assumptions used in these cash flow projections are generally consistent with our internal forecasts. The estimated cash flows are discounted using a rate that represents our weighted average cost of capital. The weighted average cost of capital is based on a number of variables, including the equity-risk premium and risk-free interest rate. Management believes the assumptions used for the impairment tests are consistent with those that would be utilized by a market participant performing similar analysis and valuations. Adverse changes in future market conditions or weaker operating results compared to our expectations may impact our projected cash flows and estimates of weighted average cost of capital, which could result in a potential impairment charge if we are unable to recover the carrying value of our goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets. For goodwill, if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized to the extent the carrying amount of the reporting unit’s goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of the goodwill. For indefinite-lived intangible assets, an impairment loss is recognized to the extent the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value.

For the 2019 annual goodwill impairment test, we elected to bypass the qualitative assessment for all reporting units and proceeded directly to the quantitative impairment test using a discounted cash flow method to estimate the fair value of our reporting units. The annual goodwill impairment test during 2019 yielded estimated fair values in excess of the carrying amounts for all of our reporting units and therefore the second step of the quantitative goodwill impairment test was not required. The reporting unit with the least excess fair value had an estimated fair value that exceeded its carrying amount by

15%

. No impairment of goodwill resulted from our annual impairment test in 2019. In the fourth quarter of 2019, the Speedo transaction was a triggering event that indicated that the amount of goodwill allocated to the Heritage Brands Wholesale reporting unit, the reporting unit that includes the Speedo North America business, could be impaired, prompting the need to perform an interim goodwill impairment test for this reporting unit. No goodwill impairment resulted from this interim test. Please see Note 8, “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets,” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this report for further discussion.

For the 2018 annual goodwill impairment test, we elected to bypass the qualitative assessment and proceeded directly to the quantitative impairment test using a discounted cash flow method to estimate the fair value of our reporting units. The annual goodwill impairment test during 2018 yielded estimated fair values in excess of the carrying amounts for our reporting units, all of which had fair values in excess of the carrying amounts by more than 50%, and therefore the second step of the quantitative goodwill impairment test was not required. No impairment of goodwill resulted from our annual impairment test in 2018.

For the 2019 annual impairment test of all indefinite-lived intangible assets, except for the Australia reacquired perpetual license rights, we elected to bypass the qualitative assessment and proceeded directly to the quantitative impairment test using a discounted cash flow method to estimate fair value. For the Australia reacquired perpetual license rights, since only a few months had passed since the acquisition on May 31, 2019 and the business had performed better than initially expected, we determined qualitatively that it was not more likely than not that the fair value of these reacquired perpetual license rights were less than the carrying amount and concluded that the quantitative impairment test was not required. The fair values of all of our indefinite-lived intangible assets substantially exceed their carrying amounts, with the exception of the perpetual license right related to our Speedo North America business, which had a fair value that exceeded its carrying amount by 3% at the testing date. In the fourth quarter of 2019, the Speedo transaction was a triggering event that prompted the need to perform an interim impairment test of this perpetual license right. As a result of this interim test, the perpetual license right was determined to be impaired and an impairment charge of $116 million was recorded to other noncash loss, net in the Consolidated Income Statement. Please see

Note 4

, “

Assets Held For Sale

,” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this report for further discussion.

For the 2018 annual impairment test of all indefinite-lived intangible assets, except for the

Geoffrey Beene

tradename, we elected to bypass the qualitative assessment and proceeded directly to the quantitative impairment test using a discounted cash flow method to estimate fair value. For the

Geoffrey Beene

tradename, since only a few months had passed since the acquisition on April 20, 2018 and there had not been any significant changes in the business, we determined qualitatively that it was not more likely than not that the fair value of this tradename was less than the carrying amount and concluded that the


quantitative impairment test was not required. No impairment of indefinite-lived intangible assets resulted from our annual impairment tests in 2018.

If different assumptions for our goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets impairment tests had been applied, significantly different outcomes could have resulted. There can be no assurance that the estimates and assumptions used in our goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets impairment testing performed in 2019 will prove to be accurate predictions of the future. For example, if general macroeconomic conditions deteriorate or otherwise vary from current assumptions (including those resulting in changes in the weighted average cost of capital), industry or market conditions deteriorate, business conditions or strategies for a specific reporting unit change from current assumptions, including cost increases or loss of major customers, our businesses do not perform as projected, or there is an extended period of a significant decline in our stock price, this could be an indicator that the excess fair value of our reporting units could be lessened and the chance of an impairment of goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets could be raised.

Pension and Benefit Plans

—Pension and benefit plan expenses are recorded throughout the year based on calculations using actuarial valuations that incorporate estimates and assumptions that depend in part on financial market, economic and demographic conditions, including expected long-term rate of return on assets, discount rate and mortality rates. These assumptions require significant judgment. Actuarial gains and losses, which occur when actual experience differs from our actuarial assumptions, are recognized in the year in which they occur and could have a material impact on our operating results. These gains and losses are measured at least annually at the end of our fiscal year and, as such, are generally recorded during the fourth quarter of each year.

The expected long-term rate of return on assets is based on historical returns and the level of risk premium associated with the asset classes in which the portfolio is invested as well as expectations for the long-term future returns of each asset class. The expected long-term rate of return for each asset class is then weighted based on the target asset allocation to develop the expected long-term rate of return on assets assumption for the portfolio. The expected return on plan assets is recognized quarterly and determined at the beginning of the year by applying the long-term expected rate of return on assets to the actual fair value of plan assets adjusted for expected benefit payments, contributions and plan expenses. At the end of the year, the fair value of the assets is remeasured and any difference between the actual return on assets and the expected return is recorded in earnings as part of the actuarial gain or loss.

The discount rate is determined based on current market interest rates. It is selected by constructing a hypothetical portfolio of high quality corporate bonds that matches the cash flows from interest payments and principal maturities of the portfolio to the timing of benefit payments to participants. The yield on such a portfolio is the basis for the selected discount rate. Service and interest cost is measured using the discount rate as of the beginning of the year, while the projected benefit obligation is measured using the discount rate as of the end of the year. The impact of the change in the discount rate on our projected benefit obligation is recorded in earnings as part of the actuarial gain or loss.

We revised during each of 2019 and 2018 the mortality assumptions used to determine our benefit obligations based on recently published actuarial mortality tables. These changes in life expectancy resulted in changes to the period for which we expect benefits to be paid. In 2019 and 2018, the decrease in life expectancy decreased our benefit obligations and future expense.

We also periodically review and revise, as necessary, other plan assumptions such as rates of compensation increases, retirement, and termination based on historical experience and anticipated future management actions. We have not historically had significant adjustments to these assumptions.

Actual results could differ from our assumptions, which would require adjustments to our balance sheet and could result in volatility in our future net benefit cost. Holding all other assumptions constant, a 1% change in the assumed rate of return on assets would result in a change to 2020 net benefit cost related to the pension plans of approximately $7 million. Likewise, a 0.25% change in the assumed discount rate would result in a change to 2020 net benefit cost of approximately $45 million.

Note 13

, “

Retirement and Benefit Plans

,” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this report sets forth certain significant rate assumptions and information regarding our target asset allocation, which are used in performing calculations related to our pension plans.

Stock-based compensation

—Accounting for stock-based compensation requires measurement of compensation cost for all stock-based awards at fair value on the date of grant and recognition of compensation cost over the service period for


awards expected to vest. We use the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model to determine the fair value of our stock options. This model uses assumptions that include the risk-free interest rate, expected volatility, expected dividend yield and expected life of the options. The fair value of restricted stock units is determined based on the quoted price of our common stock on the date of grant. The fair value of our stock options and restricted stock units is recognized as expense over the service period, net of actual forfeitures.

The fair value of contingently issuable performance shares that are subject to market conditions is established using a Monte Carlo simulation model. Certain contingently issuable performance shares that are subject to market conditions are also subject to a holding period of one year after the vesting date. For such awards, the grant date fair value is discounted for the restriction of liquidity, which is calculated using the Chaffe model. We record expense for the awards that are subject to market conditions ratably over the vesting period, net of actual forfeitures, regardless of whether the market condition is satisfied.

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Description of Business

— PVH Corp. and its consolidated subsidiaries (collectively, the “Company”) constitute a global apparel company with a brand portfolio consisting of nationally and internationally recognized trademarks, including

TOMMY HILFIGER, CALVIN KLEIN, Van Heusen, IZOD, ARROW, Warner’s, Olga

,

True&Co.

and

Geoffrey Beene

, which are owned, as well as

various other owned, licensed and, to a lesser extent, private label brands

.

The Company also licenses

Speedo

for North America and the Caribbean in perpetuity from Speedo International Limited. The Company entered into a definitive agreement on January 9, 2020 to sell its Speedo North America business to Pentland Group PLC (“Pentland”), the parent company of Speedo International Limited, (the “Speedo transaction”). The Company will deconsolidate the net assets of the Speedo North America business and no longer license the

Speedo

trademark upon closing of the sale, which is expected to occur in the first quarter of 2020, subject to customary closing conditions, including clearance under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, which was received early in the first quarter of 2020.

The Company designs and markets branded dress shirts, neckwear, sportswear (casual apparel), jeanswear, performance apparel, intimate apparel, underwear, swimwear, swim products, handbags, accessories, footwear and other related products and licenses its owned brands globally over a broad array of product categories and for use in numerous discrete jurisdictions.

Principles of Consolidation

— The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company. Intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Investments in entities that the Company does not control but has the ability to exercise significant influence over are accounted for using the equity method of accounting. The Company’s Consolidated Income Statements include its proportionate share of the net income or loss of these entities. Please see

Note 6

, “

Investments in Unconsolidated Affiliates

,” for further discussion. The Company and Arvind Limited (“Arvind”) have a joint venture in Ethiopia, PVH Arvind Manufacturing Private Limited Company (“PVH Ethiopia”), in which the Company owns a


%

interest. PVH Ethiopia is consolidated and the minority shareholder’s proportionate share (


%

) of the equity in this joint venture is accounted for as a redeemable non-controlling interest. Please see

Note 7

, “

Redeemable Non-Controlling Interest

,” for further discussion.

Use of Estimates

— The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ materially from the estimates.

Fiscal Year

— The Company uses a


-


week fiscal year ending on the Sunday closest to February 1. References to a year are to the Company’s fiscal year, unless the context requires otherwise. Results for


,


and


represent the


weeks ended

February 2, 2020

,


weeks ended

February 3, 2019

and


weeks ended

February 4, 2018

, respectively.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

— The Company considers all highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents. Cash equivalents also includes amounts due from third party credit card processors for the settlement of customer debit and credit card transactions that are collectible in one week or less. The Company’s cash and cash equivalents at

February 2, 2020

consisted principally of bank deposits and investments in money market funds.

Accounts Receivable

— Trade receivables, as presented in the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets, are net of returns and allowances. An allowance for doubtful accounts is determined through an analysis of the aging of accounts receivable and assessments of collectibility based on historic trends, the financial condition of the Company’s customers and an evaluation of economic conditions. The Company writes off uncollectible trade receivables once collection efforts have been exhausted and third parties confirm the balance is not recoverable. Costs associated with allowable customer markdowns and operational chargebacks, net of the expected recoveries, are part of the provision for allowances included in accounts receivable. These provisions result from seasonal negotiations, historical experience, and an evaluation of current market conditions.

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

— The Company assesses the recoverability of goodwill annually, at the beginning of the third quarter of each fiscal year, and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate that it is more likely than not that the carrying amount may be impaired. Impairment testing for goodwill is done at the

F-7

reporting unit level. A reporting unit is defined as an operating segment or one level below the operating segment, called a component. However, two or more components of an operating segment will be aggregated and deemed a single reporting unit if the components have similar economic characteristics.

The Company assesses qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform a more detailed two-step quantitative goodwill impairment test. The Company may elect to bypass the qualitative assessment and proceed directly to the quantitative test for any reporting unit. The quantitative goodwill impairment test, if necessary, is a two-step process. The first step is to identify the existence of a potential impairment by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit (the fair value of a reporting unit is estimated using a discounted cash flow model) with its carrying amount, including goodwill. If the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, the reporting unit’s goodwill is considered not to be impaired and performance of the second step of the quantitative goodwill impairment test is unnecessary. However, if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the second step of the quantitative goodwill impairment test is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss to be recorded, if any. The second step of the quantitative goodwill impairment test compares the implied fair value of a reporting unit’s goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit’s goodwill exceeds its implied fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. The implied fair value of goodwill is determined using the same approach as used when determining the amount of goodwill that would be recognized in a business combination. That is, the fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to all of its assets and liabilities as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination and the fair value was the purchase price paid to acquire the reporting unit.

For the 2019 annual goodwill impairment test, the Company elected to bypass the qualitative assessment for all reporting units and proceeded directly to the quantitative impairment test using a discounted cash flow method to estimate the fair value of its reporting units. The Company’s annual goodwill impairment test during 2019 yielded estimated fair values in excess of the carrying amounts for all of the Company’s reporting units and therefore the second step of the quantitative goodwill impairment test was not required. The reporting unit with the least excess fair value had an estimated fair value that exceeded its carrying amount by


%

. No impairment of goodwill resulted from the Company’s annual impairment test in 2019. In the fourth quarter of 2019, the Speedo transaction was a triggering event that indicated that the amount of goodwill allocated to the Heritage Brands Wholesale reporting unit, the reporting unit that includes the Speedo North America business, could be impaired, prompting the need for the Company to perform an interim goodwill impairment test for this reporting unit. No goodwill impairment resulted from this interim test.

For the 2018 annual goodwill impairment test, the Company elected to bypass the qualitative assessment and proceeded directly to the quantitative impairment test using a discounted cash flow method to estimate the fair value of its reporting units. The Company’s annual goodwill impairment test during 2018 yielded estimated fair values in excess of the carrying amounts for the Company’s reporting units, all of which had fair values in excess of the carrying amounts by more than


%

, and therefore the second step of the quantitative goodwill impairment test was not required. No impairment of goodwill resulted from the Company’s annual impairment test in 2018.

Indefinite-lived intangible assets not subject to amortization are tested for impairment annually, at the beginning of the third quarter of each fiscal year, and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate that it is more likely than not that the carrying amount may be impaired. The Company assesses qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform a more detailed quantitative impairment test for its indefinite-lived intangible assets. The Company may elect to bypass the qualitative assessment and proceed directly to the quantitative impairment test. When performing the quantitative test, an impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset, which is generally determined using the estimated discounted cash flows associated with the asset’s use. Intangible assets with finite lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives and are tested for impairment along with other long-lived assets when events and circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired.

For the 2019 annual impairment test of all indefinite-lived intangible assets, except for the Australia reacquired perpetual license rights, the Company elected to bypass the qualitative assessment and proceeded directly to the quantitative impairment test using a discounted cash flow method to estimate fair value. For the Australia reacquired perpetual license rights, since only a few months had passed since the acquisition on May 31, 2019 and the business had performed better than initially expected, the Company determined qualitatively that it was not more likely than not that the fair value of these reacquired perpetual license rights were less than the carrying amount and concluded that the quantitative impairment test was not required. The fair values of all of the Company’s indefinite-lived intangible assets substantially exceed their carrying amounts, with the exception of the Company’s perpetual license right related to its Speedo North America business, which had a fair value that exceeded its

F-8

carrying amount by


%

at the testing date. In the fourth quarter of 2019, the Speedo transaction was a triggering event that prompted the need for the Company to perform an interim impairment test of this perpetual license right. As a result of this interim test, the perpetual license right was determined to be impaired and an impairment charge of $

116.4

million was recorded in other noncash loss, net in the Company’s Consolidated Income Statement. Please see

Note 4

, “

Assets Held For Sale

,” for further discussion.

For the 2018 annual impairment test of all indefinite-lived intangible assets, except for the

Geoffrey Beene

tradename, the Company elected to bypass the qualitative assessment and proceeded directly to the quantitative impairment test using a discounted cash flow method to estimate fair value. For the

Geoffrey Beene

tradename, since only a few months had passed since the acquisition on April 20, 2018 and there had not been any significant changes in the business, the Company determined qualitatively that it was not more likely than not that the fair value of this tradename was less than the carrying amount and concluded that the quantitative impairment test was not required. No impairment of indefinite-lived intangible assets resulted from the Company’s annual impairment tests in 2018.

Asset Impairments

— The Company reviews for impairment of long-lived assets (excluding goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets) when events and circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired. The Company records an impairment loss when the carrying amount of the asset is not recoverable and exceeds its fair value. Please see

Note 12

, “

Fair Value Measurements

,” for further discussion.

Inventories

—

Inventories are comprised principally of finished goods and are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value, except for certain retail inventories in North America that are stated at the lower of cost or market using the retail inventory method. Cost for substantially all wholesale inventories in North America and certain wholesale and retail inventories in Asia is determined using the first-in, first-out method. Cost for all other inventories is determined using the weighted average cost method. The Company reviews current business trends, inventory aging and discontinued merchandise categories to determine adjustments that it estimates will be needed to liquidate existing clearance inventories and record inventories at either the lower of cost or net realizable value or the lower of cost or market using the retail inventory method, as applicable.

Property, Plant and Equipment

— Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is generally provided over the estimated useful lives of the related assets on a straight-line basis. The range of useful lives is principally as follows: Buildings and building improvements —


to


years; machinery, software and equipment —


to


years; furniture and fixtures —


to


years; and fixtures located in shop-in-shop/concession locations and their related costs —


to


years. Leasehold improvements are depreciated using the straight-line method over the lesser of the term of the related lease or the estimated useful life of the asset. In certain circumstances, contractual renewal options are considered when determining the term of the related lease. Major additions and improvements that extend the useful life of the asset are capitalized, and repairs and maintenance are charged to operations in the period incurred.

Depreciation expense totaled $

275.0

million, $

263.9

million and $

252.2

million in


,


and


, respectively.

Cloud Computing Arrangements

— The Company incurs costs to implement cloud computing arrangements that are hosted by a third party vendor. Implementation costs incurred during the application development stage of a project are capitalized and amortized over the term of the hosting arrangement on a straight-line basis. The Company capitalized $

16.6

million of costs incurred in


to implement cloud computing arrangements, primarily related to digital and consumer data platforms. Amortization expense totaled $

0.9

million in 2019. Cloud computing costs of $

15.7

million were included in prepaid expenses and other assets in the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheet as of February 2, 2020.

The Company’s policy for accounting for implementation costs incurred in a cloud computing arrangement that is a service contract reflects changes made in 2019 following the adoption of the updated cloud computing guidance. Please see the section “

Recently Adopted Accounting Guidance

” below for further discussion.

Leases

— The Company leases retail locations, warehouses, distribution centers, showrooms, office space and a factory in Ethiopia, as well as certain equipment and other assets. The Company recognizes right-of-use assets and lease liabilities at the lease commencement date based on the present value of fixed lease payments over the expected lease term. Operating leases are included in operating lease right-of-use assets, current portion of operating lease liabilities and long-term portion of operating lease liabilities in the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheet. Finance leases are included in property, plant and equipment, net, accrued expenses and other liabilities in the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheet. Please see

Revenue Recognition

— Revenue is recognized upon the transfer of control of products or services to the Company’s customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which it expects to be entitled in exchange for those products or services. Please see

Note 2

, “

Revenue

,” for further discussion.

Cost of Goods Sold and Selling, General and Administrative Expenses

— Costs associated with the production and procurement of product are included in cost of goods sold, including inbound freight costs, purchasing and receiving costs, inspection costs and other product procurement related charges, as well as the amounts recognized on foreign currency forward exchange contracts as the underlying inventory hedged by such forward exchange contracts is sold. Generally, all other expenses, excluding non-service related pension and post retirement (income) costs, interest and income taxes, are included in selling, general and administrative (“SG&A”) expenses, including warehousing and distribution expenses, as the predominant expenses associated therewith are general and administrative in nature, including rent, utilities, payroll and depreciation and amortization. Warehousing and distribution expenses, which are subject to exchange rate fluctuations, totaled $

351.4

million, $

307.7

million and $

272.6

million in


,


and


, respectively.

Shipping and Handling Fees

— Shipping and handling fees that are billed to customers are included in net sales. Shipping and handling costs incurred by the Company are recorded in SG&A expenses.

Advertising

— Advertising costs are expensed as incurred and are included in SG&A expenses. Advertising expenses, which are subject to exchange rate fluctuations, totaled $

509.7

million,

$

526.0

million and

$

501.3

million in


,


and


, respectively. Prepaid advertising expenses recorded in prepaid expenses and other assets totaled $

5.9

million and

$

7.3

million at

February 2, 2020

and

February 3, 2019

, respectively.

Costs associated with cooperative advertising programs, under which the Company shares the cost of a customer’s advertising expenditures, are treated as a reduction of revenue.

Sales Taxes

— The Company accounts for sales taxes and other related taxes on a net basis, excluding such taxes from revenue.

Income Taxes

— Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the consolidated financial statements. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply in the periods in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in the period that includes the enactment date. Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts more likely than not to be realized.

Significant judgment is required in assessing the timing and amount of deductible and taxable items, evaluating tax positions and determining the income tax provision. The Company recognizes income tax benefits only when it is more likely than not that the tax position will be fully sustained upon review by taxing authorities, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. If the recognition threshold is met, the Company measures the tax benefit at the largest amount with a greater than


percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. For tax positions that are


percent or less likely of being sustained upon audit, the Company does not recognize any portion of that benefit in the financial statements. When the outcome of these tax matters changes, the change in estimate impacts the provision for income taxes in the period that such a determination is made. The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in the Company’s income tax provision.

The United States Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the “U.S. Tax Legislation”) was enacted on December 22, 2017. The U.S. Tax Legislation is comprehensive and significantly revised the United States tax code. Please see

Note 10

,” for further discussion of the U.S. Tax Legislation.

Financial

Instruments

— The Company has exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates related to anticipated cash flows primarily associated with certain international inventory purchases. The Company uses foreign currency forward exchange contracts to hedge against a portion of this exposure. The Company also has exposure to interest rate volatility related to its secured term loan facilities. The Company enters into interest rate swap agreements to hedge against a portion of this exposure. The Company records the foreign currency forward exchange contracts and interest rate swap agreements at fair value in its Consolidated Balance Sheets and does not net the related assets and liabilities. The fair value of the foreign currency forward exchange contracts is measured as the total amount of currency to be purchased, multiplied by the difference between (i) the forward rate as of the period end and (ii) the settlement rate specified in each contract. The fair value of the interest rate swap agreements is based on observable interest rate yield curves and represents the expected discounted cash flows underlying

F-10

the financial instruments. Changes in fair value of the foreign currency forward exchange contracts primarily associated with certain international inventory purchases and the interest rate swap agreements that are designated as effective hedging instruments (collectively referred to as “cash flow hedges”) are recorded in equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss (“AOCL”).

The Company also has exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates related to the value of its investments in foreign subsidiaries denominated in a currency other than the United States dollar. To hedge against a portion of this exposure, the Company designates certain foreign currency borrowings issued in the United States as a net investment hedge of its investments in certain of its foreign subsidiaries that use a functional currency other than the United States dollar. Changes in fair value of the foreign currency borrowings designated as net investment hedges are recorded in equity as a component of AOCL. The Company evaluates the effectiveness of its net investment hedges at inception and as of the beginning of each quarter.

The Company records immediately in earnings changes in the fair value of hedges that are not designated as effective hedging instruments (“undesignated contracts”). Undesignated contracts include all of the foreign currency forward exchange contracts related to intercompany transactions and intercompany loans that are not of a long-term investment nature. Any gains and losses that are immediately recognized in earnings on such contracts are largely offset by the remeasurement of the underlying intercompany balances. Undesignated contracts also include foreign currency option contracts previously used by the Company to hedge against changes in foreign currency exchange rates related to the translation of the earnings of the Company’s subsidiaries that use a functional currency other than the United States dollar. The fair value of the foreign currency option contracts was estimated based on external valuation models, which used the original strike price, then current foreign currency exchange rates, the implied volatility in foreign currency exchange rates at the time and length of time to expiration as inputs. All foreign currency option contracts expired in 2017.

The Company does not use derivative or non-derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. Cash flows from the Company’s hedges are presented in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows in the same category as the items being hedged. Please see

Note 11

, “

Derivative Financial Instruments

,” for further discussion.

Foreign Currency Translation and Transactions

— The consolidated financial statements of the Company are prepared in United States dollars. If the functional currency of a foreign subsidiary is not the United States dollar, assets and liabilities are translated to United States dollars at the closing exchange rate in effect at the applicable balance sheet date and revenue and expenses are translated to United States dollars at the average exchange rate for the applicable period. Gains and losses on the revaluation of intercompany loans made between foreign subsidiaries that are of a long-term investment nature are included in AOCL. Gains and losses arising from transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of a particular entity, not including inventory purchases, are principally included in SG&A expenses and totaled a loss (gain) of $

16.2

million, $

17.3

million and $

(

)

million in


,


and


, respectively

.

Balance Sheet Classification of Early Settlements of Long-Term Obligations

— The Company classifies obligations settled after the balance sheet date but prior to the issuance of the consolidated financial statements based on the contractual payment terms of the underlying agreements.

Pension and Benefit Plans

— Employee pension benefits earned during the year, as well as interest on the projected benefit obligations or accumulated benefit obligations, are accrued quarterly. The expected return on plan assets is recognized quarterly and determined at the beginning of the year by applying the expected long-term rate of return on assets to the actual fair value of plan assets adjusted for expected benefit payments, contributions and plan expenses. Actuarial gains and losses are recognized in the Company’s operating results in the year in which they occur. These gains and losses include the difference between the actual return on plan assets and the expected return that was recognized quarterly, as well as the change in the projected benefit obligation caused by actual experience and updated actuarial assumptions differing from those assumptions used to record service and interest cost throughout the year. Actuarial gains and losses are measured at least annually at the end of the Company’s fiscal year and, as such, are generally recorded during the fourth quarter of each year. The service cost component of net benefit cost is recorded in SG&A expenses and the other components of net benefit cost are recorded in non-service related pension and postretirement cost (income) in the Company’s Consolidated Income Statements. Please see

Note 13

F-11

Stock-Based Compensation

—

The Company recognizes all share-based payments to employees and non-employee directors, net of actual forfeitures, as compensation expense in the consolidated financial statements based on their grant date fair values. Please see

Note 14

, “Stock-Based Compensation,” for further discussion.

Recently Adopted Accounting Guidance

— The Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued in February 2016 new guidance on leases. The new guidance, among other changes, requires lessees to recognize a right-of-use asset and a lease liability in the balance sheet for most leases, but retains an expense recognition model similar to the previous guidance. The lease liability is measured at the present value of the fixed lease payments over the lease term and the right-of-use asset is measured at the lease liability amount, adjusted for lease prepayments, lease incentives received and the lessee’s initial direct costs. The guidance also requires additional quantitative and qualitative disclosures. The Company adopted the guidance in the first quarter of 2019 using the modified retrospective approach applied as of the period of adoption with a cumulative-effect adjustment to opening retained earnings and as such, prior periods have not been restated. Upon adoption, the Company (i) recognized operating lease right-of-use assets of $

1.7

billion and lease liabilities of $

1.9

billion, (ii) recorded a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings of $

3.1

million and (iii) recorded other reclassification adjustments within its Consolidated Balance Sheet related to, among other things, deferred rent.

The effects of the adoption on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheet as of

February 3, 2019

were as follows:

The Company also elected the package of practical expedients permitted under the transition guidance, which allows the Company not to reassess whether any existing contracts are or contain a lease, the lease classification for any existing leases, and the capitalization of initial direct costs for any existing leases, as of the adoption date. The Company’s accounting for finance leases (formerly called capital leases) remains substantially unchanged. The adoption of the guidance did not have a material impact on the Company’s results of operations or cash flows. Please see

Note 17

, “

Leases

,” for additional disclosures required by the guidance.

The FASB issued in August 2017 an update to accounting guidance to simplify the application of hedge accounting in certain situations and allow companies to better align their hedge accounting with their risk management activities. The update eliminates the requirement to separately measure and report hedge ineffectiveness and requires companies to recognize all elements of hedge accounting that impact earnings in the same income statement line as the hedged item. The update also simplifies the requirements for hedge documentation and effectiveness assessments and amends the presentation and disclosure requirements. The Company adopted this update in the first quarter of 2019 using a modified retrospective approach, except for the presentation and disclosure guidance, which is being applied on a prospective basis, as required. The adoption of this update did not have any impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.

The FASB issued in August 2018 an update to accounting guidance related to implementation costs incurred in a cloud computing arrangement that is a service contract. The update aligns the requirements for capitalizing implementation costs incurred under such arrangements with the requirements for capitalizing costs incurred to develop or obtain internal-use software. Under previous accounting guidance, the Company generally expensed the implementation costs incurred in

F-12

connection with a cloud computing arrangement that is a service contract. The Company early adopted this update in the first quarter of 2019 using a prospective approach and, as a result, has capitalized $

16.6

million of costs incurred in 2019 to implement cloud computing arrangements, primarily related to digital and consumer data platforms. Such costs were included in prepaid expenses and other assets in the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheet.

Accounting Guidance Issued But Not Adopted as of

February 2, 2020

— The FASB issued in June 2016 an update to accounting guidance that introduces a new impairment model used to measure credit losses for certain financial assets measured at amortized cost, including trade and other receivables. This update requires entities to record an allowance for credit losses using a forward-looking expected loss impairment model that considers historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect collectibility, rather than the incurred loss model required under existing guidance. The update will be effective for the Company in the first quarter of 2020. Entities are required to apply the update using a modified-retrospective approach with a cumulative effect adjustment to opening retained earnings in the period of adoption. The adoption of this update is not expected to have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.

The FASB issued in December 2019 an update to accounting guidance to simplify the accounting for income taxes by eliminating certain exceptions to the existing guidance and clarifying and amending certain guidance to reduce diversity in practice. The update eliminates certain exceptions to the guidance related to the approach for intraperiod tax allocation, the methodology for calculating income taxes in an interim period and the recognition of deferred tax liabilities for outside basis differences. The update also simplifies aspects of the accounting for franchise taxes and enacted changes in tax laws or rates and clarifies the accounting for transactions that result in a step-up in the tax basis of goodwill. The update will be effective for the Company in the first quarter of 2021, with early adoption permitted. Most amendments in the update are required to be adopted using a prospective approach, while other amendments must be adopted using a modified-retrospective approach or retrospective approach. The Company is currently evaluating the update to determine the impact of the adoption on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.

2.

REVENUE

The Company generates revenue primarily from sales of finished products under its owned and licensed trademarks through its wholesale and retail operations. The Company also generates royalty and advertising revenue from licensing the rights to its trademarks to third parties. Revenue is recognized upon the transfer of control of products or services to the Company’s customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which it expects to be entitled in exchange for those products or services.

Product Sales

The Company generates revenue from the wholesale distribution of its products to traditional retailers (including for sale through their digital commerce sites), pure play digital commerce retailers, franchisees, licensees and distributors. Revenue is recognized upon transfer of control of goods to the customer, which generally occurs when title to goods is passed and risk of loss transfers to the customer. Depending on the contract terms, transfer of control is upon shipment of goods to or upon receipt of goods by the customer.

Payment is typically due within 30 to 90 days.

The amount of revenue recognized is net of returns, sales allowances and other discounts that the Company offers to its wholesale customers. The Company estimates returns based on an analysis of historical experience and specific customer arrangements and estimates sales allowances and other discounts based on seasonal negotiations, historical experience and an evaluation of current market conditions.

The Company also generates revenue from the retail distribution of its products through its freestanding stores, shop-in-shop/concession locations and digital commerce sites. Revenue is recognized at the point of sale in the stores and shop-in-shop/concession locations and upon estimated time of delivery for sales through the Company’s digital commerce sites, at which point control of the products passes to the customer. The amount of revenue recognized is net of returns, which are estimated based on an analysis of historical experience. Costs associated with coupons are recorded as a reduction of revenue at the time of coupon redemption.

The Company excludes from revenue taxes collected from customers and remitted to government authorities related to sales of the Company’s products. Shipping and handling costs that are billed to customers are included in net sales.

F-13

Customer Loyalty Programs

The Company uses loyalty programs that offer customers of its retail businesses specified amounts off of future purchases for a specified period of time after certain levels of spending are achieved. Customers that are enrolled in the programs earn loyalty points for each purchase made.

Loyalty points earned under the customer loyalty programs provide the customer a material right to acquire additional products and give rise to the Company having a separate performance obligation. For each transaction where a customer earns loyalty points, the Company allocates revenue between the products purchased and the loyalty points earned based on the relative standalone selling prices. Revenue allocated to loyalty points is recorded as deferred revenue until the loyalty points are redeemed or expire.

Gift Cards

The Company sells gift cards to customers in its retail stores. The Company does not charge administrative fees on gift cards nor do they expire. Gift card purchases by a customer are prepayments for products to be provided by the Company in the future and are therefore considered to be performance obligations of the Company. Upon the purchase of a gift card by a customer, the Company records deferred revenue for the cash value of the gift card. Deferred revenue is relieved and revenue is recognized when the gift card is redeemed by the customer. The portion of gift cards that the Company does not expect to be redeemed (referred to as “breakage”) is recognized proportionately over the estimated customer redemption period, subject to the constraint that it must be probable that a significant reversal of revenue will not occur, if the Company determines that it does not have a legal obligation to remit the value of such unredeemed gift cards to any jurisdiction.

License Agreements

The Company generates royalty and advertising revenue from licensing the rights to access its trademarks to third parties, including the Company’s joint ventures. The license agreements are generally exclusive to a territory or product category, have terms in excess of one year and, in most cases, include renewal options. In exchange for providing these rights, the license agreements require the licensees to pay the Company a royalty and, in certain agreements, an advertising fee. In both cases, the Company generally receives the greater of (i) a sales-based percentage fee and (ii) a contractual minimum fee for each annual performance period under the license agreement.

In addition to the rights to access its trademarks, the Company provides ongoing support to its licensees over the term of the agreements. As such, the Company’s license agreements are licenses of symbolic intellectual property and, therefore, revenue is recognized over time. For license agreements where the sales-based percentage fee exceeds the contractual minimum fee, the Company recognizes revenues as the licensed products are sold as reported to the Company by its licensees. For license agreements where the sales-based percentage fee does not exceed the contractual minimum fee, the Company recognizes the contractual minimum fee as revenue ratably over the contractual period.

Under the terms of the license agreements, payments are generally due quarterly from the licensees. The Company records deferred revenue when amounts are received or receivable from the licensee in advance of the recognition of revenue.

As of

February 2, 2020

, the contractual minimum fees on the portion of all license agreements not yet satisfied totaled $

1.2

billion, of which the Company expects to recognize $

291.5

million as revenue in 2020,

$

242.4

million in 2021 and $

684.2

million thereafter.

F-14

Deferred Revenue

Changes in deferred revenue, which primarily relate to customer loyalty programs, gift cards and license agreements for the years ended

February 2, 2020

and

February 3, 2019

, were as follows:

(1)

Represents the amount of revenue recognized during the period that was included in the deferred revenue balance at the beginning of the period, as adjusted in 2018 for the impact of adopting the new revenue standard, and does not contemplate revenue recognized from amounts deferred during the period.

The Company also had long-term deferred revenue liabilities included in other liabilities in its Consolidated Balance Sheets of $

10.3

million and $

2.3

million as of

February 2, 2020

and

February 3, 2019

, respectively.

Optional Exemptions

The Company elected not to disclose the remaining performance obligations for contracts that have an original expected term of one year or less and expected sales-based percentage fees for the portion of all license agreements not yet satisfied.

ACQUISITIONS

TH CSAP Acquisition

The Company acquired on July 1, 2019 the Tommy Hilfiger retail business in Central and Southeast Asia from the Company’s previous licensee in that market (the “TH CSAP acquisition”). As a result of the TH CSAP acquisition, the Company now operates directly the Tommy Hilfiger retail business in the Central and Southeast Asia market.

The acquisition date fair value of the consideration paid was $

74.3

million. The estimated fair value of the assets acquired consisted of $

63.9

million of goodwill and $

10.4

million of other net assets. The goodwill of $

63.9

million was assigned as of the acquisition date to the Company’s Tommy Hilfiger International segment, which is the Company’s reporting unit that is expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination. Goodwill is not expected to be deductible for tax purposes. The Company is still in the process of finalizing the valuation of the assets acquired; thus, the allocation of the acquisition consideration is subject to change.

Australia Acquisition

The Company acquired on May 31, 2019 the approximately


%

ownership interests in Gazal Corporation Limited (“Gazal”) that it did not already own (the “Australia acquisition”). Prior to the Australia acquisition, the Company and Gazal jointly owned and managed a joint venture, PVH Brands Australia Pty. Limited (“PVH Australia”), with each owning a


%

interest. PVH Australia licensed and operated businesses in Australia, New Zealand and other parts of Oceania under the

TOMMY HILFIGER

,

CALVIN KLEIN

and

Van Heusen

brands, along with other owned and licensed brands. PVH Australia came under the Company’s full control as a result of the acquisition. The Company now operates directly those businesses.

Prior to May 31, 2019, the Company accounted for its approximately


%

interest in Gazal and its


%

interest in PVH Australia under the equity method of accounting. Following the completion of the Australia acquisition, the results of Gazal and PVH Australia have been consolidated in the Company’s consolidated financial statements.

F-15

Gain on Previously Held Equity Investments

The carrying values of the Company’s approximately


%

interest in Gazal and


%

interest in PVH Australia prior to the acquisition were $

16.5

million and $

41.9

million, respectively. In connection with the acquisition, these investments were remeasured to fair values of $

40.1

million and $

131.4

million, respectively, resulting in the recognition of an aggregate noncash gain of $

113.1

million during the second quarter of 2019, which was included in other noncash loss, net in the Company’s Consolidated Income Statement.

The fair value of the Company’s investment in Gazal was determined using the trading price of Gazal’s common stock, which was listed on the Australian Securities Exchange, on the date of the acquisition. The Company classified this as a Level 1 fair value measurement due to the use of an unadjusted quoted price in an active market. The fair value of Gazal included the fair value of Gazal’s


%

interest in PVH Australia. As such, the Company derived the fair value of its investment in PVH Australia from the fair value of Gazal by adjusting for (i) Gazal’s non-operating assets and net debt position and (ii) the estimated future operating cash flows of Gazal’s standalone operations, which were discounted at a rate of

12.5

%

to account for the relative risks of the estimated future cash flows. The Company classified this as a Level 3 fair value measurement due to the use of significant unobservable inputs.

Mandatorily Redeemable Non-Controlling Interest

Pursuant to the terms of the acquisition agreement, key members of Gazal and PVH Australia management exchanged a portion of their interests in Gazal for approximately


%

of the outstanding shares in the previously wholly owned subsidiary of the Company that acquired


%

of the ownership interests in the Australia business. The Company is obligated to purchase this


%

interest within two years of the acquisition closing in two tranches as follows: tranche 1 –


%

of the shares

one year after the closing

, but the holders had the option to defer half of this tranche to tranche 2; and tranche 2 – all remaining shares

two years after the closing

. With respect to tranche 1, the holders elected not to defer their shares to tranche 2 and as a result the Company is obligated to purchase all of the tranche 1 shares in the second quarter of 2020. The purchase price for the tranche 1 and tranche 2 shares is based on a multiple of the subsidiary’s adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (“EBITDA”) less net debt as of the end of the measurement year, and the multiple varies depending on the level of EBITDA compared to a target.

The Company recognized a liability of $

26.2

million for the fair value of the


%

interest on the date of the acquisition, which is being accounted for as a mandatorily redeemable non-controlling interest. The fair value of the liability was determined using a Monte Carlo simulation model, which utilizes inputs, including the volatility of financial results, in order to model the probability of different outcomes. The Company classified this as a Level 3 fair value measurement due to the use of significant unobservable inputs. In subsequent periods, the liability for the mandatorily redeemable non-controlling interest is adjusted each reporting period to its redemption value based on conditions that exist as of each subsequent balance sheet date. The Company reflects any adjustment in the redemption value in interest expense in the Company’s Consolidated Income Statement. The Company recorded a loss of $

8.6

million in interest expense during 2019 in connection with the remeasurement of the mandatorily redeemable non-controlling interest to its redemption value, which for tranche 1 reflects the amount expected to be paid under the conditions specified in the terms of the acquisition agreement and for tranche 2 reflects the amount that would be paid under the conditions specified in the terms of the acquisition agreement if settlement had occurred as of February 2, 2020. The liability for the mandatorily redeemable non-controlling interest was $

33.8

million as of February 2, 2020 based on exchange rates in effect on that date, of which $

16.9

million was included in accrued expenses and $

16.9

million was included in other liabilities in the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheet.

Allocation of the Acquisition Date Fair Value

The following table summarizes the fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the date of acquisition:

Prior to the closing of the Australia acquisition, Gazal had entered into an agreement to sell an office building and warehouse to a third party and, as such, the building was classified as held for sale on the acquisition date. The building was subsequently sold to a third party and leased back to the Company in June 2019. Please see Note 17, “

Leases

,” for further discussion of this sale-leaseback transaction.

The goodwill of $

65.9

million was assigned as of the acquisition date to the Company’s Tommy Hilfiger International and Calvin Klein International segments in the amounts of $

56.8

million and $

9.1

million, respectively, which include the Company’s reporting units that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination. Goodwill will not be deductible for tax purposes. The other intangible assets of $

222.2

million consisted of reacquired perpetual license rights of $

204.9

million, which are indefinite lived, order backlog of $

0.3

million, which was amortized on a straight-line basis over 0.5 years, and customer relationships of $

17.0

million, which are being amortized on a straight-line basis over 10.0 years. The Company

F-17

is still in the process of finalizing the valuation of the assets and liabilities assumed; thus, the allocation of the acquisition date fair value is subject to change.

Acquisition of the

Geoffrey Beene

Tradename

The Company acquired on April 20, 2018 the

Geoffrey Beene

tradename from Geoffrey Beene, LLC (“Geoffrey Beene”). Prior to the acquisition, the Company licensed the rights to design, market and distribute

Geoffrey Beene

dress shirts and neckwear from Geoffrey Beene.

The tradename was acquired for $

17.0

million, consisting of $

15.9

million paid in cash, $

0.7

million of royalties prepaid to Geoffrey Beene by the Company under the license agreement, and $

0.4

million of liabilities assumed by the Company. The transaction was accounted for as an asset acquisition.

Acquisition of the Wholesale and Concessions Businesses in Belgium and Luxembourg

The Company acquired on September 1, 2017 the Tommy Hilfiger and Calvin Klein wholesale and concessions businesses in Belgium and Luxembourg from a former agent (the “Belgian acquisition”). As a result of the Belgian acquisition, the Company now operates directly the Tommy Hilfiger and Calvin Klein businesses in this region.

The acquisition date fair value of the consideration paid was $

12.0

million. The estimated fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed consisted of $

12.4

million of goodwill and $

0.4

million of other net liabilities. The goodwill of $

12.4

million was assigned as of the acquisition date to the Company’s Tommy Hilfiger International and Calvin Klein International segments in the amounts of $

11.1

million and $

1.3

million, respectively, which are the Company’s reporting units that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination. Goodwill is not deductible for tax purposes. The Company finalized the purchase price allocation in 2018.

Acquisition of True & Co.

The Company acquired on March 30, 2017 True & Co., a direct-to-consumer intimate apparel digital-centric retailer. This acquisition enabled the Company to participate further in the fast-growing online channel and provided a platform to increase innovation, data-driven decisions and speed in the way it serves its consumers across its channels of distribution.

The acquisition date fair value of the consideration paid was $

28.5

million. The estimated fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed consisted of $

20.9

million of goodwill and $

7.6

million of other net assets (including $

7.3

million of deferred tax assets and $

0.4

million of cash acquired). The goodwill of $

20.9

million was assigned as of the acquisition date to the Company’s Calvin Klein North America, Calvin Klein International and Heritage Brands Wholesale segments in the amounts of $

5.4

million, $

4.8

million and $

10.7

million, respectively, which include the Company’s reporting units that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination. For those reporting units that had not been assigned any of the assets acquired or liabilities assumed in the acquisition, the amount of goodwill assigned was determined by calculating the estimated fair value of such reporting units before and after the acquisition. Goodwill is not deductible for tax purposes. The Company finalized the purchase price allocation in 2017.

ASSETS HELD FOR SALE

The Company entered into a definitive agreement on January 9, 2020 to sell its Speedo North America business to Pentland, the parent company of Speedo International Limited, for $

170.0

million in cash, subject to a working capital adjustment. Speedo International Limited licenses the

Speedo

trademark to a subsidiary of the Company for perpetual use in North America and the Caribbean. The Company will deconsolidate the net assets of the Speedo business and no longer license the

Speedo

trademark upon closing of the sale, which is expected to occur in the first quarter of 2020, subject to customary closing conditions, including clearance under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, which was received early in the first quarter of 2020.

The Company classified the assets and liabilities of the Speedo North America business as held for sale and recorded a pre-tax noncash loss of $

142.0

million during the fourth quarter of 2019 (including a $

116.4

million noncash impairment charge related to the Speedo perpetual license right) to reduce the carrying value of the Speedo North America business to its estimated fair value, less costs to sell. The estimated fair value, less costs to sell, reflects the amount of consideration the Company expects to receive upon closing of the transaction, inclusive of the working capital adjustment. The loss was recorded

F-18

in other noncash loss, net in the Company’s Consolidated Income Statement. The loss will be remeasured in connection with the closing of the transaction and will be impacted by changes to the net assets of the Speedo North America business subsequent to February 2, 2020.

The noncash impairment charge related to the Speedo perpetual license right was recorded to write down its carrying value of $

203.8

million to a fair value of $

87.4

million, which was implied by the expected amount of consideration to be received upon closing of the transaction. The Company classified this as a Level 3 fair value measurement due to the use of significant unobservable inputs.

The Speedo transaction was also a triggering event that prompted the need for the Company to perform an interim goodwill impairment test for its Heritage Brands Wholesale reporting unit. No goodwill impairment resulted from this interim test.

The assets and liabilities of the Speedo North America business classified as held for sale in the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheet as of February 2, 2020 were included in the Heritage Brands Wholesale segment and consisted of the following:

(1)

Other intangibles, net includes a perpetual license right of $

REDEEMABLE NON-CONTROLLING INTEREST

The Company and Arvind formed PVH Ethiopia, in which the Company owns a


%

interest, during 2016. The Company consolidates PVH Ethiopia in its consolidated financial statements. PVH Ethiopia was formed to operate a manufacturing facility that produces finished products for the Company for distribution primarily in the United States. The manufacturing facility began operations in 2017.

F-21

The shareholders agreement governing PVH Ethiopia (the “Shareholders Agreement”) contains a put option under which Arvind can require the Company to purchase all of its shares in the joint venture during various future periods as specified in the Shareholders Agreement. The first such period immediately precedes the ninth anniversary of PVH Ethiopia’s date of incorporation. The Shareholders Agreement also contains call options under which the Company can require Arvind to sell to the Company (i) all or a portion of its shares during various future periods as specified in the Shareholders Agreement; (ii) all of its shares in the event of a change of control of Arvind; or (iii) all of its shares in the event that Arvind ceases to hold at least

10%

of the outstanding shares. The Company’s first call option referred to in clause (i) immediately follows the fifth anniversary of the date of incorporation of PVH Ethiopia. The put and call prices are the fair market value of the shares on the redemption date based upon a multiple of PVH Ethiopia’s EBITDA for the prior 12 months, less PVH Ethiopia’s net debt.

The fair value of the redeemable non-controlling interest (“RNCI”) as of the date of formation of PVH Ethiopia was $

0.1

million. The carrying amount of the RNCI is adjusted to equal the redemption amount at the end of each reporting period, provided that this amount at the end of each reporting period cannot be lower than the initial fair value adjusted for the minority shareholder’s share of net income or loss. Any adjustment to the redemption amount of the RNCI is determined after attribution of net income or loss of the RNCI and will be recognized immediately in retained earnings of the Company, since it is probable that the RNCI will become redeemable in the future based on the passage of time. The carrying amount of the RNCI as of

February 2, 2020

was $

(

2.0

)

million, which is greater than the redemption amount. The carrying amount decreased from $

0.2

million as of

February 3, 2019

as a result of a net loss attributable to the RNCI for 2019 of $

2.2

million.

GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS

The changes in the carrying amount of goodwill, by segment (please see

Note 21

, “

Segment Data

,” for further discussion of the Company’s reportable segments), were as follows:

The goodwill acquired in the Australia and TH CSAP acquisitions was assigned as of the respective acquisition dates to the Company’s reporting units that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the combinations.

F-22

The Company reclassified $

48.1

million of goodwill to assets held for sale in the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheet as of February 2, 2020 in connection with the Speedo transaction. Please see

Note 4

, “Assets Held For Sale,” for further discussion.

The Company was required to make contingent purchase price payments to Mr. Calvin Klein in connection with the Company’s acquisition of all of the issued and outstanding stock of Calvin Klein, Inc. and certain affiliated companies. Such payments were based on

1.15

% of total worldwide net sales (as defined in the acquisition agreement, as amended), of products bearing any of the

CALVIN KLEIN

brands and were required to be made with respect to sales made through February 12, 2018. A significant portion of the sales on which the payments to Mr. Klein were made were wholesale sales by the Company and its licensees and other partners to retailers. All payments due to Mr. Klein under the agreement have been made.

The Company’s other intangible assets consisted of the following:

The gross carrying amount and accumulated amortization of certain intangible assets include the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates.

(1)

The change from February 3, 2019 to February 2, 2020 included intangible assets recorded in connection with the Australia acquisition. The intangible assets as of the acquisition date included reacquired perpetual license rights of $

204.9

million, which are indefinite-lived, and customer relationships of $

17.0

million, which are being amortized on a straight-line basis over 10.0 years, both of which were subject to exchange rate fluctuations after the acquisition date

7.9

million and a perpetual license right of $

203.8

million. The Company recorded a $

116.4

million noncash impairment charge related to the Speedo perpetual license right in the fourth quarter of 2019 in connection with the Speedo transaction. The remaining perpetual license right of $

87.4

million and the customer relationships of $

7.9

million were reclassified to assets held for sale in the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheet as of February 2, 2020. Please see

Note 4

, “Assets Held For Sale,” for further discussion.

Amortization expense related to the Company’s intangible assets subject to amortization was $

39.7

million and

$

62.8

million for


and


, respectively. The decrease is primarily related to the reacquired license rights recorded in connection with the acquisition of the 55% ownership interests in the Company’s former joint venture for

TOMMY HILFIGER

in China that it did not already own (the “TH China acquisition”), which became fully amortized in 2018.

F-23

Assuming constant foreign currency exchange rates and no change in the gross carrying amount of the intangible assets, amortization expense for the next five years related to the Company’s intangible assets subject to amortization as of

February 2, 2020

is expected to be as follows:

DEBT

Short-Term Borrowings

The Company has the ability to draw revolving borrowings under its senior unsecured credit facilities, as discussed in the section entitled “2019 Senior Unsecured Credit Facilities” below. The Company had no borrowings outstanding under these facilities as of

February 2, 2020

. The maximum amount of revolving borrowings outstanding under these facilities during


was $

378.4

million. The Company had $

7.8

million outstanding under its prior senior secured credit facilities as of

February 3, 2019

as discussed in the section entitled “2016 Senior Secured Credit Facilities” below. The weighted average interest rate on the funds borrowed as of

February 3, 2019

was

4.45

%.

Additionally, the Company has the availability to borrow under short-term lines of credit, overdraft facilities and short-term revolving credit facilities denominated in various foreign currencies. These facilities, which now include a facility in Australia as a result of the Australia acquisition, provided for borrowings of up to $

132.0

million based on exchange rates in effect on

February 2, 2020

and are utilized primarily to fund working capital needs. The Company had $

49.6

million and $

5.1

million outstanding under these facilities as of

February 2, 2020

and

February 3, 2019

, respectively. The $

49.6

million of borrowings outstanding as of

February 2, 2020

included borrowings under the facility in Australia. The weighted average interest rate on funds borrowed as of

February 2, 2020

and

February 3, 2019

was

2.56

% and

0.21

%, respectively. The maximum amount of borrowings outstanding under these facilities during


was $

99.5

million.

Commercial Paper

The Company established on November 5, 2019 an unsecured commercial paper note program in the United States primarily to fund working capital needs. The program enables the Company to issue, from time to time, unsecured commercial paper notes with maturities that vary but do not exceed


days from the date of issuance. The Company had no borrowings outstanding under the commercial paper note program as of

February 2, 2020

. The maximum amount of borrowings outstanding under the program during 2019 was $

370.0

million.

The commercial paper program allows for borrowings of up to $

675.0

million to the extent that the Company has borrowing capacity under its United States dollar-denominated revolving credit facility, as discussed in the section entitled “2019 Senior Unsecured Credit Facilities” below. Accordingly, the combined aggregate amount of (i) borrowings outstanding under the commercial paper note program and (ii) the revolving borrowings outstanding under the United States dollar-denominated revolving credit facility at any one time cannot exceed $

675.0

million. The maximum aggregate amount of borrowings outstanding under the commercial paper program and the United States dollar-denominated revolving credit facility during 2019 was $

567.0

million, which reflects a brief period of higher aggregate borrowings at the time that the Company launched the commercial paper program.

F-24

Long-Term Debt

The carrying amounts of the Company’s long-term debt were as follows:

(1)

The outstanding principal balance for the United States dollar-denominated Term Loan A facility and the euro-denominated Term Loan A facility was $

1,029.6

million and €

493.8

million, respectively, as of

February 2, 2020

.

(2)

The carrying amount of the Company’s euro-denominated Term Loan A facility and senior unsecured euro notes includes the impact of changes in the exchange rate of the United States dollar against the euro.

Please see

Note 12

, “

Fair Value Measurements

,” for the fair value of the Company’s long-term debt as of

February 2, 2020

and

February 3, 2019

.

As of

February 2, 2020

, the Company’s mandatory long-term debt repayments for the next five years were as follows:

(1)

A portion of the Company’s mandatory long-term debt repayments are denominated in euro and subject to changes in the exchange rate of the United States dollar against the euro.

Total debt repayments for the next five years exceed the total carrying amount of the Company’s Term Loan A facilities, 7 3/4% debentures due 2023 and 3 5/8% senior euro notes due 2024 as of

February 2, 2020

because the carrying amount reflects the unamortized portions of debt issuance costs and the original issue discounts.

As of

February 2, 2020

, after taking into account the effect of the Company’s interest rate swap agreements discussed in the section entitled “2019 Senior Unsecured Credit Facilities,” which were in effect as of such date, approximately


% of the Company’s long-term debt had fixed interest rates, with the remainder at variable interest rates.

2016 Senior Secured Credit Facilities

On May 19, 2016, the Company entered into an amendment to its senior secured credit facilities (as amended, the “2016 facilities”). The Company replaced the 2016 facilities with new senior unsecured credit facilities on April 29, 2019 as discussed in the section entitled “2019 Senior Unsecured Credit Facilities” below. The 2016 facilities, as of the date they were replaced, consisted of a $

2,347.4

million United States dollar-denominated Term Loan A facility and senior secured revolving credit facilities consisting of (i) a $

475.0

million United States dollar-denominated revolving credit facility, (ii) a $

25.0

million United States dollar-denominated revolving credit facility available in United States dollars and Canadian dollars and (iii) a €

185.9

million euro-denominated revolving credit facility available in euro, British pound sterling, Japanese yen and Swiss francs.

F-25

2019 Senior Unsecured Credit Facilities

The Company refinanced the 2016 facilities on April 29, 2019 (the “Closing Date”) by entering into senior unsecured credit facilities (the “2019 facilities”), the proceeds of which, along with cash on hand, were used to repay all of the outstanding borrowings under the 2016 facilities, as well as the related debt issuance costs.

The 2019 facilities consist of a $

1,093.2

million United States dollar-denominated Term Loan A facility (the “USD TLA facility”), a €

500.0

million euro-denominated Term Loan A facility (the “Euro TLA facility” and together with the USD TLA facility, the “TLA facilities”) and senior unsecured revolving credit facilities consisting of (i) a $

675.0

million United States dollar-denominated revolving credit facility, (ii) a CAD $

70.0

million Canadian dollar-denominated revolving credit facility available in United States dollars or Canadian dollars, (iii) a €

200.0

million euro-denominated revolving credit facility available in euro, British pound sterling, Japanese yen, Swiss francs, Australian dollars and other agreed foreign currencies and (iv) a $

50.0

million United States dollar-denominated revolving credit facility available in United States dollars or Hong Kong dollars. The 2019 facilities are due on April 29, 2024. In connection with the refinancing of the senior credit facilities, the Company paid debt issuance costs of $

10.4

million (of which $

3.5

million was expensed as debt modification costs and $

6.9

million is being amortized over the term of the debt agreement) and recorded debt extinguishment costs of $

1.7

million to write off previously capitalized debt issuance costs.

Each of the senior unsecured revolving facilities, except for the $

50.0

million United States dollar-denominated revolving credit facility available in United States dollars or Hong Kong dollars, also include amounts available for letters of credit and have a portion available for the making of swingline loans. The issuance of such letters of credit and the making of any swingline loan reduces the amount available under the applicable revolving credit facility. So long as certain conditions are satisfied, the Company may add one or more senior unsecured term loan facilities or increase the commitments under the senior unsecured revolving credit facilities by an aggregate amount not to exceed $

1,500.0

million. The lenders under the 2019 facilities are not required to provide commitments with respect to such additional facilities or increased commitments.

The Company had loans outstanding of $

1,569.5

million, net of debt issuance costs and based on applicable exchange rates, under the TLA facilities and $

20.3

million of outstanding letters of credit under the senior unsecured revolving credit facilities as of

February 2, 2020

. The Company had no borrowings outstanding under the senior unsecured revolving credit facilities as of

February 2, 2020

.

The terms of the TLA facilities require the Company to make quarterly repayments of amounts outstanding under the 2019 facilities, which commenced with the calendar quarter ended September 30, 2019. Such required repayment amounts equal

2.50

%

per annum of the principal amount outstanding on the Closing Date for the first eight calendar quarters following the Closing Date,

5.00

%

per annum of the principal amount outstanding on the Closing Date for the four calendar quarters thereafter and

7.50

%

per annum of the principal amount outstanding on the Closing Date for the remaining calendar quarters, in each case paid in equal installments and in each case subject to certain customary adjustments, with the balance due on the maturity date of the TLA facilities. The outstanding borrowings under the 2019 facilities are prepayable at any time without penalty (other than customary breakage costs). Any voluntary repayments made by the Company would reduce the future required repayment amounts.

The Company made payments of $

70.6

million on its term loans under the 2019 facilities and repaid the 2016 facilities in connection with the refinancing of the senior credit facilities during 2019. The Company made payments of $

150.0

million and $

250.0

million during 2018 and 2017, respectively, on its term loans under the 2016 facilities.

The United States dollar-denominated borrowings under the 2019 facilities bear interest at a rate equal to an applicable margin plus, as determined at the Company's option, either (a) a base rate determined by reference to the greater of (i) the prime rate, (ii) the United States federal funds effective rate plus 1/2 of

1.00%

and (iii) a one-month reserve adjusted Eurocurrency rate plus

or (b) an adjusted Eurocurrency rate, calculated in a manner set forth in the 2019 facilities.

The Canadian dollar-denominated borrowings under the 2019 facilities bear interest at a rate equal to an applicable margin plus, as determined at the Company’s option, either (a) a Canadian prime rate determined by reference to the greater of (i) the rate of interest per annum that Royal Bank of Canada establishes as the reference rate of interest in order to determine interest rates for loans in Canadian dollars to its Canadian borrowers and (ii) the average of the rates per annum for Canadian dollar

F-26

bankers' acceptances having a term of one month or (b) an adjusted Eurocurrency rate, calculated in a manner set forth in the 2019 facilities.

Borrowings available in Hong Kong dollars under the 2019 facilities bear interest at a rate equal to an applicable margin plus an adjusted Eurocurrency rate, calculated in a manner set forth in the 2019 facilities.

The borrowings under the 2019 facilities in currencies other than United States dollars, Canadian dollars or Hong Kong dollars bear interest at a rate equal to an applicable margin plus an adjusted Eurocurrency rate, calculated in a manner set forth in the 2019 facilities.

The current applicable margin with respect to the TLA facilities and each revolving credit facility is

1.375

%

for adjusted Eurocurrency rate loans and

0.375

%

for base rate or Canadian prime rate loans. The applicable margin for borrowings under the TLA facilities and the revolving credit facilities is subject to adjustment (i) after the date of delivery of the compliance certificate and financial statements, with respect to each of the Company’s fiscal quarters, based upon the Company’s net leverage ratio or (ii) after the date of delivery of notice of a change in the Company’s public debt rating by Standard & Poor’s or Moody’s.

The Company entered into interest rate swap agreements designed with the intended effect of converting notional amounts of its variable rate debt obligation to fixed rate debt. Under the terms of the agreements, for the outstanding notional amount, the Company’s exposure to fluctuations in the one-month London interbank offered rate (“LIBOR”) is eliminated and the Company pays a fixed rate plus the current applicable margin. The following interest rate swap agreements were entered into or in effect during 2019, 2018 and 2017:

The notional amounts of the outstanding interest rate swaps that commenced in February 2018 and February 2019 are adjusted according to pre-set schedules during the terms of the swap agreements such that, based on the Company’s projections for future debt repayments, the Company’s outstanding debt under the USD TLA facility is expected to always equal or exceed the combined notional amount of the then-outstanding interest rate swaps.

The 2019 facilities contain customary events of default, including but not limited to nonpayment; material inaccuracy of representations and warranties; violations of covenants; certain bankruptcies and liquidations; cross-default to material indebtedness; certain material judgments; certain events related to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended; and a change in control (as defined in the 2019 facilities).

The 2019 facilities require the Company to comply with customary affirmative, negative and financial covenants, including minimum interest coverage and maximum net leverage. A breach of any of these operating or financial covenants would result in a default under the 2019 facilities. If an event of default occurs and is continuing, the lenders could elect to declare all amounts then outstanding, together with accrued interest, to be immediately due and payable, which would result in acceleration of the Company’s other debt.

INCOME TAXES

The domestic and foreign components of (loss) income before income taxes were as follows:

The domestic loss before benefit for income taxes in 2019, 2018 and 2017 is primarily attributable to the domestic portion of certain charges incurred in 2019, 2018 and 2017. Please see

Note 21

, “Segment Data,” for further discussion of these costs.

Taxes paid were $

133.0

million,

$

138.4

million and

$

164.6

million in


,


and


, respectively.

The provision (benefit) for income taxes attributable to income consisted of the following:

(1)

Includes a $

27.8

million benefit related to the write-off of deferred tax liabilities in connection with the pre-tax noncash impairment of the Speedo perpetual license right, primarily in the United States. Please see Note 4, “Assets Held For Sale,” for further discussion.

(2)

Includes a

$

24.7

million benefit in 2018 and a

$

52.8

million benefit in 2017 related to the U.S. Tax Legislation.

(3)

Includes a

$

41.1

million benefit related to the remeasurement of certain net deferred tax liabilities in connection with the enactment of legislation in the Netherlands known as the “2019 Dutch Tax Plan,” which became effective on January 1, 2019 and includes a gradual reduction of the corporate income tax rate by 2021.

F-29

The provision (benefit) for income taxes for the years


,


and


was different from the amount computed by applying the statutory United States federal income tax rate to the underlying income as follows:

(1)

The United States statutory federal income tax rate changed from

35.0

%

to

21.0

%

, effective January 1, 2018, as a result of the U.S. Tax Legislation. The United States statutory federal income tax rate for 2017 is a blended rate of

33.7

%

.

(2)

Includes the settlement of a multi-year audit from an international jurisdiction.

(3)

Includes the release of a

$

26.3

million valuation allowance on the Company’s foreign tax credits to adjust the provisional amount recorded in 2017 as a result of the U.S. Tax Legislation.

(4)

Includes the recognition of a

$

38.5

million provisional valuation allowance on the Company’s foreign tax credits as a result of the U.S. Tax Legislation.

(5)

Includes an excess tax benefit from the exercise of stock options by the Company’s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.

The Company files income tax returns in more than


international jurisdictions each year. A substantial amount of the Company’s earnings are in international jurisdictions, particularly in the Netherlands and Hong Kong SAR, where income tax rates, coupled with special rates levied on income from certain of the Company’s jurisdictional activities, continue to be lower than the United States statutory income tax rate. The effects of international jurisdictions, including foreign tax credits, reflected in the above table for


,


and


included those taxes at statutory income tax rates and at special rates levied on income from certain jurisdictional activities. The Company expects to benefit from these special rates until 2022.

The U.S. Tax Legislation enacted on December 22, 2017 significantly revised the United States tax code by, among other things, (i) reducing the corporate income tax rate from

35.0

%

to

21.0

%

, effective January 1, 2018, (ii) imposing a one-time transition tax on earnings of foreign subsidiaries deemed to be repatriated, (iii) implementing a modified territorial tax system, (iv) introducing a tax on foreign income in excess of a deemed return on tangible assets of foreign corporations (known as “GILTI”) and a beneficial tax rate to be applied against foreign derived intangible income (known as “FDII”) and (v) introducing a base erosion anti-abuse tax measure (known as “BEAT”) that taxes certain payments between United States corporations and their subsidiaries.

The Company recorded a provisional net tax benefit of

$

52.8

million in the fourth quarter of 2017 in connection with the U.S. Tax Legislation, consisting of a

$

265.0

million benefit primarily from the remeasurement of the Company’s net deferred tax liabilities to the lower United States corporate income tax rate, partially offset by a

$

38.5

million valuation allowance on the Company’s foreign tax credits and a

$

173.7

million transition tax on undistributed post-1986 earnings and profits of foreign subsidiaries deemed to be repatriated.

F-30

The Company finalized its accounting related to the impacts of the U.S. Tax Legislation on the one-time transition tax liability, deferred taxes, valuation allowances, state tax considerations, and any remaining outside basis differences in the Company’s foreign subsidiaries during 2018. The analysis resulted in the Company recording an additional net tax benefit of

$

24.7

million to adjust the provisional net tax benefit recorded in the fourth quarter of 2017 during the measurement period allowed by the Securities and Exchange Commission. The net tax benefit included the release of a

$

26.3

million valuation allowance on the Company’s foreign tax credits, partially offset by a

$

1.6

million expense related to the remeasurement of the Company’s net deferred tax liabilities.

The GILTI provisions of the U.S. Tax Legislation impose a tax on foreign income in excess of a deemed return on tangible assets of foreign corporations for tax years beginning after December 31, 2017. The guidance indicated that companies must make a policy election to either record deferred taxes for basis differences expected to reverse as a result of the GILTI provisions in future years or treat any taxes on GILTI inclusions as period costs when incurred. The Company completed its analysis of the tax effects of the GILTI provisions in 2018 and elected to account for these tax effects as period costs when incurred.

The components of deferred income tax assets and liabilities were as follows:

At the end of 2019, the Company had on a tax-effected basis approximately $

238.9

million of net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards available to offset future taxable income in various jurisdictions. This included net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $

2.8

million and $

47.1

million for federal and various state and local jurisdictions, respectively, and $

15.5

million for various foreign jurisdictions. The Company also had federal and state tax credit and other carryforwards of $

173.5

million. The carryforwards expire principally between 2020 and 2039.

Prior to the enactment of the U.S. Tax Legislation, the Company's undistributed foreign earnings were considered

permanently reinvested and, as such, United States federal and state income taxes were not previously recorded on these

earnings. As a result of the U.S. Tax Legislation, substantially all of the Company’s earnings in foreign subsidiaries generated prior to the enactment of the U.S. Tax Legislation were deemed to have been repatriated and, as a result, the Company recorded a one-time transition tax of

$

173.7

million in 2017. The Company's intent is to reinvest indefinitely substantially all of its foreign earnings outside of the United States. However, if the Company decides at a later date to repatriate these earnings to the United States, the Company may be required to accrue and pay additional taxes, including any applicable foreign withholding

F-31

tax and United States state income taxes. It is not practicable to estimate the amount of tax that might be payable if these earnings were repatriated due to the complexities associated with the hypothetical calculation.

Uncertain tax positions activity for each of the last three years was as follows:

The entire amount of uncertain tax positions as of

February 2, 2020

, if recognized, would reduce the future effective tax rate under current accounting guidance.

Interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions are recorded in the Company’s income tax provision. Interest and penalties recognized in the Company’s Consolidated Income Statements for


,


and


totaled a benefit of $

15.0

million, an expense of

$

12.1

million and an expense of

$

0.9

million, respectively. Interest and penalties accrued in the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets as of

February 2, 2020

and

February 3, 2019

totaled $

25.2

million and

$

44.1

million, respectively. The Company recorded its liabilities for uncertain tax positions principally in accrued expenses and other liabilities in its Consolidated Balance Sheets.

The Company files income tax returns in the United States and in various foreign, state and local jurisdictions. Most examinations have been completed by tax authorities or the statute of limitations has expired for United States federal, foreign, state and local income tax returns filed by the Company for years through 2006. It is reasonably possible that a reduction of uncertain tax positions in a range of $

20.0

million to $

40.0

million may occur within


months of

February 2, 2020

.

DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

Cash Flow Hedges

The Company has exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates related to anticipated cash flows associated with certain international inventory purchases. The Company uses foreign currency forward exchange contracts to hedge against a portion of this exposure.

The Company also has exposure to interest rate volatility related to its term loans under the 2019 facilities. The Company has entered into interest rate swap agreements to hedge against a portion of this exposure. Please see

Note 9

, “

Debt

,” for further discussion of the 2019 facilities and these agreements.

The Company records the foreign currency forward exchange contracts and interest rate swap agreements at fair value in its Consolidated Balance Sheets and does not net the related assets and liabilities. The foreign currency forward exchange contracts associated with certain international inventory purchases and the interest rate swap agreements are designated as effective hedging instruments (collectively, “cash flow hedges”). The changes in the fair value of the cash flow hedges are recorded in equity as a component of AOCL. No amounts were excluded from effectiveness testing.

Net Investment Hedges

The Company has exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates related to the value of its investments in foreign subsidiaries denominated in a currency other than the United States dollar. To hedge against a portion of this exposure, the Company designated the carrying amounts of its €

600.0

million euro-denominated principal amount of 3 1/8% senior notes due 2027 and €

350.0

million euro-denominated principal amount of 3 5/8% senior notes due 2024 (collectively, “foreign currency borrowings”), that it had issued in the United States, as net investment hedges of its investments in certain of its

F-32

foreign subsidiaries that use the euro as their functional currency. Please see

Note 9

, “

Debt

,” for further discussion of the Company’s foreign currency borrowings.

The Company records the foreign currency borrowings at carrying value in its Consolidated Balance Sheets. The carrying value of the foreign currency borrowings is remeasured at the end of each reporting period to reflect changes in the foreign currency exchange spot rate. Since the foreign currency borrowings are designated as net investment hedges, such remeasurement is recorded in equity as a component of AOCL. The fair value and the carrying value of the foreign currency borrowings designated as net investment hedges were $

1,178.6

million and $

1,038.5

million, respectively, as of

February 2, 2020

and $

1,098.3

million and $

1,076.0

million, respectively, as of

February 3, 2019

. The Company evaluates the effectiveness of its net investment hedges at inception and at the beginning of each quarter thereafter. No amounts were excluded from effectiveness testing.

Undesignated Contracts

The Company records immediately in earnings changes in the fair value of hedges that are not designated as effective hedging instruments (“undesignated contracts”), including all of the foreign currency forward exchange contracts related to intercompany transactions and intercompany loans that are not of a long-term investment nature. Any gains and losses that are immediately recognized in earnings on such contracts are largely offset by the remeasurement of the underlying intercompany balances.

In addition, the Company has exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates related to the translation of the earnings of its subsidiaries denominated in a currency other than the United States dollar. To hedge against a portion of this exposure, the Company entered into several foreign currency option contracts during 2017. These contracts represented the Company’s purchase of euro put/United States dollar call options and Chinese yuan renminbi put/United States dollar call options. All foreign currency option contracts expired in 2017.

The Company’s foreign currency option contracts were also undesignated contracts. As such, the changes in the fair value of these foreign currency option contracts were immediately recognized in earnings.

The Company does not use derivative or non-derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. The cash flows from the Company’s hedges are presented in the same category in the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows as the items being hedged.

The following table summarizes the fair value and presentation of the Company’s derivative financial instruments in its Consolidated Balance Sheets:

The notional amount outstanding of foreign currency forward exchange contracts was $

1,308.1

million at

February 2, 2020

. Such contracts expire principally between February 2020 and June 2021.

F-33

The following tables summarize the effect of the Company’s hedges designated as cash flow and net investment hedging instruments:

A net gain in AOCL on foreign currency forward exchange contracts at

February 2, 2020

of $

29.5

million is estimated to be reclassified in the next


months in the Company’s Consolidated Income Statement to costs of goods sold as the underlying inventory hedged by such forward exchange contracts is sold. In addition, a net loss in AOCL for interest rate swap agreements at

February 2, 2020

of $

5.4

million is estimated to be reclassified to interest expense within the next


months. Amounts recognized in AOCL for foreign currency borrowings would be recognized in earnings only upon the sale or substantially complete liquidation of the hedged net investment.

The following table summarizes the effect of the Company’s undesignated contracts recognized in SG&A expenses in its Consolidated Income Statements:

The Company had no derivative financial instruments with credit risk-related contingent features underlying the related contracts as of

February 2, 2020

.

FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS

In accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. A three level hierarchy prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value as follows:

Level 1 – Inputs are unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Company has the ability to access at the measurement date.

Level 2 – Observable inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1, including quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in inactive markets, inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability and inputs derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data.

Level 3 – Unobservable inputs reflecting the Company’s own assumptions about the inputs that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability based on the best information available.

In accordance with the fair value hierarchy described above, the following table shows the fair value of the Company’s financial assets and liabilities that are required to be remeasured at fair value on a recurring basis:

The fair value of the foreign currency forward exchange contracts is measured as the total amount of currency to be purchased, multiplied by the difference between (i) the forward rate as of the period end and (ii) the settlement rate specified in each contract. The fair value of the interest rate swap agreements is based on observable interest rate yield curves and represents the expected discounted cash flows underlying the financial instruments.

There were no transfers between any levels of the fair value hierarchy for any of the Company’s fair value measurements.

F-35

The following table shows the fair values of the Company’s non-financial assets and liabilities that were required to be remeasured at fair value on a non-recurring basis (consisting of operating lease right-of-use assets, property, plant and equipment, and other intangible assets) during


,


and 2017, and the total impairments recorded as a result of the remeasurement process:

Operating lease right-of-use assets with a carrying amount of $

97.5

million were written down to a fair value of $

14.5

million during 2019 primarily as a result of the closure during the first quarter of 2019 of the Company’s

TOMMY HILFIGER

flagship and anchor stores in the United States (the “TH U.S. store closures”) and the closure during the first quarter of 2019 of the Company’s

CALVIN KLEIN

flagship store on Madison Avenue in New York, New York in connection with the Calvin Klein restructuring (as defined in

Note 18

, “Exit Activity Costs”). Please see

Note 18

for further discussion of the Calvin Klein restructuring costs. The fair value of the Company’s operating lease right-of-use assets was determined based on the discounted cash flows of estimated sublease income using market participant assumptions.

Property, plant and equipment with a carrying amount of $

26.9

million was written down to a fair value of

zero

during 2019 primarily in connection with the TH U.S. store closures, the closure of the Company’s

CALVIN KLEIN 205 W39 NYC

brand (formerly

Calvin Klein Collection

), and the financial performance in certain of the Company’s retail stores and shop-in-shops, including certain

CALVIN KLEIN

stores affected by the realignment of the Calvin Klein creative direction globally. Please see

Note 18

, “Exit Activity Costs,” for further discussion of the Calvin Klein restructuring costs. The fair value of the Company’s property, plant and equipment was determined based on the estimated discounted future cash flows associated with the assets using sales trends and market participant assumptions.

brand. Please see

Note 18

, “

Exit Activity Costs

,” for further discussion. Fair value of the Company’s retail stores and shop-in-shops was determined based on the estimated discounted future cash flows associated with the assets using sales trends and market participant assumptions. The

$

17.9

million impairment charge was included in SG&A expenses, of which

$

8.5

million was recorded in the Calvin Klein International segment,

$

$

1.8

million was recorded in the Calvin Klein North America segment and

$

0.4

million was recorded in the Tommy Hilfiger North America segment.

The carrying amounts and the fair values of the Company’s cash and cash equivalents, short-term borrowings and long-term debt were as follows:

The fair values of cash and cash equivalents and short-term borrowings approximate their carrying amounts due to the short-term nature of these instruments. The Company estimates the fair value of its long-term debt using quoted market prices as of the last business day of the applicable year. The Company classifies the measurement of its long-term debt as a Level 1 measurement. The carrying amounts of long-term debt reflect the unamortized portions of debt issuance costs and the original issue discounts.

RETIREMENT AND BENEFIT PLANS

The Company, as of

February 2, 2020

, has

five

noncontributory qualified defined benefit pension plans covering substantially all employees resident in the United States who meet certain age and service requirements. The plans provide monthly benefits upon retirement generally based on career average compensation and years of credited service. Vesting in plan benefits generally occurs after

five

years of service. The Company refers to these

five

plans as its “Pension Plans.”

The Company also has

three

noncontributory unfunded non-qualified supplemental defined benefit pension plans, including:

–

A plan for certain current and former members of Tommy Hilfiger’s domestic senior management. The plan is frozen and, as a result, participants do not accrue additional benefits.

–

A capital accumulation program for certain current and former senior executives. Under the individual participants’ agreements, the participants in the program will receive a predetermined amount during the

ten

years following the attainment of age


, provided that prior to the termination of employment with the Company, the participant has been in the plan for at least

ten

years and has attained age


.

–

A plan for certain employees resident in the United States who meet certain age and service requirements that provides benefits for compensation in excess of Internal Revenue Service earnings limits and requires payments to vested employees upon, or shortly after, employment termination or retirement.

The Company refers to these

three

plans as its “SERP Plans.”

The Company also provides certain postretirement health care and life insurance benefits to certain retirees resident in the United States. As a result of the Company’s acquisition of The Warnaco Group, Inc. (“Warnaco”), the Company also provides certain postretirement health care and life insurance benefits to certain Warnaco retirees resident in the United States. Retirees contribute to the cost of the applicable plan, both of which are unfunded and frozen. The Company refers to these

two

plans as its “Postretirement Plans.”

F-37

Reconciliations of the changes in the projected benefit obligation (Pension Plans and SERP Plans) and the accumulated benefit obligation (Postretirement Plans) were as follows:

The actuarial losses in 2019 were due principally to decreases in the discount rates. The actuarial gains in 2018 were due principally to increases in the discount rates.

Reconciliations of the fair value of the assets held by the Pension Plans and the funded status were as follows:

Amounts recognized in the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets were as follows:

F-38

The components of net benefit cost recognized were as follows:

The service cost component of net benefit cost is recorded in SG&A expenses and the other components of net benefit cost are recorded in non-service related pension and postretirement cost in the Company’s Consolidated Income Statements.

The actuarial losses in 2019 were due principally to decreases in the discount rates. For the Pension Plans, these losses were partially offset by an actuarial gain as a result of the difference between the actual and expected returns on plan assets.

In 2017, the Company completed the purchase of a group annuity using assets from the Pension Plans. Under the group annuity, the accrued pension obligations for approximately

4,000

retiree participants who had deferred vested benefits under the Pension Plans were transferred to an insurer. As a result, the Company recognized a loss of $

9.4

million, which was recorded in non-service related pension and postretirement cost in the Company’s Consolidated Income Statement for 2017. The amount of the pension benefit obligation settled was $

65.3

million.

Amortization of prior service cost recognized in other comprehensive (loss) income for Pension Plans, SERP Plans, and Postretirement Plans was immaterial during

Pre-tax amounts in AOCL as of

February 2, 2020

expected to be recognized as components of net benefit cost in 2020 in the Pension Plans, SERP Plans and Postretirement Plans were immaterial.

The accumulated benefit obligation (Pension Plans and SERP Plans) were as follows:

F-39

In 2019, three of the Company’s Pension Plans had projected benefit obligations and accumulated benefit obligations in excess of plan assets. In 2018, three of the Company’s Pension Plans had projected benefit obligations in excess of plan assets and two of the Company’s Pension Plans had accumulated benefit obligations in excess of plan assets. The balances were as follows:

In 2019 and 2018, all of the Company’s SERP Plans had projected benefit obligations and accumulated benefit obligations in excess of plan assets as the plans are unfunded.

Significant weighted average rate assumptions used in determining the projected and accumulated benefit obligations at the end of each year and benefit cost in the following year were as follows:

To develop the expected long-term rate of return on assets assumption, the Company considered the historical level of the risk premium associated with the asset classes in which the portfolio is invested and the expectations for future returns of each asset class. The expected return for each asset class was then weighted based on the target asset allocation.

The assets of the Pension Plans are invested with the objective of being able to meet current and future benefit payment needs, while managing future contributions. The investment policy aims to earn a reasonable rate of return while minimizing the risk of large losses. Assets are diversified by asset class in order to reduce volatility of overall results from year to year and to take advantage of various investment opportunities. The assets of the Pension Plans are diversified among United States equities, international equities, fixed income investments and cash. The strategic target allocation for the majority of the Pension Plans as of

February 2, 2020

was approximately


%

United States equities,


%

international equities and


%

fixed income investments and cash. Equity securities primarily include investments in large-, mid- and small-cap companies located in the United States and abroad. Fixed income securities include corporate bonds of companies from diversified industries, municipal bonds, collective funds and United States Treasury bonds. Actual investment allocations may vary from the Company’s target investment allocations due to prevailing market conditions.

,” the following tables show the fair value of the total assets of the Pension Plans for each major category as of

February 2, 2020

and

February 3, 2019

:

(1)

The Company uses third party pricing services to determine the fair values of the financial instruments held by the pension plans. The Company obtains an understanding of the pricing services' valuation methodologies and related inputs and validates a sample of prices by reviewing prices from other sources. The Company has not adjusted any prices received from the third party pricing services.

F-41

(2)

Valued at the closing price or unadjusted quoted price in the active market in which the individual securities are traded.

(3)

Valued at the net asset value of the fund, as determined by a pricing vendor or the fund family. The Company has the ability to redeem this investment at net asset value within the near term and therefore classifies this investment within Level 2. This commingled fund invests in United States large cap equities that track the Russell 1000 Index.

(4)

Valued at the net asset value of the fund, either as determined by the closing price in the active market in which the individual fund is traded and classified within Level 1, or as determined by a pricing vendor or the fund family and classified within Level 2. This category includes funds that invest in equities of companies outside of the United States.

(5)

Valued with bid evaluation pricing where the inputs are based on actual trades in active markets, when available, as well as observable market inputs that include actual and comparable trade data, market benchmarks, broker quotes, trading spreads and/or other applicable data.

(6)

Valued at the net asset value of the funds, as determined by a pricing vendor or the fund family. The Company has the ability to redeem these investments at net asset value within the near term and therefore classifies these investments within Level 2. These funds invest in high-grade, short-term, money market instruments.

(7)

Valued at the net asset value of this fund, as determined by the closing price in the active market in which the individual fund is traded. This mutual fund invests in both equity securities and fixed income securities

.

(8)

This category includes other pension assets and liabilities such as pending trades and accrued income.

The Company believes that there are no significant concentrations of risk within the plan assets as of

February 2, 2020

.

Currently, the Company does not expect to make material contributions to the Pension Plans in 2020. The Company’s actual contributions may differ from planned contributions due to many factors, including changes in tax and other laws, as well as significant differences between expected and actual pension asset performance or interest rates.

The expected benefit payments associated with the Pension Plans and SERP Plans, and expected benefit payments, net of retiree contributions, associated with the Postretirement Plans are as follows:

A

1%

change in the assumed medical health care cost trend rate for the Postretirement Plans would not have a material impact on the Company’s net benefit cost for

The Company has savings and retirement plans and a supplemental savings plan for the benefit of its eligible employees in the United States who elect to participate. The Company matches a portion of employee contributions to the plans. The Company also has defined contribution plans for certain employees associated with certain businesses acquired in the Tommy Hilfiger, Warnaco and Australia acquisitions, whereby the Company pays a percentage of the contribution for the employee.

STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION

The Company grants stock-based awards under its 2006 Stock Incentive Plan (the “2006 Plan”). Shares issued as a result of stock-based compensation transactions generally have been funded with the issuance of new shares of the Company’s common stock.

The Company may grant the following types of incentive awards under the 2006 Plan: (i) non-qualified stock options (“stock options”); (ii) incentive stock options; (iii) stock appreciation rights; (iv) restricted stock; (v) restricted stock units (“RSUs”); (vi) performance shares; (vii) performance share units (“PSUs”); and (viii) other stock-based awards. Each award granted under the 2006 Plan is subject to an award agreement that incorporates, as applicable, the exercise price, the term of the award, the periods of restriction, the number of shares to which the award pertains, performance periods and performance measures, and such other terms and conditions as the plan committee determines. Awards granted under the 2006 Plan are classified as equity awards, which are recorded in stockholders’ equity in the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Through

February 2, 2020

, the Company has granted under the 2006 Plan (i) service-based stock options, RSUs and restricted stock; and (ii) contingently issuable PSUs and RSUs. There was no restricted stock outstanding as of

February 2, 2020

.

According to the terms of the 2006 Plan, for purposes of determining the number of shares available for grant, each share underlying a stock option award reduces the number available by

one

share and each share underlying an RSU or PSU award reduces the number available by

two

shares. Total shares available for grant at

February 2, 2020

amounted to

3.9

million shares.

Net income for


,


and


included $

56.1

million,

$

56.2

million and

$

44.9

million, respectively, of pre-tax expense related to stock-based compensation, with related recognized income tax benefits of $

6.9

million, $

8.9

million and $

8.8

million, respectively.

The Company adopted in 2017 an update to accounting guidance that simplifies several aspects of accounting for share-based payment award transactions, which resulted in the Company’s election to recognize forfeitures as they occur rather than continue to estimate expected forfeitures in determining compensation expense. This accounting change was applied on a modified retrospective basis and resulted in a cumulative-effect adjustment to decrease 2017 beginning retained earnings by $

0.8

million, with an offsetting increase to additional paid in capital of $

1.1

million and an increase to deferred tax assets of $

0.3

million.

The Company receives a tax deduction for certain transactions associated with its stock-based plan awards. The actual income tax benefits realized from these transactions in


,


and


were $

8.8

million, $

13.2

million and

$

27.2

million, respectively. The tax benefits realized included discrete net excess tax benefits of $

0.9

million, $

4.9

million and

$

15.4

million recognized in the Company’s provision for income taxes during


,


and


, respectively.

Stock Options

Stock options granted to employees are generally exercisable in four equal annual installments commencing

one year after the date of grant

. The underlying stock option award agreements generally provide for accelerated vesting upon the award recipient’s retirement (as defined in the 2006 Plan). Such stock options are granted with a


-year term and the per share exercise price cannot be less than the closing price of the common stock on the date of grant.

The Company estimates the fair value of stock options at the date of grant using the Black-Scholes-Merton model. The estimated fair value of the stock options granted is expensed over the stock options’ vesting periods.

F-43

The following summarizes the assumptions used to estimate the fair value of stock options granted during


,


and


and the resulting weighted average grant date fair value per stock option:

The risk-free interest rate is based on United States Treasury yields in effect at the date of grant for periods corresponding to the expected stock option term. The expected stock option term represents the weighted average period of time that stock options granted are expected to be outstanding, based on vesting schedules and the contractual term of the stock options. Company volatility is based on the historical volatility of the Company’s common stock over a period of time corresponding to the expected stock option term. Expected dividends are based on the Company’s common stock cash dividend rate at the date of grant.

The Company has continued to utilize the simplified method to estimate the expected term for its “plain vanilla” stock options granted due to a lack of relevant historical data resulting, in part, from changes in the pool of employees receiving stock option grants. The Company will continue to evaluate the appropriateness of utilizing such method.

Stock option activity for the year was as follows:

The aggregate grant date fair value of stock options granted during


,


and


was $

6.3

million, $

4.4

million and $

4.8

million, respectively.

The aggregate grant date fair value of stock options that vested during


,


and


was $

6.5

million, $

6.5

million and $

7.2

million, respectively.

The aggregate intrinsic value of stock options exercised during 2019, 2018 and 2017 was $

1.3

million,

$

10.9

million and

$

56.9

million, respectively.

At

February 2, 2020

, there was $

4.4

million of unrecognized pre-tax compensation expense related to non-vested stock options, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of

1.8

years.

RSUs

RSUs granted to employees since 2016 generally vest in four equal annual installments commencing one year after the date of grant. Outstanding RSUs granted to employees prior to 2016 generally vest in three annual installments of


%

,


%

and


%

commencing

two

years after the date of grant. Service-based RSUs granted to non-employee directors vest in full

one

year after the date of grant. The underlying RSU award agreements (excluding agreements for non-employee director awards) generally provide for accelerated vesting upon the award recipient’s retirement (as defined in the 2006 Plan). The fair value of

F-44

RSUs is equal to the closing price of the Company’s common stock on the date of grant and is expensed over the RSUs’ vesting periods.

RSU activity for the year was as follows:

The aggregate grant date fair value of RSUs granted during


,


and


was $

67.3

million, $

53.5

million and

$

46.0

million, respectively. The aggregate grant date fair value of RSUs vested during


,


and


was $

40.7

million,

$

35.1

million and

$

28.7

million, respectively.

At

February 2, 2020

, there was $

73.7

million of unrecognized pre-tax compensation expense related to non-vested RSUs, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of

1.8

years.

PSUs

Contingently issuable PSUs granted to certain of the Company’s senior executives since 2015 are subject to a three-year performance period. For such awards, the final number of shares to be earned, if any, is contingent upon the Company’s achievement of goals for the applicable performance period, of which 50% is based upon the Company’s absolute stock price growth during the applicable performance period and 50% is based upon the Company’s total shareholder return during the applicable performance period relative to other companies included in the S&P 500 as of the date of grant. For awards granted in 2016, the three-year performance period ended during 2019 and holders of the awards earned an aggregate of

67,000

shares, which was between the threshold and target levels. The Company records expense ratably over the applicable vesting period regardless of whether the market condition is satisfied because the awards are subject to market conditions.

The fair value of the awards granted was established for each grant on the grant date using the Monte Carlo simulation model.

The following summarizes the assumptions used to estimate the fair value of PSUs granted during


,


and


and the resulting weighted average grant date fair value per PSU:

For certain of the awards granted, the after-tax portion of the award is subject to a holding period of one year after the vesting date. For such awards, the grant date fair value was discounted

6.20

%

in 2019,

7.09

%

in 2018 and

12.67

%

in 2017 for the restriction of liquidity, which was calculated using the Chaffe model.

F-45

PSU activity for the year was as follows:

The aggregate grant date fair value of PSUs granted during


,


and


was $

8.6

million,

$

7.0

million and

$

7.0

million, respectively. The aggregate grant date fair value of PSUs that vested during 2019 and 2018 was $

6.7

million and

$

4.6

million, respectively. No PSUs vested in 2017. PSUs in the above table are subject to market conditions. As such, the non-vested PSUs are reflected at the target level, which is consistent with how expense will be recorded, regardless of the numbers of shares that will actually be earned.

At

February 2, 2020

, there was $

2.4

million of unrecognized pre-tax compensation expense related to non-vested PSUs, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of

2.1

years.

STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY

The Company’s Board of Directors has authorized over time since 2015 an aggregate $

2.0

billion stock repurchase program through June 3, 2023. Repurchases under the program may be made from time to time over the period through open market purchases, accelerated share repurchase programs, privately negotiated transactions or other methods, as the Company deems appropriate. Purchases are made based on a variety of factors, such as price, corporate requirements and overall market conditions, applicable legal requirements and limitations, trading restrictions under the Company’s insider trading policy and other relevant factors. The program may be modified by the Board of Directors, including to increase or decrease the repurchase limitation or extend, suspend, or terminate the program, at any time, without prior notice.

During


,


and


, the Company purchased

3.4

million shares,

2.2

million shares and

2.2

million shares, respectively, of its common stock under the program in open market transactions for $

325.0

million, $

300.1

million and $

250.4

million, respectively. As of

February 2, 2020

, the repurchased shares were held as treasury stock and $

683.3

million of the authorization remained available for future share repurchases.

Treasury stock activity also includes shares that were withheld in conjunction with the settlement of RSUs and PSUs to satisfy tax withholding requirements.

ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE LOSS

The following table presents the changes in AOCL, net of related taxes, by component:

(1)

Foreign currency translation adjustments included a net gain (loss) on net investment hedges of $

29.7

million, $

73.1

million and $

(

70.8

)

million in 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively.

(2)

Favorable foreign currency translation adjustments were principally driven by a weakening of the United States dollar against the euro.

(3)

Unfavorable foreign currency translation adjustments were principally driven by a strengthening of the United States dollar against the euro.

(4)

The stranded tax effects resulting from the U.S. Tax Legislation were reclassified from AOCL to retained earnings as a result of the Company’s early adoption of an update to accounting guidance in the fourth quarter of 2017. The amount of the reclassification was calculated based on the effect of the change in the United States federal corporate income tax rate on the gross deferred tax amounts at the date of the enactment of the U.S. Tax Legislation related to items that remained in AOCL at that time.

F-47

The following table presents reclassifications from AOCL to earnings:

LEASES

The Company leases approximately

1,830

Company-operated freestanding retail store locations across more than


countries, generally with initial lease terms of

three

to

ten years

. The Company also leases warehouses, distribution centers, showrooms, office space and a factory in Ethiopia, generally with initial lease terms of

ten

to


years

, as well as certain equipment and other assets, generally with initial lease terms of

one

to

five years

.

Right-of-use assets and lease liabilities are recognized at the lease commencement date based on the present value of fixed lease payments over the expected lease term. The Company uses its incremental borrowing rates to determine the present value of fixed lease payments based on the information available at the lease commencement date, as the rate implicit in the lease is not readily determinable for the Company's leases. The Company's incremental borrowing rates are based on the term of the lease, the economic environment of the lease, and the effect of collateralization. Certain leases include one or more renewal options, generally for the same period as the initial term of the lease. The exercise of lease renewal options is generally at the Company’s sole discretion and, as such, the Company typically determines that exercise of these renewal options is not reasonably certain. As a result, the Company does not include the renewal option period in the expected lease term and the associated lease payments are not included in the measurement of the right-of-use asset and lease liability. Certain leases also contain termination options with an associated penalty. Generally, the Company is reasonably certain not to exercise these options and as such, they are not included in the determination of the expected lease term. The Company recognizes operating lease expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term.

Leases with an initial lease term of 12 months or less are not recorded on the balance sheet. The Company recognizes lease expense for these leases on a straight-line basis over the lease term.

Leases generally provide for payments of nonlease components, such as common area maintenance, real estate taxes and other costs associated with the leased property. For lease agreements entered into or modified after

February 3, 2019

, the Company accounts for lease components and nonlease components together as a single lease component and, as such, includes fixed payments of nonlease components in the measurement of the right-of-use assets and lease liabilities. Variable lease payments, such as percentage rentals based on location sales, periodic adjustments for inflation, reimbursement of real estate taxes, any variable common area maintenance and any other variable costs associated with the leased property are expensed as incurred as variable lease costs and are not recorded on the balance sheet.

The Company’s lease agreements do not contain any material residual value guarantees or material restrictions or covenants.

In conjunction with the Australia acquisition in May 2019, the Company acquired an office building and warehouse owned by Gazal. Prior to the acquisition, Gazal had entered into an agreement with a third party to sell the building and as such, the building was classified as held for sale and recorded at its fair value less estimated costs to sell on the acquisition date. Please see

Note 3

, “

Acquisitions

,” for further discussion. In June 2019, the Company completed the sale of the office building and warehouse for $

59.4

million, incurring costs of $

1.0

million, and leased back the building without an option to repurchase.

F-48

No gain or loss was recognized on the transaction. The lease is classified as an operating lease with an initial lease term of

five years

and includes

three

options to renew for a period of

five years

each. Exercise of these renewal options is not reasonably certain and as a result, the Company recognized an operating lease right-of-use asset and operating lease liability based on the initial term of the lease.

The components of the net lease cost were as follows:

Supplemental balance sheet information related to leases was as follows:

Supplemental cash flow information related to leases was as follows:

The Company’s lease liabilities exclude $

45.0

million of future lease payment obligations related to leases for two new warehouses and various retail store leases that were entered into but did not commence as of

February 2, 2020

. These leases commence between February 2020 and September 2020 with initial lease terms of

five

to

ten years

Disclosures Related to Periods Prior to Adoption of the New Lease Accounting Guidance

The Company adopted the update to accounting guidance related to leases in 2019 using the modified retrospective approach applied as of the period of adoption with a cumulative-effect adjustment to opening retained earnings and as such, prior periods have not been restated. As a result, disclosures related to periods prior to adoption are presented under the previous accounting guidance.

At

February 3, 2019

NET INCOME PER COMMON SHARE

The Company computed its basic and diluted net income per common share as follows:

Potentially dilutive securities excluded from the calculation of diluted net income per common share as the effect would be anti-dilutive were as follows:

Shares underlying contingently issuable awards that have not met the necessary conditions as of the end of a reporting period are not included in the calculation of diluted net income per common share for that period. The Company had contingently issuable PSU awards outstanding that did not meet the performance conditions as of

February 2, 2020

,

February 3, 2019

and

February 4, 2018

and, therefore, were excluded from the calculation of diluted net income per common share for each applicable year. The maximum number of potentially dilutive shares that could be issued upon vesting for such awards was

The Company records the fair value of the liability for asset retirement obligations in the period in which it is legally or contractually incurred.

Changes in the liability for the asset retirement obligations are recognized for the passage of time and revisions to either the timing or the amount of estimated cash flows. Accretion expense is recognized in SG&A expenses for the impacts of increasing the discounted fair value to its estimated settlement value.

SUBSEQUENT EVENTS (UNAUDITED)

On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared the COVID-19 outbreak a pandemic and recommended containment and mitigation measures. COVID-19 continues to spread globally. Virus-related concerns, reduced travel, temporary store closures and government-imposed restrictions have resulted in sharply reduced traffic and consumer spending trends and sales stoppages in the Company’s retail stores in virtually all key markets during the first quarter of 2020. The Company’s wholesale customers and licensees have been similarly impacted, which in turn negatively impacts the Company.

In addition, the Company’s supply chain and the supply chains of its licensees had been disrupted and may experience future disruptions as a result of either closed factories or factories operating with reduced workforces.

The disruption is expected to be temporary but there is significant uncertainty about the duration and extent of the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak. The related financial impact cannot be reasonably estimated at this time. However, the Company expects a significant negative impact to its business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations in 2020, which may include non-cash asset impairments, excess inventory and difficulty collecting trade receivables, among other things.

As a result, the Company has increased the aggregate borrowings outstanding under its senior unsecured revolving credit facilities, other short-term revolving credit facilities and unsecured commercial paper note program to approximately $

930.0

million to increase its cash position and help preserve its financial flexibility.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.

Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
