Overview

We are one of the largest apparel companies in the world, with a heritage dating back over 125 years. We design and market nationally recognized branded
dress shirts, sportswear and, to a lesser degree, footwear and other related products. We believe we market approximately one in three of the dress shirts sold in the United States and have a leading
position in men's sportswear. Our portfolio of brands includes our owned brands,

Calvin Klein Collection, ck Calvin Klein, Calvin Klein

,

Van Heusen

,

IZOD, Arrow, G.H. Bass & Co., Bass

and

Eagle

and our licensed brands,

Geoffrey Beene

,

BCBG Max Azria, BCBG Attitude, Chaps, Sean John, Donald J. Trump Signature Collection, Kenneth Cole New York,
Kenneth Cole Reaction, unlisted, A Kenneth Cole Production, JOE Joseph Abboud

and

MICHAEL Michael Kors

. We also license our
owned brands both domestically and internationally over a broad range of products, with

Calvin Klein

being the best known and most widely licensed
brand.

We
design, source and market substantially all of our products on a brand-by-brand basis, targeting distinct consumer demographics and lifestyles. We market our
brands at multiple price points and across multiple channels of distribution. This allows us to provide products to a broad range of consumers, while minimizing competition among our brands and
reducing our reliance on any one demographic group, merchandise preference or distribution channel. Currently, our products are distributed at wholesale in national and regional department,
mid-tier department, mass market, specialty and independent stores in the United States. We also leverage our apparel design and sourcing expertise by offering private label dress shirt
programs to retailers. Our wholesale business represents our core business and we believe that it is the basis for our brand equity. As a complement to our wholesale business, we also market our
products directly to consumers through our

Van Heusen, IZOD, Geoffrey Beene, Bass

and

Calvin Klein

retail stores, primarily located in outlet malls throughout the United States.

We
acquired

Calvin Klein

in February 2003. We believe

Calvin Klein

is one of the best
known designer names in the world and that the

Calvin Klein

brands—

Calvin Klein Collection, ck Calvin
Klein

and

Calvin Klein—

provide us with the opportunity to market products both domestically and internationally at
higher price points, in higher-end distribution channels and to different consumer groups than our other product offerings. Products sold under the

Calvin
Klein

brands are sold primarily under licenses and other arrangements and include high-end collection apparel and accessories, sportswear, jeans, underwear,
fragrances, eyewear, men's tailored clothing, ties, shoes, hosiery, socks, footwear, swimwear, jewelry, watches, coats, handbags, leather goods, home furnishings and accessories. Calvin Klein controls
all design operations and product development for most of its licensees, including the licensee for the

Calvin Klein Collection

high-end
apparel businesses. Calvin Klein oversees a worldwide marketing, advertising and promotion program of over $200 million, most of which is funded by its licensees. We believe that maintaining
control over design and advertising through Calvin Klein's dedicated in-house teams plays a key role in the continued strength of the

Calvin
Klein

brands.

We
acquired the

Arrow

brand worldwide and the related licensing business from affiliates of Cluett American Group, Inc. in
December 2004. The transaction consisted of the acquisition from Cluett American Corp., Consumer Direct Corporation and Cluett Peabody Holding Corp. of all of the outstanding shares of common
stock of Cluett Peabody Resources Corporation ("Resources") and Cluett Peabody & Co., Inc. ("CP&Co."). Resources is the worldwide owner of the

Arrow

trademark, principally for apparel,
footwear and related goods, and certain related marks. CP&Co. licenses the

Arrow

marks from
Resources and, in turn, licenses them to third parties throughout the world. Prior to our acquisition, we had been licensing the

Arrow

marks in the
United States from Resources and CP&Co. since mid-2000 for use on and in connection with men's and boys' dress shirts and sportswear.


Seasonality

Our business generally follows a seasonal pattern. Our dress shirt and sportswear wholesale businesses generate higher levels of sales and income in the first and
third quarters, as the selling of Spring and Fall merchandise to our customers occurs at higher levels as these selling seasons begin. Royalty and other revenues tend to be earned somewhat evenly
throughout the year. The third quarter has the highest level of royalty income, due to higher sales by licensees in advance of the holiday selling season.

The
aggregate effect of our seasonality is that our first and third quarters have the highest levels of revenues and income. Revenues in the second and fourth quarters are relatively
equal, but earnings in the fourth quarter are lower as a result of significant holiday marketing costs, as well as post-holiday promotional selling and inventory clearance activity.

Company Information

We were incorporated in the State of Delaware in 1976 as the successor to a business begun in 1881, and, with respect to our footwear business, to G.H.
Bass & Co., a business begun in 1876, and our Arrow business is the successor to the original Cluett, Peabody & Co., a business begun in 1851. Our principal executive offices are located
at 200 Madison Avenue, New York, New York 10016; our telephone number is (212) 381-3500.

We
make available, at no cost, on our corporate website, our annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on
Form 8-K and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act as soon as reasonably practicable after we have
electronically filed such material with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We also make available, at no cost, on our corporate website, our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics. Our corporate
website address is

www.pvh.com

.

Our Business Strategy

We intend to capitalize upon the significant opportunities presented by Calvin Klein and the strengthening of our "heritage" businesses (the wholesale and outlet
retail businesses we have operated from before the

Calvin Klein

acquisition). Although the

Calvin Klein

brand is well established and, we believe, enjoys strong brand awareness among consumers worldwide, there were numerous product areas in which no products, or only a limited number of products, were
offered under one or more of the

Calvin Klein

brands prior to our acquisition of Calvin Klein. This included men's and women's better sportswear,
footwear and certain accessories. Since our acquisition of Calvin Klein, we have introduced in the United States a

Calvin Klein

men's better sportswear
line, and, through our licensing agreement with Kellwood Company, a women's better sportswear line, as well as entered into licenses for one or more of the

Calvin
Klein

brands for, among other product categories, color cosmetics and skin care products, swimwear, men's tailored clothing, outerwear, footwear, handbags, fine jewelry,
sunglasses and luggage. We believe our expertise in brand management, product design, sourcing and other logistics provides us with the ability to successfully strengthen and grow existing offerings,
expand into new product offerings and increase distribution under the

Calvin Klein

brands while preserving the brands' prestige and global presence. As
a result, we believe we have the opportunity to realize revenue growth and enhanced profitability.

We
intend for each of our brands to be a leader in its respective market segment, with strong consumer awareness and consumer loyalty. We believe that our brands are successful in their
respective segments because we have strategically positioned each brand to target a distinct consumer demographic. We will continue to design and market our branded products to complement each other,
satisfy lifestyle needs, emphasize product features important to our target consumers and produce consumer loyalty. We will seek to increase our market share within the dress shirt and sportswear


segments
by enhancing our relationships with existing customers, expanding our product offerings through new licenses and product extensions and gaining increased floor space. We will also seek to
strengthen our existing licensing relationships and to align ourselves with new licensing partners to take advantage of growth opportunities as they arise.

To
address the needs of our customers, we are continuing to make investments and develop strategies to enhance our ability to provide timely product availability and delivery. We believe
the enhancement of our supply chain efficiencies and working capital management through the effective use of our
distribution network and overall infrastructure will allow us to better control costs and provide improved service to our customers.

Our Business

Our business includes the design, sourcing and marketing of a varied selection of branded and private label dress shirts, branded sportswear and, to a lesser
degree, branded footwear and other related products, as well as the licensing of our brands for an assortment of products.

Dress Shirts

We market our dress shirts principally under the

Van Heusen, Arrow, Geoffrey Beene, Calvin Klein, IZOD, Eagle, BCBG Max Azria, BCBG
Attitude, Chaps, Sean John, Donald J. Trump Signature Collection, Kenneth Cole New York, Kenneth Cole Reaction, unlisted, A Kenneth Cole Production

and

MICHAEL Michael Kors

brands.

Our

at retail price points generally ranging from $20 to $150 a shirt.

more than 1,200 doors, principally

points. We distribute the two

BCBG

brands of dress shirts through more than 250 doors combined, principally in department stores, including Federated
and Dillards, under a license agreement with BCBG Max Azria Group, Inc. that expires on January 31, 2010 and which we may extend, subject to certain conditions, through
January 31, 2020.

The

Chaps

dress shirt, which we launched for Holiday 2004, targets the updated traditional consumer and is marketed at moderate price
points. The

Chaps

dress shirt is distributed through more than 850 doors, principally in mid-tier department stores, including Kohl's and
Mervyn's. We market

Chaps

dress shirts under a license agreement with PRL USA, Inc. and The Polo/Lauren Company, LP that expires on
December 31, 2007 and which we may extend, subject to certain conditions, through December 31, 2013.

Collection

dress shirts under a license agreement with Donald J. Trump that expires on December 31, 2006 and which we may extend, subject to certain conditions, through
December 31, 2009.

The

Kenneth Cole New York

and

Kenneth Cole Reaction

dress shirts target the modern
consumer, are marketed at better price points and are distributed through more than 600 doors combined, principally in department stores, including Dillards, Inc., Federated and Saks. The

unlisted, A Kenneth Cole
Production

dress shirt, introduced at the beginning of 2006, targets the more youthful, modern consumer, is marketed at upper
moderate to better price points and is distributed through more than 300 doors, principally in department stores, including Federated. We market the three

Kenneth

points and is distributed through more than 200 doors, principally in department stores, including Federated and Dillards. We market

the licensor's discontinuation of other licensed lines of menswear under the brand.

We
entered into a license agreement with J.A. Apparel Corp. to market the

second half of 2006. The

JOE Joseph Abboud

target
the more youthful, classical consumer, be marketed at moderate to better price points and be distributed through more than 150 doors, principally in department stores, including Federated. The
license agreement expires on December 31, 2009 and may be extended, subject to certain conditions, through December 31, 2012.

We
also offer private label programs to retailers. Private label offerings allow a retailer to sell its own line of exclusive merchandise and give the retailer control over distribution
of the product. These programs present an opportunity for us to leverage our design, sourcing and logistics expertise. Our private label customers work with our designers to develop shirts in the
styles, sizes and cuts that the customers desire to sell in their stores under their private labels. Private label programs offer the consumer quality product and offer the retailer the opportunity to
enjoy product exclusivity at generally higher margins. Private label products, however, generally do not have the same level of consumer recognition as branded products and private label manufacturers
do not generally provide retailers with the same breadth of services and in-store sales and promotional support as branded manufacturers. We market private label dress shirts to national
department and mass market stores. Our private label programs include

Puritan

and

George

for
Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. and

John Ashford

for Federated.

Sportswear

We market our sportswear principally under the

IZOD, Van Heusen

,

Arrow, Geoffrey
Beene

and

Calvin Klein

brands. Our wholesale sportswear business generated 26.0% of our 2005 revenues. These businesses include
men's knit and woven sport shirts, sweaters, bottoms, swimwear, boxers and outerwear marketed at wholesale.

IZOD

is the best selling main floor department store men's knit sport shirt brand.

IZOD

men's sportswear consists of six related separate concepts under the classic

IZOD

blue label, the

IZOD

black label (golf/resort lifestyle sportswear), the

IZOD

red label (

IZOD LX,

a higher-priced "luxe" line
of sportswear),

IZOD Jeans

,

IZOD PerformX

and

IZOD XFG

(

X-treme Function Golf

) sub-brands.

IZOD

apparel consists of a range of men's
sportswear, including sweaters, knit and woven sports shirts, slacks, fleecewear and outerwear.

IZOD

sportswear is targeted to the active consumer, is
marketed at moderate to upper moderate price points and is distributed through more than 2,900 doors, principally in department stores, including, Federated, Belk, Saks and JCPenney, and through our

IZOD

retail stores.

Van Heusen

is the best selling main floor department store men's woven sport shirt brand in the United States.

Van
Heusen

sportswear is
marketed at upper moderate price points and is distributed through more than 1,300 doors, principally in department stores,

Geoffrey Beene

men's

Geoffrey Beene

dress shirts.

Calvin Klein men's

sportswear, which we began shipping commencing with the Fall 2004 season and continue to expand, targets a modern
classical consumer, is marketed at better price points and is


distributed
through more than 500 doors, principally in better fashion department and specialty stores, including Federated and Dillards, and through our

Calvin
Klein

retail stores.

We
entered into a license agreement in May 2005 to sell a line of golf-inspired sportswear under the

Donald J. Trump Signature
Collection

brand. The

Donald J. Trump Signature Collection

line of sportswear and golf apparel will be targeted to the modern
classical consumer and will be marketed at better price points, with distribution principally through Federated, as well as country clubs operated by The Trump Organization. We launched the line for
Spring 2006. The license agreement expires on December 31, 2007 and may be extended, subject to certain conditions, through December 31, 2010.

Licensing

We license our brands globally for a broad range of products. The licensing of our brands generated 11.1% of our 2005 revenues. We believe royalty and other
revenues from our licensing partners provide us with a relatively stable flow of revenues and a strong source of cash flow, and extend and strengthen our brands globally.

We
grant licensing partners the right to manufacture and sell at wholesale specified products under one or more of our brands. In addition, certain foreign licensees are granted the
right to open retail stores under the licensed brand name and sell only goods under that name in such stores. A substantial portion of the sales by our domestic licensing partners is made to our
largest wholesale customers. As compensation under these agreements, each licensing partner pays us royalties based upon its sales of our branded products, subject generally to payment of a minimum
royalty. These payments generally range from 4.0% to 8.0% of the licensing partners' sales of the licensed products. In addition, licensing partners are generally required to spend or contribute to us
an amount equal to between 2.0% and 5.0% of their sales of the licensed products for advertising. We provide support to our business partners and seek to preserve the integrity of our brand names by
taking an active role in the design, quality control, advertising, marketing and distribution of each licensed product, most of which are subject to our prior approval and continuing oversight.

We
license our

Van Heusen, IZOD, IZOD G, Arrow

and

G.H. Bass & Co.

brand names for
various products worldwide. We also sublicense to others the

Geoffrey Beene, Donald J. Trump Signature Collection, BCBG Attitude

and

BCBG Max Azria

brand
names for certain products. We license these


brands
under approximately 110 agreements. The products offered by our licensing partners under these brands include:

Additionally,
during 2005 we entered into new licensing agreements for, among other things, a line of color cosmetics and skin care products, fine jewelry and watches, women's better
suits, men's bridge suits, men's and women's bridge footwear in Japan, men's and women's bridge sportswear in Europe, sunglasses and luggage. Beginning with the Spring 2006 season, the production of
men's and women's high-end collection apparel and accessories under the

Calvin Klein Collection

label was transferred to Confezioni Moda
International S.r.L. (CMI).

Calvin
Klein's largest business partners in terms of royalty and other revenues earned by Calvin Klein in 2005 were:

•

Warnaco,
accounting for approximately 28%

•

Coty,
accounting for approximately 16%

•

CK
Jeanswear N.V., accounting for approximately 11%

On
January 31, 2006, through its acquisition of Fingen SPA, a holding company controlled by the Fratini family of Italy, Warnaco acquired CK Jeanswear N.V. and affiliated
companies, which are the companies that operate the licenses for

Calvin Klein

jeans and accessories in Europe and Asia and the

Calvin Klein

bridge line of
sportswear and accessories in Europe. Further, as part of this transaction, beginning in 2008 and continuing through 2013,
Warnaco will assume the license for men's and women's

Calvin Klein Collection

apparel and accessories worldwide from CMI, which is also controlled by
the Fratini family.

With
respect to revenues generated from the sale of

Calvin Klein

men's underwear and sleepwear and women's intimate apparel and sleepwear,
Warnaco pays us an administration fee based on Warnaco's worldwide sales of underwear, intimate apparel and sleepwear bearing any of the

Calvin Klein

marks under an administration agreement between Calvin Klein and Warnaco. Warnaco controls


design
and advertising related to the sale of underwear, intimate apparel and sleepwear products bearing the

Calvin Klein

name. See "Trademarks."

Wholesale Customers

Our wholesale business represents our core business and we believe that it is the basis for our brand equity. Currently, our products are distributed at wholesale
in national and regional department, mid-tier department, mass market, specialty and independent stores in the United States. A few of our customers, including Federated, JCPenney, Kohl's,
and Wal-Mart account for significant portions of our revenues. Sales to our five largest customers were 34.3% of our revenues in 2005, 28.8% of our revenues in 2004 and 27.2% of our
revenues in 2003. Federated acquired The May Department Stores Company, another of our largest customers, during 2005. The combined company accounted for 13.7% of our revenues in 2005.

We
believe we provide our customers with a high level of service. We have six separate sales forces covering the following products and product categories:

•

national
brand dress shirts

—Van Heusen, Arrow, IZOD, Chaps, Eagle

and

Donald J. Trump
Signature Collection

•

and

Geoffrey Beene

•

and

Donald J. Trump Signature Collection

•

Each
sales force includes a team of sales professionals that works closely with our customers, providing them with a dedicated level of service which includes designing a focused selling
strategy for each brand while ensuring that each brand's particular qualities and identities are strategically positioned to target a distinct consumer base.

Our
customers offer our dress shirts and men's sportswear, other than

Calvin Klein

men's better sportswear, on the main floor of their
stores.

Calvin Klein

men's better sportswear is offered in the collection area of our customers' stores. In each case, we offer our customers
merchandising support with visual display fixtures and in-store marketing, with

Calvin Klein

men's better sportswear generally being offered
in fixtured shops within stores we design and help build. When a line of our products is displayed in a stand-alone area on the main floor, or, in case of

Calvin
Klein

men's better sportswear, an exclusively dedicated collections area, we are able to further enhance brand recognition to permit more complete merchandising of our lines
and to differentiate the presentation of our products. We believe the broad appeal of our products, with multiple well-known brands offering differing styles at different price points,
together with our customer, advertising and marketing support and our ability to offer products with innovative qualities, allow us to expand and develop relationships with apparel retailers in the
United States.

We
believe that our investments in logistics and supply chain management allow us to respond rapidly to changes in sales trends and consumer demands while enhancing inventory management.
We believe our customers can better manage their inventories as a result of our continuous analysis of sales trends, our broad array of product availability and our quick response capabilities.
Certain of our products can
be ordered at any time through our EDI replenishment systems. For customers who reorder these products, we generally ship these products within one to two days of order receipt.


Retail Stores

We operate approximately 700 retail stores under the

Van Heusen, IZOD, Bass, Geoffrey Beene

,

Calvin
Klein

and

Calvin Klein Collection

names. Ranging in size from 1,200 to 12,000 square feet, with
an average of approximately 4,700 square feet, our stores are primarily located in outlet malls throughout the United States. Our retail business generated 42.3% of our 2005 revenues. We believe our
retail stores are an important complement to our wholesale operations because we believe that the stores further enhance consumer awareness of our brands by offering products that are not available in
our wholesale lines, while also providing a means for managing excess inventory.

Our

Van Heusen

outlet stores offer men's dress shirts and neckwear, men's and women's sportswear, including woven and knit shirts,
sweaters, bottoms and outerwear, and men's and women's accessories. These stores are targeted to the value-conscious consumer who looks for classically styled, moderately priced apparel.

Our

IZOD

outlet stores offer men's and women's active-inspired sportswear, including woven and knit shirts, sweaters, bottoms and
activewear. These stores focus on golf, travel and resort clothing.

Our

Bass

outlet stores offer

Bass

and

G.H. Bass &
Co.

casual and dress casual shoes for men, women and children. Most of our stores also carry sportswear for men and women, including tops, bottoms and outerwear, as well as
accessories such as handbags, wallets, belts and travel gear.

Our

Geoffrey Beene

outlet stores offer men's dress shirts and neckwear, men's and women's sportswear including woven and knit shirts,
sweaters, bottoms and outerwear and men's and women's accessories. These stores are targeted towards a more fashion-conscious, designer-oriented consumer. Our

Geoffrey
Beene

stores offer men's furnishings, casual and dress casual sportswear and women's casual and dress casual sportswear, under a license agreement which expires on
December 31, 2008, and which we may extend, subject to certain conditions, for one additional three-year period, which would end on December 31, 2011.

Our

Calvin Klein

outlet stores are located in premium outlet centers and offer men's and women's apparel and other

Calvin Klein

products to communicate the

Calvin Klein

lifestyle. We also operate one

Calvin Klein Collection

store,
located in New York City, that offers

Calvin Klein

men's and women's
high-end collection apparel and accessories and other products under the

Calvin Klein

brands. We previously operated

Calvin Klein Collection

stores in
Dallas and Paris that we closed during the fourth quarter of 2005.

Design

Our business depends on our ability to stimulate and respond to consumer tastes and demands, as well as on our ability to remain competitive in the areas of
quality and price.

A
significant factor in the continued strength of our brands is our in-house design teams. We form separate teams of designers and merchandisers for each of our brands, and,
with respect to Calvin Klein, for each product category, creating a structure that focuses on the special qualities and identity of each brand and product. These designers and merchandisers consider
consumer taste and lifestyle and trends when creating a brand or product plan for a particular season. The process from initial design to finished product varies greatly, but generally spans six to
ten months prior to each selling season. Our product lines are developed primarily for two major selling seasons, Spring and Fall. However, certain of our product lines offer more frequent
introductions of new merchandise.

Calvin
Klein has developed a cohesive team of senior design directors who share a vision for the

Calvin Klein

brands and who each lead a
separate design team. We have maintained the in-house design teams of Calvin Klein since the acquisition in 2003. These teams control all design operations and product development for most
licensees and other strategic alliances. In addition, new teams


sharing
the same vision were assembled for our men's better sportswear line and for overseeing all design operation and product development in connection with the licensing of the women's better
sportswear line.

Sourcing and Production

To address the needs of our customers, we are continuing to make investments and develop strategies to enhance our ability to provide our customers with timely
product availability and delivery. Our investments in sophisticated systems should allow us to reduce the cycle time between the design of products to the delivery of those products to our customers.
We believe the enhancement of our supply chain efficiencies and working capital management through the effective use of our distribution
network and overall infrastructure will allow us to better control costs and provide improved service to our customers.

In
2005, over 200 different manufacturers produced our products in approximately 200 factories and 27 countries worldwide. As a result of quota elimination on textiles and
apparel-related products from World Trade Organization ("WTO") member countries as of January 1, 2005, there was a decrease in the number of different factories and countries where our products
were manufactured in 2005. During 2005, in excess of 95% of our products were produced by manufacturers located in foreign countries. On March 6, 2006, we committed to a plan to close our
apparel manufacturing facility in Ozark, Alabama by May 15, 2006. As a result, 100% of our products will be produced by independent third parties, principally located in foreign countries. We
source finished products and raw materials. Raw materials include fabric, buttons, thread, labels and similar materials. Raw materials and production commitments are generally made two to six months
prior to production, and quantities are finalized at that time. We believe we are one of the largest procurers of shirting fabric in the world. Finished products consist of manufactured and fully
assembled products ready for shipment to our customers and our stores. Most of our dress shirts and all of our sportswear are sourced and manufactured to our specifications by independent
manufacturers in the Far East, Indian subcontinent, Middle East, the Caribbean and Central America who meet quality, cost and human rights criteria we have established. Our footwear is sourced and
manufactured to our specifications by manufacturers who meet our quality, cost and human rights requirements, principally located in the Far East, Europe, South America and the Caribbean. No single
supplier is critical to our production needs, and we believe that an ample number of alternative suppliers exist should we need to secure additional or replacement production capacity and raw
materials. Given our extensive network of sourcing partners, we believe we are able to obtain goods at low cost and on a timely basis.

Our
foreign offices and buying agents enable us to monitor the quality of the goods manufactured by, and the delivery performance of, our suppliers, which includes the enforcement of
human rights standards through our ongoing approval and monitoring system. In addition, sales are monitored regularly at both the retail and wholesale levels and modifications in production can be
made either to increase or reduce inventories. We continually seek additional suppliers throughout the world for our sourcing needs and place our orders in a manner designed to limit the risk that a
disruption of production at any one facility could cause a serious inventory problem. We have not experienced significant production delays or difficulties in importing goods. Our purchases from our
suppliers are effected through individual purchase orders specifying the price and quantity of the items to be produced.

Warehousing and Distribution

To facilitate distribution, our products are shipped from manufacturers to our wholesale and retail warehousing and distribution centers for inspection, sorting,
packing and shipment. Ranging in size from 112,000 to 575,000 square feet, our centers are located in Arkansas, Georgia, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Tennessee. Each of our centers is generally
dedicated to serving either our wholesale


customers
or our retail stores. Our warehousing and distribution centers are designed to provide responsive service to our customers and our retail stores, as the case may be, on a
cost-effective basis. This includes the use of various forms of electronic communications to meet customer needs, including advance shipping notices for all major customers. We believe
that our distribution centers and capabilities compare favorably on a cost and service basis with those of our competitors and that these constitute part of our core competencies.

Advertising and Promotion

We market substantially all of our products on a brand-by-brand basis targeting distinct consumer demographics and lifestyles. Our
marketing programs are an integral feature of our product offerings. Advertisements generally portray a lifestyle rather than a specific item. We intend for each of our brands to be a leader in its
respective market segment, with strong consumer awareness and consumer loyalty. We believe that our brands are successful in their respective segments because we have strategically positioned each
brand to target a distinct consumer demographic. We will continue to design and market our products to complement each other, satisfy lifestyle needs, emphasize product features important to our
target consumers and produce consumer loyalty.

We
advertise our brands in national print media (including fashion, entertainment/human interest, business, men's, women's, niche and sports magazines,

The New
York Times

and

The Wall Street Journal

), on television and in movie theaters. We also participate in cooperative advertising
programs with our customers, as we believe that brand awareness and in-store positioning are further strengthened by our contributions to such programs.

With
respect to our retail operations, we generally rely upon local outlet mall developers to promote traffic for their centers. Outlet center developers employ multiple formats,
including signage (highway billboards, off-highway directional signs, on-site signage and on-site information centers), print advertising (brochures, newspapers and
travel magazines), direct marketing (to tour bus companies and travel agents), radio and television and special promotions.

We
believe Calvin Klein is one of the best known designer names in the world. One of the efforts that helps to establish the

Calvin Klein

image is its high-profile, cutting-edge advertising campaigns that stimulate admiration, publicity, curiosity and debate. Calvin Klein has a dedicated in-house
advertising agency, with experienced in-house creative and media teams that develop and execute a substantial portion of the institutional consumer advertising for products under the

Calvin Klein

brands. The teams work closely with other functional areas within Calvin Klein and its licensing and other business partners to deliver a
consistent and unified brand message to the consumer. Calvin Klein oversees a worldwide marketing, advertising and promotion program of over $200 million, most of which is funded by its
licensees and authorized users.

Calvin Klein

products are advertised primarily in national print media, through outdoor signage and, with respect to fragrances, in
television advertising spots. We believe promotional activities throughout the year further strengthen brand awareness of the

Calvin Klein

brands. The
Spring and Fall

Calvin Klein

high-end apparel collections are presented at major fashion shows in New York City and Milan, which typically
generate extensive media coverage. Other Calvin Klein promotional efforts include in-store appearances by fashion models, providing wardrobes to celebrities for award ceremonies, product
launches, gift-with-purchase programs, charity events and special corporate-sponsored events.

Trademarks

We own the

Van Heusen

,

Bass, G.H. Bass & Co.

,

IZOD, IZOD G,
Arrow

and

Eagle

brands, as well as related trademarks and lesser-known names. We
beneficially own the

Calvin Klein Collection

,

ck Calvin Klein

and

Calvin
Klein

marks. Calvin Klein and Warnaco are co-owners of the Calvin Klein


Trademark
Trust, which is the sole and exclusive title owner of substantially all registered

Calvin Klein Collection, ck Calvin Klein

and

Calvin Klein

trademarks.
The sole purpose of the trust is to hold these marks. Calvin Klein maintains and protects the marks on behalf of the trust
pursuant to a servicing agreement. The Trust exclusively licenses to Warnaco on a perpetual, royalty-free basis the use of the marks on men's underwear and sleepwear and women's intimate
apparel and sleepwear, and to Calvin Klein on a perpetual, royalty-free basis the use of the marks on all other products. Warnaco pays us a fee based on Warnaco's worldwide sales of
underwear, intimate apparel and sleepwear products bearing any of the

Calvin Klein

marks under an administration agreement between Calvin Klein and
Warnaco.

With
respect to our

Calvin Klein Collection, ck Calvin Klein

and

Calvin Klein

marks, we
allow Mr. Calvin Klein to retain the right to use his name, on a non-competitive basis, with respect to his right of publicity, unless those rights are already being used in the
Calvin Klein business. We also grant
Mr. Klein a royalty-free worldwide right to use the

Calvin Klein

mark with respect to certain personal businesses and activities,
such as motion picture, television and video businesses, a book business, writing, speaking and/or teaching engagements, non-commercial photography, charitable activities and architectural
and industrial design projects, subject to certain limitations designed to protect the image and prestige of the

Calvin Klein

brands and to avoid
competitive conflicts.

Our
trademarks are the subject of registrations and pending applications throughout the world for use on a variety of apparel, footwear and related products, and we continue to expand
our worldwide usage and registration of new and related trademarks. In general, trademarks remain valid and enforceable as long as the marks continue to be used in connection with the products and
services with which they are identified and, as to registered tradenames, the required registration renewals are filed. In markets outside of the United States, particularly those where products
bearing any of our brands are not sold by us or any of our licensees or other authorized users, our rights to the use of trademarks may not be clearly established.

We
regard the license to use our trademarks and our other intellectual property rights in the trademarks as valuable assets in marketing our products and, on a worldwide basis,
vigorously seek to protect them against infringement. We are susceptible to others imitating our products and infringing on our intellectual property rights. This is especially the case with respect
to the

Calvin Klein

brands, as the

Calvin Klein

brands enjoy significant worldwide consumer recognition
and their generally higher pricing provides significant opportunity and incentive for counterfeiters and infringers. Calvin Klein has a broad, proactive enforcement program, which we believe has been
generally effective in controlling the sale of counterfeit products in the United States and in major markets abroad. We have taken enforcement action with respect to our other marks on an
as-needed basis.

Contingent Purchase Price Payments to Mr. Calvin Klein

Prior to our acquisition of Calvin Klein, Calvin Klein was obligated to pay Mr. Calvin Klein and his heirs in perpetuity a percentage of sales of certain
products bearing any of the

Calvin Klein

brands under a design services letter agreement. In connection with our acquisition of Calvin Klein, we bought
all of Mr. Klein's rights under that agreement in consideration of a warrant to purchase our common stock and for granting him the right to receive from us contingent purchase price payments
for a period of 15 years based on a percentage of total worldwide net sales of products bearing any of the

Calvin Klein

brands. In addition,
Mr. Klein was released from all of his obligations under that agreement, including his obligation to render design services to Calvin Klein, and the design services letter agreement was
terminated. Our obligation to make contingent purchase price payments to Mr. Klein in connection with our acquisition of Calvin Klein is guaranteed by our Calvin Klein subsidiaries and is
secured by a subordinated pledge of all of the equity interests in our Calvin Klein subsidiaries and a subordinated lien on substantially all of our domestic Calvin Klein subsidiaries' assets. Events
of default under the agreements governing the collateral for our contingent payment obligations to Mr. Klein, include, but are not limited to (1) our failure to make payments to
Mr. Klein when due, (2) covenant


defaults,
(3) cross-defaults to other indebtedness in excess of an agreed amount, (4) events of bankruptcy, (5) monetary judgment defaults and (6) a change of control,
including the sale of any portion of the equity interests in our Calvin Klein subsidiaries. An event of default under those agreements would permit Mr. Klein to foreclose on his security
interest in the collateral. In addition, if we fail to pay Mr. Klein a contingent purchase price payment when due and such failure to pay continues for 60 days or more after a final
judgment by a court is rendered relating to our failure to pay, Mr. Klein will no longer be restricted from competing with us as he otherwise would be under the non-competition
provisions contained in the purchase agreement relating to our acquisition of Calvin Klein, although he would still not be able to use any of the

Calvin
Klein

brands or any similar trademark in any competing business.

Competition

The apparel and footwear industries are competitive as a result of their fashion orientation, mix of large and small producers, the flow of domestic and imported
merchandise and the wide diversity of retailing methods. Some of our larger branded apparel and footwear competitors include Polo Ralph Lauren, Tommy Hilfiger Corporation, Nautica Enterprises, Inc.,
Perry Ellis International, Timberland Company and Rockport. As a result of our acquisition of Calvin Klein, we believe The Donna Karan Company LLC, Polo Ralph Lauren's Purple Label, Giorgio
Armani SPA, Gucci Group N.V. and Prada SPA Group also are our competitors. In addition, we face significant competition from retailers, including our own wholesale customers, through their private
label programs.

We
compete primarily on the basis of style, quality and service. Our business depends on our ability to stimulate consumer tastes and demands, as well as on our ability to remain
competitive in the areas of quality, service and price. We believe we are particularly well-positioned to compete in the apparel and footwear industries. Our diversified portfolio of
apparel brands and apparel and footwear products and our use of multiple channels of distribution have allowed us to develop a business that produces results which are not dependent on any one
demographic group, merchandise preference or distribution channel. We have developed a portfolio of brands that appeal to a broad spectrum of consumers. Our owned brands have long histories and enjoy
high recognition within their respective consumer segments. We develop our owned and licensed brands to complement each other and to generate strong consumer loyalty. The

Calvin Klein

brands provide us
with the opportunity to develop businesses that target different consumer groups at higher price points and in
higher-end distribution channels than our other brands, as well as with significant global opportunities due to the worldwide recognition of the brands.

Imports and Import Restrictions

A substantial portion of our products is manufactured by contractors located outside the United States. These products are imported and are subject to United
States customs laws, which impose tariffs, as well as quota restrictions, for non-WTO countries. Under the provisions of the WTO agreement governing international trade in textiles, known
as the "WTO Agreement on Textiles and Clothing," effective as of January 1, 2005, the United States and other WTO member countries have eliminated quotas on textiles and apparel-related
products from WTO member countries. As a result, quota restrictions no longer affect our business in most countries; however, the removal of quotas resulted in an import surge from China. Accordingly,
the United States, pursuant to the U.S.-China Accession Agreement to join the WTO, has imposed safeguard quotas on certain categories of products imported from China. The imposition of these safeguard
quotas has not had any adverse impact on us, as the quotas that were established were significantly larger than quotas China had in place prior to 2005. Furthermore, we closely monitor our imports and
are aware of the quantities that will be shipped on a month-by-month basis. This enables us to ensure that there are no supply chain disruptions as a result of the usage of the
quota. The safeguard restrictions imposed will expire December 31, 2008. Presently, a portion of our imported products is eligible for certain duty-advantaged programs commonly
known as NAFTA, AGOA, and CBTPA/CBI, which will be replaced by CAFTA in 2006.


Environmental Matters

Our facilities and operations are subject to various environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, including the proper maintenance of
asbestos-containing materials. In addition, we may incur liability under environmental statutes and regulations with respect to the contamination of sites that we own or operate or previously owned or
operated (including contamination caused by prior owners and operators of such sites, abutters or other persons) and the off-site disposal of hazardous materials. We believe our operations
are in compliance with terms of all applicable laws and regulations.

Employees

As of January 29, 2006, we employed approximately 5,200 persons on a full-time basis and approximately 4,500 persons on a part-time
basis. Approximately 4% of our employees were represented for the purpose of collective bargaining by five different unions. Additional persons, some represented by these five unions, are employed
from time to time based upon our manufacturing schedules and retailing seasonal needs. Our collective bargaining agreements generally are for three-year terms. We believe that our
relations with our employees are satisfactory.

Item 1A. Risk Factors

Our substantial level of debt could impair our financial condition.

We currently have a substantial amount of debt. Our significant level of debt could have important consequences to investors, including:

•

requiring
a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations be used for the payment of interest on our debt, therefore reducing the funds available to us for our
operations or other capital needs;

•

limiting
our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industries in which we operate because our available cash flow after paying
principal and interest on our debt may not be sufficient to make the capital and other expenditures necessary to address these changes;

•

increasing
our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions because, during periods in which we experience lower earnings and cash flow, we will be
required to devote a proportionally greater amount of our cash flow to paying principal and interest on our debt;

•

limiting
our ability to obtain additional financing in the future to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and general corporate requirements;

•

placing
us at a competitive disadvantage to other relatively less leveraged competitors that have more cash flow available to fund working capital, capital expenditures and
general corporate requirements; and

•

any
borrowings we make at variable interest rates, including our revolving credit facility, leave us vulnerable to increases in interest rates generally.

We may not be able to continue to realize revenue growth from Calvin Klein.

A significant portion of our business strategy involves growing our Calvin Klein business. Our realization of revenue growth from Calvin Klein will depend largely
upon our ability to:

•

continue
to maintain and enhance the distinctive brand identity of

Calvin Klein;

•

continue
to maintain good working relationships with Calvin Klein's licensees;

•

continue
to enter into new licensing agreements for the

Calvin Klein

brands, both domestically and internationally;

•

successfully
design and market the

Calvin Klein

men's better sportswear line over time; and

•

continue
to open

Calvin Klein

retail outlet stores in premium outlet malls and successfully operate over time a chain of such
stores.

We
cannot assure you that we can successfully execute any of these actions or our growth strategy for the

Calvin Klein

brands, nor can we
assure you that the launch of any

Calvin Klein

branded products by us or our licensees or that the continued offering of these lines will achieve the
degree of consistent success necessary to generate profits or positive cash flow. Our ability to successfully carry out our growth strategy may be affected by, among other things, our ability to
enhance our relationships with existing customers to obtain additional selling space and develop new relationships with apparel retailers, economic and competitive conditions, changes in consumer
spending patterns and changes in consumer tastes and style trends. If we fail to develop and grow successfully the Calvin


Klein
business, our financial condition and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected.

A substantial portion of our revenues and gross profit is derived from a small number of large customers and the loss of any of these customers could
substantially reduce our revenues.

A
few of our customers, including Federated Department Stores, Inc., J. C. Penney Company, Inc., Kohl's Corporation and Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., account
for significant portions of our revenues. Sales to our five largest customers were 34.3% of our revenues in fiscal 2005, 28.8% of our revenues in fiscal 2004 and 27.2% of our revenues in fiscal 2003.
Federated, our largest customer, accounted for 13.7% of our revenues in fiscal 2005. We do not have long-term agreements with any of our customers and purchases generally occur on an
order-by-order basis. A decision by any of our major customers, whether motivated by marketing strategy, competitive conditions, financial difficulties or otherwise, to
decrease significantly the amount of merchandise purchased from us or our licensing or other business partners, or to change their manner of doing business with us or our licensing or other business
partners, could substantially reduce our revenues and materially adversely affect our profitability. The retail industry has recently experienced a great deal of consolidation and other ownership
changes and we expect such changes to be ongoing. For example, in August 2005, Federated acquired The May Department Stores Company and is in the process of closing 79 stores. Store closings
will decrease the number of stores carrying our apparel products, while the remaining stores may purchase a smaller amount of our products and may reduce the retail floor space designated for our
brands. Federated may also close additional stores, which could further reduce our revenues. In the future, retailers may further consolidate, undergo restructurings or reorganizations, realign their
affiliations or reposition their stores' target markets. Any of these types of actions could decrease the number of stores that carry our
products or increase the ownership concentration within the retail industry, in each case having a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. These changes could
decrease our opportunities in the market, increase our reliance on a smaller number of large customers and decrease our negotiating strength with our customers. These factors could have a material
adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.

Our business could be adversely affected by financial instability experienced by our customers.

During
the past several years, various retailers have experienced significant financial difficulties, which have resulted in bankruptcies, liquidations and store closings. We sell our
products primarily to national and regional department, mid-tier department and mass market stores in the United States on credit and evaluate each customer's financial condition on a
regular basis in order to determine the credit risk we take in selling goods to them. The financial difficulties of a customer could cause us to curtail business with that customer and we may be
unable to shift sales to another viable customer. We may also assume more credit risk relating to receivables of a customer experiencing financial instability. Should these circumstances arise with
respect to our customers, our inability to shift sales or to collect on our trade accounts receivable from any one of our customers could substantially reduce our revenues and have a material adverse
effect on our financial condition and results of operations.

We primarily use foreign suppliers for our products and raw materials, which poses risks to our business operations.

During
2005, in excess of 95% of our apparel products and 95% of our raw materials for apparel were produced by and purchased or procured from independent manufacturers located in
countries in the Far East, Indian subcontinent, the Middle East, the Caribbean and Central America. We believe that we are one of the largest procurers of shirting fabric in the world. Additionally,
our footwear products and the raw materials therefor were produced by and purchased or procured from manufacturers located principally in countries in the Far East, Europe, South America and the
Caribbean. Although no single supplier and no one country is critical to our production needs, any of


the
following could materially and adversely affect our ability to produce or deliver our products and, as a result, have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of
operations:

•

political
or labor instability in countries where contractors and suppliers are located;

•

political
or military conflict involving the United States, which could cause a delay in the transportation of our products and raw materials to us and an increase in
transportation costs;

•

heightened
terrorism security concerns, which could subject imported or exported goods to additional, more frequent or more thorough inspections, leading to delays in
deliveries or impoundment of goods for extended periods or could result in decreased scrutiny by customs officials for counterfeit goods, leading to lost sales, increased costs for our
anti-counterfeiting measures and damage to the reputation of our brands;

•

a
significant decrease in availability or increase in cost of raw materials, particularly petroleum-based synthetic fabrics, which are currently in high demand;

•

disease
epidemics and health-related concerns, such as the SARS outbreak and the mad cow and hoof-and-mouth disease outbreaks in recent years and
current concerns over an avian flu pandemic, which could result in closed factories, reduced workforces, scarcity of raw materials and scrutiny or embargoing of goods produced in infected areas;

•

the
migration and development of manufacturers, which could affect where our products are or are planned to be produced;

•

imposition
of regulations, quotas and safeguards relating to imports and our ability to adjust timely to changes in trade regulations, which, among other things, could limit
our ability to produce products in cost-effective countries that have the labor and expertise needed;

•

imposition
of duties, taxes and other charges on imports;

•

significant
fluctuation of the value of the dollar against foreign currencies; and

•

restrictions
on transfers of funds out of countries where our foreign licensees are located.

If our manufacturers fail to use acceptable ethical business practices, our business could suffer.

We
require our manufacturers to operate in compliance with applicable laws, rules and regulations regarding working conditions, employment practices and environmental compliance.
Additionally, we impose upon our business partners operating guidelines that require additional obligations in those areas in order to promote ethical business practices, and our staff and third
parties we retain for such purposes periodically visit and monitor the operations of our independent manufacturers to determine compliance. However, we do not control our independent manufacturers or
their labor and other business practices. If one of our manufacturers violates labor or other laws or implements labor or other business practices that are generally regarded as unethical in the
United States, the shipment of finished products to us could be interrupted, orders could be cancelled, relationships could be terminated and our reputation could be damaged. Any of these events could
have a material adverse effect on our revenues and, consequently, our results of operations.

Our reliance on independent manufacturers could cause delay and damage customer relationships.

In
2005, we relied upon independent third parties for the manufacture of more than 95% of our apparel products and 100% of our footwear products. On March 6, 2006, we committed to
a plan to close our apparel manufacturing facility in Ozark, Alabama by May 15, 2006. As a result, 100% of our products will be produced by independent third parties. We do not have
long-term contracts with any of our suppliers. A manufacturer's failure to ship products to us in a timely manner or to meet


required
quality standards could cause us to miss the delivery date requirements of our customers for those products. As a result, customers could cancel their orders, refuse to accept deliveries or
demand reduced prices. Any of these actions taken by our customers could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and, consequently, our results of operations.

A significant portion of our revenues is dependent on royalties and licensing.

In 2005, $211.6 million, or 11.1%, of our revenues were derived from licensing royalties and other revenues, principally in our Calvin Klein Licensing
segment. Royalty and other revenues from Calvin Klein's three largest business partners accounted for approximately 55% of its royalty and other revenues in 2005. This concentration will increase as a
result of Warnaco's acquisition of the licensees of jeanswear in Europe and Asia and bridge apparel and accessories in Europe. Those licensees, which
were controlled by the Fratini family, accounted for approximately 11% of the segment's 2005 royalty and other revenues; Warnaco accounted for another 28%. We also derive licensing revenues from our

Van Heusen, IZOD, IZOD G,
G.H. Bass & Co.

and

Arrow

brand names, as well as from sublicensing of

Geoffrey Beene, BCBG Max Azria, BCBG Attitude

and

Donald J. Trump Signature Collection.

Our three
largest licensing partners accounted for approximately 35.5% of licensing revenue for these brand names as a group in 2005. The operating profit associated with our royalty and other revenues is
significant because the operating expenses directly associated with administering and monitoring an individual licensing or similar agreement are minimal. Therefore, the loss of a significant business
partner, whether due to the termination or expiration of the relationship, the cessation of the business partner's operations or otherwise (including as a result of financial difficulties of the
partner), without an equivalent replacement, could materially affect our profitability.

While
we generally have significant control over our business partners' products and advertising, we rely on our business partners for, among other things, operational and financial
controls over their businesses. Our business partners' failure to successfully market licensed products or our inability to replace our existing business partners could materially and adversely affect
our revenues both directly from reduced royalty and other revenues received and indirectly from reduced sales of our other products. Risks are also associated with a business partner's ability to:

•

obtain
capital;

•

execute
its business plans, including timely delivery of quality products;

•

manage
its labor relations;

•

maintain
relationships with its suppliers;

•

manage
its credit risk effectively; and

•

maintain
relationships with its customers.

In
addition, we rely on our business partners to preserve the value of our brands. Although we make every attempt to protect our brands through, among other things, approval rights over
design, production quality, packaging, merchandising, distribution, advertising and promotion of our products, we cannot assure you that we can control the use by our business partners of each of our
licensed brands. The misuse of our brands by a business partner could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. For example, Calvin Klein in the
past has been involved in legal proceedings with Warnaco with respect to certain quality and distribution issues. As a result of our acquisition of Calvin Klein in 2003, Warnaco is entitled to control
design and advertising related to the sale of underwear, intimate apparel and sleepwear products bearing the

Calvin Klein

brands, although to date, it
has only exercised this right with respect to design. We cannot assure you that Warnaco will continue to maintain the same standards of design and, if it assumes control,


advertising
previously maintained by Calvin Klein, although we believe they are generally obligated to do so.

Our retail stores are heavily dependent on the ability and desire of consumers to travel and shop.

Our
retail stores are located principally in outlet malls, which are typically located in or near vacation destinations or away from large population centers where department stores and
other traditional retailers are concentrated. As a result, fuel shortages, increased fuel prices, travel restrictions, travel concerns and other circumstances, including as a result of war, terrorist
attacks or the perceived threat of war or terrorist attacks, which would lead to decreased travel, could have a material adverse affect on us. Other factors which could affect the success of our
stores include:

•

the
location of the mall or the location of a particular store within the mall;

•

the
other tenants occupying space at the mall;

•

increased
competition in areas where the outlet malls are located;

•

a
downturn in the economy generally or in a particular area where an outlet mall is located; and

•

the
amount of advertising and promotional dollars spent on attracting consumers to the malls.

We may be unable to protect our trademarks and other intellectual property rights.

Our
trademarks and other intellectual property rights are important to our success and our competitive position. We are susceptible to others imitating our products and infringing on our
intellectual property rights. Since our acquisition of Calvin Klein in 2003, we are more susceptible to infringement of our intellectual property rights, as the

Calvin
Klein

brands enjoy significant worldwide consumer recognition, and the generally higher pricing of

Calvin Klein

branded products
creates additional incentive for counterfeiters and infringers. Imitation or counterfeiting of our products or infringement of our intellectual property rights could diminish the value of our brands
or otherwise adversely affect our revenues. We cannot assure you that the actions we have taken to establish and protect our trademarks and other intellectual property rights will be adequate to
prevent imitation of our products by others or to prevent others from seeking to invalidate our trademarks or block sales of our products as a violation of the trademarks and intellectual property
rights of others. In addition, we cannot assure you that others will not assert rights in, or ownership of, trademarks and other intellectual property rights of ours or in marks that are similar to
ours or marks that we license and/or market or that we will be able to successfully resolve these types of conflicts to our satisfaction. In some cases, there may be trademark owners who have prior
rights to our marks because the laws of certain foreign countries may not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the United States. In other cases, there may be
holders who have prior rights to similar marks. For example, we were involved in a proceeding relating to a company's claim of prior rights to the

IZOD

mark in Mexico, and Calvin Klein was involved in a proceeding relating to a company's claim of prior rights to the

Calvin Klein

mark in Chile. We are
currently involved in opposition and cancellation proceedings with respect to marks similar to some of our brands, both domestically and internationally.

The success of Calvin Klein depends on the value of our Calvin Klein brands, and if the value of those brands were to diminish, our business could be adversely
affected.

Our
success depends on our brands and their value. The

Calvin Klein

name is integral to the existing Calvin Klein business, as well as to
our strategies for continuing to grow and expand Calvin Klein. The

Calvin Klein

brands could be adversely affected if Mr. Calvin Klein's public
image or reputation were to be tarnished. We may seek in the future stockholder approval to change the name of our company to "Calvin Klein Inc." or a similar name. Any such name change could
increase our risks related to the public perception of the

Calvin Klein

name.


Our success is dependent on the strategies and reputation of our licensors.

Our business strategy is to offer our products on a multiple brand, multiple channel and multiple price point basis. This strategy is designed to provide
stability should market trends shift. As part of this strategy we license the names and brands of recognized designers and celebrities, including Kenneth Cole, Max Azria, Michael Kors, Sean "Diddy"
Combs (Sean John), Donald J. Trump and Joseph Abboud. In entering into these license agreements, we plan our products to be targeted towards certain market segments based on consumer demographics,
design, suggested pricing and channel of distribution in order to minimize competition between our own products and maximize profitability. If any of our licensors determines to
"re-position" a brand we license from them, introduce similar products under similar brand names or otherwise change the parameters of design, pricing, distribution, target market or
competitive set, we could experience a significant downturn in that brand's business, adversely affecting our sales and profitability. In addition, as products may be personally associated with these
designers and celebrities, our sales of those products could be materially and adversely affected if any of those individual's images or reputations were to be negatively impacted.

Our revenues and profits are cyclical and sensitive to general economic conditions, consumer confidence and spending patterns.

The
apparel and footwear industries in which we operate have historically been subject to substantial cyclical variations and are particularly affected by adverse trends in the general
economy, with consumer spending tending to decline during recessionary periods. The success of our operations depends on consumer spending. Consumer spending is impacted by a number of factors,
including actual and perceived economic conditions affecting disposable consumer income (such as unemployment, wages and salaries), business conditions, interest rates, availability of credit and tax
rates in the general economy and in the international, regional and local markets where our products are sold. Any significant deterioration in general economic conditions or increases in interest
rates could reduce the level of consumer spending and inhibit consumers' use of credit. In addition, war, terrorist activity or the threat of war and terrorist activity could adversely affect consumer
spending, and thereby have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.

We face intense competition in the apparel industry.

Competition is strong in the apparel industry. We compete with numerous domestic and foreign designers, brands, manufacturers and retailers of apparel,
accessories and footwear, some of which are significantly larger or more diversified or have greater resources than we do. In addition, through their use of private label programs, we compete directly
with our wholesale customers. We compete within the apparel industry primarily on the basis of:

•

anticipating
and responding to changing consumer tastes and demands in a timely manner and developing attractive, quality products;

•

maintaining
favorable brand recognition;

•

appropriately
pricing products and creating an acceptable value proposition for customers;

•

providing
strong and effective marketing support;

•

ensuring
product availability and optimizing supply chain efficiencies with third party manufacturers and retailers; and

•

obtaining
sufficient retail floor space and effective presentation of our products at retail.

The
failure to compete effectively or to keep pace with rapidly changing markets could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In
addition, if we


misjudge
the market for our products, we could be faced with significant excess inventories for some products and missed opportunities with others.

The loss of members of our executive management and other key employees could have a material adverse effect on our business.

We
depend on the services and management experience of our executive officers who have substantial experience and expertise in our business. We also depend on other key employees
involved in our licensing, design and advertising operations. Competition for qualified personnel in the apparel and footwear industries is intense, and competitors may use aggressive tactics to
recruit our key employees. The unexpected loss of services of one or more of these individuals could materially adversely affect us.

Acquisitions may not be successful in achieving intended benefits and synergies.

One
component of our growth strategy contemplates our making select acquisitions if appropriate opportunities arise. Prior to completing any acquisition, our management team identifies
expected synergies, cost savings and growth opportunities. However, these benefits may not be realized due to, among other things:

•

delays
or difficulties in completing the integration of acquired companies or assets;

•

higher
than expected costs or a need to allocate resources to manage unexpected operating difficulties;

•

diversion
of the attention and resources of management;

•

consumers'
failure to accept product offerings by us or our licensees;

•

inability
to retain key employees in acquired companies; and

•

assumption
of liabilities unrecognized in due diligence.

We
cannot assure you that any acquisition will not have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.

Our segment reporting has changed and the SEC may request further changes that would require us to restate segment information that appears in the notes to our
financial statements.

We manage our business through operating divisions that are aggregated into four reportable segments: Wholesale, Retail Apparel and Related Products, Retail
Footwear and Related Products and Calvin Klein Licensing. This segment reporting is first being shown in this report. We changed our reporting from two segments—Apparel and Related
Products and Calvin Klein Licensing—in response to comments we received from the SEC in connection with an ordinary course review of our annual report on Form 10-K for our fiscal
year ended January 30, 2005. In its comments, the SEC has questioned whether we need to report additional segments to satisfy the requirements of Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB)
Statement No. 131. We believe the four segments that we are now reporting satisfy the requirements of FASB Statement No. 131. As of April 13, 2006, we are continuing to discuss
with the SEC our segment reporting. If, as a result of these discussions, it is concluded that further segments need to be reported, we will be required to restate segment information that appears
throughout our notes to financial statements and file an amendment to this annual report on Form 10-K for our 2005 fiscal year. The restatement of the notes to our financial statements to
report different segments and segment information could materially and adversely affect our stock price.

Future sales of our common stock may depress our stock price.

Sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market or otherwise, by us or by a major stockholder (including pursuant to a
registration rights agreement we have with the


holders
of our Series B convertible preferred stock), could depress the market price of our common stock and impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity
securities.

Our stockholder rights plan, provisions in our certificate of incorporation and our by-laws and Delaware General Corporate Law could make it more
difficult to acquire us and may reduce the market price of our common stock.

We
have adopted a stockholder rights plan that, subject to certain limitations, limits the ability of any person to acquire more than 20% of our common stock. Our stockholder rights plan
could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control or the removal of management, of deterring potential acquirers from making an offer to our stockholders and of limiting any
opportunity to realize premiums over prevailing market prices for our common stock.

Our
certificate of incorporation and by-laws contain certain provisions, including provisions requiring supermajority voting (80% of the outstanding voting power) to approve
certain business combinations with beneficial owners of 5% or more of our outstanding stock entitled to vote for election of directors, permitting the board of directors to fill vacancies on the board
and authorizing the board of directors to issue additional shares of preferred stock without approval of our stockholders. These provisions could also have the effect of deterring changes of control.

In
addition, Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporate Law imposes restrictions on mergers and other business combinations between us and any holder of 15% or more of our
common stock. The existence of this provision may have an anti-takeover effect with respect to transactions not approved in advance by the board of directors.

Significant influence by certain stockholders.

In connection with our acquisition of Calvin Klein, affiliates of Apax Managers, Inc. and Apax Partners Europe Managers Limited purchased
$250 million of our Series B convertible preferred stock. During 2005, the Apax affiliates voluntarily converted a portion of such Series B convertible preferred stock, as further
discussed in Note 10, "Series B Convertible Preferred Stock," in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this report. As of January 29, 2006, the
remaining Series B convertible preferred stock held by the Apax affiliates had liquidation preference of $161.9 million and was convertible by them into 21.1% of our outstanding common
stock. If we elect not to pay a cash dividend for any quarter, then the Series B convertible preferred stock will be treated for purposes of the payment of future dividends and upon conversion,
redemption or liquidation as if an in-kind dividend has been paid.

Pursuant
to the Investors' Rights Agreement we have with the Apax affiliates, the holders of our Series B convertible preferred stock are generally prohibited from initiating a
takeover of us. In certain circumstances, the Apax affiliates may be able to participate in a bidding process initiated by a third party. As long as Apax affiliates own at least 50% of the shares of
our Series B convertible preferred stock initially sold to the Apax affiliates, they will have the ability to prevent a change of control, or a sale of all or substantially all of our assets.
As of January 29, 2006, the Apax affiliates owned approximately 61% of the shares of our Series B convertible preferred stock initially issued to them. Additionally, as long as 50% of
our Series B convertible preferred stock remains outstanding, the holders of our Series B convertible preferred stock will have a right to purchase their pro rata share of newly issued
securities. The holders of our Series B convertible preferred stock have certain additional rights, including the right to approve the issuance of certain new series of our preferred stock,
which could also have the effect of discouraging a third party from pursuing a non-negotiated takeover, and preventing changes in control, of us.

Prior
to the conversion of a portion of our Series B convertible preferred stock during 2005, the Apax affiliates had the right to elect separately as a class three directors and
to have one of their


directors
serve on the audit, compensation, nominating and executive committees of our board, subject to applicable law, rule and regulation; current regulation precludes service on the audit
committee. In connection with the conversion, the remaining preferred stockholders agreed to reduce their right to elect directors from three directors to two directors and to further reduce this
right to one director if they did not have more than one director elected as of December 31, 2005. The remaining preferred stockholders did not elect an additional director as of
December 31, 2005 and, as such, only one such director can be and is currently elected. If the Apax affiliates continue to own at least 10% of the Series B convertible preferred stock
issued in connection with the acquisition of Calvin Klein they will maintain their right to elect separately as a class one director. However, the right of the Series B convertible preferred
stockholders to elect a director will be terminated if the previously announced acquisition of the Tommy Hilfiger Corporation by certain affiliates of the Apax affiliates is consummated. As a result
of these and other rights related to their ownership of our Series B convertible preferred stock, the Apax affiliates have substantial influence over us.

The
interests of the Apax affiliates or the holders of Series B convertible preferred stock may at any time conflict with, or diverge from, those of our other stockholders. The
Apax affiliates or such other Series B convertible preferred stockholders, by virtue of their large percentage of voting rights and the terms of the Series B convertible preferred stock,
will be able to substantially influence, and may effectively be able to prevent or veto, certain corporate actions, such as the sale of our company, the issuance of a new class or series of our stock
in connection with a corporate transaction or other major corporate action.

Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments

We do not have unresolved comments within the parameters established under this Item. However, we did receive comments on or about February 9, 2006 on our annual

Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

OVERVIEW

The following discussion and analysis is intended to help you understand us, our operations and our financial performance. It should be read in conjunction with
our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes which are included elsewhere in this report.

We
are one of the largest apparel companies in the world, with a heritage dating back over 125 years. Our brand portfolio consists of nationally recognized brand names, including

Calvin Klein, Van Heusen, IZOD, Arrow, Bass

and

Eagle,

which are owned, and

Geoffrey Beene, Kenneth Cole New York, Kenneth Cole Reaction, BCBG Max Azria, BCBG Attitude, Sean John, Chaps, Donald J.
Trump Signature Collection

and

MICHAEL Michael Kors,

which are licensed. We launched a new licensed line of dress shirts under the

unlisted, A Kenneth
Cole Production

brand in the beginning of 2006 and will launch a new licensed line of dress shirts under the

JOE Joseph Abboud

brand in the second half of 2006.

We
had an exceptional year in 2005, following on a very strong performance in 2004. It was a year in which all of our businesses performed above expectations and fueled double digit
growth in earnings and record cash flow generation.

At
the core of our success was the power of our expanded business model. Our historical strategy has been to manage and market a portfolio of nationally recognized brands across multiple
product categories, through multiple channels of distribution and at multiple price points. This strategy was enhanced by our acquisition of Calvin Klein, Inc. in February 2003, which provided
us with one of the most famous designer names in the world and an additional platform for growth in revenues and profitability. Through that transaction, and to a lesser extent, our acquisition of
Arrow in December 2004, we were able to diversify our business model by providing growth opportunities from strong and highly profitable licensing streams which do not require capital
investments. Equally important, we also have broadened the reach of the

Calvin Klein

brands through growth of existing businesses and entry into new
businesses, both directly by us and through licensees. This additional diversification, in terms of product, positioning, business model and opportunity has not only enhanced our growth prospects, but
has also further moderated our risk to a downturn in any one of our businesses.

While
the expansion of the

Calvin Klein

brands, in terms of both product and global reach has contributed significant growth and
profitability, it was also the exceptional performance of our heritage


businesses
that drove consolidated results in 2005. Market share gains in both our wholesale dress shirt and sportswear businesses along with strong comparative store performance in the outlet retail
channel added to our success.

The
current year was notable not only in terms of profitability but also in terms of cash flow and strength in our balance sheet. We generated $143 million of cash flow, ending
the year with $267 million of cash. In July 2005, the holders of our Series B convertible preferred stock converted approximately 40% of their holdings into shares of our common
stock and then sold the common stock in a successful secondary offering. While we did not receive any of the proceeds from the secondary offering, and made payment to the preferred stockholders of
approximately $13 million to induce the conversion and sale, we were able to strengthen our balance sheet and broaden our investor base as a result. This positions us well as we enter 2006.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Operations Overview

We generate net sales from (i) the wholesale distribution of men's dress shirts and sportswear, principally under the brand names

Van Heusen, Arrow, Geoffrey
Beene, Calvin Klein, IZOD, BCBG Max Azria, BCBG Attitude, Chaps, Sean John, Donald J. Trump Signature Collection, Kenneth Cole New
York

,

Kenneth Cole Reaction

and

MICHAEL Michael Kors

, as well as various private
labels, and, through the end of 2003, footwear under the

Bass

brand and (ii) the sale, through approximately 700 company-operated retail stores,
of apparel, footwear and accessories under the brand names

Van Heusen

,

IZOD

,

Geoffrey Beene

,

Bass

and

Calvin Klein

. Our stores
operate in an outlet format, except for our

Calvin Klein Collection

store located in New York City, in which we sell men's and women's
high-end collection apparel and accessories, soft home furnishings and tableware. We closed our

Calvin Klein Collection

stores in Dallas and
Paris at the end of 2005 and will be discontinuing sales of our licensed line of

MICHAEL Michael Kors

dress shirts in connection with the licensor's
discontinuance of its other licensed menswear offerings under the brand.

We
generate royalty and other revenues from fees for licensing the use of our trademarks. Calvin Klein royalty and other revenues comprised 85% of total royalty and other revenues in
2005. Calvin Klein royalty and other revenues are derived under licenses and other arrangements primarily for jeans, underwear, fragrances, eyewear, watches and home furnishings. In
December 2004, we acquired the companies that own and license

Arrow

, which has generated, and will continue to generate, additional royalty and
other revenues.

Gross
profit on total revenues is total revenues less cost of goods sold. We include as cost of goods sold costs associated with the production and procurement of product, including
inbound freight costs, purchasing and receiving costs, inspection costs, internal transfer costs and other product procurement related charges. Since there is no cost of goods sold associated with
royalty and other revenues, 100%
of such revenues are included in gross profit. Due to the above factors, our gross profit may not be comparable to that of other entities.

Selling,
general and administrative expenses include all other expenses, excluding interest and income taxes. Salaries and related fringe benefits are the largest component of selling,
general and administrative expenses, comprising 48% of such expenses in 2005. Rent and occupancy for offices, warehouses and retail stores is the next largest expense, comprising 21% of selling,
general and administrative expenses in 2005.

Net Sales

Our net sales in 2005 increased to $1,697.3 million from $1,460.2 million in 2004 and $1,425.7 million in 2003. Our 2005 net sales increase
of $237.1 million over 2004 net sales was due principally to the net effect of the items described below.

Net
sales

increases

in 2005 included:

•

The
addition of $100.5 million of net sales attributable to our

Calvin Klein

men's better sportswear line marketed to
upscale specialty and department stores, which was launched for the Fall 2004 season, as well as the continued opening of

Calvin Klein

retail outlet
stores in premium outlet malls. We currently intend to have as many as 85 to 90

Calvin Klein

outlet stores by the end of 2008.

•

The
addition of $79.2 million of net sales attributable to growth in our

IZOD

,

Arrow

and

Van Heusen

wholesale sportswear businesses.

•

The
addition of $75.7 million of net sales attributable to growth in our wholesale dress shirt business, particularly from the

BCBG Max Azria,
BCBG Attitude, Sean John

and

Chaps

lines, which were launched in the second half of 2004, and the

Donald
J. Trump Signature Collection

line, which was launched in the first quarter of 2005, as well as growth in our core brands,

Van Heusen, Arrow, Geoffrey
Beene, IZOD, Eagle

and

Calvin Klein

.

•

The
addition of net sales attributable to a 6.0% sales increase in our

Van Heusen, IZOD, Geoffrey Beene

and

Bass

retail stores open at least two years, offset,
in part, by a reduction in the overall number of stores in these divisions.


Net
sales

decreases

in 2005 included:

•

A
$15.5 million net sales decline due to the elimination of our private label wholesale sportswear business and the discontinuation in 2004 of our sales of a licensed
line of

DKNY

dress shirts.

Our
2004 net sales increase of $34.5 million over 2003 net sales was due principally to the net effect of the items described below.

Net
sales

increases

in 2004 included:

•

The
addition of $88.0 million of net sales attributable to the launch of our

Calvin Klein

men's better sportswear
line, as well as the continued opening of

Calvin Klein

retail outlet stores in premium outlet malls.

•

The
addition of $41.5 million attributable to growth in our

IZOD

and

Arrow

wholesale sportswear businesses.

•

The
addition of $12.0 million attributable to growth in our wholesale dress shirt business, particularly from the launch in 2004 of five new labels:

BCBG Max Azria, BCBG Attitude, MICHAEL Michael Kors, Sean
John

and

Chaps.

Net
sales

decreases

in 2004 included:

•

The
loss of the net sales attributable to the wholesale distribution of footwear, principally under the

Bass

brand, which in
2003 was $63.2 million. The

Bass

wholesale footwear business was transferred to a third party under a license agreement as of the first day of
2004.

•

The
loss of the net sales attributable to the wholesale distribution of the

Calvin Klein

men's and women's
high-end collection apparel businesses, which businesses were
transferred at the end of 2003 to a third party under a license agreement. The net sales of these businesses were $20.9 million in 2003.

•

The
loss of the net sales attributable to retail store closings, an 0.8% sales decline in our retail stores open at least two years and reduced wholesale sales of private
label sportswear.

Our
net sales in 2006 are expected to increase 3% to 4% due principally to growth in our

Calvin Klein

men's better sportswear line, the
continued opening of

Calvin Klein

retail outlet stores in premium outlet malls and increases in our wholesale sportswear business, particularly from our

Arrow

brand. These projected increases include the impact of the 2005 acquisition by Federated Department Stores, Inc. of The May Department Stores
Company, as the combined company is closing certain of its stores and implementing a brand mix strategy that limits our sales opportunity to them.

Royalty and Other Revenues

Royalty and other revenue increases over the prior year were $30.4 million and $38.1 million in 2005 and 2004, respectively. These increases were
primarily attributable to increases of $19.2 million and $31.6 million in 2005 and 2004, respectively, in our Calvin Klein Licensing segment due to new licensees and growth exhibited by
existing licensees. Approximately 75% of the growth in Calvin Klein royalty revenue in 2005 was attributable to growth from existing licenses, with the remaining 25% stemming from new licenses. In
particular, our existing licenses for jeanswear and fragrances generated significant increases. Royalty and other revenues for our other segments increased $11.2 million and $6.5 million
in 2005 and 2004, respectively. The increase in 2005 was due principally to the royalties generated by the

Arrow

brand license agreements acquired as
part of our acquisition of Arrow in December 2004. We currently expect that royalty and other revenues will increase 4% to 5% in 2006, both as a result of growth in the businesses of existing
licensees as well as royalties generated from new license agreements.


Gross Profit on Total Revenues

The following table shows our revenue mix between net sales and royalty and other revenues, as well as our gross profit as a percentage of total revenues for
2005, 2004 and 2003:

The
90 basis point improvement in the 2005 gross profit on total revenues percentage compared with 2004 was due principally to overall lower product costs and the elimination of

Arrow

royalty costs in
connection with our acquisition of Arrow in December 2004.

The
increase in the 2004 gross profit on total revenues percentage compared with 2003 was due principally to the increase in royalty and other revenues as a percentage of total revenues.
Since royalty and other revenues do not carry a cost of sales, the gross profit percentage on such revenues is 100.0%. In addition to revenue mix, our gross profit percentage improvement in 2004 was
enhanced by (i) a stronger retail environment for our outlet stores, which resulted in less promotional selling, (ii) stronger sell-throughs of our product in department
stores, requiring less support under margin allowance arrangements with many of our department and specialty store customers and (iii) the exiting of the lower margin

Bass

wholesale and

Calvin Klein Collection

wholesale businesses at the end of 2003, as both businesses
were transferred to third parties under license agreements which went into effect at the beginning of 2004.

We
currently expect that the gross profit on total revenues percentage will increase slightly in 2006 as royalty and other revenues should increase moderately as a percentage of total
revenues. Additionally, we expect to realize lower product costs beginning in the latter part of the year resulting from the closing of our apparel manufacturing facility in Ozark, Alabama during the
first half of the year.

Selling, General and Administrative (SG&A) Expenses

Our SG&A expenses were as follows:

Our
2005 SG&A expenses as a percentage of total revenues decreased 210 basis points to 35.8% in 2005 from the prior year's 37.9%. This decrease was due principally to leveraging a 16%
revenue increase against a 10% expense increase in 2005. The $62.4 million increase in 2005 SG&A expenses versus the prior year was due principally to the following: (i) additional
expenses associated with operating our

Calvin Klein

businesses, including our

Calvin Klein

men's better
sportswear line, which was launched in the second quarter of 2004, and additional

Calvin Klein

retail outlet store openings in premium outlet malls;
(ii) additional operating expenses, including increased advertising expenses, in our wholesale dress shirt and sportswear businesses to support the sales growth mentioned previously and
(iii) an increase in corporate and other expenses, including incentive compensation costs. Offsetting these increases, in part, was the absence of expenses incurred in 2004 associated with
exiting our wholesale footwear business and other related costs, as the

Bass

wholesale footwear business was transferred to a third party under a
license agreement as of the first day of 2004.

Our
2004 SG&A expenses as a percentage of total revenues of 37.9% remained relatively flat compared with 37.5% in 2003. While significant Calvin Klein integration and retail store
impairment


costs
that were incurred in 2003 did not recur in 2004, we incurred $12.6 million associated with exiting the wholesale footwear business and other related costs. In addition, our advertising
expenses, principally for Calvin Klein, increased by $23.3 million in 2004.

Our
2006 SG&A expenses as a percentage of total revenues are currently expected to increase approximately 100 basis points as we anticipate that we will incur approximately
$10.0 million in costs associated with the closing of our apparel manufacturing facility in Ozark, Alabama and approximately $10.0 million in costs associated with the
February 2006 departure of Mark Weber, our former Chief Executive Officer. Also impacting 2006 will be noncash stock option expense of approximately $10.0 million resulting from the
requirement to expense stock options beginning in 2006. Partially offsetting these items will be expense savings in 2006 of approximately $9.0 million due to the closure at the end of 2005 of
our

Calvin Klein Collection

stores in Dallas and Paris. Excluding the effect of these items, we expect that our 2006 SG&A expenses as a percentage of
total revenues will decrease slightly compared to 2005.

Gain on Sale of Investments

We did not sell any investments in 2005. In the first quarter of 2006, we sold minority interests held by one of our subsidiaries in certain entities that
operated various licensed

Calvin Klein

jeans and sportswear businesses in Europe and Asia. We estimate that this will result in a pre-tax
gain of approximately $31.0 million, which is net of related fees, amounts held in escrow and the carrying value of the investments.

In
2004, we sold an investment in marketable securities for a pre-tax gain of $0.7 million. In 2003, we sold our minority interest in Gant Company AB for
$17.2 million, net of related expenses, which resulted in a pre-tax gain of $3.5 million.

Interest Expense and Interest Income

Interest expense in 2005 decreased to $34.4 million compared with $44.6 million in 2004. Interest expense in 2004 included a prepayment penalty of
$7.3 million and the write-off of debt issuance costs of $2.1 million in connection with the purchase and redemption of our 9


/


% senior subordinated notes due
2008 in February 2004. These notes were purchased and redeemed with the net
proceeds of the issuance on February 18, 2004 of 7


/


% senior unsecured notes. Excluding the effect of these items, 2005 interest expense was relatively flat compared with 2004.
The 2005 interest income increase to $5.8 million compared with $1.7 million in 2004 was due principally to an increase in our average cash position during 2005 and an increase in
interest rates over the prior year.

Interest
expense in 2004 increased to $44.6 million compared with $37.5 million in 2003 due to the prepayment penalty and write-off of debt issuance costs noted
above. Excluding the effect of these items, 2004 interest expense was below 2003 levels due to the realization of the benefits of the lower interest rate of the 7


/


% notes. The 2004
interest income of $1.7 million remained relatively flat compared with the 2003 amount of $1.1 million.

Interest
expense is expected to be relatively flat in 2006 as compared with 2005 while interest income is expected to increase approximately $7.0 million to $8.0 million as
a result of the estimated increase in our average cash position during the year.


Income Taxes

Income tax expense as a percentage of pre-tax income was as follows:




37.3

%

32.6

%

35.8

%

The
increased percentage for 2005 compared with 2004 related principally to a $3.0 million reduction in the valuation allowance for state net operating loss carryforwards recorded
in 2004. Excluding the effect of the valuation allowance reduction, our income tax expense as a percentage of pre-tax income in 2004 would have been 36.1%.

The
decreased percentage for 2004 compared with 2003 related principally to non-deductible expenses included in 2003 pre-tax income related to the sale of our
minority interest in Gant and the reduction in the valuation allowance for state net operating loss carryforwards noted above.

We
are currently undergoing examinations of our income tax returns for multiple years by the Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities. We have reserves for exposures we believe
could result from these examinations. Any favorable or unfavorable result as compared with our reserves will affect our tax rate in the year it materializes. Excluding any such discrete items, we
currently anticipate our 2006
tax expense as a percentage of pre-tax income will approximate the 2005 percentage of 37.3%.

Earnings Per Share

Our calculation of earnings per share in 2005 was impacted by the voluntary conversion of a portion of our Series B convertible preferred stock by the
holders of such stock into shares of common stock. Such shares of common stock were subsequently sold in a registered offering by the holders. In connection with these transactions, we made an
inducement payment to the preferred stockholders of $1.75 for each share of common stock sold, or an aggregate of $12.9 million, and incurred certain costs, totaling $1.3 million,
specifically related to the registered common stock offering. The inducement payment was based on the net present value of the dividends that we would have been obligated to pay the preferred
stockholders through the earliest date on which it is estimated that we would have the right to convert the Series B convertible preferred stock, net of the present value of the dividends
payable over the same period on the shares of common stock into which the Series B convertible preferred stock was convertible. In accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in
the United States, the portion of our Series B convertible preferred stock that was converted was considered separately from the portion of our Series B convertible preferred stock that
was not converted for purposes of our earnings per share calculation. Further, the aggregate $14.2 million inducement payment and offering costs were treated as a preferred stock dividend and
attributed to the portion of our Series B convertible preferred stock that was converted. Note 15, "Earnings per Share," in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in
Item 8 of this report includes a further explanation and the calculation of net income per diluted common share.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

Generally, our principal source of cash is from operations, and our principal uses of cash are for capital expenditures, contingent purchase price payments to
Mr. Calvin Klein and dividends on our common stock and Series B convertible preferred stock.

Operations

Cash provided by operating activities in 2005 was $189.4 million, which significantly exceeded our net income of $111.7 million, principally as a
result of depreciation and amortization and deferred taxes. Included in cash provided by operating activities were contributions of $38.3 million to our


qualified
pension plans in 2005. In 2006, we expect our cash provided by operating activities to again exceed net income, due to depreciation and amortization, deferred taxes and noncash stock option
expense resulting from the requirement to expense stock options beginning in 2006. This will be offset, in part, by increases in working capital and an expected increase in income tax payments due to
exhausting certain net operating loss carryforwards. We do not currently intend to make any material contributions to our qualified pension plans in 2006.

Capital Expenditures

Our capital expenditures in 2005 were $37.4 million. We currently expect capital expenditures in 2006 to be in a range of $40 million to
$45 million, and decrease moderately thereafter, as the roll-out of our

Calvin Klein

stores in premium outlet centers will be substantially
complete. Our capital expenditures are generally for information systems, warehouse and office facilities and retail outlet stores. As such, we have no long-term contractual commitments
for capital expenditures.

Contingent Purchase Price Payments

In connection with our acquisition of Calvin Klein in 2003, we are obligated to pay Mr. Calvin Klein contingent purchase price payments through 2017 based
on 1.15% of total worldwide net sales of products bearing any of the

Calvin Klein

brands. Such contingent purchase price payments are recorded as an
addition to goodwill and totaled $25.5 million in 2005. We currently expect that such payments will be $26 million to $28 million in 2006, and will continue to increase moderately
thereafter.

Dividends

During 2005, the holders of our Series B convertible preferred stock voluntarily converted a portion of such stock into shares of our common stock. The
shares of common stock issued upon conversion were then sold in a registered offering by the holders. In connection with these transactions, we made an inducement payment to the preferred stockholders
of $1.75 for each share of common stock sold, or an aggregate of $12.9 million, and incurred certain costs, totaling $1.3 million, in connection with the offering. The inducement payment
was based on the net present value of the dividends that we would have been obligated to pay the preferred stockholders through the earliest date on which it is estimated that we would have the right
to convert the Series B convertible preferred stock, net of the present value of the dividends payable over the same period on the shares of common stock into which the Series B
convertible preferred stock was convertible. Under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, the aggregate $14.2 million inducement payment and offering costs were treated
as a preferred stock dividend.

Our
Series B convertible preferred stock has a dividend rate of 8.0% per annum, payable in cash. If we elect not to pay a cash dividend for any quarter, the
then-outstanding shares will be treated for purposes of the payment of future dividends and upon conversion, redemption or liquidation as if an in-kind dividend had been paid.
We currently expect to pay the dividends on the Series B convertible preferred stock in cash for the foreseeable future. Based on the liquidation preference of $161.9 million as of
January 29, 2006, cash dividends are expected to aggregate $13.2 million in 2006, which is a 53 week fiscal year, and $12.9 million in each 52 week fiscal year thereafter.

Our
common stock currently pays an annual dividend of $0.15 per share. Based on the number of shares of our common stock outstanding at January 29, 2006 and our estimates of stock
option exercises in 2006, we project that cash dividends on our common stock in 2006 will be $6.3 million to $6.5 million.


Cash Flow Summary

Our net cash flow in 2005 was $143.2 million. Cash flow in 2006 will be impacted by various other factors in addition to those noted above. For example,
the exercise of stock options provided $52.6 million of cash in 2005. We currently estimate that 2006 will include $10.0 million to $15.0 million of cash from the exercise of
stock options. In connection with the announced closing of our apparel manufacturing facility in Ozark, Alabama, we expect to incur cash expenditures of approximately $9.0 million in 2006
related to severance, employee termination benefits and facility closing costs. In
addition, we expect to incur cash expenditures of approximately $10.0 million in 2006 in connection with the departure of Mark Weber, our former Chief Executive Officer. Offsetting these cash
expenditures in 2006 will be cash receipts of approximately $31.0 million, net of amounts held in escrow and certain associated fees, generated by the sale by one of our subsidiaries of its
minority interests in certain entities.

We
currently expect to generate $115.0 million to $125.0 million of cash flow in 2006. There can be no assurance that this estimate will prove to be accurate. Unforeseen
events, including changes in our net income, working capital requirements or other items, including acquisitions, could occur which could cause our cash flow to vary significantly from this estimate.

Financing Arrangements

Our capital structure as of January 29, 2006 was as follows:

(in millions)

Long-term debt

$

399.5

Series B convertible preferred stock

161.9

Stockholders' equity

610.7

We
believe our capital structure provides a secure base to support our current operations and our planned growth in the future. There are no maturities of our long-term debt
until 2011. Our Series B convertible preferred stock has a conversion price of $14.00 per share, and based on current market conditions, and that redemption cannot be required until
November 2013, we believe the Series B convertible preferred stock will be converted to common stock rather than redeemed. The preferred stockholders have the right to convert the
remaining Series B convertible preferred stock to common stock at any time. Conversion may occur at our option after February 12, 2007, if the market value of our common stock equals or
exceeds 225% of the conversion price then in effect for 60 consecutive trading days.

For
near-term liquidity, in addition to our cash balance, we have a $325.0 million secured revolving credit facility that provides for revolving credit borrowings, as
well as the issuance of letters of credit. We may, at our option, borrow and repay amounts up to a maximum of $325.0 million for revolving credit borrowings and the issuance of letters of
credit, with a sublimit of $30.0 million for standby letters of credit and with no sublimit on trade letters of credit. Based on our working capital projections, we believe that our borrowing
capacity under this facility provides us with adequate liquidity for our peak seasonal needs for the foreseeable future. During 2005, we had no revolving credit borrowings under the facility, and the
maximum amount of letters of credit outstanding on any one date was $189.3 million. As of January 29, 2006, we had $156.1 million outstanding letters of credit under this
facility. We currently do not expect to have any revolving credit borrowings under the facility in 2006.

Our
secured revolving credit facility requires us to maintain certain financial covenants, including a minimum level of availability under the secured revolving credit facility. If such
minimum level is not maintained, we are then required to maintain a minimum ratio of (i) earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and rent (EBITDAR) less capital expenditures
paid in cash; cash dividends


and
cash distributions; Federal, state, local and foreign income taxes paid in cash and management fees paid during the period to (ii) Fixed Charge Expense for the period, which consists of
principal payments of debt, cash interest expense and rent expense (as such terms are defined in the secured revolving credit facility).

Our
secured revolving credit facility also contains covenants that, subject to specified exceptions, may restrict or limit our ability to:

•

sell
or dispose of assets, including equity interests;

•

make
loans, advances or guarantees;

•

make
investments;

•

declare
and pay dividends;

•

engage
in transactions with affiliates;

•

incur
additional debt, prepay or modify existing debt;

•

incur
liens;

•

engage
in businesses that are not a related line of business; and

•

merge
with or acquire other companies, liquidate or dissolve.

Upon
the occurrence of an event of default under our secured revolving credit facility, the lenders may cease making loans, terminate the secured revolving credit facility and declare
all amounts outstanding to be immediately due and payable. The secured revolving credit facility specifies a number of events of default (many of which are subject to applicable grace periods),
including, among others, the failure to make timely principal and interest payments or to satisfy the covenants, including the financial covenants described above.

In
addition, we are subject to similar covenants and restrictions in connection with our long-term debt agreements. As of January 29, 2006, we were in compliance with
all financial and non-financial covenants.

During
2005, Standard & Poor's raised our corporate credit rating to BB+ from BB, with a stable outlook. During the year, Moody's also raised our long term corporate credit rating
to Ba3 from B1, with a positive outlook. Our credit ratings of BB+ from Standard & Poor's and Ba3 from Moody's contribute to our ability to successfully access capital markets. Given our
capital structure and our projections for future profitability and cash flow, we believe we could obtain additional financing, if necessary, for refinancing our long-term debt or preferred
stock, or, if opportunities present themselves, future acquisitions.

(2)

We
currently anticipate that future payments required under our license agreements on an aggregate basis will exceed significantly the contractual minimums shown in the table.

(3)

We
have an unfunded supplemental defined benefit plan covering 23 executives under which the participants will receive a predetermined amount during the 10 years following the
attainment of age 65.

Not
included in the above table are severance payments we are obligated to pay Mark Weber, our former Chief Executive Officer, in connection with his departure. Such payments are
expected to aggregate approximately $8.0 million over the next three years.

Not
included in the above table are contingent purchase price payments we are obligated to pay Mr. Calvin Klein through 2017 based on 1.15% of total worldwide net sales of
products bearing any of the

Calvin Klein

brands. Such payments were $25.5 million in 2005.

Not
included in the above table are contributions to our defined benefit qualified pension plans, or payments to employees and retirees in connection with our supplemental pension plan
and postretirement health plan. Contractual cash obligations for these plans can not be determined due to the number of assumptions required to estimate our future benefit obligations, including
return on assets, discount rate and future compensation increases. The liabilities associated with these plans are presented in more detail in Note 8, "Retirement and Benefit Plans," in the
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this report.

Also
not included in the above table are payments of cash dividends on our Series B convertible preferred stock. If we elect not to pay a cash dividend, then the Series B
convertible preferred stock will be treated for purposes of the payment of future dividends and upon conversion, redemption or liquidation as if an in-kind dividend had been paid. We
currently expect to pay the dividends on the Series B convertible preferred stock in cash for the forseeable future. Based on the liquidation preference of $161.9 million as of
January 29, 2006, cash dividends are expected to aggregate $13.2 million in 2006, which is a 53-week fiscal year, and $12.9 million in each 52 week fiscal year thereafter. In
addition, the preferred stockholders can require us to redeem for cash all of the then outstanding shares of Series B convertible preferred stock on or after November 1, 2013. Based on
the


conversion
price of $14.00 per share, we believe the Series B convertible preferred stock will be converted to common stock rather than redeemed.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have a material current effect, or that are reasonably likely to have a material future effect,
on our financial position, changes in financial position, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.

MARKET RISK—INTEREST AND EXCHANGE RATE SENSITIVITY

Financial instruments held by us include cash equivalents and long-term debt. Interest rates on our long-term debt are fixed, therefore a
change in rates would not have an effect on our interest expense. Note 7, "Long-Term Debt," in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this report
outlines the principal amounts, interest rates, fair values and other terms required to evaluate the expected sensitivity of interest rate changes on the fair value of our fixed rate
long-term debt. Cash equivalents held by us are affected by short-term interest rates. Therefore, a change in short-term interest rates would have an impact on our
interest income. Given our balance of cash and cash equivalents as of January 29, 2006, the effect of a 50 basis point change in short-term interest rates on our interest income
would be approximately $1.3 million.

Substantially
all of our sales and expenses are currently denominated in United States dollars. However, certain of our operations and license agreements expose us to fluctuations in
foreign currency exchange rates, primarily the rate of exchange of the United States dollar against the Euro and the Yen. Our principal exposure to changes in exchange rates for the United States
dollar results from our licensing business. Many of our license agreements require the licensee to report sales to us in their local currency but to pay us in United States dollars based on the
exchange rate as of the last day of the contractual selling period. Thus, while we are not exposed to exchange rate gains and losses between the end of the selling period and the date we collect
payment, we are exposed to exchange rates during and up to the last day of the selling period. During times of a strengthening United States dollar, our foreign royalty revenues will be negatively
impacted, and during times of a weakening United States dollar, our foreign royalty revenues will be favorably impacted.

Not
all foreign license agreements expose us to foreign exchange risk. Many of our foreign license agreements specify that contractual minimums be paid in United States dollars. Thus,
for foreign license agreements where the licensee's sales do not exceed contractual minimums, the licensee, not us, assumes the risk of changes in exchange rates.

Also
somewhat mitigating our exposure to changes in the exchange rate for the Euro is our Calvin Klein administrative office in Milan, Italy. During times of a strengthening United
States dollar against the Euro, the United States dollar impact of our Milan expenses will be favorably impacted, and during
times of a weakening United States dollar against the Euro, our Milan expenses will effectively increase.

Due
to the fact that foreign royalties comprise about half of our total royalty revenues which themselves are only 11% of our total revenues, changes in the exchange rate for the United
States dollar have not had a material effect on our financial position or results of operations.

SEASONALITY

Our business generally follows a seasonal pattern. Our dress shirt and sportswear wholesale businesses generate higher levels of sales and income in the first and
third quarters, as the selling of Spring and Fall merchandise to our customers occurs at higher levels as these selling seasons begin. Royalty and other revenues tend to be earned somewhat evenly
throughout the year. The third quarter


has
the highest level of royalty income, due to higher sales by licensees in advance of the holiday selling season.

The
aggregate effect of our seasonality is that our first and third quarters have the highest levels of revenues and income. Revenues in the second and fourth quarters are relatively
equal, but earnings in the fourth quarter are lower as a result of significant holiday marketing costs, as well as post-holiday promotional selling and inventory clearance activity.

ACCOUNTING POLICY CHANGES

In November 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Statement No. 151, "Inventory Costs." FASB Statement No. 151
requires that abnormal amounts of idle facility expense, freight, handling costs, and wasted material (spoilage) be recognized as current period charges. FASB Statement No. 151 is effective for
inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2005. As such, we will adopt the provisions of FASB Statement No. 151 in the first quarter of 2006. We do not expect
this to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.

In
December 2004, the FASB issued Statement No. 123R, "Share-Based Payment," which is a revision of FASB Statement No. 123, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation"
and supersedes APB Opinion No. 25, "Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees" and FASB Statement No. 148, "Accounting for
Stock-Based Compensation—Transition and Disclosure." FASB Statement No. 123R requires all share-based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, to be
recognized in the financial statements based on their fair values. FASB Statement No. 123R is effective for the first annual period beginning after June 15, 2005. As such, we will adopt
the requirements of FASB Statement No. 123R on a prospective basis beginning in the first quarter of 2006. We estimate that adoption of FASB Statement No. 123R in 2006 will decrease our
full year 2006 net income per diluted common share by approximately $0.10 to $0.11, dependent, in part, on the timing and amount of any future stock option grants.

In
October 2005, the FASB issued Staff Position No. FAS 13-1, "Accounting for Rental Costs Incurred During a Construction Period." FASB Staff Position No.
FAS 13-1 requires that rental costs associated with operating leases that are incurred during a construction period be recognized as rental expense and allocated over the lease term
in accordance with the guidance in FASB Statement No. 13, "Accounting for Leases," and FASB Technical Bulletin No. 85-3, "Accounting for Operating Leases with Scheduled Rent
Increases." FASB Staff Position No. FAS 13-1 is effective with reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2005. As such, we will adopt the provisions of FASB staff
position No. FAS 13-1 in the first quarter of 2006. We do not expect this to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.


CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES

Our consolidated financial statements are based on the selection and application of significant accounting policies, which require management to make significant
estimates and assumptions. Our significant accounting policies are outlined in Note 1, "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies," in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
included in Item 8 of this report. We believe that the following are the more critical judgmental areas in the application of our accounting policies that currently affect our financial position and
results of operations:

Sales allowances and returns

—We have arrangements with many of our department and specialty store customers to support their
sales of our products. We establish accruals which, based on a review of the individual customer arrangements and the expected performance of our products in their stores, we believe will be required
to satisfy our sales allowance obligations. We also establish accruals, which are partly based on historical data, that we believe are necessary to provide for inventory returns. It is possible that
the accrual estimates could vary from actual results, which would require adjustment to the allowance and returns accruals.

Inventories—

Inventories related to our wholesale operations, comprised principally of finished goods, are stated at the lower
of cost or market. Inventories related to our retail operations, comprised entirely of finished goods, are valued at the lower of average cost or market using the retail inventory method. Under the
retail inventory method, the valuation of inventories at cost is calculated by applying a cost-to-retail ratio to the retail value inventories. Permanent and point of sale
markdowns, when recorded, reduce both the retail and cost components of inventory on hand so as to maintain the already established cost-to-retail relationship. Based on a
review of current business trends, inventory agings and discontinued merchandise categories, a further adjustment to inventory is recorded to reflect additional markdowns which are estimated to be
necessary to liquidate existing clearance inventories and reduce inventories to the lower of cost or market. We believe that all inventory writedowns required at January 29, 2006 have been
recorded. If market conditions were to change, it is possible that the required level of inventory reserves would need to be adjusted.

Asset impairments

—In each of the last three years, we determined that the long-lived assets in various retail
outlet stores and certain other locations were not recoverable, which resulted in us recording impairment charges. In order to calculate the impairment charges, we estimated the related undiscounted
future cash flows and the fair value of each asset. The undiscounted future cash flows for each asset were estimated using current sales trends and other assumptions. If different assumptions had been
used for future sales trends, the number of assets
resulting in impairment could have been significantly higher or lower. Note 14, "Activity Exit Costs and Asset Impairments," in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in
Item 8 of this report includes a further discussion of the circumstances surrounding the impairments and the assumptions related to the impairment charges.

Allowance for doubtful accounts

—Accounts receivable as shown on our Consolidated Balance Sheets is net of an allowance for
doubtful accounts. An allowance for doubtful accounts is determined through an analysis of the aging of accounts receivable and assessments of collectibility based on historic trends, the financial
position of our customers and an evaluation of economic conditions. Any significant changes to the above factors could impact our financial position and results of operations.

Income taxes

—We have deferred tax assets related to tax loss and credit carryforwards which begin to expire principally in
2010. Realization of these carryforwards is primarily dependent upon the achievement of future taxable income. Based on the expiration dates and projections of future taxable income, we have
determined that realization of certain of these assets relating to state net operating loss carryforwards is not likely. If future conditions require a change in judgment as to realization, it is
possible that material adjustments to these deferred tax assets may be required. Additionally, we are subject to examination of our income tax returns for multiple years by the Internal Revenue
Service


and
other tax authorities. We periodically assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the impact on our deferred taxes and income tax liabilities. Based
on our assessments, we establish reserves for those amounts that we deem will result in future liabilities related to these examinations. If the actual outcomes resulting from these examinations vary
from our expectations, adjustments to the reserves could be required.

Goodwill and other intangible assets

—Goodwill and other indefinitely lived intangible assets are tested for impairment based
on fair value. These tests are performed annually, and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate the carrying amount may be impaired. An impairment loss could
have a material adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations. Performance of the goodwill impairment tests requires significant judgments regarding the allocation of net assets
to the reporting unit level, which is the level at which the impairment tests are required. The determination of whether an impairment exists also depends on, among other factors, the estimated fair
value of the reporting units, which itself depends in part on market conditions.

Medical claims accrual

—We self-insure a significant portion of our employee medical costs. Based on trends and the
number of covered employees, we record estimates of medical claims which have been incurred but not paid. Although our claims experience has not displayed substantial volatility in the past, actual
experience could materially vary from our past trends in the future, which could require an adjustment to the medical claims accrual.

Pension benefits

—Included in the calculations of expense and liability for our pension plans are various assumptions,
including return on assets, discount rate and future compensation increases. Note 8, "Retirement and Benefit Plans," in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of
this report sets forth the significant rate assumptions used in performing certain calculations related to our pension plans. Based on these assumptions, and due in large part to decreases in discount
rates and the poor performance of United States equity markets in recent years, we have significant unrecognized costs for our pension plans. Depending on future asset performance and discount rates,
such costs could be required to be amortized in the future which could have a material effect on future pension expense. We are currently estimating that our 2006 pension expense will be approximately
$5.0 million lower than our 2005 pension expense.

PHILLIPS-VAN HEUSEN CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(Dollar and share amounts in thousands, except per share data)

1.    SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Principles of Consolidation

—The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of
Phillips-Van Heusen Corporation and its subsidiaries (the "Company"). Intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.

Use of Estimates

—The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting
principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from the
estimates.

Fiscal Year

—Fiscal years are designated in the consolidated financial statements and notes by the calendar year in which the
fiscal year commences. Results for 2005, 2004 and 2003 represent the 52 weeks ended January 29, 2006, January 30, 2005 and February 1, 2004, respectively.

Reclassifications—

For comparative purposes, certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current
period's presentation.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

—The Company considers all highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less when
purchased to be cash equivalents.

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

—Goodwill is tested for impairment annually, and between annual tests if an event occurs
or circumstances change that would indicate the carrying amount may be impaired. Impairment testing for goodwill is done at a reporting unit level. Under Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB)
Statement No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets," reporting units are defined as an operating segment or one level below the operating segment, called a component. However, two or more
components of an operating segment shall be aggregated and deemed a single reporting unit if the components have similar economic characteristics. Under these criteria, as of January 29, 2006,
the Company had nine reporting units. The Company's goodwill relates to and is directly assigned to three of its reporting units. An impairment loss would be recognized if the carrying amount of the
reporting unit's net assets exceeds the estimated fair value of the reporting unit and the carrying amount of reporting unit goodwill is determined to exceed the implied fair value of that goodwill.
The estimated fair value of a reporting unit is calculated based on the reporting unit's percentage contribution of earnings to the Company and applied to the estimated fair market value of the
Company.

Indefinitely
lived intangible assets not subject to amortization are tested for impairment annually, and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would
indicate that the carrying amount may be impaired. Intangible assets with a definite life, which are thus subject to amortization, are tested for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate
that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. An impairment loss would be recognized if the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset, which is determined using
the estimated undiscounted cash flows associated with the asset's use.

No
impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets resulted from the Company's required annual impairment tests in 2005, 2004 and 2003.

Asset Impairments

—The Company reviews for and records impairment losses on long-lived assets (excluding goodwill
and other indefinitely lived intangible assets) in accordance with FASB Statement No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets." The Company records

F-6

impairment
losses when events and circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by the related assets are less than the carrying
amounts of those assets.

Inventories—

Inventories related to our wholesale operations, comprised principally of finished goods, are stated at the lower
of cost or market. Inventories related to our retail operations, comprised entirely of finished goods, are valued at the lower of average cost or market using the retail inventory method. Under the
retail inventory method, the valuation of inventories at cost is calculated by applying a cost-to-retail ratio to the retail value inventories.
Permanent and point of sale markdowns, when recorded, reduce both the retail and cost components of inventory on hand so as to maintain the already established cost-to-retail
relationship. Cost for certain apparel inventories of $136,978 (2005) and $128,004 (2004) is determined using the last-in, first-out method (LIFO). Cost for all other
inventories is determined using the first-in, first-out method (FIFO). At January 29, 2006 and January 30, 2005, no LIFO reserve was recorded because LIFO cost
approximated FIFO cost.

Property, Plant and Equipment—

Property, plant and equipment are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is
generally provided over the estimated useful lives of the related assets on a straight-line basis. The range of useful lives is as follows: Buildings and building improvements:
15-40 years; machinery, software and equipment: 2-10 years; furniture and fixtures: 7-10 years. Fixtures located in third party customer
locations ("shops within a store") and their related costs are depreciated over three years. Leasehold improvements are depreciated using the straight-line method over the lesser of the
term of the related lease or the estimated useful life of the asset. In certain circumstances, contractual renewal options are considered when determining the term of the related lease. Major
additions and betterments are capitalized, and repairs and maintenance are charged to operations in the period incurred.

Deferred Rent Obligations and Contributions from Landlords

—The Company accounts for rent expense under
non-cancelable operating leases with scheduled rent increases on a straight-line basis over the lease term. The excess of straight-line rent expense over scheduled
payments is recorded as a deferred liability. In addition, the Company receives build out contributions from landlords primarily as an incentive for the Company to lease retail store space from the
landlords. Such amounts are amortized as a reduction of rent expense over the life of the related lease.

Revenue Recognition

—Sales are recognized upon shipment of products to customers since title passes upon shipment and, in the
case of sales by the Company's outlet stores, when goods are sold to consumers. Allowances for estimated returns and discounts are provided when sales are recorded. Revenue from gift cards is
recognized at the time of redemption. Royalty revenue for licensees whose sales exceed contractual sales minimums, including licensee contributions toward advertising, is recognized when licensed
products are sold by the Company's licensees. For licensees whose sales do not exceed contractual sales minimums, royalty revenue is recognized based on contractual minimums.

Accounts Receivable

—Accounts receivable as shown on the Consolidated Balance Sheets is net of allowances. An allowance for
doubtful accounts is determined through an analysis of the aging of accounts receivable and assessments of collectibility based on historic trends, the financial condition of the Company's customers
and an evaluation of economic conditions. The Company writes off uncollectible trade receivables once collection efforts have been exhausted and third parties confirm the balance is not recoverable.
Costs associated with potential returns of products as well as allowable customer markdowns and operational chargebacks, net of the expected recoveries, are part of the provision for allowances
included in accounts receivable. These provisions result from divisional

F-7

seasonal
negotiations, as well as historic deduction trends net of expected recoveries, and the evaluation of current market conditions.

Cost of Sales and Selling, General and Administrative Expenses

—Costs associated with the production and procurement of product
are included in cost of sales, including inbound freight costs, purchasing and receiving costs, inspection costs, internal transfer costs and other product procurement related charges. All other
expenses, excluding interest and income taxes, are included in selling, general and administrative expenses, including warehousing and distribution expenses, as the predominant expenses associated
therewith are general and administrative in nature, including rent, utilities and payroll.

Sales Incentives

—The Company uses certain sales incentive programs related to the Company's retail operations, such as a
customer loyalty program and the issuance of coupons. The Company's loyalty program is structured such that customers receive gift cards for future use after specified levels of spending are achieved.
Costs associated with the Company's loyalty program are recorded ratably as a cost of sales based on enrolled customers' spending. Costs associated with coupons are recorded as a reduction of revenue
at the time of coupon redemption.

Advertising

—Advertising costs are expensed as incurred and are included in selling, general and administrative expenses. Costs
associated with cooperative advertising programs, under which the Company generally shares the cost of a customer's advertising expenditures, are treated as a reduction of revenue. Advertising
expenses totaled $105,875 (2005), $88,063 (2004) and $64,803 (2003).

Shipping and Handling Fees and Costs

—Shipping and handling fees billed to customers are included in net sales. Internal and
external shipping and handling costs are included in cost of sales. Such costs include inbound freight costs, inspection costs, internal transfer costs and other product procurement related charges.

Income Taxes

—The Company has recorded its provision for income taxes under the asset and liability method in accordance with
FASB Statement No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes." Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on differences between the
financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates that will be in effect at the time such differences are expected to reverse. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a
valuation allowance when, in the opinion of management, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.

Foreign Currency Translations

—The consolidated financial statements of the Company are prepared in United States dollars, as
this is the currency of the primary economic environment in which the Company operates, and the vast majority of its revenue is received and expenses are disbursed in United States dollars. Where the
functional currency of business units is not the United States dollar, balance sheet accounts are translated at the current exchange rate and income statement transactions are translated at the
average exchange rate for the period. Adjustments resulting from translating the financial statements of business units which do not use the United States dollar as their functional currency are
recorded in stockholders' equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss.

Stock-Based Compensation

—The Company accounts for its stock options under the intrinsic value method of Accounting Principles
Board (APB) Opinion No. 25, "Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees," and complies with the disclosure requirements of FASB Statement No. 123, "Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation," as amended by FASB Statement No. 148, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation—Transition and Disclosure." Under APB Opinion No. 25, the Company does not

F-8

recognize
compensation expense because the exercise price of the Company's stock options equals the market price of the underlying stock on the date of grant.

The
following table illustrates the effect on net income and net income (loss) per common share as if the Company had applied the fair value recognition provisions of FASB Statement
No. 123:

New Accounting Standards

—In November 2004, the FASB issued Statement No. 151, "Inventory Costs." FASB Statement
No. 151 requires that abnormal amounts of idle facility expense, freight, handling costs, and wasted material (spoilage) be recognized as current period charges. FASB Statement No. 151
is effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2005. As such, the Company will adopt the provisions of FASB Statement No. 151 in the first quarter
of 2006. The Company does not expect this to have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements.

In
December 2004, the FASB issued Statement No. 123R, "Share-Based Payment," which is a revision of FASB Statement No. 123, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation"
and supersedes APB Opinion No. 25, "Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees" and FASB Statement No. 148, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation—Transition and Disclosure."
FASB Statement No. 123R requires all share-based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, to be recognized in the financial statements based on their fair values. FASB
Statement No. 123R is effective for the first annual period beginning after June 15, 2005. As such, the Company will adopt the requirements of FASB Statement No. 123R on a
prospective basis beginning in the first quarter of 2006. The Company estimates that adoption of FASB Statement No. 123R in 2006 will decrease the
Company's full year 2006 diluted net income per common share by approximately $0.10 to $0.11, dependent, in part, on the timing and amount of any future stock option grants.

In
October 2005, the FASB issued Staff Position No. FAS 13-1, "Accounting for Rental Costs Incurred During a Construction Period." FASB Staff Position No.
FAS 13-1 requires that rental costs associated with operating leases that are incurred during a construction period be recognized as rental expense and allocated over the lease term
in accordance with the guidance in FASB Statement No. 13, "Accounting for Leases," and FASB Technical Bulletin No. 85-3, "Accounting for Operating Leases with Scheduled Rent
Increases." FASB Staff Position No. FAS 13-1 is effective with reporting periods

F-9

beginning
after December 15, 2005. As such, the Company will adopt the provisions of FASB Staff Position No. 13-1 in the first quarter of 2006. The Company does not expect
this to have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements.

2.    ACQUISITION OF ARROW

On December 10, 2004, the Company acquired the

Arrow

brand worldwide and the related licensing business
from affiliates of Cluett American Group, Inc. for $70,539 in cash. The Company incurred additional costs of $194 in 2005 in connection with the acquisition. The transaction consisted of the
acquisition from Cluett American Corp., Consumer Direct Corporation and Cluett Peabody Holding Corp. of all of the outstanding shares of common stock of Cluett Peabody Resources Corporation
("Resources") and Cluett Peabody & Co., Inc. ("CP&Co."). Resources is the worldwide owner of the

Arrow

trademark, principally for apparel,
footwear and related goods, and certain related marks. CP&Co. licenses the

Arrow

marks from Resources and, in turn, licenses them to third parties
throughout the world. Prior to the acquisition the Company had been licensing the

Arrow

marks in the United States from Resources and CP&Co. since
mid-2000 for use on and in connection with men's and boys' dress shirts and sportswear.

3.    ACQUISITION OF CALVIN KLEIN

On February 12, 2003, the Company purchased all of the issued and outstanding stock of Calvin Klein, Inc. and certain affiliated companies. The
Company paid $401,565 in cash, net of $6,435 cash acquired, and issued 2,536 shares of the Company's common stock, valued at $30,000, in connection with the acquisition. The purchase price also
included, in consideration of Mr. Calvin Klein's sale to the Company of all of his rights under a design services letter agreement with Calvin Klein, Inc., a nine-year
warrant in favor of Mr. Klein to purchase 320 shares of the Company's common stock at $28.00 per share, which the Company valued at $637 using the Black-Scholes model,
and contingent purchase price payments for 15 years based on 1.15% of total worldwide net sales of products bearing any of the

Calvin Klein

brands. Such contingent purchase price payments are recorded as additions to goodwill.

Related Products segments.

In
2000, the Company acquired net operating loss carryforwards in connection with the acquisition of certain license agreements and recorded a valuation allowance for such carryforwards.
In 2004, the Company determined that realization of these loss carryforwards was more likely than not, and the valuation allowance of $2,663 was reversed as a reduction of goodwill.

% per annum, which is payable semi-annually. The Company used the net proceeds of the issuance of the 7


/


% senior unsecured notes and
available cash to purchase and redeem its 9


/


% senior subordinated notes due 2008. The total cash paid for purchase and redemption, including a prepayment penalty, was $157,293. The
fair value of the 7


/


% senior unsecured notes on January 29, 2006, based on current

F-12

market
price, was approximately $152,250. In connection with the 7


/


% senior unsecured notes, the Company must maintain, among other things, a certain interest coverage ratio in order
to make restricted payments, as defined in the indenture governing the notes, including cash dividends.

In
connection with the Calvin Klein acquisition, the Company entered into a 10% secured term loan agreement for $125,000 with the holders of the Company's Series B convertible
preferred stock. On May 5, 2003, the Company issued $150,000 of senior unsecured notes due 2013. The net proceeds of the offering after related fees were $144,696. The Company used a portion of
the net proceeds of the issuance to repay the $125,000 10% secured term loan from the holders of the Series B convertible preferred stock, plus accrued interest. The notes accrue interest at
the rate of 8


/


% per annum, which is payable semi-annually. The fair value of these notes on January 29, 2006, based on current market price, was approximately
$157,875. In connection with the 8


/


% senior unsecured notes, the Company must maintain, among other things, a certain interest coverage ratio in order to make restricted payments, as
defined in the indenture governing the notes, including cash dividends.

The
Company issued $100,000 of 7


/


% debentures due 2023 on November 15, 1993 with a yield to maturity of 7.80%. Interest is payable semi-annually. The
fair value of these debentures on January 29, 2006, based on current market price, was approximately $104,375. In connection with the debentures, the Company must maintain a certain level of
stockholders' equity in order to make restricted payments, as defined in the indenture governing the debentures, including cash dividends.

The
Company has a secured revolving credit facility which provides for revolving credit borrowings, as well as the issuance of letters of credit. The Company may, at its option, borrow
and repay amounts up to a maximum of $325,000 under both the revolving credit borrowings and the issuance of letters of credit, with a sublimit of $30,000 for standby letters of credit and with no
sublimit on trade letters of credit. Advances under the Revolving Credit Agreement are also limited to a borrowing base consisting of specified percentages of eligible categories of assets. Borrowing
spreads and letters of credit fees are based on spreads above LIBOR and other available interest rates, with the spreads changing based upon a pricing grid. For example, revolving credit spreads range
from 0 to 25 basis points over prime on prime rate loans, 125 to 225 basis points over LIBOR on LIBOR rate loans and 75 to 150 basis points on outstanding letters of credit. All outstanding borrowings
and letters of credit under this credit facility are due December 15, 2009. As of January 29, 2006, the Company had no borrowings and $156,118 outstanding letters of credit under this
facility.

In
connection with the revolving credit facility, the 7


/


% debentures due 2023 and the Company's obligation to pay contingent purchase price payments to Mr. Calvin
Klein (as further discussed in Note 3, "Acquisition of Calvin Klein"), substantially all of the Company's assets have been pledged as collateral.

Interest
paid was $32,507 (2005), $39,459 (2004) and $32,993 (2003). 2004 interest paid includes a $7,293 prepayment penalty on the early extinguishment of debt.

There
are no scheduled maturities of long-term debt until 2011.

8.     RETIREMENT AND BENEFIT PLANS

The Company has noncontributory defined benefit pension plans covering substantially all United States employees meeting certain age and service requirements. For
those vested (after five years of service), the plans provide monthly benefits upon retirement based on career compensation and years of credited service. It is the Company's policy to fund pension
cost annually in an amount consistent with Federal law and regulations.

F-13

The
Company also has an unfunded supplemental defined benefit pension plan which provides benefits for compensation in excess of Internal Revenue Service earnings limits and requires
lump sum payments to vested employees upon employment termination or retirement, or shortly thereafter.

The
Company and its domestic subsidiaries also provide certain postretirement health care and life insurance benefits. Retirees contribute to the cost of this plan, which is unfunded.
During 2002, the postretirement plan was amended to eliminate benefits for active participants who, as of January 1, 2003, had not attained age 55 and 10 years of service.

On
December 8, 2003, President Bush signed the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 into law. In May 2004, the FASB issued FASB Staff
Position No. FAS 106-2, "Accounting and Disclosure Requirements Related to the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003," which provides guidance on
accounting for the Medicare subsidy to sponsors of retiree health care benefit plans that provide a benefit that is at least actuarially equivalent to Medicare Part D. This guidance is
effective for periods beginning after June 15, 2004. The benefits provided by the Company's postretirement plan are
actuarially equivalent to Medicare Part D. As such, the Company has included the effects of the Medicare subsidy in measuring the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation and the net
periodic postretirement benefit cost for 2005.

The
measurement date used to determine pension and postretirement measurements for the pension plans and postretirement plan for each year is December 31.

Following
is a reconciliation of the changes in the projected benefit obligation (pension plans) and the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation (postretirement plan) for each of
the last two years:

The
pension plan assets are invested with the objective of being able to meet current and future benefit payment needs, while controlling pension expense volatility and future
contributions. Plan assets are diversified among United States equities, international equities, fixed income investments and cash. The strategic target allocation is approximately 55% United States
equities, 15% international equities and 30% fixed income investments. The following table illustrates the percentage of the fair value of total pension plan assets for each major category:

During
2006, the Company expects to make payments of approximately $4,800 from its supplemental pension plan to Mark Weber, the Company's former Chief Executive Officer, in connection
with his departure from the Company in February 2006. Currently, the Company does not expect to make any material contributions to its qualified pension plans and expects to make contributions
of approximately $2,700 to its postretirement plan in 2006. Expected benefit payments associated with the Company's pension plans, and expected benefit payments net of retiree contributions associated
with the Company's postretirement plan, are as follows:

The
health care cost trend rate assumed for 2006 is 9.5% and is assumed to decrease by 0.5% per year through 2015. Thereafter, the rate assumed is 5.0%. If the assumed health care cost
trend rate increased or decreased by 1%, the aggregate effect on the service and interest cost components of the net postretirement benefit cost for 2005 and on the accumulated postretirement benefit
obligation at January 29, 2006 would be as follows:

follows:

To
develop the expected weighted average long-term rate of return on assets assumption, the Company considered the current level of expected returns on risk-free
investments (primarily government bonds), the historical level of the risk premium associated with the other asset classes in which the portfolio is invested and the expectations for future returns of
each asset class. The expected return for each asset class was then weighted based on the target asset allocation to develop the expected long-term rate of return on assets assumption for
the portfolio.

In
addition to the defined benefit pension plans described above, the Company has an unfunded supplemental defined benefit plan covering 23 current and retired executives under which the
participants will receive a predetermined amount during the 10 years following the attainment of age 65, provided that prior to the termination of employment with the Company, the participant
has been in the plan for at least 10 years and has attained age 55. At January 29, 2006 and January 30, 2005, $15,859 and $16,913, respectively, are included in other liabilities
as the accrued cost of this plan.

The
Company has a savings and retirement plan and a supplemental savings plan for the benefit of its eligible employees who elect to participate. The Company matches a portion of
employee contributions to the plans. Matching contributions were $4,388 (2005), $3,706 (2004) and $3,863 (2003).

As
of the end of 2005, the Company has utilized all of its Federal net operating loss carryforwards. Included in the tax loss and credit carryforwards at the end of 2005 are $7,660 of
state net operating loss carryforwards and Federal credit carryforwards of $35,708. Of the Federal amount, $18,527 is alternative minimum tax credits which never expire under the current Internal
Revenue Code. The balance of the Federal credit carryforwards expires principally between 2010 and 2020.

The
Company has a valuation allowance for state net operating loss carryforwards for which the Company believes realization is unlikely. In 2004, the Company determined that net
operating loss carryforwards in certain states would be utilized against 2004 taxable income, resulting in a current state tax benefit of $905, and additional net operating loss carryforwards in those
states would more likely than not be utilized against future taxable income, resulting in a deferred state tax benefit of $2,111. As a result, the total reduction in the state net operating loss
carryforwards valuation allowance in 2004 was $3,016, which reduced income tax expense.

On
October 22, 2004, the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (the "AJCA") was signed by President Bush. The AJCA provides for a special one-time deduction of 85% of
certain foreign earnings that are repatriated (as defined by the AJCA) in either an enterprise's last tax year that began before the enactment date, or the first tax year that begins during the
one-year period beginning on the date of enactment. The repatriation provision did not have any impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements.

10.    SERIES B CONVERTIBLE PREFERRED STOCK

In connection with the Calvin Klein acquisition, the Company issued $250,000 of Series B convertible preferred stock. The Series B convertible
preferred stock has a conversion price of $14.00 per share and a dividend rate of 8% per annum, payable quarterly, in cash. If the Company elects not to pay a cash dividend for any quarter, then the
Series B convertible preferred stock will be treated for purposes of the payment of future dividends and upon conversion, redemption or liquidation as if an in-kind dividend had
been paid.

During
the second quarter of 2005, the holders of the Series B convertible preferred stock voluntarily converted an aggregate of $102,820 of the Series B convertible
preferred stock, or 39% of the liquidation value of the Series B preferred stock prior to conversion, into 7,344 shares of the Company's common stock. In connection with the conversion of the
Series B convertible preferred stock by the preferred stockholders and their subsequent sale of the 7,344 shares of common stock received upon conversion, the Company made an inducement payment
to the preferred stockholders in the amount of $1.75 per share of common stock, or an aggregate of $12,853. The inducement payment was based on the net present value of the dividends that the Company
would have been obligated to pay the preferred stockholders through the earliest date on which it is estimated that the Company would have the right to convert the Series B convertible
preferred stock, net of the present value of the dividends payable over the same period on the shares of common stock into which the Series B convertible preferred stock was convertible. In
addition, the Company incurred certain costs, totaling $1,352, specifically related to the registered common stock offering.

As
of January 29, 2006, the liquidation preference of the shares of Series B convertible preferred stock remaining outstanding was $161,926. Conversion of the remaining
outstanding Series B convertible preferred stock may occur any time at the option of the preferred stockholders. Conversion may occur at the Company's option after February 12, 2007, if
the market value of the Company's common stock equals or exceeds 225% of the conversion price then in effect for 60 consecutive trading days.

F-19

The preferred stockholders can require the Company to redeem for cash all of the then outstanding shares of Series B convertible preferred stock on or
after November 1, 2013. On all matters put to a vote to holders of the Company's common stock, each holder of shares of the Series B convertible preferred stock is entitled to the number
of votes equal to the number of shares of the Company's common stock that would be issued upon conversion of the holders' shares of Series B convertible preferred stock.

Prior
to the conversion of a portion of the Series B convertible preferred stock during the second quarter of 2005, the preferred stockholders had the right to elect separately as
a class three directors and to have one of their directors serve on the audit, compensation, nominating and executive committees of the Company's Board of Directors, subject to applicable law, rule
and regulation; current regulation precludes service on the audit committee. In connection with the conversion, the remaining preferred stockholders agreed to reduce their right to elect directors of
the Company from three directors to two directors and to further reduce this right to one director if they did not have more than one director elected as of December 31, 2005. The remaining
preferred stockholders did not elect an additional director as of December 31, 2005 and, as such, only one such director can be and is currently elected.

11.    STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY

Preferred Stock Rights

—On June 10, 1986, the Company's Board of Directors declared a
distribution of one Right (the "Rights") to purchase Series A Cumulative Participating Preferred Stock, par value $100 per share, for each outstanding share of the Company's common stock. As a
result of subsequent stock splits, each outstanding share of the Company's common stock now carries with it one-fifth (


/


) of one Right.

Under
certain circumstances, each Right will entitle the registered holder to acquire from the Company one one-hundredth (


/


) of a share of said
Series A Preferred Stock at an exercise price of $100 per fractional share. The Rights will be exercisable, except in certain circumstances, commencing ten days following a public announcement
that (i) a person or group has acquired or obtained the right to acquire 20% or more of the Company's common stock, in a transaction not approved by the Company's Board of Directors or
(ii) a person or group has commenced or intends to commence a tender offer for 30% or more of the Company's common stock (the "Distribution Date"). Rights held
by any person or group triggering the exercisability of the Rights and their affiliates become void and unexercisable upon the occurrence of the triggering event.

If
the Company is the surviving corporation in a merger or other business combination then, under certain circumstances, each holder of a Right will have the right to receive upon
exercise the number of shares of the Company's common stock having a market value equal to two times the exercise price of the Right.

In
the event the Company is not the surviving corporation in a merger or other business combination, or more than 50% of the Company's assets or earning power is sold or transferred,
each holder of a Right will have the right to receive upon exercise the number of shares of common stock of the acquiring company having a market value equal to two times the exercise price of the
Right.

At
any time prior to the close of business on the Distribution Date, the Company may redeem the Rights in whole, but not in part, at a price of $0.05 per Right. The rights are currently
scheduled to expire on June 16, 2006.

Stock Option Plans

Service-Based Stock Options

—The Company grants non-qualified and incentive stock options
("ISOs") that are service-based. Options are granted with an exercise price equal to the closing price of the Company's common stock on the date of grant. ISOs and non-qualified options
granted have a ten-year duration. Depending upon which plan options have been granted under, options are cumulatively exercisable in either three installments commencing three years after
the date of grant or in four installments commencing one year after the date of grant.

For
purposes of the disclosure requirements of FASB Statement No. 148, as illustrated in Note 1, "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies," the Company estimated the
fair value of stock options granted at the date of grant using the Black-Scholes model. For purposes of the required disclosures, the estimated fair value of the options is then amortized to expense
on a straight-line basis.

Performance-Based Stock Options—

The Company made grants in 2004 of 1,750 performance-based,
non-qualified stock options to Bruce J. Klatsky, the Company's Chairman and former Chief Executive Officer. The options were granted with an exercise price of $18.75. The options had a
seven-year duration and vesting was partly contingent upon a 20-day average stock price of the Company's common stock. When the Company's 20-day average stock price
reached $22.50, 50% of the options vested. When the Company's 20-day average stock price reached $25.00, 75% of the options vested. When the Company's 20-day average stock
price reached $27.50, 100% of the options vested. If these targets had not been achieved, the options would have fully vested six years after the date of grant. As of January 29, 2006, 100% of
these options had vested and were exercised.

For
purposes of the disclosure requirements of FASB Statement No. 148, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation-Transition and Disclosure," as illustrated in Note 1,
"Summary of Significant Accounting
Policies," the Company estimated the fair value of stock options granted at the date of grant using the Black-Scholes model.

costs associated with closing the store are included in selling, general and administrative expenses of the Retail Apparel and Related Products segment.

Asset Impairments

During 2005, Federated Department Stores, Inc. acquired The May Department Stores Company. In connection with the acquisition, Federated announced its
intention to divest certain of its locations beginning in 2006. The Company has identifiable long-lived assets, consisting of shops within stores (fixtures located in third party customer
locations) in certain of the locations to be divested. This was an impairment indicator which caused the Company to evaluate whether the net book value of these long-lived assets was
recoverable. In the fourth quarter of 2005, the Company determined that the long-lived assets in 46 locations were not recoverable and recorded an impairment of $443. This amount is
included in selling, general and administrative expenses of the Wholesale segment. Since the long-lived assets are related to locations to be divested, there were deemed to be no future
cash flows associated with the long-lived assets in these locations. As such, the impairment recorded was equal to the net book value of the long-lived assets in these
locations.

During
2005 and 2004, the level of profitability in certain of the Company's retail outlet stores was an impairment indicator which caused the Company to evaluate whether the net book
value of the long-lived assets in the stores was recoverable. Based on the evaluations, the Company determined that the long-lived assets were not recoverable and recorded
impairments of $589 and $528 in 2005 and 2004, respectively. These amounts are included in selling, general and administrative expenses of the Retail Apparel and Related Products segment. These
determinations were made by comparing each store's expected undiscounted future cash flows to the carrying amount of the long-lived assets. Since the long-lived assets in each
store were deemed not recoverable, the net book value of the long-lived assets in excess of the fair value was written off. Fair value was estimated based on net present value of the
future cash flows expected from these stores.

During
2003, the Company's retail outlet stores were under significant competitive pressure, which resulted in negative same store sale comparisons and reduced overall profitability.
This condition was an impairment indicator which caused the Company to evaluate its portfolio of stores to determine whether the net book value of the long-lived assets in the stores was
recoverable. Based on this evaluation, during 2003, the Company determined that the long-lived assets in approximately 200 stores were not recoverable and recorded an impairment of $9,017.
Of this amount, $2,623 is included in selling, general and administrative expenses of the Retail Footwear and Related Products segment and $6,394 is included in selling, general and administrative
expenses of the Retail Apparel and Related Products segment, respectively. This determination was made by comparing each store's expected undiscounted future cash flows to the carrying amount of the
long-lived assets, and for each store in which the long-lived assets were not deemed recoverable, the net book value of the long-lived assets in excess of the fair
value was written off. Fair value was estimated based on the Company's past experience in disposing of leasehold improvements of stores which it has closed.

F-24

In 2003, the Company announced the licensing of the

Bass

brand for wholesale distribution of footwear to Brown
Shoe Company, Inc. and the Company's exiting of the wholesale footwear business. This action was an impairment indicator which caused the Company to evaluate whether the net book value of the
long-lived assets relating to the wholesale footwear business, which principally included leasehold improvements in the South Portland, Maine facility and various information systems that
specifically supported the Company's wholesale footwear business, was recoverable. Based on this evaluation, during 2003, the Company determined that the long-lived assets were not
recoverable and recorded an impairment of $3,130. This amount is included in selling, general and administrative expenses of the Wholesale segment. Since the long-lived assets related to
the exiting of the wholesale footwear business, no future cash flows were expected from the impaired assets and the impairment recorded was equal to the net book value of these long-lived
assets.

During
the second quarter of 2005, the holders of the Company's Series B convertible preferred stock completed a voluntary conversion of a portion of such stock into shares of the
Company's common stock. Such shares of common stock were subsequently sold in a registered offering by the holders. In connection with these transactions, the Company made an inducement payment to the
preferred stockholders of $1.75 for each share of common stock sold, or an aggregate of $12,853, and incurred certain costs, totaling $1,352, specifically related to the registered common stock
offering. As set forth in Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Topic D-42, "The Effect on the Calculation of Earnings per Share for the Redemption or Induced Conversion of Preferred Stock,"
when convertible preferred stock is converted pursuant to an inducement offer, the excess of the fair value of consideration

F-25

transferred
in the transaction to the holders of the convertible preferred stock over the fair value of the securities issuable pursuant to the original conversion terms should be subtracted from net
income to arrive at net income available to common stockholders in the calculation of net income per common share. As such, the inducement payment and offering costs paid by the Company in connection
with the conversion and subsequent registered common stock offering resulted in a reduction of net income available to common stockholders for the year ended January 29, 2006.

Potentially
dilutive securities excluded from the calculation of diluted net income (loss) per common share are as follows:




Antidilutive securities


1,081

1,654

In
addition, for 2003, stock options to purchase 695 common shares, which would have been dilutive had net income available to common stockholders been positive, were excluded from the
computation of diluted net loss per common share because 2003 net income available to common stockholders was a loss; the inclusion of such dilutive stock options would have been antidilutive to the
net loss per common share computation.

As
set forth in EITF Topic D-53, "Computation of Earnings per Share for a Period That Includes a Redemption or an Induced Conversion of a Portion of a Class of Preferred
Stock," when a company effects an induced conversion of only a portion of a class of the company's then-outstanding preferred stock, any excess consideration should be attributed to the
converted shares, and the converted shares should be considered separately from the shares that were not converted for purposes of applying the "if-converted" method of calculating diluted
net income per common share from the beginning of the period. As such, for purposes of the Company's computation of diluted net income per common share for 2005, the portion of the Company's
Series B convertible preferred stock that was converted was considered separately from the portion of the Company's Series B convertible preferred stock that was not converted. The
inducement payment and offering costs paid by the Company in connection with the conversion and subsequent registered common stock offering were attributed to the portion of the Company's
Series B convertible preferred stock that was converted. As a result, conversion of the portion of the Company's Series B convertible preferred stock that was converted into 3,347
weighted average common shares outstanding for 2005 was not assumed because the resulting impact on the calculation of diluted net income per common share would have been antidilutive. Additionally,
conversion of the Company's Series B convertible preferred stock into 17,930 shares of common stock for 2003 was not assumed because the resulting impact on the calculation of diluted net
income per common share would have been antidilutive.

16.    NONCASH INVESTING AND FINANCING TRANSACTIONS

Omitted from the Financing Activities section of the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows for 2005 was a decrease in Series B convertible preferred stock
of $102,820, an increase in common stock of $7,302, an increase in additional capital of $94,870 and a decrease in treasury stock of $648 associated with the conversion of a portion of the Company's
Series B convertible preferred stock. Note 10, "Series B Convertible Preferred Stock," includes a further discussion of the conversion of the Company's Series B convertible
preferred stock.

Omitted
from the Investing Activities and Financing Activities sections of the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows for 2003 were certain noncash transactions related to the Calvin Klein
acquisition. As part of the purchase price, the Company issued shares of its common stock, valued at $30,000, to the selling shareholders. In addition, the Company issued a nine-year
warrant to purchase

F-26

the
Company's common stock at an exercise price of $28.00 to Mr. Calvin Klein, valued at $637. Note 3, "Acquisition of Calvin Klein," includes a further discussion of the consideration
paid by the Company in connection with the acquisition.

Omitted
from the Financing Activities section of the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows for 2003 were preferred dividends of $20,027 on the Company's Series B convertible
preferred stock, as the Company elected not to pay a cash dividend in each of the first three quarters of 2003.

17.    SEGMENT DATA

The Company manages its operations through its operating divisions, which are aggregated into four reportable segments: Wholesale, Retail Apparel and Related
Products, Retail Footwear and Related Products and Calvin Klein Licensing.

Trump Signature Collection

to department, mid-tier department and specialty stores. In addition, this segment includes the operations of the Company's

G.H. Bass

wholesale
footwear division, which was exited at the end of 2003.

Retail Apparel and Related Products Segment

—The Company aggregates its

Van
Heusen

,

Izod

,

Geoffrey Beene

and

Calvin
Klein

retail outlet divisions into the Retail Apparel and Related Products segment. This segment derives revenues principally from operating retail stores, primarily in the
outlet channel of distribution, which sell apparel and accessories under the brand names

Van Heusen, IZOD, Geoffrey Beene

and

Calvin Klein.

In addition,
the Company aggregates the results of its Calvin Klein Collection Retail division into the Retail Apparel and Related
Products segment. This division sells

Calvin Klein Collection

branded high-end collection apparel and accessories through the Company's own
full price retail stores, which during 2003, 2004 and 2005 were located in New York City, Dallas and Paris. The stores in Dallas and Paris were closed in the fourth quarter of 2005.

Retail Footwear and Related Products Segment

division derives revenues principally from operating retail stores, primarily in the outlet channel of distribution, which sell footwear, apparel and accessories under the

Bass

brand name.

Calvin Klein Licensing Segment

—The Company aggregates the results of its Calvin Klein licensing and advertising divisions into
the Calvin Klein Licensing segment. This segment derives revenues from licensing and similar arrangements worldwide relating to the use by third parties of the

Calvin Klein
Collection, ck Calvin Klein

and

Calvin Klein

brands for a broad array of products and retail services.

Prior
to 2005, the Company aggregated its divisions into two segments: (i) Calvin Klein Licensing segment and (ii) Apparel and Related Products segment. As a result of the
communication with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission described below, the Company re-evaluated the way it aggregated its operating divisions into its reportable segments under
FASB Statement No. 131. The Apparel and Related Products segment has been disaggregated into the Wholesale, Retail Apparel and Related Products, and Retail Footwear and Related Products
segments described above. Prior year segment data has been reclassified for this change.

In
the first quarter of 2006, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission requested certain information from the Company in connection with an ordinary course review of the Company's
Form 10-K for fiscal 2004. In connection therewith, the SEC questioned the Company's segment

F-27

aggregation.
The Company believes the four reportable segments described above satisfy the requirements of FASB Statement No. 131. As of April 13, 2006, the Company and the SEC are
continuing to discuss the Company's segment reporting. If, as a result of these discussions, it is concluded that further segment disaggregation is appropriate, the Company would report its segments
differently in the future and would file an amendment to this Form 10-K.

19.    SUBSEQUENT EVENTS (UNAUDITED)

On January 31, 2006, Warnaco, Inc. acquired 100% of the shares of the companies that operate the licenses and related wholesale and retail
businesses of

Calvin Klein

jeans and accessories in Europe and Asia and the

Calvin Klein

bridge line of
sportswear and accessories in Europe. The Company is the licensor of the businesses sold and had minority interests in certain of the entities sold. The Company accounted for the investments in these
entities under the cost method and, as such, these investments had a carrying amount of $768 at the time of the sale. The Company received $34,590 in cash proceeds from the sale of these entities, net
of amounts held in escrow and certain associated fees. The cash proceeds are subject to adjustments, including for working capital. The Company's share of the cash proceeds being held in escrow
totaled $5,000 as of January 31, 2006, and represents security for indemnification of certain potential losses incurred by Warnaco. The Company expects that the sale will result in a
pre-tax gain of approximately $31,000, which is net of related fees, amounts held in escrow and the carrying value of the investments. The Company will record the gain in the first quarter
of 2006. The Company will be entitled to receive any amounts remaining in escrow after indemnification payments to Warnaco in installments during 2007 and 2008. The Company will record
the release of any escrow amounts as additional gains if and when such amounts are released to the Company. As part of this transaction, beginning in 2008 and continuing through December 2013,

benefits, $1,000 relates to long-lived asset impairments and $1,000 relates to facility closing and other costs. The majority of these costs will be recorded in the first quarter of 2006.

MANAGEMENT'S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

The management of the Company is responsible for the preparation and integrity of the consolidated financial statements appearing in this Annual Report on
Form 10-K. The consolidated financial statements were prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States and, accordingly, include certain
amounts based on management's best judgments and estimates.

The
management of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) under
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The Company's internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the
preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The Company's internal control over financial reporting
includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the underlying transactions, including the
acquisition and disposition of assets; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that the Company's assets are safeguarded and transactions are executed in accordance with management's authorization
and are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of the Company's consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States; and
(iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the Company's assets that could have a material effect on the
consolidated financial statements.

Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements and even when determined to be effective, can only provide
reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may
become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

The
Audit Committee of the Company's Board of Directors, composed solely of directors who are independent in accordance with New York Stock Exchange listing standards, the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, the Company's Corporate Governance Guidelines and its charter, meets periodically with the Company's independent auditors, the Company's internal auditors and management to
discuss internal control over financial reporting, auditing and financial reporting matters. Both the independent auditors and the Company's internal auditors periodically meet alone with the Audit
Committee and have free access to the Committee.

Management
assessed the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of January 29, 2006. In making this assessment, management used the criteria
set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control—Integrated Framework. Based on management's assessment and those criteria,
management believes that the Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of January 29, 2006.

The
Company's independent auditors, Ernst & Young LLP, a registered public accounting firm, are appointed by the Audit Committee, subject to ratification by the Company's
stockholders. Ernst & Young LLP have audited and reported on the consolidated financial statements of the Company, management's assessment of the effectiveness of the Company's internal control
over financial reporting and the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting. The reports of the independent auditors are contained in this Annual Report on
Form 10-K.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To
the Board of Directors and Stockholders of

Phillips-Van Heusen Corporation

We
have audited management's assessment, included in the accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting, that Phillips-Van Heusen Corporation
maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of January 29, 2006, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee
of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria). Phillips-Van Heusen Corporation's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over
financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on management's assessment and an opinion on
the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We
conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control
over financial reporting, evaluating management's assessment, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing such other procedures as we considered
necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A
company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures
that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide
reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and
(3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the
financial statements.

Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In
our opinion, management's assessment that Phillips-Van Heusen Corporation maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of January 29, 2006, is
fairly stated, in all material respects, based on the COSO criteria. Also, in our opinion, Phillips-Van Heusen Corporation maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control
over financial reporting as of January 29, 2006, based on the COSO criteria.

We
also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of Phillips-Van
Heusen Corporation and subsidiaries as of January 29, 2006 and January 30, 2005, and the related consolidated statements of income, changes in stockholders' equity and cash flows for
each of the three years in the period ended January 29, 2006 and our report dated March 20, 2006 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To
the Board of Directors and Stockholders of

Phillips-Van Heusen Corporation

We
have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Phillips-Van Heusen Corporation and subsidiaries as of January 29, 2006 and January 30, 2005,
and the related consolidated income statements, consolidated statements of changes in stockholders' equity and consolidated statements of cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
January 29, 2006. Our audits also included the financial statement schedule included in Item 15(a)(2). These financial statements and schedule are the responsibility of the Company's
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and schedule based on our audits.

We
conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In
our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Phillips-Van Heusen Corporation
and subsidiaries at January 29, 2006 and January 30, 2005, and the consolidated results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
January 29, 2006 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Also, in our opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to
the basic financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly in all material respects, the information set forth therein.

We
also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the effectiveness of Phillips-Van Heusen
Corporation's internal
control over financial reporting as of January 29, 2006, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations
of the Treadway Commission and our report dated March 20, 2006, expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
