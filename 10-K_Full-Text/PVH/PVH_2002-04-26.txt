PART I

Item 1.  Business

Unless the context otherwise requires, the term "Company" means Phillips-Van Heusen Corporation ("PVH") and its subsidiaries
("Subsidiaries").  The Company's fiscal year is based on the 52-53 week period ending on the Sunday closest to February 1, and is designated by
the calendar year in which the fiscal year commences.  The Company derives market share data information used herein from various industry
sources.


Overview

The Company is a leading marketer of apparel and footwear.  Its roster of brands includes

Van Heusen

â

(dress shirts and sportswear), Bass

â

/

G.H. Bass & Co

.

â

(footwear, apparel and accessories),

Geoffrey Beene

â

(dress shirts and sportswear),

Izod

â

(dress shirts and sportswear),

DKNY

â

(dress shirts),

Arrow

â

(dress shirts and sportswear),

Kenneth Cole New York

â

(dress shirts) and

Reaction by Kenneth Cole

â

(dress shirts).

The Company is brand focused, managing the design, sourcing and manufacturing of substantially all of its products on a brand by brand
basis. The Company's wholesale and retail products include dress, sport and knit shirts, casual and dress casual shoes and, to a lesser extent,
sweaters, furnishings, bottoms, outerwear and leather and canvas accessories.  Approximately 24% of the Company's net sales in fiscal 2001 were
derived from sales of dress shirts, 26% from sales of footwear and related products and 50% from sales of other apparel goods, primarily
branded sportswear.  The Company markets its products at the wholesale level through national and regional department store chains and also
directly to consumers through its own retail stores, generally located in factory outlet retail malls.  The Company also presently markets
Bass/G.H. Bass & Co. brand footwear, selected Izod brand sportswear and Van Heusen brand pilot shirts through the Internet on a limited
basis. The Company believes that marketing through the wholesale channel is where the Company is able to build brand equity and is its core
business, and it views its retail businesses as a complement to its strong branded positions in the wholesale market.  Revenues from the
Company's products occur principally in the United States.

The Company owns the Van Heusen, Bass/G.H. Bass & Co. and Izod brand trademarks. The Geoffrey Beene brand is licensed for dress
shirts, men's sportswear and men's and women's apparel stores under agreements with Geoffrey Beene, Inc.; the Arrow brand is licensed for men's
and boys' dress shirts and sportswear under an agreement with Cluett American Corp.; the DKNY brand is licensed for dress shirts under an
agreement with Donna Karan Studio; and the Kenneth Cole brands are licensed for dress shirts under an agreement with K.C.P.L., Inc.

The Company's principal brands enjoy national recognition.  In the United States, Van Heusen is the best-selling dress shirt brand and
men's woven sport shirt brand, and Geoffrey Beene is the best-selling designer dress shirt brand.  The Company believes that it is the largest
supplier of dress shirts, including its branded, designer and private label offerings, in the United States.  Izod is one of the best-selling
men's sweater brands and one of the best-selling men's basic knit shirts in the United States.  Bass/G.H. Bass & Co. is a leading brand of
men's, women's and children's casual shoes at the moderate price range in the United States. In addition, the Izod Club

â

brand, which the Company owns and licenses to Oxford Industries Inc., is a leading golf apparel brand in pro shops and at resorts.

The Company markets its brands at different price points to various segments of the market, which spreads its appeal to multiple
demographic sectors and a broad spectrum of consumers.  This diversity of the Company's brands is intended to minimize competition among the
brands and minimize reliance on any one sector. The Company's products are designed to appeal to


relatively stable demographic sectors and generally are not reliant on rapidly changing fashion trends.

Consistent with its strategy of developing its brands, the Company has focused on the wholesale sector -- primarily department stores --
as the key source of distribution for its products.  The Company believes that the wholesale channel generally, and department stores
specifically, provide the best means of promoting a fully conceptualized image for each of its brands and of securing broad awareness of its
products and image.

While focused on the wholesale sector, the Company also sells its products directly to consumers in Company-owned stores located
primarily in factory outlet retail malls.  At the end of fiscal 2001, the Company operated 719 stores.  The stores are operated in four brand
formats -- Van Heusen, Bass, Izod and Geoffrey Beene.  Van Heusen and Bass, which appeal to the broader range of consumer, are in the broadest
range of malls.  Izod and Geoffrey Beene stores are located in malls in geographic areas where those brands have greater appeal.  The Company
believes its retail presence is an important complement to its strong branded positions in the wholesale market, facilitating product
experimentation, the gathering of market intelligence and effective inventory control.

The Company was incorporated in the State of Delaware in 1976 as the successor to a business begun in 1881, and, with respect to G.H.
Bass & Co., a business begun in 1876.  The Company's principal executive offices are located at 200 Madison Avenue, New York, New York
10016; its telephone number is (212) 381-3500.

Business

The Company's business is divided into two segments - (i) Apparel and (ii) Footwear and Related Products.  The Apparel segment is
operated in two groups - Dress Shirts and Sportswear.  See "Item 7 - Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations" and "Segment Data" in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in "Item 14 - Exhibits, Financial Statement Schedules
and Reports on Form 8-K" for information regarding the revenues, profits and total assets attributable to these two segments.

Apparel

Dress Shirts

The Company's dress shirts currently are marketed principally under the Van Heusen, Geoffrey Beene, DKNY, Arrow, Izod, Kenneth Cole New
York and Reaction by Kenneth Cole brands.  The Van Heusen and Geoffrey Beene brands are the leaders in men's dress shirts in their respective
categories, with a combined 2001 unit share in the key United States department store sector of 33%. In addition, the Company markets its dress
shirts under the Etienne Aigner

â

and FUBU

â

brands and through private label programs.

Van Heusen brand dress shirts have provided a strong foundation for the Company for most of its history and constitutes the best-selling
dress shirt brand in the United States.  The Van Heusen dress shirt is marketed at wholesale in the moderate price range to department
stores.


The Company began marketing Izod brand dress shirts in the third quarter of 2001.  Like Izod brand sportswear, Izod dress shirts are
marketed in the moderate to upper moderate price range in department stores.  The Company believes that the success of Izod sportswear supports
its presence in the department stores' dress shirt offerings and presents an opportunity for further development.

The Company markets Geoffrey Beene brand men's dress shirts under a license agreement with that designer, which expires in 2003 and
which may be extended, at the Company's option (subject to the satisfaction of certain criteria), through 2013.  Geoffrey Beene dress shirts
are the best-selling designer dress shirts in the United States.  Geoffrey Beene dress shirts are sold in the upper moderate price range to
department and specialty stores.

The Company markets DKNY brand dress shirts under a license agreement that expires in December 2002.  The Company is currently
negotiating the renewal of this license agreement and there can be no assurances that the DKNY license agreement will be renewed.  The failure
to renew the license could adversely affect the Company's revenues.  DKNY brand dress shirts are sold in the better price range to department
and specialty stores.  Arrow brand dress shirts are marketed under a license agreement that expires in 2007 and which may be extended, at the
Company's option, through 2017.  They are sold in the moderate price range to value department and chain stores.  The two Kenneth Cole brands
of dress shirts, Kenneth Cole New York and Kenneth Cole Reaction, are marketed under a license agreement that expires in 2005.  These shirts
are sold in the better price range to department and specialty stores.

Private label programs offer the retailer the ability to create its own line of exclusive merchandise and give the retailer control over
distribution of the product.  These programs present an opportunity for the Company to leverage its strong design and sourcing expertise.  The
Company's customers work with the Company's designers to develop shirts in the styles, sizes and cuts which the customers desire to sell in
their stores with their particular store names or private labels.  Private label programs offer the consumer quality product and offer the
retailer the opportunity to enjoy product exclusivity.  Private label products, however, generally do not have the same level of consumer
recognition as branded products and private label manufacturers do not generally provide retailers with the same breadth of services and in-
store sales and promotional support as branded manufacturers. The Company markets private label dress shirts to major national retail chains
and department stores.

Sportswear

The Company's sportswear products are marketed principally under the Van Heusen, Izod, Geoffrey Beene and Arrow brands.

Van Heusen is the best-selling men's woven sport shirt brand in the United States.  Van Heusen sportswear also includes knit sport
shirts and sweaters.  Like Van Heusen brand dress shirts, Van Heusen brand sport shirts and sweaters are marketed at wholesale in the moderate
price range to department stores.

The product mix targeted for the Company's Van Heusen stores is intended to satisfy the key apparel needs of men from dress furnishings
to sportswear and of women for sportswear.  Van Heusen stores' merchandising strategy is focused

on achieving a classic and/or updated traditional look at principally moderate


price points.  Target customers represent the broadest spectrum of the American consumer.

Izod occupies a major presence in department stores as a main floor lifestyle classification sportswear brand for all seasons.  Izod
brand apparel products consist of active inspired men's sportswear, including sweaters, knitwear, slacks, fleecewear and microfiber jackets.
Izod products are marketed in the moderate to upper moderate price range in department stores.

The Company's Izod stores offer men's and women's active sportswear.  The product assortments cater to an active lifestyle that revolves
around the game of golf.  In addition, the Company's Izod stores market easy care sportswear for travel, resort inspired casual sportswear and
outerwear.  All products are marketed in the moderate to upper moderate price category.

Geoffrey Beene brand men's sportswear is marketed at wholesale under the same license agreement as Geoffrey Beene dress shirts.
Products are marketed in the upper moderate price range in department stores, and include men's sport shirts and knit tops.

The Company's Geoffrey Beene stores offer men's and women's apparel and accessories.  Men's apparel is comprised of dress shirts and
furnishings, as well as casual and dress casual sportswear.  The women's product mix is also a combination of casual and dress casual
sportswear.  The merchandising strategy is focused on an upscale, fashion forward consumer who is prepared to purchase apparel in the upper
moderate price range.  The Company offers Geoffrey Beene products in its stores under a license agreement which expires in December 2002 and is
renewable, at the Company's option (subject to the satisfaction of certain criteria), through 2011.  It is the Company's intention to renew
this license in 2002.  However, there can be no assurances that this will be the case.  The failure to renew the license would adversely affect
the Company's revenues and profits.

Arrow brand sportswear is marketed at wholesale under the same license agreement as Arrow dress shirts.  Products are marketed in the
moderate price range to value department and chain stores.  Arrow brand apparel products that the Company markets consist of men's knit and
woven tops, sweaters and bottoms.

The Company's extensive resources in both product development and sourcing have permitted it to market successfully private label sport
shirts to major national retail chains and department stores.  The Company also markets private label sport shirts to companies in service
industries, including major airlines and food chains.

Footwear and Related Products

The Company markets a broad range of casual and dress casual shoes and related products for men, women and children under the Bass/G.H.
Bass & Co. brand.  The brand has a long history of highly recognizable and innovative products.  Bass/G.H. Bass & Co. is a leading
brand of men's, women's and children's casual shoes in the moderate price range in the United States.


The Company markets its footwear products at wholesale to department stores and specialty shoe stores.  In addition, the Company also
markets Bass/G.H. Bass & Co. footwear internationally to retailers in Europe, Canada, South America, the Middle East, Africa and Asia.

The Company's Bass stores typically carry a modified assortment of Bass/G.H. Bass & Co. footwear from its wholesale line, as well as
styles not available in the wholesale line, in the moderate price range.  The stores also carry apparel and accessories for men and women and
other complementary products.

Competition

The apparel industry is highly competitive due to its fashion orientation, its mixture of large and small producers, the flow of
domestic and imported merchandise and the wide diversity of retailing methods.  Some of the larger brand apparel competitors include Polo/Ralph
Lauren, Tommy Hilfiger, Nautica, Perry Ellis and Chaps.  In addition, the Company faces significant competition from retailers, including its
own wholesale customers, through their private label programs.

The footwear industry is characterized by fragmented competition.  Consequently, retailers and consumers have a wide variety of choices
regarding brands, style and price.  However, over the years, the Bass/G.H. Bass & Co. brand has maintained its important position in the
casual footwear market, while extending the brand's offerings in modern, contemporary casual and dress casual styles.  Few of its competitors
have the overall men's and women's brand recognition of Bass/G.H. Bass & Co.  The Company's primary competitors include Dockers,
Timberland, Rockport and Sperry.

Based on the variety of the apparel and footwear marketed by the Company, the various channels of distribution it has developed, its
logistics and sourcing expertise, and the strength of the Company's brands, the Company believes it is particularly well-positioned to compete
in the apparel and footwear industries.

Merchandise Design and Product Procurement

The Company employs separate teams of designers and merchandisers for each of its brands, creating a structure that focuses on the
brand's special qualities and identity.  These designers and merchandisers consider consumer taste, fashion trends and the economic environment
when creating a product plan for a particular season for their brand.  The Company also employs sourcing specialists who focus on the
manufacturing and sourcing needs of its brands.  In addition, the Company operates a worldwide network of foreign offices and buying agents for
purposes of providing technical support and quality control to those sourcing specialists.

The process from initial design to finished product varies greatly, but generally spans seven to ten months prior to each selling
season.  Apparel and footwear product lines are developed primarily for two major selling seasons, spring and fall.  However, certain Company
product lines require more frequent introductions of new merchandise.  Raw materials and production commitments are generally made two to six
months prior to production and quantities are finalized at that time.  In addition, sales are monitored regularly at both


the retail and wholesale levels and modifications in production can be made both to increase or reduce inventories.

A portion of the Company's dress shirts is manufactured in the Company's domestic apparel manufacturing facility in Alabama.  However,
most of the Company's dress shirts and all of its sportswear are sourced and manufactured to the Company's specifications by independent
manufacturers in the Far East, Middle East, Caribbean and Asia who meet its quality, cost and human rights requirements.  Footwear is sourced
and manufactured to the Company's specifications by independent manufacturers who meet the Company's quality, cost and human rights
requirements, principally located in the Far East, Italy and Brazil.

The Company's foreign offices and buying agents enable the Company to monitor the quality of the goods manufactured by, and the delivery
performance of, its suppliers.  The Company continually seeks additional suppliers throughout the world for its sourcing needs and places its
orders in a manner designed to limit the risk that a disruption of production at any one facility could cause a serious inventory problem.  The
Company has not experienced significant production delays or difficulties in importing goods. The Company's purchases from its suppliers are
effected through individual purchase orders specifying the price and quantity of the items to be produced. No single supplier is critical to
the Company's production needs, and the Company believes that an ample number of alternative suppliers exist should the Company need to secure
additional or replacement production capacity.

The Company purchases raw materials, including fabric, buttons, thread, labels, yarn, piece goods and leather, from domestic and foreign
sources based on quality, pricing and availability (including quotas and duties).  The Company believes it is one of the largest procurers of
shirting fabric worldwide and purchases the majority of its shirting fabric from overseas manufacturers. The Company monitors factors affecting
textile production and imports and remains flexible in order to exploit advantages in obtaining materials from different suppliers and
different geographic regions.  No single supplier of raw materials is critical to the Company's production needs and the Company believes that
an ample number of alternative suppliers exist should the Company need to secure additional or replacement raw materials.

Advertising and Promotion

The Company advertises its brands primarily in national print media, including fashion, entertainment/human interest, business, men's,
women's and sports magazines.  The Company continues its efforts in cooperative advertising, as it believes that brand awareness and in-store
positioning are further supplemented by the Company's continuation of such a program.

With respect to the Company's retail operations, the Company relies upon local outlet mall developers to promote traffic for their
centers.  Outlet center developers employ multiple formats, including signage (highway billboards, off-highway directional signs, on-site
signage and on-site information centers), print advertising (brochures, newspapers and travel magazines), direct marketing (to tour bus
companies and travel agents), radio and television, and special promotions.


Trademarks

The Company has the exclusive worldwide right to use the Van Heusen, G.H. Bass & Co. and Izod names.  In addition, the Company owns
the Izod Club name. The Company has registered or applied for registration of these and numerous other trademarks for use on a variety of items
of apparel and footwear and related products and owns many foreign trademark registrations.  The Company regards its trademarks and other
proprietary rights as valuable assets and believes that they have significant value in the marketing of its products.

Licensing

The Company has multiple and varied licensing agreements under which it licenses the use of its brand names.  The Company licenses the
Van Heusen name for dress shirts and sportswear throughout the world, excluding the United States.  The Company also licenses the use of the
Van Heusen name around the world for various products, including boy's apparel, pants, sleepwear, eyewear, neckwear, belts, hosiery, outerwear,
suits, men's jewelry, small leather goods and 'big and tall' sportswear.  The Company licenses the use of the Izod name for neckwear, tailored
clothing, belts, boy's sportswear and sleepwear, 'big and tall' sportswear, men's and women's hosiery, eyewear, sleepwear, linens and towels in
the United States, and for men's and women's sportswear in Canada and Australia.  The Company licenses the use of the Izod Club name for men's
and women's golf apparel in the United States, Canada and Europe, and the G.H. Bass & Co. name for eyewear in the United States.  In
addition, the Company sublicenses the Arrow name for boyswear.

The Company plans to continue expanding its worldwide marketing efforts, utilizing licensing and other strategic partnerships for all
its brands.  A substantial portion of sales by its domestic licensing partners are made to the Company's largest customers.  While the Company
has significant control over its licensing partners' products and advertising, it relies on its licensing partners for, among other things,
operational and financial controls over their businesses.  Although the Company believes in most circumstances it could replace existing
licensing partners if necessary, its inability to do so for any period of time could adversely affect the Company's revenues both directly from
reduced licensing revenue received and indirectly from reduced sales of the Company's other products.  To the extent the equity and awareness
of each of the Company's brands grows, the Company expects to gain even greater opportunities to build on its licensing efforts.

Tariffs and Import Restrictions

A substantial portion of the Company's products is manufactured by contractors located outside the United States.  These products are
imported and are subject to United States Customs laws, which impose tariffs as well as import quota restrictions for textiles and apparel
established by the United States government. In addition, a portion of the Company's imported products are eligible for certain duty-advantaged
programs commonly known as NAFTA, AGOA, CBTPA and CBI.  While importation of goods from certain countries from which the Company obtains goods
may be subject to embargo by United States Customs authorities if shipments exceed quota limits, the Company closely monitors import quotas and
can, in most cases, shift production to contractors located in countries with available quotas.  The existence of import quotas has, therefore,
not had a material adverse effect on the Company's business. Moreover, with the gradual elimination over the next few years of textile and


apparel quotas resulting from the United State's membership in the World Trade Organization, quota restrictions will no longer affect the
Company's business.

Employees

As of February 3, 2002, the Company employed approximately 5,200 persons on a full-time basis and approximately 3,600 persons on a part-
time basis.  Approximately 4% of the Company's 8,800 employees are represented for the purpose of collective bargaining by four different
unions.  Additional persons, some represented by these four unions, are employed from time to time based upon the Company's manufacturing
schedules and retailing seasonal needs. The Company believes that its relations with its employees are satisfactory.

Item 6.  Selected Financial Data

Selected Financial Data appears under the heading "Ten Year Financial Summary" on pages F-21 and F-22.

Item 7.  Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and

Results of Operations

Reflecting on the past year, one can view 2001 as two distinct time periods.  During the first half of 2001, the Company continued the
growth momentum it carried into the year and further solidified its position in dress shirts, sportswear and footwear.  Sales and earnings
during this period grew 10% and 84%, respectively, with sportswear gaining market share, led by Izod and Van Heusen, and Bass continuing its
strong financial turnaround.

Circumstances changed drastically after the tragic events of September 11 and this, in addition to its personal toll, had a major
negative impact on the Company's business in the second half of the year.  Despite this turn of events, which significantly impacted sales and
earnings versus the Company's initial expectations, the Company ended the year with very clean inventories, positive cash flow of $23 million
and maintained or grew its market share position in dress shirts, sportswear and footwear.

In the fourth quarter of 2001, in response to the changing economic climate and the gradual elimination over the next few years of
import quotas on apparel, the Company recorded a $21.0 million charge which included $15.6 million to make certain staff reductions and exit
three Central American dress shirt manufacturing facilities and $5.4 million to liquidate certain related dress shirt inventories.  The Company
believes that these actions will yield greater efficiency and flexibility in sourcing and, in 2002, will benefit the Company with decreased
expense levels and, beginning in the second half of the year, with lower cost of goods.

In the Apparel segment, despite a very weak dress shirt environment, the Company increased its share of sales in department stores.  The
wholesale sportswear businesses achieved double digit growth in sales as Izod and Van Heusen increased penetration and broadened product
presentation, and Arrow improved its position within Kohl's and Sears.


In the Footwear and Related Products segment, a major highlight was the continuation of the financial turnaround begun in the fourth
quarter of 2000, as significant gross margin improvement was driven by greatly reduced promotional selling.

The Company believes that its strategy of providing a broad spectrum of consumers with nationally recognized branded dress shirts,
sportswear and footwear that embody appropriate fashion at a great value is never more relevant as it is in these uncertain times.  The
Company's products are solidly placed in their respective market segments across broad and diversified channels of distribution.  The Company
believes that it continues to be well-positioned to grow its existing brands as well as to add new brands to its existing infrastructure,
giving it significant opportunity to enhance future financial performance.

Results of Operations

The Company manages and analyzes its operating results by its two vertically integrated business segments:  (i) Apparel and (ii)
Footwear and Related Products.  Of the $21.0 million charge for restructuring and other costs mentioned above, $19.0 million related to the
Apparel segment and $2.0 million to the Footwear and Related Products segment.

Apparel

Net sales of the Apparel segment were $1,061.4 million in 2001 against $1,071.0 million in 2000 and $885.8 million in 1999.  Excluding
the 53

rd

week in 2000, apparel sales were up 1% this year.  Sales in 2001 were impacted by a very weak dress shirt environment
offset by strength in sportswear, especially Izod and Van Heusen.  The increase in 2000 versus 1999 was due to the strong performance of the
Company's then existing sportswear and dress shirt brands and the additional volume associated with the July 2000 acquisition of the Arrow and
Kenneth Cole licenses.

Gross margin was 33.2% in 2001 compared with 32.8% in 2000 and 34.2% in 1999.  The gross margin in 2001 excludes the previously
mentioned $5.4 million charge relating to restructuring and other costs. The gross margin percent increased in 2001 as aggressive inventory
management positioned the Company to manage through the weak sales trends at both wholesale and in its retail stores.  In comparison, the
decrease in gross margin percent in 2000 versus 1999 resulted from a significant shift in the sales mix driven by the more rapid growth in the
Company's wholesale businesses, which carry lower gross margins, than its retail businesses. Selling, general and administrative expenses,
before restructuring and other charges of $13.6 million, was 27.2% as a percentage of sales in 2001 compared with 25.8% in 2000 and 27.9% in
1999. The increase versus 2000 reflects the lack of sales leverage in 2001.

Operating income of the Apparel segment was $64.0 million in 2001 before restructuring and other charges of $19.0 million, or $45.0
million after these charges.  This compares with $74.9 million in 2000 and $55.6 million in 1999. The decline in 2001 reflects, in addition to
the restructuring charge, the impact of the lack of sales growth and the inability to leverage expenses. In 2000, all of the Company's
divisions experienced operating income margin improvements, as the operating income margin of the Apparel segment improved to 7.0% in 2000 from
6.3% in 1999.  The operating income margin before restructuring and other charges declined to 6.0% in 2001.


Footwear and Related Products

Net sales of the Footwear and Related Products segment were $370.5 million in 2001 versus $384.5 million in 2000 and $385.7 million in
1999.  The 2001 sales decline was principally attributable to the second half of the year, as the soft retail environment was exacerbated by
the events of September 11.  Sales in 2000, down for most of that year, had begun to recover in the fourth quarter, which also included an
additional week of sales.

Gross margin continued to be a highlight and reached 42.9% in 2001, up from 39.2% in 2000 and 38.0% in 1999. This represents an almost
500 basis point improvement over this three year period.  In 2001, the improvement was driven by the significantly reduced level of promotional
selling.  The improvement in gross margin in 2000 is directly attributable to the closure of Bass' two manufacturing facilities in 1999, which
enabled the Company to source footwear product more effectively.  In 2001, selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of
sales increased to 37.1% before $2.0 million of restructuring and other charges.  This compares with 34.6% and 33.2% in 2000 and 1999,
respectively.  The increase in all years is driven by the absence of sales growth and the resulting inability to leverage expenses.

Operating income of the Footwear and Related Products segment increased 21% to $21.5 million before restructuring and other charges, or
to $19.5 million after such charges.  Overall operating margins increased to 5.8% in 2001 before restructuring and other charges, compared with
4.6% and 4.8% in 2000 and 1999, respectively.

Corporate Expenses

Corporate expenses were $23.4 million in 2001, $22.2 million in 2000 and $26.0 million in 1999. The decreased expense level in 2000 was
due to the absence of Year 2000 computer conversion costs that were incurred in 1999.

Interest Expense

Net interest expense in 2001 was $24.5 million compared with $22.3 million in 2000 and $22.4 million in 1999.  The increase in 2001
reflects funding the acquisition of the Arrow and Kenneth Cole licenses in mid-2000, as well as the year end acquisition of the Van Heusen
trademark in the parts of the world where the Company did not previously own the trademark.  Interest expense was relatively flat in 2000
versus 1999 as the benefit of the positive cash flow from operations in 2000 offset the use of cash for the acquisition of the net assets
associated with the Arrow and Kenneth Cole licenses at the end of the second quarter.

Income Taxes

The income tax expense rate was 36.0% in 2001 compared with 37.6% in 2000 and 34.8% in 1999.  The tax rate in 2001 reflects tax
saving strategies implemented by the Company at the end of 2000. The increase in 2000 resulted principally from closing Bass' manufacturing
operations in Puerto Rico in the third quarter of 1999, which resulted in a higher percentage of pre-tax income being subject to U.S. tax.  The
full year impact of this closing on the effective tax rate was reflected in 2000 while 1999 had only a partial year effect.


Liquidity and Capital Resources

Cash provided by operating activities was $63.7 million in 2001 compared with $35.4 million in 2000 and $74.0 million in 1999.  The
higher level of cash from operations in 2001 was primarily the result of the Company's aggressive management of working capital, notably
inventory.  The higher level in 1999 came from the liquidation of working capital associated with the Company's exiting of its Gant and Izod
Club businesses.  The Company anticipates cash flow from operations to approximate $50 to $55 million in 2002 as the expected increase in
earnings is planned to be offset by a build in working capital, principally higher receivables related to the anticipated increase in fourth
quarter sales.  The foregoing is a forward-looking statement. Factors that could affect the Company's ability to attain this cash flow forecast
include the failure to attain projected sales levels, to collect receivables as projected, variations in projected inventory levels and
increased costs.

Capital spending in 2001 was $33.4 million compared with $31.9 million in 2000 and $31.3 million in 1999. The Company anticipates
capital spending in 2002 to approximate $32 to $34 million, which it expects to fund from operating cash flow. The foregoing is a forward-
looking statement.  Changes in the Company's plans or projections regarding store refurbishment and logistics infrastructure investment, as
well as a change in cash flow could affect actual capital spending levels.

Total debt as a percentage of total capital was 48.4% at the end of 2001 compared with 48.1% and 50.7% at the end of 2000 and 1999,
respectively.  The Company believes that its ability to generate positive cash flow, combined with its borrowing capacity under its revolving
credit agreement, provides sufficient liquidity for potential investment opportunities that may arise. The foregoing is a forward-looking
statement and may be affected by factors such as changes in cash flow or the size of any acquisition the Company may undertake.  The Company
does not currently have any understanding regarding any acquisition.

The Company's Credit Facility expires in April 2003.  The Company believes it will be able to resyndicate this facility prior to year-
end 2002.  However, given current market conditions, borrowing spreads are likely to be 100 to 150 basis points higher than borrowing spreads
under the existing Credit Facility. The foregoing are forward-looking statements.  The Company's ability to enter into a new credit facility
and the pricing thereof will be affected by factors such as the Company's financial condition and conditions in the lending market.

Market Risk

Financial instruments held by the Company include cash equivalents and long-term debt.  Based on the amount of cash equivalents held by
the Company at February 3, 2002 and the average net amount of cash equivalents which the Company anticipates holding during 2002, it believes
that a change of 100 basis points in interest rates would not have a material effect on the Company's financial position.  The long-term debt
footnote to the Company's consolidated financial statements outlines the principal amounts, interest rates, fair values and other terms
required to evaluate the expected sensitivity of interest rate changes on the fair value of the Company's fixed rate long-term debt.


Seasonality

The Company's business is seasonal, with higher sales and income in the second half of the year, which coincides with the Company's two
peak retail selling seasons: the first running from the start of the back to school and Fall selling seasons beginning in August and continuing
through September, and the second being the Christmas selling season beginning with the weekend following Thanksgiving and continuing through
the week after Christmas.

Also contributing to the strength of the second half is the high volume of Fall shipments to wholesale customers, which are generally
more profitable than Spring shipments. The less profitable Spring selling season at wholesale combines with retail seasonality to make the
first quarter weaker than the other quarters.

Accounting Policies Involving Significant Estimates

The Company's financial statements are based on the selection and application of significant accounting policies, which require
management to make significant estimates and assumptions. The Company believes that the following are among the more critical judgment areas in
the application of its accounting policies that currently affect its financial condition and results of operations:

Sales allowance accrual - The Company has arrangements with many of its department and specialty store customers to support those
customers' sales of the Company's products. The Company establishes accruals which, based on a review of the individual customer arrangements
and the expected performance of the Company's products in those customers' stores, it believes will be required to satisfy its obligations with
its customers. It is possible that the Company's estimates could vary from actual results, which would require the Company to adjust the
allowance accruals.

Inventories - The Company states its inventories at the lower of cost or market. When market conditions indicate that inventories may
need to be sold below cost, the Company writes down its inventories to the estimated net realizable value. The Company believes that all
inventory writedowns required at February 3, 2002 have been recorded. If market conditions were to change, it is possible that the required
level of inventory reserves would need to be adjusted.

Income taxes - As of February 3, 2002, the Company has deferred tax assets totaling $49 million, of which $33 million relates to tax
loss and credit carryforwards which begin to expire principally in 2010. Realization of these carryforwards is primarily dependent upon the
Company's achievement of future taxable income. Based on the extended expiration dates and projections of future taxable income, the Company
has determined that realization of these assets is more likely than not. If future changes to market conditions require the Company to change
its judgment as to realization, it is possible that material adjustments to the deferred tax asset may be required.

Goodwill and other intangible assets - As discussed under the heading "Accounting Pronouncement" in the Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements, in 2002 the Company is adopting FASB Statement No. 142. This statement requires, among other things, that goodwill and other
indefinitely lived intangible assets no longer be amortized, and instead be tested for impairment based on fair value.  An impairment loss
could have a material adverse impact


on the Company's financial condition and results of operations.  Performance of the goodwill impairment tests will require significant
judgments regarding the allocation of net assets to the reporting unit level, which is the level at which the impairment tests are required.
The determination of whether an impairment exists will also depend on, among other factors, the estimated fair value of the reporting units,
which itself will depend in part on market conditions, including the price of the Company's common stock.

Investment in Gant AB - As of February 3, 2002, other noncurrent assets include $13 million as an equity investment in Gant AB, which
owns the Gant trademark. The Company evaluates annually whether the carrying amount of this investment is impaired based on the estimated fair
market value of Gant AB.

Medical claims accrual - The Company self-insures a significant portion of its employee medical costs. Based on trends and number of
covered employees, the Company records estimates of medical claims which have been incurred but not paid. If actual medical claims varied
significantly from these estimates, an adjustment to the medical claims accrual would be required.

Pension benefits - Included in the calculations of expense and liability for the Company's pension plans are various assumptions,
including return on assets, discount rate and future compensation increases. Based on these assumptions, and due in large part to poor
performance of U.S. equity markets in the past two years, the Company has certain unrecognized costs for its pension plans at February 3, 2002.
Depending on future asset performance and discount rates, the Company could be required to amortize these costs in the future which could have
a material effect on future pension expense.

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Principles of Consolidation

- The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries.
Significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.

Use of Estimates

- The preparation of the financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles
requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes.
Actual results could differ from the estimates.

Fiscal Year

- Fiscal years are designated in the financial statements and notes by the calendar year in which the fiscal year
commences.  Results for 2001 represent the 52 weeks ended February 3, 2002.  Results for 2000 represent the 53 weeks ended February 4, 2001.
Results for 1999 represent the 52 weeks ended January 30, 2000.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

- The Company considers all highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less when
purchased to be cash equivalents.

Asset Impairments

- The Company records impairment losses on long-lived assets (including goodwill) when events and circumstances
indicate that the assets might be impaired and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by the related assets are less than the
carrying amounts of those assets.  As explained in the note entitled "Accounting Pronouncement," beginning in 2002 the Company will test
goodwill and other indefinitely lived intangible assets for impairment under the fair value approach prescribed in FASB Statement No. 142,
"Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets".

Inventories -

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market.  Cost for certain apparel inventories of $105,768 (2001) and
$134,331 (2000) is determined using the last-in, first-out method (LIFO).  Cost for footwear and other apparel inventories is determined using
the first-in, first-out method (FIFO).

Property, Plant and Equipment

- Depreciation is computed principally by the straight line method over the estimated useful lives
of the various classes of property.

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

- Included in goodwill and other intangible assets is goodwill of $94,742 and $95,117 in
2001 and 2000, respectively, net of accumulated amortization of $17,316 and $13,942 in 2001 and 2000, respectively.  Goodwill and other
intangible assets are amortized principally using the straight line method over 40 years.  As explained in the note entitled "Accounting
Pronouncement," beginning in 2002 the Company will no longer amortize goodwill and other indefinitely lived intangible assets.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)

Contributions from Landlords

- The Company receives contributions from landlords primarily for opening retail stores which the
Company leases from the landlords.  Such amounts are amortized as a reduction of rent expense over the life of the related lease.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments

- Using discounted cash flow analyses, the Company estimates that the fair value of all
financial instruments approximates their carrying value, except as noted in the note entitled "Long-Term Debt".

Stock-Based Compensation

- The Company accounts for its stock options under the provisions of APB Opinion No. 25, "Accounting for
Stock Issued to Employees," and complies with the disclosure requirements of FASB Statement No. 123, "Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation".

Advertising

- Advertising costs are expensed as incurred and totalled

$33,132 (2001), $34,773 (2000) and $26,922 (1999).

Accounting Pronouncement

In June 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued FASB Statement No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets". FASB
Statement No. 142 changes the accounting for goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives from an amortization method to an
impairment-only approach based on fair value.  The Company is adopting this Statement in 2002.  Amortization of goodwill and other indefinitely
lived intangible assets in 2001 was $3,842, of which $3,374 related to goodwill and $468 related to indefinitely lived intangible assets.  The
Company has not yet completed the transitional impairment tests required under this Statement.

Earnings Per Share

The Company computed its basic and diluted earnings per share by dividing net income by:

Income Taxes

Income taxes consist of:

The current Federal tax provision in 2000 related to estimated alternative minimum tax.

Taxes paid were $1,454 (2001), $8,248 (2000) and $1,135 (1999).

The approximate tax effect of items giving rise to the deferred income tax asset recognized in the Company's balance sheets is as
follows:

A reconciliation of the statutory Federal income tax to the income tax expense is as follows:

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)

Inventories

Inventories are summarized as follows:

Inventories would have been approximately $5,100 higher than reported at February 4, 2001 if the FIFO method of inventory accounting had
been used for all apparel.  At February 3, 2002, no LIFO reserve is recorded because the combination of the liquidation of certain LIFO
inventories resulting from the exiting of Central America manufacturing facilities and reduced overall prices resulted in LIFO cost
approximating FIFO cost.  Partially offsetting the reduction of the LIFO reserve in 2001 is an increase of approximately $3,900 of reserves
recorded for LIFO inventories.

Property, Plant and Equipment

Property, plant and equipment, at cost, are summarized as follows:

Long-Term Debt

Long-term debt is as follows:

F-9

PHILLIPS-VAN HEUSEN CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)

Long-Term Debt (Continued)

The Company issued $100,000 of 7.75% Debentures due 2023 on November 15, 1993 with a yield to maturity of 7.80%.  Interest is payable
semi-annually.  Based on current market conditions, the Company estimates that the fair value of these Debentures on February 3, 2002, using
discounted cash flow analyses, was approximately $80,100.

The Company issued $150,000 of 9.50% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2008 on April 22, 1998 with a yield to maturity of 9.58%.  Interest
is payable semi-annually.  Based on current market conditions, the Company estimates that the fair value of these Notes on February 3, 2002,
using discounted cash flow analyses, was approximately $147,600.  In connection with the Notes, the Company must maintain, among other things,
a certain cash flow coverage ratio in order to make restricted payments, as defined in the note agreement, including cash dividends.

The Company's $325,000 Credit Facility includes a revolving credit facility which allows the Company, at its option, to borrow and repay
amounts up to $325,000.  The Facility also includes a letter of credit facility with a sub-limit of $250,000.  However, the aggregate maximum
amount outstanding under both the revolving credit facility and the letter of credit facility cannot exceed $325,000.  Interest is payable
quarterly at a spread over LIBOR or the prime rate, at the Company's option, with the spread based on the Company's credit rating and certain
financial ratios.  The Facility also provides for payment of a fee on the unutilized portion of the Facility.  All outstanding borrowings and
letters of credit under this Credit Facility are due April 22, 2003.

In connection with the 7.75% Debentures and the $325,000 Credit Facility, substantially all of the Company's assets have been pledged as
collateral.

The amount outstanding under the letter of credit facility as of February 3, 2002 was $134,063.

Interest paid was $24,805 (2001), $23,818 (2000) and $22,647 (1999).

There are no scheduled maturities of long-term debt until 2008.

Stockholders' Equity

Preferred Stock Rights

- On June 10, 1986, the Board of Directors declared a distribution of one Right (the "Rights") to purchase
Series A Cumulative Participating Preferred Stock, par value $100 per share, for each outstanding share of common stock.  As a result of
subsequent stock splits, each outstanding share of common stock now carries with it one-fifth of one Right.

Under certain circumstances, each Right will entitle the registered holder to acquire from the Company one one-hundredth (1/100) of a
share of said Series A Preferred Stock at an exercise price of $100.  The Rights will be exercisable, except in certain circumstances,
commencing ten days following a public announcement that (i) a person or group has acquired or obtained the

F-10

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)

Stockholders' Equity (Continued)

right to acquire 20% or more of the common stock, in a transaction not approved by the Board of Directors or (ii) a person or group has
commenced or intends to commence a tender offer for 30% or more of the common stock (the "Distribution Date").

If the Company is the surviving corporation in a merger or other business combination then, under certain circumstances, each holder of
a Right will have the right to receive upon exercise the number of shares of common stock having a market value equal to two times the exercise
price of the Right.

In the event the Company is not the surviving corporation in a merger or other business combination, or more than 50% of the Company's
assets or earning power is sold or transferred, each holder of a Right will have the right to receive upon exercise the number of shares of
common stock of the acquiring company having a market value equal to two times the exercise price of the Right.

At any time prior to the close of business on the Distribution Date, the Company may redeem the Rights in whole, but not in part, at a
price of $.05 per Right. The rights are currently scheduled to expire on June 16, 2006.

Stock Options

- Under the Company's stock option plans, non-qualified and incentive stock options ("ISOs") may be granted.
Options are granted with an exercise price equal to the closing price of the common stock on the trading date immediately preceding the date of
grant.  ISOs and non-qualified options granted have a ten year duration.  Depending upon which plan options have been granted under, options
are cumulatively exercisable in either three installments commencing three years after the date of grant or in four installments commencing one
year after the date of grant.

Under APB Opinion No. 25, the Company does not recognize compensation expense because the exercise price of the Company's stock options
equals the market price of the underlying stock on the date of grant.  Under FASB Statement No. 123, proforma information regarding net income
and earnings per share is required as if the Company had accounted for its employee stock options under the fair value method of that
Statement.

For purposes of proforma disclosures, the Company estimated the fair value of stock options granted since 1995 at the date of grant
using the Black-Scholes option pricing model, and the estimated fair value of the options is then amortized to expense over the options'
vesting period.

Stockholders' Equity (Continued)

The following summarizes the assumptions used to estimate the fair value of stock options granted in each year and certain proforma
information:

Other data with respect to stock options follows:

Of the outstanding options at February 3, 2002, 1,782,180 shares have an exercise price below $13.06, 2,600,089 shares have an exercise
price from $13.06 to $14.75 and 23,420 shares have an exercise price above $14.75.  The weighted average remaining contractual life for all
options outstanding at February 3, 2002 is 6.8 years.

Of the outstanding options at February 3, 2002 and February 4, 2001, options covering 1,705,585 and 1,150,941 shares were exercisable at
a weighted average price of $12.84 and $13.81, respectively.  Stock options available for grant at February 3, 2002 and February 4, 2001
amounted to 1,686,792 and 2,440,572 shares, respectively.

Leases

The Company leases retail stores, manufacturing facilities, warehouses, office space and equipment.  The leases generally are renewable
and provide for the payment of real estate taxes and certain other occupancy expenses.  Retail store leases generally provide for the payment
of percentage rentals based on store sales and other costs associated with the leased property.

At February 3, 2002, minimum annual rental commitments under non- cancellable operating leases, including leases for new retail stores
which had not begun operating at February 3, 2002, are as follows:

Rent expense is as follows:

Retirement and Benefit Plans

The Company has noncontributory, defined benefit pension plans covering substantially all U.S. employees meeting certain age and service
requirements. For those vested (after five years of service), the plans provide monthly benefits upon retirement based on career compensation
and years of credited service.  It is the Company's policy to fund pension cost annually in an amount consistent with Federal law and
regulations.  The assets of the plans are principally invested in a mix of fixed income and equity investments.

The Company and its domestic subsidiaries also provide certain postretirement health care and life insurance benefits.  Employees become
eligible for these benefits if they reach retirement age while working for the Company.  Retirees contribute to the cost of this plan, which is
unfunded.
