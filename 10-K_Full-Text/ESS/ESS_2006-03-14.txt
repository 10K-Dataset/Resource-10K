      1. Business

OVERVIEW

Essex
      Property Trust, Inc. (“Essex”) is a Maryland corporation that operates as a
      self-administered and self-managed real estate investment trust (“REIT”). Essex
      owns all of its interest in its real properties directly or indirectly through
      Essex Portfolio, L.P. (the “Operating Partnership”). Essex is the sole general
      partner of the Operating Partnership and as of December 31, 2005 owns a 90.4%
      general partnership interest. In this report, the terms “we”, “us” and “our”
refer to Essex Property Trust, it’s Operating Partnership and their
      subsidiaries.

The
      Company has elected to be treated as a real estate investment trust (“REIT”) for
      federal income tax purposes, commencing with the year ended December 31, 1994
      as
      the Company completed an initial public offering on June 13, 1994. In order
      to
      maintain compliance with REIT tax rules, the Company utilizes taxable REIT
      subsidiaries (“TRS”) for various revenue generating or investment activities.
      The TRSs’ are consolidated by the Company.

We
      are
      engaged primarily in the ownership, operation, management, acquisition,
      development and re-development of real estate. Our real estate consists
      primarily of apartment communities. As of December 31, 2005, we owned or held
      an
      interest in 126 apartment communities, aggregating 26,587 units, located
      predominantly along the West Coast (collectively, the “Properties”, and
      individually, a “Property”). Our other properties included three recreational
      vehicle parks (totaling 562 spaces), three office buildings (totaling
      approximately 166,340 square feet), which the company primarily occupies and
      uses as office space, and one manufactured housing community (containing 157
      pads). We currently have three development projects, with 505 units in various
      stages of development (together with the Properties, the
“Portfolio”).

BUSINESS
      OBJECTIVES AND STRATEGIES

The
      following is a discussion of our business objectives and strategies with respect
      to real estate investment and management. One or more of these criteria may
      be
      amended or rescinded from time to time without stockholder vote.

Business
      Objectives

Our
      primary business objectives are to increase shareholders’ value by investing in
      properties located in supply constrained markets, improving operating results
      and the value of our Properties while maintaining a conservative balance sheet.
      We intend to achieve these objectives by:

·

Pursuing
                an occupancy and rent rate growth strategy that capitalizes on the
                desirable locations of our
                properties;

·

Expanding
                our Portfolio through acquisitions, development and, when appropriate,
                re-development of multifamily properties in selected major metropolitan
                areas;

·

Optimizing
                financial performance through a portfolio asset allocation program,
                and to
                increase or decrease investments in a market based on projected changes
                in
                regional economic and local market conditions;
                and

·

Maintaining
                a conservative leverage ratio by identifying and utilizing capital
                resources that provide a lower cost of
                capital.

We
      can
      not assure that we will achieve our business objectives.


Business
      Strategies

Research
      Driven Approach

-

We
      believe that successful real estate investment decisions and portfolio growth
      begin with extensive regional economic research and local market knowledge.
      Utilizing a proprietary research model that we have developed over the last
      years, we continually assess markets where we currently operate, as well as
      markets where we would consider future investment opportunities by evaluating:

·

Markets
                in major metropolitan areas that have regional population in excess
                of one
                million people, thereby creating liquidity, which is an important
                element
                when modifying the geographic concentration of the Company’s portfolio in
                response to changing market
                conditions;

·

Demand
                for housing that is greater than supply driven by: (i) low availability
                of
                developable land sites where competing housing could be built; (ii)
                political growth barriers, such as protected land, urban growth
                boundaries, and potential lengthy and expensive development permit
                processes; and (iii) natural limitations to development, such as
                mountains
                or waterways;

·

Markets
                where rental demand is enhanced by expensive for-sale housing;
                and

·

Housing
                demand that is based on proximity to jobs, high quality of life and
                related commuting factors, as well as potential job
                growth.

Recognizing
      that all real estate markets are cyclical, we regularly evaluate the results
      of
      our regional economic, as well as our local market research and adjust the
      geographic focus of our portfolio accordingly. We seek to increase our portfolio
      allocation in markets projected to have the strongest local economies and to
      decrease such allocations in markets projected to have declining economic
      conditions. Likewise, the Company also seeks to increase its portfolio
      allocation in markets that have attractive property valuations and to decrease
      such allocations in markets that have inflated valuations and low relative
      yields.

Property
      Operations

- We
      manage our Properties by focusing on and marketing strategies that will generate
      above-average rental growth, tenant retention/satisfaction and long-term asset
      appreciation. We intend to achieve this by utilizing the strategies set forth
      below:

·

Property
                Management

-

The
                Chief Operating Officer, Divisional Managers, Regional Managers and
                Area
                Managers are accountable for the performance and maintenance of the
                Properties. They supervise, provide training for the on-site managers,
                manage budgeted expectations against performance, monitor market
                trends
                and prepare operating and capital
                budgets.

·

Business
                Planning and Control -

Comprehensive
                business plans are implemented in conjunction with every investment
                decision. These plans include benchmarks on future financial performance,
                based on collaborative discussions between on-site managers and senior
                management.

·

Development
                and Redevelopment -

We
                focus on acquiring and developing multifamily residential communities
                in
                supply constrained markets, and redeveloping our existing communities
                to
                improve the financial and physical aspects of our
                communities.

CURRENT
      BUSINESS ACTIVITIES

Acquisitions

Acquisitions
      have been a significant growth component of our business. In 2005, we completed,
      in addition to acquisitions by the Essex Apartment Value Fund II (“Fund II”)
      discussed below, a series of acquisitions that added to our overall
      portfolio.

·

On
                February 2, 2005, we acquired Cedar Terrace, a 180-unit apartment
                community located in Bellevue, Washington for approximately $22.3
                million.

·

On
                June 18, 2005, we acquired Mission Hills, a 282-unit apartment community
                located in Oceanside, California for approximately $50.5
                million.

·

On
                September 28, 2005, we acquired Marbella, a 60-unit apartment community
                located in Los Angeles, California for approximately $13.6
                million.

In
      January 2006, we acquired two apartment communities - Chimney Sweep and CBC,
      aggregating 239 units, located in Isla Vista, California for a combined price
      of
      approximately $57.1 million.


Dispositions

As
      part
      of our strategic plan to own quality real estate in supply-constrained markets,
      we continually evaluate our Properties and sell those which no longer meet
      our
      strategic criteria. We may use the capital generated from the dispositions
      to
      invest in higher-return Properties or repay debts. We believe that the sale
      of
      these Properties will not have a material impact on our future results of
      operations or cash flows nor will their sale materially affect our ongoing
      operations. Generally, any impact of earnings dilution resulting from these
      dispositions will be offset by the positive impact of our acquisitions,
      development and redevelopment activities.

·

In
                January 2005, we sold four non-core assets that were acquired in
                conjunction with the merger with John M. Sachs, Inc. in 2002. The
                four
                non-core assets were: Two small office buildings, located in San
                Diego,
                California, aggregating 7,200 square feet, and the Riviera Recreational
                Vehicle Park and the Riviera Manufactured Home Park, both located
                in Las
                Vegas, Nevada, and for which we had previously entered into a master
                lease
                and option agreement with an unrelated
                entity.

·

In
                June 2005, we sold the Eastridge Apartments, located in San Ramon,
                California, for a contract price of approximately $47.5 million.
                Eastridge
                was acquired in 1996 for $19.2 million. In conjunction with the sale,
                $2.2
                million of the gain on the sale was deferred because an affiliate
                of Essex
                originated a participating loan to the buyer in the amount of
                approximately $2.2 million, which allows the Company to financially
                participate in the buyer’s condominium conversion
                plan.

·

In
                January 2006, we sold the Vista Capri East and Casa Tierra Apartment
                Communities for approximately $7.0 million.

Development

Development
      communities are defined as new apartment properties that are being constructed
      or are newly constructed and in a phase of lease-up and have not reached 95%
      physical occupancy (stabilized operations). In the first quarter of 2005, we
      stabilized the second phase of development at San Marcos, which is located
      in
      Richmond, California. Total construction costs for the 120 units were
      approximately $23.9 million.

In
      connection with the properties currently under development, we have entered
      into
      contractual construction-related commitments with unrelated third parties.
      As of
      December 31, 2005, we are committed to approximately $96.6 million in estimated
      development expenditures to complete these projects.

As
      of
      December 31, 2005, we had three development projects in various stages of
      construction and other pre-development costs in our pipeline with combined
      estimated costs of $133.7 million. The following table sets forth information
      regarding the Company’s development communities at December 31, 2005.

(1)
      Includes incurred costs and estimated costs to complete the development
      projects.

Redevelopment

Redevelopment
      is defined as investment on existing Properties with the expectation of
      increased financial returns through property improvement. During redevelopment
      certain apartment units typically are not available for rent and, as a result,
      may have less than stabilized operations. As of December 31, 2005, we had
      ownership interests in six redevelopment communities aggregating 1,450 apartment
      units with estimated redevelopment costs of $36.8 million, of which
      approximately $23.5 million remains to be expended.


The
      following table illustrates those redevelopment projects:

(1)

Includes
                incurred costs and estimated costs to complete these redevelopment
                projects.

Debt
      Transactions

On
      February 1, 2005, we obtained a non-recourse mortgage on a previously
      unencumbered property in the amount of $21.8 million with a 4.94% fixed interest
      rate for a 9-year term, maturing in March 2014, with an option to extend the
      maturity for one year thereafter at a floating rate of 2.4% over one month
      LIBOR. During the extension period, the loan may be paid in full with no
      prepayment penalty.

On
      April
      15, 2005, we obtained two non-recourse mortgage

loans

on
      previously unencumbered properties in the aggregate amount of $32.9 million
      with
      fixed interest rates of 5.44% that mature on May 1, 2014.

On
      May
      19, 2005, we obtained three non-recourse mortgage loans in the aggregate amount
      of $12.9 million, secured by second deeds of trusts, with an average interest
      rate of 5.32% and maturity dates ranging from May 1, 2009 to January 1,
      2013.

On
      July
      14, 2005, we obtained a non-recourse mortgage loan on previously unencumbered
      property in the aggregate amount of $40.3 million with a fixed interest rate
      of
      4.935% for a 10-year term that matures on August 1, 2015.

During
      October and November 2005, the Operating Partnership

raised
      $225 million from the sale of exchangeable senior notes (the “Notes”) with a
      coupon of 3.625% due 2025.

On
      or
      after November 1, 2020, the Notes will be exchangeable at the option of the
      holder into cash and, in certain circumstances at Essex’s option, shares of the
      Company’s common stock at an initial exchange price of $103.25 per share subject
      to certain adjustments. The Notes will also be exchangeable prior to November
      1,
      2020, but only upon the occurrence of certain specified events. On or after
      November 4, 2010, the Operating Partnership may redeem all or a portion of
      the
      Notes at a redemption price equal to the principal amount plus accrued and
      unpaid interest. Note holders may require the Operating Partnership to
      repurchase all or a portion of the Notes at a purchase price equal to the
      principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest (including additional
      interest, if any), on the Notes on November 1, 2010, November 1, 2015 and
      November 1, 2020.

With
      the
      proceeds from the sale of the Notes, the Company repurchased $25 million in
      common stock and paid down $135 million on the outstanding lines of credit.
      In
      part using proceeds from the sale of the Notes, i

n
      the
      fourth quarter of 2005, the Company paid-off ten mortgage notes payable totaling
      $89 million with fixed rates ranging from 6.5% to 7.9%, and the Company
      originated two new mortgage notes payable totaling $35 million with fixed rates
      of 5.5% and 5.6%.

Derivative
      Transactions

To
      hedge
      the cash flows associated with the refinancings of a portion of the debt that
      matures in 2007 and 2008 the Company entered into the following
      contracts:

·

On
                February 16, 2005, a $50.0 million notional forward-starting swap
                with a
                commercial bank at a fixed rate of 4.927%, with a settlement date
                on or
                before October 1, 2007,

·

On
                August 18, 2005, a $50.0 million notional forward-starting swap with
                a
                commercial bank at a fixed rate of 4.869% and a settlement date on
                or
                before October 1, 2008.


We
      believe that these transactions will be effective in offsetting changes in
      future cash flows for forecasted transactions and qualify for hedge accounting.
      The increase in the fair value of these derivatives during 2005 was
      approximately $660,000 and is reflected in accumulated other comprehensive
      income in the Company’s consolidated financial statements.

On
      February 22, 2006, the Company entered into additional notional forward-starting
      swaps. The first was for $25.0 million with a commercial bank at a fixed rate
      of
      5.082% and a settlement date on or before January 1, 2009. The second and third
      swaps are for a total of $100.0 million with two commercial banks at a fixed
      rate of 5.099% and a settlement date on or before January 1, 2011. These
      derivatives will be used to economically hedge the cash flows associated with
      the refinancing of debt that matures in 2008 and 2010, respectively

Equity
      Transactions

The
      Company repurchased $25 million of common stock in conjunction with our
      exchangeable bond offering in the fourth quarter of 2005. The Company also
      granted stock options and certain employees exercised their options pursuant
      to
      the Company’s Stock Incentive Plan.

ESSEX
      APARTMENT VALUE FUNDS

Essex
      and
      several institutional partners formed Essex Apartment Value Fund (“Fund I”) to
      broaden the Company’s capital alternatives. Essex is

a 1%
      general partner and 20.4% limited partner in Fund I. Fund I was in the process
      of liquidation as of December 31, 2005.

Essex
      Apartment Value Fund II (“Fund II”) was formed in 2004, and Essex is a 1%
      general partner and 27.2% limited partner. Fund II is the Company’s investment
      vehicle (subject to certain exceptions) until October 31, 2006, or when Fund
      II’s capital has been invested, whichever occurs first.

                in Irvine, California, for approximately $10.5
                million.

OFFICES
      AND EMPLOYEES

The
      Company is headquartered in Palo Alto, California, and has regional offices
      in
      Woodland Hills, California; Irvine, California; San Diego, California; Bellevue,
      Washington; and Portland, Oregon. As of December 31, 2005, the Company had
      approximately 820 employees.

INSURANCE

The
      Company carries comprehensive liability, fire, extended coverage and rental
      loss
      insurance for each of the Properties. There are, however, certain types of
      extraordinary losses, such as, for example, losses for terrorism or earthquake,
      for which the Company may not have sufficient insurance coverage.


Substantially
      all of the Properties are located in areas that are subject to earthquake
      activity. The Company has obtained earthquake insurance for most the Properties.
      Most of the Properties are included in an earthquake insurance program that
      is
      subject to an aggregate limit of $80.0 million payable upon a covered loss
      in
      excess of a $15.0 million self-insured retention amount and a 5% deductible.
      In
      the future, the Company may selectively exclude properties from being covered
      by
      earthquake insurance based on management's evaluation of the following factors:
      (i) the availability of coverage on terms acceptable to the Company, (ii) the
      location of the property and the amount of seismic activity affecting that
      region, and, (iii) the age of the property and building codes in effect at
      the
      time of construction. Despite earthquake coverage on most of the Company's
      Properties, should a property sustain damage as a result of an earthquake,
      the
      Company may incur losses due to deductibles, co-payments and losses in excess
      of
      applicable insurance, if any.

Although
      the Company may carry insurance for potential losses associated with its
      properties, employees, residents, and compliance with applicable laws, it may
      still incur losses due to uninsured risks, deductibles, co-payments or losses
      in
      excess of applicable insurance coverage.

COMPETITION

There
      are
      numerous housing alternatives that compete with our multifamily properties
      in
      attracting residents. These include other multifamily rental apartments and
      single-family homes that are available for rent in the markets in which the
      properties are located. The properties also compete for residents with new
      and
      existing homes and condominiums that are for sale. If the demand for our
      properties is reduced or if competitors develop and/or acquire competing
      properties on a more cost-effective basis, rental rates and occupancy may drop,
      which may have a material adverse affect on our financial condition and results
      of operations.

We
      face
      competition from other real estate investment trusts, businesses and other
      entities in the acquisition, development and operation of properties. Some
      of
      the competitors are larger and have greater financial resources than we do.
      This
      competition may result in increased costs of properties we acquire and/or
      develop.

WORKING
      CAPITAL

We
      believe that cash flows generated by our operations, existing cash balances,
      availability under existing lines of credit, access to capital markets and
      the
      ability to generate cash gains from the disposition of real estate are
      sufficient to meet all of our reasonably anticipated cash needs during 2006.
      The
      timing, source and amounts of cash flows provided by financing activities and
      used in investing activities are sensitive to changes in interest rates and
      other fluctuations in the capital markets environment, which can affect our
      plans for acquisitions, dispositions, development and redevelopment activities.

ENVIRONMENTAL
      CONSIDERATIONS

See
      the
      discussion under the caption, “

Possible
      environmental liabilities

”
in
      Item
      1A, Risk Factors, for information concerning the potential effect of
      environmental regulations on our operations.

OTHER
      MATTERS

Certain
      Policies of the Company

We
      intend
      to continue to operate in a manner that will not subject us to regulation under
      the Investment Company Act of 1940. The Company has in the past five years
      and
      may in the future (i) issue securities senior to its Common Stock, (ii) fund
      acquisition activities with borrowings under its line of credit and (iii) offer
      shares of Common Stock and/or units of limited partnership interest in the
      Operating Partnership or affiliated partnerships as partial consideration for
      property acquisitions. The Company from time to time acquires partnership
      interests in partnerships and joint ventures, either directly or indirectly
      through subsidiaries of the Company, when such entities' underlying assets
      are
      real estate. In general, the Company does not (i) underwrite securities of
      other
      issuers or (ii) actively trade in loans or other investments.

We
      invest
      primarily in multifamily properties that are located in predominantly coastal
      markets within Southern California, the San Francisco Bay Area, and parts of
      Pacific Northwest. The Company currently intends to continue to invest in
      multifamily properties in such regions. However, these practices may be reviewed
      and modified periodically by the Board of Directors and may change these
      practices without shareholder approval

.


Item
      1A. Risk Factors

Our
      business, operating results, cash flows and financial conditions are subject
      to
      various risks and uncertainties, including, without limitation, those set forth
      below, any one of which could cause our actual results to vary materially from
      recent results or form our anticipated future results.

We
      depend on our key personnel

- Our
      success depends on our ability to attract and retain executive officers, senior
      officers and company managers. There is substantial competition for qualified
      personnel in the real estate industry and the loss of several of our key
      personnel could have an adverse effect on us.

Debt
      financing

- At
      December 31, 2005, we had approximately $1.35 billion of indebtedness (including
      $186.7 million of variable rate indebtedness, of which $152.7 million is subject
      to interest rate protection agreements). We are subject to the risks normally
      associated with debt financing, including the following:

·

cash
                flow may not be sufficient to meet required payments of principal
                and
                interest;

·

inability
                to refinance maturing indebtedness on encumbered properties;

·

the
                terms of any refinancing may not be as favorable as the terms of
                existing
                indebtedness;

·

inability
                to comply with debt covenants could cause an acceleration of the
                maturity
                date; and

·

repaying
                debt before the scheduled maturity date could result in prepayment
                penalties.

Uncertainty
      of our ability to refinance balloon payments

- As of
      December 31, 2005, we had approximately $1.35 billion of mortgage debt,
      exchangeable bonds and line of credit borrowings, most of which are subject
      to
      balloon payments. We do not expect to have sufficient cash flows from operations
      to make all of these balloon payments. These mortgages, bonds and lines of
      credit borrowings have the following scheduled principal and balloon payments:

2006--$26.2
      million;

2007--$82.0
      million;

2008--$155.7
      million;

2009--$34.4
      million;

2010--$159.3
      million;

Thereafter--$872.2
      million.

We
      may
      not be able to refinance such mortgage indebtedness, bonds, or lines of credit.
      The Properties subject to these mortgages could be foreclosed upon or otherwise
      transferred to the lender. This could cause us to lose income and asset value.
      We may be required to refinance the debt at higher interest rates or terms
      of
      such refinancing may not be as favorable as the terms of existing indebtedness.

Debt
      financing on properties may result in insufficient cash
      flow

- Where
      possible, we intend to continue to use leverage to increase the rate of return
      on our investments and to provide for additional investments that we could
      not
      otherwise make. There is a risk that the cash flow from the properties will
      be
      insufficient to meet both debt payment obligations and the distribution
      requirements of the real estate investment trust provisions of the Internal
      Revenue Code. We may obtain additional debt financing in the future, through
      mortgages on some or all of the properties. These mortgages may be recourse,
      non-recourse, or cross-collateralized.

As
      of
      December 31, 2005, Essex had 72 of its 120 consolidated multifamily properties
      encumbered by debt. Of the 72 properties, 53 are secured by deeds of trust
      relating solely to those properties. With respect to the remaining 19
      properties, there are 4 cross-collateralized mortgages secured by 8 properties,
      6 properties, 3 properties and 2 properties, respectively. The holders of this
      indebtedness will have a claim against these properties and, to the extent
      indebtedness is cross-collateralized, lenders may seek to foreclose upon
      properties, which are not the primary collateral for their loan. This may
      accelerate other indebtedness secured by properties. Foreclosure of properties
      would reduce our income and asset value.

Risk
      of rising interest rates

-

Current
      interest rates are at historic lows and could potentially increase rapidly,
      which could result in higher interest expense on our variable rate indebtedness.
      Prolonged interest rate increases could negatively impact our ability to make
      acquisitions and develop properties at economic returns on investment and our
      ability to refinance existing borrowings at acceptable rates.

As
      of December 31, 2005, we had approximately $186.7
      million of long-term variable rate indebtedness bearing interest at floating
      rates tied to the rate of short-term tax-exempt revenue bonds (which mature
      at
      various dates from 2020 through 2034), and $25.0 million of variable rate
      indebtedness under our lines of credit, bearing interest at the Freddie Mac
      Reference Rate plus from 0.55% to 0.59%.


Approximately
      $152.7 million of the long-term indebtedness is subject to interest rate cap
      protection agreements, which may reduce the risks associated with fluctuations
      in interest rates. The remaining $34.0 million of long-term variable rate
      indebtedness was not subject to any interest rate cap protection agreements
      as
      of December 31, 2005. An increase in interest rates may have an adverse effect
      on our net income and results of operations.

Risk
      of losses on interest rate hedging arrangement

-
      Periodically, we have entered into agreements to reduce the risks associated
      with increases in interest rates, and may continue to do so. Although these
      agreements may partially protect against rising interest rates, they also may
      reduce the benefits to us if interest rates decline. If a hedging arrangement
      is
      not indexed to the same rate as the indebtedness that is hedged, we may be
      exposed to losses to the extent that the rate governing the indebtedness and
      the
      rate governing the hedging arrangement change independently of each other.
      Finally, nonperformance by the other party to the hedging arrangement may
      subject us to increased credit risks. In order to minimize counterparty credit
      risk, our policy is to enter into hedging arrangements only with large financial
      institutions.

Bond
      compliance requirements may limit income from certain
      properties

- At
      December 31, 2005, we had approximately $186.7 million of variable rate
      tax-exempt financing relating to the Inglenook Court Apartments, Wandering
      Creek
      Apartments, Treetops Apartments, Huntington Breakers Apartments, Camarillo
      Oaks
      Apartments, Fountain Park, Anchor Village and Parker Ranch Apartments. This
      tax-exempt financing subjects these properties to certain deed restrictions
      and
      restrictive covenants. We expect to engage in tax-exempt financings in the
      future. In addition, the Internal Revenue Code and rules and regulations
      thereunder impose various restrictions, conditions and requirements excluding
      interest on qualified bond obligations from gross income for federal income
      tax
      purposes. The Internal Revenue Code also requires that at least 20% of apartment
      units be made available to residents with gross incomes that do not exceed
      a
      specified percentage, generally 50%, of the median income for the applicable
      family size as determined by the Housing and Urban Development Department of
      the
      federal government. In addition to federal requirements, certain state and
      local
      authorities may impose additional rental restrictions. These restrictions may
      limit income from the tax-exempt financed properties if we are required to
      lower
      rental rates to attract residents who satisfy the median income test. If Essex
      does not reserve the required number of apartment homes for residents satisfying
      these income requirements, the tax-exempt status of the bonds may be terminated,
      the obligations under the bond documents may be accelerated and we may be
      subject to additional contractual liability.

Adverse
      effect to property income and value due to general real estate investment risks
      -

Real
      property investments are subject to a variety of risks. The yields available
      from equity investments in real estate depend on the amount of income generated
      and expenses incurred. If the properties do not generate sufficient income
      to
      meet operating expenses, including debt service and capital expenditures, cash
      flow and the ability to make distributions to stockholders will be adversely
      affected. The performance of the economy in each of the areas in which the
      properties are located affects occupancy, market rental rates and expenses.
      Consequently, the income from the properties and their underlying values may
      be
      impacted. The financial results of major local employers may have an impact
      on
      the cash flow and value of certain of the properties as well.

Income
      from the properties may be further adversely affected by, among other things,
      the following factors:

·

the
                general economic climate;

·

local
                economic conditions in which the properties are located, such as
                oversupply of housing or a reduction in demand for rental housing;

·

the
                attractiveness of the properties to tenants;

·

competition
                from other available space; and

·

Essex’s
                ability to provide for adequate maintenance and
                insurance.

As
      leases
      on the properties expire, tenants may enter into new leases on terms that are
      less favorable to us. Income and real estate values also may be adversely
      affected by such factors as applicable laws (e.g., the Americans With
      Disabilities Act of 1990 and tax laws), interest rate levels and the
      availability and terms of financing. Real estate investments are relatively
      illiquid and, therefore, our ability to vary our portfolio promptly in response
      to changes in economic or other conditions may be quite limited.

Economic
      environment and impact on operating results

- The
      national economy and the economies of the western states in markets where we
      operate can impact our operating results. Some of these markets are concentrated
      in high-tech sectors, which have experienced economic downturns, and could
      again
      in the future. Our property type and diverse geographic locations provide some
      degree of risk mitigation. However, we are not immune to prolonged economic
      downturns. Although we believe we are well positioned to meet these challenges,
      it is possible a reduction in rental rates, occupancy levels, property
      valuations and increases in operating costs such as advertising, turnover and
      repair and maintenance expense could occur in the event of economic
      uncertainty.


Risk
      of Inflation/Deflation

-
      Substantial inflationary or deflationary pressures could have a negative effect
      on rental rates and property operating expenses.

Risks
      that acquisitions will fail to meet expectations

- We
      intend to continue to acquire multifamily residential properties. However,
      there
      are risks that acquisitions will fail to meet our expectations. Our estimates
      of
      future income, expenses and the costs of improvements or redevelopment that
      are
      necessary to allow us to market an acquired property as originally intended
      may
      prove to be inaccurate. We expect to finance future acquisitions, in whole
      or in
      part, under various forms of secured or unsecured financing or through the
      issuance of partnership units by the Operating Partnership or related
      partnerships or additional equity by Essex. The use of equity financing, rather
      than debt, for future developments or acquisitions could dilute the interest
      of
      Essex’s existing stockholders. If we finance new acquisitions under existing
      lines of credit, there is a risk that, unless we obtain substitute financing,
      Essex may not be able to secure further lines of credit for new development
      or
      such lines of credit may be not available on advantageous terms.

Risks
      that development activities will be delayed, not completed, and/or not achieve
      expected results

- These
      risks may reduce the funds available for distribution to Essex’s stockholders.
      Further, the development of properties is also subject to the general risks
      associated with real estate investments. For further information regarding
      these
      risks, please see “Adverse Effect to Property Income and Value Due to General
      Real Estate Investment Risks.”

We
      pursue
      multifamily residential property development projects and these projects
      generally require various governmental and other approvals, which have no
      assurance of being received. Our development activities generally entail certain
      risks, including the following:

·

funds
                may be expended and management's time devoted to projects that may
                not be
                completed;

·

construction
                costs of a project may exceed original estimates, possibly making
                the
                project economically unfeasible;

·

development
                projects may be delayed due to, without limitation, adverse weather
                conditions, labor shortages, or unforeseen complications;

·

occupancy
                rates and rents at a completed project may be less than anticipated;
                and

·

costs
                at a completed development may be higher than anticipated.

The
      geographic concentration of our Properties and fluctuations in local markets
      may
      adversely impact our financial condition and operating
      results

- We
      generated significant amounts of rental revenues for the year ended December
      31,
      2005 from properties concentrated in Southern California (Los Angeles, Ventura,
      Orange, San Diego and Riverside counties), Northern California (the San
      Francisco Bay Area), and the Pacific Northwest (the Seattle, Washington and
      Portland, Oregon metropolitan areas). As of December 31, 2005, more than half
      (73%) of our Properties were located in California. This geographic
      concentration could present risks if local property market performance falls
      below expectations. The economic condition of these markets could affect
      occupancy, market rental rates, and expenses, as well as impact the income
      generated from the Properties and their underlying asset values. The financial
      results of major local employers also may impact the cash flow and value of
      certain of the Properties. This could have a negative impact on our financial
      condition and operating results, which could affect our ability to pay expected
      dividends to our stockholders.

Competition
      in the multifamily residential market may adversely affect operations and the
      rental demand for our Properties

- There
      are numerous housing alternatives that compete with our multifamily properties
      in attracting residents. These include other multifamily rental apartments
      and
      single-family homes that are available for rent in the markets in which the
      Properties are located. The Properties also compete for residents with new
      and
      existing homes and condominiums that are for sale. If the demand for our
      Properties is reduced or if competitors develop and/or acquire competing
      properties on a more cost-effective basis, rental rates may drop, which may
      have
      a material adverse affect on our financial condition and results of operations.

We
      also
      face competition from other real estate investment trusts, businesses and other
      entities in the acquisition, development and operation of properties. Some
      of
      the competitors are larger and have greater financial resources than we do.
      This
      competition may result in increased costs of properties we acquire and/or
      develop.

Dividend
      requirements as a result of preferred stock may lead to a possible inability
      to
      sustain dividends

- The
      Company has approximately $25 million of Series F Cumulative Redeemable
      Preferred Stock (“Series F Preferred Stock”) outstanding. The Series B Preferred
      Units, the Series D Preferred Units, and the Series F Preferred Stock are
      collectively referred to as the “Preferred Equity”. The terms of the Series F
      Preferred Stock and of the preferred stock into which each series of Preferred
      Units are exchangeable provide for certain cumulative preferential cash
      distributions per each share of preferred stock.


These
      terms also provide that while such preferred stock is outstanding, Essex cannot
      authorize, declare, or pay any distributions on the Common Stock, unless all
      distributions accumulated on all shares of such preferred stock have been paid
      in full. The distributions payable on such preferred stock may impair Essex’s
      ability to pay dividends on its Common Stock.

If
      Essex
      wishes to issue any Common Stock in the future (including, upon exercise of
      stock options), the funds required to continue to pay cash dividends at current
      levels will be increased. Essex’s ability to pay dividends will depend largely
      upon the performance of the Properties and other properties that may be acquired
      or developed in the future.

If
      Essex
      cannot pay dividends on its stock, Essex’s status as a real estate investment
      trust may be jeopardized. Our ability to pay dividends on our common stock
      is
      further limited by the Maryland General Corporation Law. Under the Maryland
      General Corporation Law, Essex may not make a distribution on stock if, after
      giving effect to such distribution, either:

·

we
                would not be able to pay our indebtedness as it becomes due in the
                usual
                course of business; or

·

our
                total assets would be less than our total liabilities.

Resale
      of shares pursuant to our effective registration statement may have an adverse
      effect on the market price of the shares

-
      Pursuant to the acquisition of John M. Sachs, Inc., a real estate company,
      in
      December 2002, we issued 2,719,875 shares of common stock, as partial
      consideration for the acquisition, to the trusts that were the shareholders
      of
      that company. In connection with the acquisition, Essex entered into a
      registration rights agreement with these trusts, pursuant to which in January
      2003 we filed a registration statement on Form S-3 in order to enable the resale
      of these shares of common stock. In an amendment to this registration statement
      filed in April 2003, we also registered, pursuant to certain registration
      rights, 50,000 shares of common stock which are issuable to the trusts in
      connection with certain contractual obligations and 2,270,490 shares of common
      stock which are issuable upon exchange of limited partnership interests in
      the
      Operating Partnership. These limited partnership interests are held by senior
      members of our management, certain members of our Board of Directors and certain
      outside investors, or the Operating Partnership holders, and comprise
      approximately 9.6% of the limited partnership interests of the Operating
      Partnership as of December 31, 2005. In the 2003 registration statement, we
      registered, pursuant to certain registration rights, 1,473,125 shares of common
      stock, which are issuable upon redemption of all of the limited partnership
      interests in such real estate partnerships. In total, this 2003 registration
      statement covers in aggregate 6,513,490 shares of our common stock. In January
      2006, we filed registration statements that cover (1) the resale of up to
      142,076 shares issuable in connection with our Waterford and Vista Belvedere
      acquisitions and (2) the resale of shares issuable in connection with the
      exchange rights of our 3.625% Senior Exchangeable Notes, as to which there
      is a
      principal amount of $225 million outstanding. The resale of the shares of common
      stock pursuant to these various registration statements may have an adverse
      effect on the market price of our shares.

The
      exchange and repurchase rights of Exchangeable Senior Notes may be detrimental
      to holders of common stock -

The
      Operating Partnership has $225 million principal amount of 3.625% Exchangeable
      Senior Notes (the “Notes”) outstanding which mature on November 1, 2025. The
      Notes are exchangeable into the Company's common shares on or after November
      1,
      2020 or prior to November 1, 2020 under certain circumstances. The Notes are
      redeemable at the Company's option for cash at any time on or after November
      4,
      2010 and are subject to repurchase for cash at the option of the holder on
      November 1

st

in the
      years 2010, 2015 and 2020, or upon the occurrence of certain events. The Notes
      are senior unsecured and unsubordinated obligations of the Company. The exchange
      of Notes for common stock would dilute stockholder ownership in the Company,
      and
      could adversely affect the market price of our common stock and could impair
      our
      ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity securities.
      If
      the Notes are not exchanged, the repurchase rights of holder of the Notes may
      discourage or impede transactions that might otherwise be in the interest of
      holders of common stock. Further, these repurchase rights might be triggered
      in
      situations where Essex needs to conserve its cash reserves, in which event
      such
      repurchase might adversely affect Essex and its common holders.

Our
      Chairman is involved in other real estate activities and investments, which
      may
      lead to conflicts of interest -

Our
      Chairman, George M. Marcus is not an employee of Essex, and is involved in
      other
      real estate activities and investments, which may lead to conflicts of interest.
      Mr. Marcus owns interests in various other real estate-related businesses and
      investments. He is the Chairman of The Marcus & Millichap Company, or
“TMMC”, which is a holding company for certain real estate brokerage and
      services companies. TMMC has an interest in Pacific Property Company, a company
      that invests in West Coast multifamily residential properties. In 1999 we sold
      an office building to TMMC, which Essex previously occupied as its corporate
      headquarters.

Mr.
      Marcus has agreed not to divulge any information that may be received by him
      in
      his capacity as Chairman of Essex to any of his affiliated companies and that
      he
      will abstain his vote on any and all resolutions by the Essex Board of Directors
      regarding any proposed acquisition and/or development of a multifamily property
      where it appears that there may be a conflict of interest with any of his
      affiliated companies.


Notwithstanding
      this agreement, Mr. Marcus and his affiliated entities may potentially compete
      with us in acquiring and/or developing multifamily properties, which competition
      may be detrimental to us. In addition, due to such potential competition for
      real estate investments, Mr. Marcus and his affiliated entities may have a
      conflict of interest with us, which may be detrimental to the interests of
      Essex’s stockholders.

The
      influence of executive officers, directors and significant stockholders may
      be
      detrimental to holders of common stock

- As of
      December 31, 2005, George M. Marcus, the Chairman of our Board of Directors,
      wholly or partially owned 1,752,111 shares of common stock (including shares
      issuable upon exchange of limited partnership interests in the Operating
      Partnership and certain other partnerships and assuming exercise of all vested
      options). This represents approximately 7.6% of the outstanding shares of our
      common stock. Mr. Marcus currently does not have majority control over us.
      However, he currently has, and likely will continue to have, significant
      influence with respect to the election of directors and approval or disapproval
      of significant corporate actions. Consequently, his influence could result
      in
      decisions that do not reflect the interests of all our stockholders.

Under
      the
      partnership agreement of the Operating Partnership, the consent of the holders
      of limited partnership interests is generally required for any amendment of
      the
      agreement and for certain extraordinary actions. Through their ownership of
      limited partnership interests and their positions with us, our directors and
      executive officers, including Mr. Marcus and Mr. William A. Millichap, a
      director of Essex, have substantial influence on us. Consequently, their
      influence could result in decisions that do not reflect the interests of all
      stockholders.

The
      voting rights of preferred stock may allow holders of preferred stock to impede
      actions that otherwise benefit holders of common stock

- In
      general, the holders of Series F Preferred stock and of the preferred stock
      into
      which our preferred units are exchangeable do not have any voting rights.
      However, if full distributions are not made on any outstanding preferred stock
      for six quarterly distributions periods, the holders of preferred stock who
      have
      not received distributions, voting together as a single class, will have the
      right to elect two additional directors to serve on Essex’s Board of Directors.
      These voting rights continue until all distributions in arrears and
      distributions for the current quarterly period on the preferred stock have
      been
      paid in full. At that time, the holders of the preferred stock are divested
      of
      these voting rights, and the term and office of the directors so elected
      immediately terminates.

These
      voting rights of the preferred stock may allow holders of preferred stock to
      impede or veto actions that would otherwise benefit the holders of Essex’s
      Common Stock. While any shares of Series F Preferred Stock or shares of
      preferred stock into which the preferred units are exchangeable are outstanding,
      Essex may not, without the consent of the holders of two-thirds of the
      outstanding shares of each series of preferred stock, each voting separately
      as
      a single class;

·

authorize
                or create any class of series of stock that ranks senior to such
                preferred
                stock with respect to the payment of dividends, rights upon liquidation,
                dissolution or winding-up of our business;

·

amend,
                alter or repeal the provisions of Essex’s Charter or Bylaws, that would
                materially and adversely affect the rights of such preferred stock;
                or

·

in
                the case of the preferred stock into which our preferred units are
                exchangeable, merge or consolidate with another entity or transfer
                substantially all of its assets to another entity, except if such
                preferred stock remains outstanding with the surviving entity and
                has the
                same terms and in certain other circumstances.

The
      redemption rights of the Series B preferred units, Series D preferred units
      and
      Series F preferred stock may be detrimental to holders of Essex common
      stock

- Upon
      the occurrence of one of the following events, the terms of the Operating
      Partnership’s Series B and D Preferred Units require it to redeem all of such
      units and the terms of Essex’s Series F Preferred Stock provide the holders of
      the majority of the outstanding Series F Preferred Stock the right to require
      Essex to redeem all of such stock:

·

Essex
                completes a “going private” transaction and its common stock is no longer
                registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
                amended;

·

Essex
                completes a consolidation or merger or sale of substantially all
                of its
                assets and the surviving entity’s debt securities do not possess an
                investment grade rating; or

·

Essex
                fails to qualify as a REIT.

The
      aggregate redemption price of the Series B Preferred Units would be $80 million,
      the aggregate redemption price of the Series D Preferred Units would be $50
      million and the aggregate redemption price of the Series F Preferred Stock
      would
      be $25 million, plus, in each case, any accumulated distributions.


These
      redemption rights may discourage or impede transactions that might otherwise
      be
      in the interest of holders of common stock. Further, these redemption rights
      might trigger situations where Essex needs to conserve its cash reserves, in
      which event such redemption might adversely affect Essex and its common
      holders.

Maryland
      business combination law may not allow certain transactions between Essex and
      its affiliates to proceed without compliance with such
      law

- The
      Maryland General Corporation Law establishes special requirements for “business
      combinations” between a Maryland corporation and “interested stockholders”
unless exemptions are applicable. An interested stockholder is any person who
      beneficially owns ten percent or more of the voting power of the
      then-outstanding voting stock.

The
      law
      also requires a supermajority stockholder vote for such transactions. This
      means
      that the transaction must be approved by at least:

·

80%
                of the votes entitled to be cast by holders of outstanding voting
                shares;
                and

·

66%
                of the votes entitled to be cast by holders of outstanding voting
                shares
                other than shares held by the interested stockholder with whom the
                business combination is to be effected.

However,
      as permitted by the statute, the Board of Directors of Essex irrevocably has
      elected to exempt any business combination by us, George M. Marcus, William
      A.
      Millichap, who are the chairman and a director of Essex, respectively, and
      TMMC
      or any entity owned or controlled by Messrs. Marcus and Millichap and TMMC.
      Consequently, the super-majority vote requirement described above will not
      apply
      to any business combination between us and Mr. Marcus, Mr. Millichap, or TMMC.
      As a result, we may in the future enter into business combinations with Messrs.
      Marcus and Millichap and TMMC, without compliance with the super-majority vote
      requirements and other provisions of the Maryland General Corporation Law.

Anti-takeover
      provisions contained in the Operating Partnership agreement, charter, bylaws,
      and certain provisions of Maryland law could delay, defer or prevent a change
      in
      control

- While
      Essex is the sole general partner of the Operating Partnership, and generally
      has full and exclusive responsibility and discretion in the management and
      control of the Operating Partnership, certain provisions of the Operating
      Partnership agreement place limitations on Essex’s ability to act with respect
      to the Operating Partnership. Such limitations could delay, defer or prevent
      a
      transaction or a change in control that might involve a premium price for our
      stock or otherwise be in the best interest of the stockholders or that could
      otherwise adversely affect the interest of Essex’s stockholders. The partnership
      agreement provides that if the limited partners own at least 5% of the
      outstanding units of limited partnership interest in the Operating Partnership,
      Essex cannot, without first obtaining the consent of a majority-in-interest
      of
      the limited partners in the Operating Partnership, transfer all or any portion
      of our general partner interest in the Operating Partnership to another entity.
      Such limitations on Essex’s ability to act may result in our being precluded
      from taking action that the Board of Directors believes is in the best interests
      of Essex’s stockholders. As of December 31, 2005, George M. Marcus held or
      controlled more than 50% of the outstanding units of limited partnership
      interest in the Operating Partnership, allowing such actions to be blocked
      the
      limited partner.

Essex’s
      Charter authorizes the issuance of additional shares of common stock or
      preferred stock and the setting of the preferences, rights and other terms
      of
      such preferred stock without the approval of the holders of the common stock.
      We
      may establish one or more series of preferred stock that could delay, defer
      or
      prevent a transaction or a change in control. Such a transaction might involve
      a
      premium price for our stock or otherwise be in the best interests of the holders
      of common stock. Also, such a class of preferred stock could have dividend,
      voting or other rights that could adversely affect the interest of holders
      of
      common stock.

Essex’s
      Charter, as well as Essex’s stockholder rights plan, contains other provisions
      that may delay, defer or prevent a transaction or a change in control that
      might
      be in the best interest of Essex’s stockholders. Essex’s stockholder rights plan
      is designed, among other things, to prevent a person or group from gaining
      control of us without offering a fair price to all of Essex’s stockholders. The
      Bylaws may be amended by the Board of Directors to include provisions that
      would
      have a similar effect, although Essex presently has no such intention. The
      Charter contains ownership provisions limiting the transferability and ownership
      of shares of capital stock, which may have the effect of delaying, deferring
      or
      preventing a transaction or a change in control. For example, subject to
      receiving an exemption from the Board of Directors, potential acquirers may
      not
      purchase more than 6% in value of the stock (other than qualified pension trusts
      which can acquire 9.9%). This may discourage tender offers that may be
      attractive to the holders of common stock and limit the opportunity for
      stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of common stock.

The
      Maryland General Corporations Law restricts the voting rights of shares deemed
      to be “control shares.”


Under
      the
      Maryland General Corporations Law, “control shares” are those which, when
      aggregated with any other shares held by the acquirer, entitle the acquirer
      to
      exercise voting power within specified ranges. Although the Bylaws exempt Essex
      from the control share provisions of the Maryland General Corporations Law,
      the
      Board of Directors may amend or eliminate the provisions of the Bylaws at any
      time in the future. Moreover, any such amendment or elimination of such
      provision of the Bylaws may result in the application of the control share
      provisions of the Maryland General Corporations Law not only to control shares
      which may be acquired in the future, but also to control shares previously
      acquired. If the provisions of the Bylaws are amended or eliminated, the control
      share provisions of the Maryland General Corporations Law could delay, defer
      or
      prevent a transaction or change in control that might involve a premium price
      for the stock or otherwise be in the best interests of Essex’s stockholders.

Essex’s
      joint ventures and joint ownership of properties and partial interests in
      corporations and limited partnerships could limit Essex’s ability to control
      such Properties and partial interests

-

Instead
      of purchasing properties directly, we have invested and may continue to invest
      as a co-venturer. Joint venturers often have shared control over the operation
      of the joint venture assets. Therefore, it is possible that the co-venturer
      in
      an investment might become bankrupt, or have economic or business interests
      or
      goals that are inconsistent with our business interests or goals, or be in
      a
      position to take action contrary to our instructions or requests, or our
      policies or objectives. Consequently, a co-venturer’s actions might subject
      property owned by the joint venture to additional risk. Although we seek to
      maintain sufficient influence of any joint venture to achieve its objectives,
      we
      may be unable to take action without our joint venture partners’ approval, or
      joint venture partners could take actions binding on the joint venture without
      consent. Should a joint venture partner become bankrupt, we could become liable
      for such partner’s share of joint venture liabilities.

From
      time
      to time, we, through the Operating Partnership, invest in corporations, limited
      partnerships, limited liability companies or other entities that have been
      formed for the purpose of acquiring, developing or managing real property.
      In
      certain circumstances, the Operating Partnership’s interest in a particular
      entity may be less than a majority of the outstanding voting interests of that
      entity. Therefore, the Operating Partnership’s ability to control the daily
      operations of such an entity may be limited. Furthermore, the Operating
      Partnership may not have the power to remove a majority of the board of
      directors (in the case of a corporation) or the general partner or partners
      (in
      the case of a limited partnership) of such an entity in the event that its
      operations conflict with the Operating Partnership’s objectives. The Operating
      Partnership may not be able to dispose of its interests in such an entity.
      In
      the event that such an entity becomes insolvent, the Operating Partnership
      may
      lose up to its entire investment in and any advances to the entity. We have
      and
      in the future may enter into transactions that could require us to pay the
      tax
      liabilities of partners, which contribute assets into joint ventures or the
      Operating Partnership, in the event that certain taxable events, which are
      within our control, occur. Although we plan to hold the contributed assets
      or
      defer recognition of gain on their sale pursuant to the like-kind exchange
      rules
      under Section 1031 of the Internal Revenue Code, we can provide no assurance
      that we will be able to do so and if such tax liabilities were incurred they
      can
      expect to have a material impact on our financial position.

Dedicated
      investment activities and other factors specifically related to Fund
      II

.
      - Fund
      II involves risks to us such as the following:

·

our
                partners in Fund II might remove Essex as the gereral partner of
                Fund
                II;

·

our
                partners in Fund II might become bankrupt (in which event we might
                become
                generally liable for the liabilities of Fund II);

·

have
                economic or business interests or goals that are inconsistent with
                our
                business interests or goals;

·

fail
                to fund capital commitments as contractually required;
                or

·

fail
                to approve decisions regarding Fund II that are in our best interest.

We
      will,
      however, generally seek to maintain sufficient influence over Fund II to permit
      it to achieve its business objectives.

Investments
      in mortgages and other real estate securities

- We may
      invest in securities related to real estate, which could adversely affect our
      ability to make distributions to stockholders. We may purchase securities issued
      by entities, which own real estate and invest in mortgages or unsecured debt
      obligations. These mortgages may be first, second or third mortgages that may
      or
      may not be insured or otherwise guaranteed. In general, investments in mortgages
      include the following risks:

·

that
                the value of mortgaged property may be less than the amounts owed,
                causing
                realized or unrealized losses;


·

the
                borrower may not pay indebtedness under the mortgage when due, requiring
                us to foreclose, and the amount recovered in connection with the
                foreclosure may be less than the amount
                owed;

·

that
                interest rates payable on the mortgages may be lower than our cost
                of
                funds; and

·

in
                the case of junior mortgages, that foreclosure of a senior mortgage
                would
                eliminate the junior mortgage.

If
      any of
      the above were to occur, cash flows from operations and our ability to make
      expected dividends to stockholders could be adversely affected.

Possible
      environmental liabilities

- Under
      various federal, state and local laws, ordinances and regulations, an owner
      or
      operator of real estate is liable for the costs of removal or remediation of
      certain hazardous or toxic substances on, in, to or migrating from such
      property. Such laws often impose liability without regard as to whether the
      owner or operator knew of, or was responsible for, the presence of such
      hazardous or toxic substances. The presence of such substances, or the failure
      to properly remediate such substances, may adversely affect the owner’s or
      operator’s ability to sell or rent such property or to borrow using such
      property as collateral. Persons exposed to such substances, either through
      soil
      vapor or ingestion of the substances may claim personal injury damages. Persons
      who arrange for the disposal or treatment of hazardous or toxic substances
      or
      wastes also may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of such
      substances at the disposal or treatment facility to which such substances or
      wastes were sent, whether or not such facility is owned or operated by such
      person. Certain environmental laws impose liability for release of
      asbestos-containing materials (“ACMs”) into the air, and third parties may seek
      recovery from owners or operators of real properties for personal injury
      associated with ACMs. In connection with the ownership (direct or indirect),
      operation, management and development of real properties, the Company could
      be
      considered an owner or operator of such properties or as having arranged for
      the
      disposal or treatment of hazardous or toxic substances and, therefore, may
      be
      potentially liable for removal or remediation costs, as well as certain other
      costs, including governmental fines and costs related to injuries of persons
      and
      property.

Investments
      in real property create a potential for environmental liabilities on the part
      of
      the owner of such real property. We carry certain limited insurance coverage
      for
      this type of environmental risk. We have conducted environmental studies which
      revealed the presence of groundwater contamination at certain properties. Such
      contamination at certain of these properties was reported to have migrated
      on-site from adjacent industrial manufacturing operations. The former industrial
      users of the properties were identified as the source of contamination. The
      environmental studies noted that certain properties are located adjacent to
      any
      possible down gradient from sites with known groundwater contamination, the
      lateral limits of which may extend onto such properties. The environmental
      studies also noted that at certain of these properties, contamination existed
      because of the presence of underground fuel storage tanks, which have been
      removed. In general, in connection with the ownership, operation, financing,
      management and development of real properties, we may be potentially liable
      for
      removal or clean-up costs, as well as certain other costs and environmental
      liabilities. We may also be subject to governmental fines and costs related
      to
      injuries to persons and property.

Recently
      there has been an increasing number of lawsuits against owners and managers
      of
      multifamily properties alleging personal injury and property damage caused
      by
      the presence of mold in residential real estate. Some of these lawsuits have
      resulted in substantial monetary judgments or settlements. Essex has been sued
      for mold related matters and has settled some, but not all, such matters, which
      matters remain unresolved and pending. Insurance carriers have reacted to mold
      related liability awards by excluding mold related claims from standard policies
      and pricing mold endorsements at prohibitively high rates. Essex has, however,
      purchased pollution liability insurance, which includes limited coverage for
      mold, although the insurance may not cover all pending or future mold claims.
      Essex has adopted programs designed to manage the existence of mold in its
      properties as well as guidelines for promptly addressing and resolving reports
      of mold to minimize any impact mold might have on residents or the property.
      Essex cannot assure you that it will not be sued in the future for mold related
      matters not can it assure you that the liabilities resulting from such current
      or future mold related matters will not be substantial. The costs of carrying
      insurance to address potential mold related claims may also be
      substantial.

California
      has enacted legislation commonly referred to as “Proposition 65” requiring that
“clear and reasonable” warnings be given to consumers who are exposed to
      chemicals known to the State of California to cause cancer or reproductive
      toxicity, including tobacco smoke. Although we have sought to comply with
      Proposition 65 requirements, we cannot assure you that we will not be adversely
      affected by litigation relating to Proposition 65.

Methane
      gas is a naturally-occurring gas that is commonly found below the surface in
      several areas, particularly in the Southern California coastal areas. 
Methane is a non-toxic gas, but can be ignitable in confined spaces. 
Although naturally-occurring, methane gas is not regulated at the state or
      federal level, some local governments, such as the County of Los Angeles, have
      imposed requirements that new buildings install detection systems in areas
      where
      methane gas is known to be located.


Methane
      gas is also associated with certain industrial activities, such as former
      municipal waste landfills. Radon is also a naturally-occurring gas that is
      found
      below the surface. Essex cannot assure you that it will not be adversely
      affected by costs related to its compliance with methane gas related
      requirements or litigation costs related to methane or radon gas.

Except
      with respect to three Properties, the Company has no indemnification agreements
      from third parties for potential environmental clean-up costs at its Properties.
      The Company has no way of determining at this time the magnitude of any
      potential liability to which it may be subject arising out of unknown
      environmental conditions or violations with respect to the properties formerly
      owned by the Company. No assurance can be given that existing environmental
      studies with respect to any of the Properties reveal all environmental
      liabilities, that any prior owner or operator of a Property did not create
      any
      material environmental condition not known to the Company, or that a material
      environmental condition does not exist as to any one or more of the Properties.
      The Company has limited insurance coverage for the types of environmental
      liabilities described above.

General
      uninsured losses

- We
      have a comprehensive insurance program covering our property and operating
      activities. There are, however, certain types of extraordinary losses for which
      we may not have insurance. Accordingly, we may sustain uninsured losses due
      to
      insurance deductibles, self-insured retention, uninsured claims or casualties,
      or losses in excess of applicable coverage.

Changes
      in real estate tax and other laws

-
      Generally we do not directly pass through costs resulting from changes in real
      estate tax laws to residential property tenants. We also do not generally pass
      through increases in income, service or other taxes, to tenants under leases.
      These costs may adversely affect funds from operations and the ability to make
      distributions to stockholders. Similarly, compliance with changes in (i) laws
      increasing the potential liability for environmental conditions existing on
      properties or the restrictions on discharges or other conditions or (ii) rent
      control or rent stabilization laws or other laws regulating housing may result
      in significant unanticipated expenditures, which would adversely affect funds
      from operations and the ability to make distributions to
      stockholders.

Changes
      in financing policy; no limitation on debt -

We have
      adopted a policy of maintaining a debt-to-total-market-capitalization ratio
      of
      less than 50%. The calculation of debt-to-total-market-capitalization is as
      follows: total property indebtedness divided by the sum of total property
      indebtedness plus total equity market capitalization. As used in this
      calculation, total equity market capitalization is equal to the aggregate market
      value of the outstanding shares of common stock (based on the greater of current
      market price or the gross proceeds per share from public offerings of the
      outstanding shares plus any undistributed net cash flow), assuming the
      conversion of all limited partnership interests in the Operating Partnership
      into shares of common stock and the gross proceeds of the preferred units.
      Based
      on this calculation (including the current market price and excluding
      undistributed net cash flow), our debt-to-total-market-capitalization ratio
      was
      approximately 35% as of December 31, 2005.

Our
      organizational documents do not limit the amount or percentage of indebtedness
      that may be incurred. Accordingly, the Board of Directors of Essex could change
      current policies and the policies of the Operating Partnership regarding
      indebtedness. If we changed these policies, we could incur more debt, resulting
      in an increased risk of default on our obligations and the obligations of the
      Operating Partnership, and an increase in debt service requirements that could
      adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. Such
      increased debt could exceed the underlying value of the Properties.

We
      are subject to certain tax risks

-

Essex
      has
      elected to be taxed as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code. Essex’s
      qualification as a REIT requires it to satisfy numerous requirements (some
      on an
      annual and quarterly basis) established under highly technical and complex
      Internal Revenue Code provisions for which there are only limited judicial
      or
      administrative interpretations, and involves the determination of various
      factual matters and circumstances not entirely within Essex’s control. Although
      Essex intends that its current organization and method of operation enable
      it to
      qualify as a REIT, it cannot assure you that it so qualifies or that it will
      be
      able to remain so qualified in the future. Future legislation, new regulations,
      administrative interpretations or court decisions (any of which could have
      retroactive effect) could adversely affect Essex’s ability to qualify as a REIT
      or adversely affect its stockholders. If it fails to qualify as a REIT in any
      taxable year, Essex would be subject to U.S. federal income tax (including
      any
      applicable alternative minimum tax) on its taxable income at corporate rates,
      and would not be allowed to deduct dividends paid to its shareholders in
      computing its taxable income. Essex may also be disqualified from treatment
      as a
      REIT for the four taxable years following the year in which it failed to
      qualify. The additional tax liability would reduce its net earnings available
      for investment or distribution to stockholders, and it would no longer be
      required to make distributions to its stockholders. Even if Essex continues
      to
      qualify as a REIT, it will continue to be subject to certain federal, state
      and
      local taxes on its income and property.


Essex
      has
      established several taxable REIT subsidiaries. Despite Essex’s qualification as
      a REIT, its taxable REIT subsidiaries must pay U.S. federal income tax on their
      taxable income. While Essex will attempt to ensure that its dealings with its
      taxable REIT subsidiaries will not adversely affect its REIT qualification,
      it
      cannot provide assurance that it will successfully achieve that result.
      Furthermore, Essex may be subject to a 100% penalty tax, or its taxable REIT
      subsidiaries may be denied deductions, to the extent its dealings with its
      taxable REIT subsidiaries are not deemed to be arm’s length in nature. No
      assurances can be given that Essex’s dealings with its taxable REIT subsidiaries
      will be arm’s length in nature.

From
      time
      to time, we may transfer or otherwise dispose of some of our Properties. Under
      the Internal Revenue Code, any gain resulting from transfers of Properties
      that
      we hold as inventory or primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course
      of business would be treated as income from a prohibited transaction subject
      to
      a 100% penalty tax. Since we acquire properties for investment purposes, we
      do
      not believe that our occasional transfers or disposals of property are
      prohibited transactions. However, whether property is held for investment
      purposes is a question of fact that depends on all the facts and circumstances
      surrounding the particular transaction. The Internal Revenue Service may contend
      that certain transfers or disposals of properties by us are prohibited
      transactions. If the Internal Revenue Service were to argue successfully that
      a
      transfer or disposition of property constituted a prohibited transaction, then
      Essex would be required to pay a 100% penalty tax on any gain allocable to
      Essex
      from the prohibited transaction and Essex’s ability to retain future gains on
      real property sales may be jeopardized. Income from a prohibited transaction
      might adversely affect Essex’s ability to satisfy the income tests for
      qualification as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Therefore, no
      assurances can be given that Essex will be able to satisfy the income tests
      for
      qualification as a REIT.

Item
      2. Properties

Our
      core
      apartment portfolio as of December 31, 2005 (including partial ownership
      interests) was comprised of 126 multifamily properties (comprising 26,587
      apartment units), of which 13,382 units are located in Southern California,
      6,557 units are located in the San Francisco Bay Area, 5,471 units are located
      in the Seattle Metropolitan Area, and 875 units are located in the Portland
      Metropolitan Area. The Company’s multifamily properties accounted for 99% of the
      Company’s property revenues for the year ended December 31, 2005.

Occupancy
      Rates

The
      apartment communities had an average Same-Properties occupancy (as defined
      in
      Item 7), based on “financial occupancy,” during the year ended December 31,
      2005, of approximately 96.9%. With respect to stabilized multifamily properties
      with sufficient operating history, occupancy figures are based on financial
      occupancy (the percentage resulting from dividing actual rental revenue by
      total
      possible rental revenue). Actual rental revenue represents contractual revenue
      pursuant to leases without considering delinquency and concessions. Total
      possible rental revenue represents the value of all apartment units, with
      occupied units valued at contractual rental rates pursuant to leases and vacant
      units valued at estimated market rents. We believe that financial occupancy
      is a
      meaningful measure of occupancy because it considers the value of each vacant
      unit at its estimated market rate. Financial occupancy may not completely
      reflect short-term trends in physical occupancy and financial occupancy rates
      as
      disclosed by other REITs may not be comparable to our calculation of financial
      occupancy.

As
      of
      December 31, 2005, the headquarters building was 100% occupied by the Company
      and the Southern California office building was 99% occupied, based on physical
      occupancy. With respect to office buildings, occupancy figures are based on
      “physical occupancy” which refers to the percentage resulting from dividing
      leased and occupied square footage by rentable square footage. With respect
      to
      recreational vehicle parks, manufactured housing communities, or multifamily
      properties which have not yet stabilized or have insufficient operating history,
      occupancy figures are based on “physical occupancy” which refers to the
      percentage resulting from dividing leased and occupied units by rentable units.

For
      the
      year ended December 31, 2005, none of the Company’s Properties had book values
      equal to 10% or more of total assets of the Company or gross revenues equal
      to
      10% or more of aggregate gross revenues of the Company.

Multifamily
      Residential Properties

Our
      apartment communities are generally suburban garden apartments and town homes
      comprising multiple clusters of two and three story buildings situated on three
      to fifteen acres of land.


The
      multifamily properties have on average 210 units, with a mix of studio, one,
      two
      and some three-bedroom units. A wide variety of amenities are available at
      each
      apartment community, including covered parking, fireplaces, swimming pools,
      clubhouses with complete fitness facilities, volleyball and playground areas
      and
      tennis courts.

We
      select, train and supervise a full team of on-site service and maintenance
      personnel. We believe that the following primary factors enhance our ability
      to
      retain tenants:

·

well
                built communities that have been well maintained since acquisition;
                and

·

proactive
                customer service approach.

Office
      Buildings

The
      Company’s corporate headquarters is located in a two-story office building with
      approximately 17,400 square feet located at 925 East Meadow Drive, Palo Alto,
      California. The Company acquired this property in 1997. The Company also owns
      an
      office building in Southern California (Woodland Hills), comprised of
      approximately 38,940 square feet building, of which the Company occupies
      approximately 11,200 square feet at December 31, 2005. The building has nine
      third party tenants occupying approximately 27,400 feet. The largest single
      tenant occupies approximately 10,900 square feet. The Company acquired this
      property in 2001. The Company has a mortgage loan receivable on an office
      building with approximately 110,000 square feet located in Irvine, California,
      which is consolidated under FIN 46R.

Recreational
      Vehicle Parks and Manufactured Housing Community

The
      Company owns three recreational vehicle parks (comprising of 562 spaces),
      acquired in the Company’s December 2002 acquisition of John M. Sachs, Inc.,
      located in El Cajon and San Jaciento, California.

The
      Company owns one manufactured housing community (containing 157 sites), acquired
      in the Company’s December 2002 acquisition of John M. Sachs, Inc., located in
      Vista, California.


The
        following tables describe the Company’s Properties as of December 31, 2005. The
        first table describes the Company’s multifamily residential properties and the
        second table describes the Company’s other real estate assets.




(1)

Unless
                otherwise specified, the Company has a 100% ownership interest in
                each
                Property.

(2)

For
                multifamily residential properties, occupancy rates are based on
                financial
                occupancy for the year ended December 31, 2005; for the office buildings,
                recreational vehicle parks, manufactured housing communities or properties
                which have not yet stabilized or have insufficient operating history,
                occupancy rates are based on physical occupancy as of December 31,
                2005.
                For an explanation of how financial occupancy and physical occupancy
                are
                calculated, see “Properties-Occupancy Rates” in this Item
                2.

(3)

The
                Company has a 30% special limited partnership interest in the entity
                that
                owns this multifamily property. This investment was made under
                arrangements whereby EMC became the general partner and the existing
                partners were granted the right to require the applicable partnership
                to
                redeem their interest for cash. Subject to certain conditions, the
                Company
                may, however, elect to deliver an equivalent number of shares of
                the
                Company’s Common Stock in satisfaction of the applicable partnership's
                cash redemption obligation.

(4)

The
                property is subject to a ground lease, which, unless extended, will
                expire
                in 2082.

(5)

The
                Company owns the land and has leased the improvements to an unrelated
                third party. The leasehold interest entitles the Company to receive
                a
                monthly payment for the 34-year term of the land lease. The Company
                may be
                required to sell its interest in the property anytime following the
                seventh anniversary of the leasehold date which was created in 2000.

(6)

This
                property is owned by Fund II. The Company has a 28.2% interest in
                Fund II
                and is accounted for using the equity method of
                accounting.

(7)

The
                Company holds a 1% special limited partner interest in the partnerships
                which own these multifamily properties. These investments were made
                under
                arrangements whereby EMC became the 1% sole general partner and the
                other
                limited partners were granted the right to require the applicable
                partnership to redeem their interest for cash. Subject to certain
                conditions, the Company may, however, elect to deliver an equivalent
                number of shares of the Company’s Common Stock in satisfaction of the
                applicable partnership’s cash redemption obligation.

(8)

In
                2002 the Company purchased an additional 21 units adjacent to this
                property for $3 million. This property was built in
                1991.

Item
      3. Legal Proceedings

In
      April
      2004, an employee lawsuit entitled Chance Nelson and Douglas Korte, et al vs.
      Essex Property Trust, as filed against the Company in the California Superior
      Court in the County of Alameda. In this lawsuit, two former Company maintenance
      employees seek unpaid wages, associated penalties and attorneys’ fees on behalf
      of a putative class of the Company’s current and former maintenance employees
      who were required to wear a pager while they were on call during evening and
      weekend hours. In June 2005, the Company recorded $1.5 million for legal
      settlement costs. There has been no change to the settlement amount since the
      second quarter of 2005. However, litigation is subject to inherent
      uncertainties, and such amount represents management’s best estimate of the
      total cost of the litigation at this time.

Recently
      there has been an increasing number of lawsuits against owners and managers
      of
      multifamily properties alleging personal injury and property damage caused
      by
      the presence of mold in residential real estate. Some of these lawsuits have
      resulted in substantial monetary judgments or settlements. The Company has
      been
      sued for mold related matters and has settled some, but not all, of such
      matters. Insurance carriers have reacted to mold related liability awards by
      excluding mold related claims from standard policies and pricing mold
      endorsements at prohibitively high rates. The Company has, however, purchased
      pollution liability insurance, which includes coverage for mold. The Company
      has
      adopted programs designed to manage the existence of mold in its properties
      as
      well as guidelines for promptly addressing and resolving reports of mold to
      minimize any impact mold might have on residents or the property. Liabilities
      resulting from such mold related matters and the costs of carrying insurance
      to
      address potential mold related claims may also be substantial.

The
      Company is subject to various other lawsuits in the normal course of its
      business operations. Accordingly, such lawsuits, as well as the class action
      lawsuit described above, could result in substantial costs and diversion of
      resources and could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial
      condition, results of operations or cash flows.

Item
      4. Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders

During
      the fourth quarter of 2005, no matters were submitted to a vote of security
      holders.

Item
      5. Market for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer
      Purchases of Equity Securities

The
      shares of the Company’s common stock are traded on the New York Stock Exchange
      (“NYSE”) under the symbol ESS.

Market
      Information

The
      Company’s common stock has been traded on the NYSE since June 13, 1994. The
      high, low and closing price per share of common stock reported on the NYSE
      for
      the quarters indicated are as follows:

The
      closing price as of March 10, 2006 was $105.50.

Holders

The
      approximate number of holders of record of the shares of the Company’s common
      stock was 208 as of March 10, 2006. This number does not include stockholders
      whose shares are held in trust by other entities. The actual number of
      stockholders is greater than this number of holders of record.

Return
      of Capital

Under
      provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, the portion of
      the
      cash dividend, if any, that exceeds earnings and profits is considered a return
      of capital. The return of capital is generated due to a variety of factors,
      including the deduction of non-cash expenses, primarily depreciation, in the
      determination of earnings and profits.

The
      status of the cash dividends distributed for the years ended December 31, 2005,
      2004 and 2003 for tax purposes is as follows:


Dividends
        and Distributions

Since
      its
      initial public offering on June 13, 1994, the Company has paid regular quarterly
      dividends to its stockholders. From inception, the Company has paid the
      following dividends per share of common stock:

Future
        distributions by the Company will be at the discretion of the Board of Directors
        and will depend on the actual funds from operations of the Company, its
        financial condition, capital requirements, the annual distribution requirements
        under the REIT provisions of the Internal Revenue Code, applicable legal
        restrictions and such other factors as the Board of Directors deems relevant.
        There are currently no contractual restrictions on the Company’s present or
        future ability to pay dividends.

On
      February 23, 2006, the Company announced the Board of Directors approved a
      $0.12
      per share annual increase to the quarterly cash dividend. Accordingly, the
      first
      quarter dividend distribution, payable on April 17, 2006 to stockholders as
      of
      record as of March 31, 2006, will be $0.84 per share.

Dividend
      Reinvestment and Share Purchase Plan

The
      Company has adopted a dividend reinvestment and share purchase plan designed
      to
      provide holders of Common Stock with a convenient and economical means to
      reinvest all or a portion of their cash dividends in shares of Common Stock
      and
      to acquire additional shares of Common Stock through voluntary purchases.
      Computershare, LLC, which serves as the Company’s transfer agent, administers
      the dividend reinvestment and share purchase plan. For a copy of the plan,
      contact Computershare, LLC at

      360-5354.

Stockholder
      Rights Plan

In
      1998,
      the Company adopted a stockholder rights plan that is designed to enhance the
      ability of all of the Company’s stockholders to realize the long-term value of
      their investment. The rights plan is designed, in part, to prevent a person
      or
      group from gaining control of the Company without offering a fair price to
      all
      of the Company’s stockholders.

On
      October 13, 1998, the Board declared a one for one preferred share purchase
      right (a “Right”) for each outstanding share of Common Stock. Each Right
      entitles the registered holder to purchase from the Company one one-hundredth
      of
      a share of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock, par value $.0001
      per
      share, of the Company, at a price of $99.13 per one-hundredth of a share,
      subject to adjustment. The description and terms of the Rights are set forth
      in
      a Rights Agreement dated as of November 11, 1998, as amended between the Company
      and Computershare, LLC as Rights Agent.

Item
      6. Selected Financial Data

The
        following tables set forth summary financial and operating information for
        the
        Company from January 1, 2001 through December 31, 2005.


(1)

The
                above financial and operating information from January 1, 2002 through
                December 31, 2003 reflect the retroactive adoption of FIN 46R and
                SFAS
                123. The above financial and operating information from January 1
                through
                December 31, 2001 has not been restated to reflect the retroactive
                adoption of FIN 46R and SFAS 123. The results of operations for 2004,
                2003, and 2002 have been reclassified to reflect discontinued operations
                for properties sold subsequent to December 31, 2004. Results of operations
                for 2001 have not been reclassified. Because 2001 results have not
                been
                reclassified, the results for that period may not be comparable to
                the
                results for the later periods set forth
                above.

(2)

Interest
                coverage ratio represents earnings before minority interests, gain
                on
                sales of real estate, interest expense, taxes, depreciation and
                amortization (“adjusted EBITDA”) divided by interest expense. The Company
                believes that the interest coverage ratio is useful to readers because
                it
                is frequently used by investors, lenders, security analysts and other
                interested parties in the evaluation of companies in our industry.


In
      addition, the Company believes that this ratio is useful in evaluating our
      performance compared to that of other companies in our industry because the
      calculation of the adjusted EBITDA component of the interest coverage ratio
      generally eliminates the effects of financing costs, income taxes, and
      depreciation and amortization, which items may vary for different companies
      for
      reasons unrelated to operating performance.

The
      adjusted EBITDA component of the interest coverage ratio, however, is not a
      recognized measurement under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles,
      or
      GAAP. When analyzing our operating performance, readers should use the interest
      coverage ratio and its adjusted EBITDA component in addition to, and not as
      an
      alternative for, net income, as determined in accordance with GAAP. Because
      not
      all companies use identical calculations, our presentation of the interest
      coverage ratio and its adjusted EBITDA component may not be comparable to
      similarly titled measures of other companies. Furthermore, the interest coverage
      ratio is not intended to be a measure of free cash flow for our management’s
      discretionary use, as it does not consider certain cash requirements such as
      income tax payments, debt service requirements, capital expenditures and other
      fixed charges. The amounts shown for the interest coverage ratio and adjusted
      EBITDA may also differ from the amounts calculated under similarly titled
      definitions in our debt instruments, which can be further adjusted to reflect
      certain other cash and non-cash charges and are used to determine compliance
      with financial covenants and our ability to engage in certain activities such
      as
      incurring additional debt and making certain restricted payments.

(3)

Gross
                operating margin represents rental revenues and other property income
                less
                property operating expenses, exclusive of depreciation and amortization,
                divided by rental revenues and other property income.

(4)

A
                multifamily stabilized property, or “Same-Property” apartment units (as
                defined in Item 7), are those units in properties that the Company
                has
                consolidated for the entire two years ended as of the end of the
                period
                set forth. The number of same property apartment units in such properties
                may vary at each year-end. Percentage changes in averages per unit
                do not
                correspond to total same property revenues and expense percent changes
                which are discussed in Item 7—Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
                Financial Condition and Results of Operations.

(5)

Average
                Same-Property monthly rental rate per apartment unit represents total
                scheduled rent for the same property apartment units for the period
                (actual rental rates on occupied apartment units plus market rental
                rates
                on vacant apartment units) divided by the number of such apartment
                units
                and further divided by the number of months in the period.

(6)

Average
                Same-Property monthly expenses per apartment unit represents total
                monthly
                operating expenses, exclusive of depreciation and amortization, for
                the
                same property apartment units for the period divided by the total
                number
                of such apartment units and further divided by the number of months
                in the
                period.

(7)

Occupancy
                rates are based on financial occupancy. For an explanation of how
                financial occupancy is calculated, see “Properties-Occupancy Rates” in
                Item 2 of Part I of this Form 10-K.


Item
        7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
        Operations

The
      following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the
      accompanying consolidated financial statements and notes thereto. These
      consolidated financial statements include all adjustments which are, in the
      opinion of management, necessary to reflect a fair statement of the results
      and
      all such adjustments are of a normal recurring nature.

OVERVIEW

The
      Company is a self-administered and self-managed real estate investment trust,
      or
“REIT,” that acquires, develops, redevelops and manages multifamily residential
      properties in selected communities located primarily in the west coast of the
      United States. The Company owns all of its interests in its real
      properties, directly or indirectly, through the Operating
      Partnership. The Company is the sole general partner of the Operating
      Partnership and, as of December 31, 2005, had an approximately 90.4%
      general partner interest in the Operating Partnership.

Our
      investment strategy has two components: constant monitoring of existing markets,
      and evaluation of new markets to identify areas with the characteristics that
      underlie rental growth. Our strong financial condition supports our investment
      strategy by enhancing our ability to quickly shift our acquisition, development,
      and disposition activities to markets that will optimize the performance of
      the
      portfolio.

By
      region, the Company's operating results and rent growth analysis are as
      follows:

Southern
      California Region

:
      As of
      December 31, 2005, we had ownership interests in this region representing 50%
      of
      our multifamily units. During the year ended December 31, 2005, the region
      continued to perform well, as Same-Property (as defined below) revenues
      increased 5.3% compared to 2004. The Company expects new residential supply
      of
      26,000 single family homes and 19,000 multi-family units which represents a
      total new supply of 0.8% of existing stock. The Company expects this region
      to
      generate positive rent growth of approximately 3.75% in 2006.

Northern
      California Region

:
      As of
      December 31, 2005, the Company had ownership interests in this region
      representing 25% of its multifamily units. The region improved from a decrease
      in Same-Property revenues of 4.2% in 2004 compared to 2003, to an increase
      in
      Same-Property revenues of 1.9% in 2005 compared to 2004. The Company expects
      new
      residential supply of 10,000 single family homes and 7,000 multi-family units
      which represents a total new supply of 0.8% of existing stock. The company
      expects this region to generate positive rent growth of approximately 4.0%
      in
      2006.

Pacific
      Northwest Region

:
      As of
      December 31, 2005, the Company had ownership interests in this region
      representing 24% of its multifamily units. The region improved from an increase
      in Same-Property revenues of 1.4% in 2004 compared to 2003, to an increase
      in
      Same-Property revenues of 3.3% in 2005 compared to 2004. The Company expects
      new
      residential supply of 22,000 single family homes and 5,500 multi-family units
      which represents a total new supply of 1.5% of existing stock. The company
      expects this region to generate positive rent growth of approximately 3.5%
      in
      2006.

As
      of
      December 31, 2005, we had ownership interests in 126 multifamily properties,
      comprising 26,587 apartment units. Our multifamily residential properties are
      located in three major West Coast regions:

Southern
      California

(Los
      Angeles, Ventura, Orange, Riverside and San Diego counties)

Northern
      California

(the San
      Francisco Bay Area)

Pacific
      Northwest

(Seattle, Washington and Portland, Oregon metropolitan areas)

The
      Company’s consolidated multifamily properties are as follows:


At
      December 31, 2005, we also had ownership interests in three office buildings
      (with approximately 166,340 square feet), three recreational vehicle parks
      (comprising 562 spaces) and one manufactured housing community (containing
      sites).

We
      currently have three development projects and other pre-development projects
      in
      our pipeline, aggregating 505 units, with total incurred costs as of December
      31, 2005 of $37.1 million and estimated remaining costs of approximately $96.6
      million.

These
      consolidated development projects are:

·

Northwest
                Gateway, in Los Angeles, California consisting of 275
                units.

·

Moorpark,
                in Ventura County, California consisting of 200
                units.

·

Tuscana,
                in Tracy, California consisting of 30
                units.

RESULTS
      OF OPERATIONS

Comparison
      of Year Ended December 31, 2005 to Year Ended December 31,

Average
      financial occupancy rates of the Company’s multifamily stabilized properties or
“Same-Properties” (properties consolidated by the Company for each of the years
      ended December 31, 2005 and 2004) increased to 96.9% for the year ended December
      31, 2005 from 96.0% for the year ended December 31, 2004. Financial occupancy
      is
      defined as the percentage resulting from dividing actual rental revenue by
      total
      possible rental revenue. Actual rental revenue represents contractual rental
      revenue pursuant to leases without considering delinquency and concessions.
      Total possible rental revenue represents the value of all apartment units,
      with
      occupied units valued at contractual rental rates pursuant to leases and vacant
      units valued at estimated market rents. We believe that financial occupancy
      is a
      meaningful measure of occupancy because it considers the value of each vacant
      unit at its estimated market rate. Financial occupancy may not completely
      reflect short-term trends in physical occupancy and financial occupancy rates
      as
      disclosed by other REITs may not be comparable to our calculation of financial
      occupancy.

The
      regional breakdown of the Company’s Same-Property portfolio for financial
      occupancy for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004 are as follows:

Total
      Property revenues

increased by $35.6 million or by 12.7% to $316.3 million in 2005 from $280.7
      million in 2004. The following table sets forth a breakdown of these revenue
      amounts, including the revenues attributable to Same-Properties.

(1)

Also
          includes three office buildings, one multifamily property located in Houston,
          Texas, three recreational vehicle parks, one manufactured housing community,
          and
          redevelopment communities and development communities.


Same-Property
        revenues

increased by $9.0 million or 4.1% to $227.4 million in 2005 from $218.4 million
        in 2004. The majority of this increase was due to strong rental rate growth
        of
        4.0% or $5.0 million attributable to the 49 Same-Properties located in Southern
        California and rental rate growth of 1.1% or approximately $526,000 attributable
        to the 25 Same-Properties located in the Pacific Northwest. The 16 multifamily
        residential properties located in Northern California achieved rental rate
        growth of 0.7% or approximately $352,000. Property revenues for Same-Properties
        also increased due to an increase in occupancy from 96.0% in 2004 to 96.9%
        for
        2005, for an increase in revenues of $1.9 million. Rent concessions also
        decreased in the second half of 2005, which increased 2005 revenues by
        approximately $415,000 for the Same-Property portfolio.

Non-Same
      Property Revenues

increased
      by $26.7 million or 42.8% to $89.0 million for 2005 from $62.3 million for
      2004.
      Non-Same Properties include properties acquired subsequent to January 1, 2004,
      the three office buildings, three recreational vehicle parks, one manufactured
      housing community, and development and redevelopment communities. The increase
      was primarily generated from communities acquired and or developed and increased
      rents from redeveloped properties. Subsequent to January 1, 2004, we acquired
      multifamily communities or 3,262 units and completed the construction of 756
      units.

Management
      and other fees from affiliates

decreased
      by approximately $12.2 million in 2005 due primarily to the promote
      distributions from Fund I being reduced from $18.3 million in 2004 to $7.0
      million in 2005 as Fund I finished the liquidation of its assets. Development
      and redevelopment fees from Fund I decreased by $1.1 million during 2005 from
      $1.3 million in 2004 to $204,000 in 2005 as the expenditures for Fund I’s
      development assets decreased as the assets were sold in the second half of
      and early 2005.

Total
      Expenses

increased 10% to $285.9 million for 2005 from $250.2 million for 2004. The
      increase was due primarily to depreciation and amortization, real estate taxes,
      property operating expenses, interest expense, and other expenses. For 2005
      as
      compared to 2004, depreciation and amortization increased 12% or $8.3 million,
      real estate taxes increased 11% or $2.8 million, and property operating expenses
      increased 9% or $6.7 million due to an increase in the number of owned
      properties during 2005.

Interest
      expense

increased
      17% to $73.6 million, net of $1.1 of capitalized interest for 2005, as compared
      to $63.0 million, net of $2.0 million of capitalized interest, for 2004. The
      increase was primarily due to an increase in LIBOR during 2005, and during
      the
      fourth quarter of 2005 the Company issued $225 million in exchangeable bonds.
      The proceeds from the bond issuance were used to pay the lines of credit and
      certain mortgage notes payable, and repurchase $25 million in common
      stock.

Other
      expenses

were
      $5.8
      million for 2005. Other expenses included a provision of $1.5 million for a
      legal settlement recorded in the second quarter of 2005, see Item 3  of
      Part I "Legal Proceedings." A $1.4 million incentive compensation reward was
      accrued in the third quarter and paid during the fourth quarter of 2005 for
      key
      members of the management team that contributed to the success of the $6.1
      million interest income realized on the $5 million participating loan at The
      Essex at Lake Merritt. During the fourth quarter, the Company recorded an
      impairment loss of $1.3 million related to a property in Houston, Texas, and
      pre-payment penalties and write-off of deferred charges in the amount of $1.6
      million related to the early termination of various mortgage notes payable.

Gain
      on sale of real estate

decreased by $1.5 million for 2005 to $6.4 million compared to $7.9 million
      recorded in 2004. During 2005, Essex recognized $5.0 million in gains previously
      deferred in 2004 on the sale of Essex at Lake Merritt and $1.4 million in gains
      related to additional real estate sales. The gain of $7.9 million recorded
      in
      the third quarter of 2004 related to the sale of The Essex at Lake
      Merritt.

Interest
      and other income

increased
      by $5.4 million to $8.6 million for 2005 compared to $3.2 million for 2004.
      The
      increase is primarily attributable to the receipt of $6.1 million in interest
      income related to The Essex at Lake Merritt participating loan in
      2005.

Equity
      income in co-investments

decreased by $22.2 million to $19.0 million for 2005 compared to $41.2 million
      in 2004. During 2005 the Company recorded its pro-rata allocation of gains
      of
      $18.1 million on sales of Fund I properties and equity income from Funds I,
      II
      and other joint ventures totaling approximately $915,000. During 2004, the
      Company recorded its pro-rata allocation of gains of $39.2 million on sales
      of
      Fund I properties

and
      the
      sale of its direct interest in Coronado at Newport - North,

and
      equity income from Funds I, II and joint ventures totaling approximately $2.0
      million.

Income
      tax provision

increased
      by $2.3 million during 2005 due to taxable income related to our taxable REIT
      subsidiaries.


Discontinued
      operations

increased by $26.9 million to $28.3 million for 2005 from $1.4 million for
      2004.
      The increase was due mainly to a gain on sale of the Eastridge property during
      the second quarter of 2005, for $26.6 million which is net of minority interest
      of $2.6 million and deferred gain of $2.2 million.

Comparison
      of Year Ended December 31, 2004 to Year Ended December 31,

Average
      financial occupancy rates of the Company’s 2004/2003 Same-Property portfolio
      (properties consolidated by the Company for each of the years ended December
      31,
      2004 and 2003) for the year ended December 31, 2004 increased to 96.0% from
      95.8% for the year ended December 31, 2003.

The
      regional breakdown of financial occupancy for the 2004/2003 Same-Properties
      for
      the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003 are as follows:

Total
      Property revenues increased by $31.9 million or 12.8% to $280.7 million in
      from $248.8 million in 2003. The following table sets forth a breakdown of
      these
      revenue amounts, including the revenues attributable to 2004/2003
      Same-Properties.

(1)

Also
                includes three office buildings, one multifamily property located
                in
                Houston, Texas, three recreational vehicle parks, one manufactured
                housing
                community, and redevelopment communities and development
                communities.

2004/2003
      Same-Property revenues

increased by $1.6 million or 0.9% to $176.9 million in 2004 from $175.3 million
      in 2003. The majority of this increase was attributable to the 40 2004/2003
      Same-Properties located in Southern California and the 22 2004/2003
      Same-Properties located in the Pacific Northwest. 2004/2003 Same-Property
      revenues for the Southern California region increased by $3.1 million or 3.6%
      to
      $89.6 million in 2004 from $86.5 million in 2003. The increase in Southern
      California is primarily attributable to rental rate increases and a slight
      increase in financial occupancy to 96.1% in 2004 from 96.0% in 2003. 2004/2003
      Same-property revenues for the Pacific Northwest region increased by
      approximately $533,000 or 1.4% to $39.6 million in 2004 from $39.0 million
      in
      2003. The $533,000 increase in the Pacific Northwest is primarily attributable
      to rental rate increases and an increase in financial occupancy to 95.6% in
      from 95.1% in 2003. The 16 2004/2003 Same-Properties located in Northern
      California offset the net increase in total property revenues from the other
      regions. 2004/2003 Same-Property revenues for the Northern California region
      decreased $2.1 million or 4.2% to $47.7 million in 2004 from $49.8 million
      in
      2003. The $2.1 million decrease is primarily attributable to rental rate
      decreases offset by an increase in financial occupancy to 96.1% in 2004 from
      95.9% in 2003.


2004/2003
      Non-Same Property revenues

increased by $30.3 million or 41.3% to $103.9 million for 2004 from $73.5
      million for 2003.

2004/2003

Non-Same
      Properties include properties acquired subsequent to January 1, 2003, five
      office buildings, four recreational vehicle parks, two manufactured housing
      communities, and development and redevelopment communities. The increase is
      primarily attributable to the 14 multifamily properties acquired subsequent
      to
      January 1, 2003.

Total
      Expenses

increased by $49.5 million or approximately 25% to $250.1 million in 2004 from
      $200.6 million in 2003. This increase was mainly due to an increase in property
      operating expenses of $30.1 million or 22% to $167.5 million in 2004 from $137.4
      million in 2003. Of such operating expense increase, $13.5 million was
      attributable to the 14 multifamily properties purchased subsequent to January
      1,
      2003, three development properties that stabilized operations and five
      communities that are in redevelopment excluding depreciation and amortization
      expense. Depreciation and amortization expense increased by $15.0 million,
      which
      was attributable mainly to the 14 properties purchased subsequent to January
      1,
      2003 and a correction of depreciation expense recorded in the first quarter
      of
      2004.

Interest
      expense

increased by $10.6 million or 20% to $63.0 million in 2004 from $52.4 million
      in
      2003. The increase in interest expense is primarily due to increases in the
      mortgage notes payable and line of credit balances, the majority of which
      relates to the 14 communities purchased subsequent to January 1, 2003.

General
      and Administrative (G&A) expenses

increased by $8.4 million or 88% to $18.1 million in 2004 from $9.6 million
      in
      2003. The increase in G&A was primarily attributable to incentive
      compensation, increases in headcount and related compensation expense,
      compliance with Rule 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, and accrued
      litigation costs.

Gain
      on sale of real estate

was $7.9
      million for 2004 and there were no sales in 2003. The Essex at Lake Merritt
      property, a 270-unit multifamily community located in Oakland, California,
      was
      sold in August 2004 for a total gain of $12.9 million reduced by a deferred
      gain
      of $5.0 million related to a participating loan with the buyer.

Interest
      and other income

increased by $2.5 million to $3.2 million in 2004 from approximately $688,000
      in
      2003. The increase relates primarily to an increase in leasing income related
      to
      the recreational vehicle parks and manufactured housing
      communities.

Equity
      income in co-investments

increased
      by $37.9 million to $41.2 million in 2004 from $3.3 million in 2003.

During
      2004, the Company recorded its pro-rata allocation of gains of $39.2 million
      on
      sales of Fund I properties

and
      the
      sale of its direct interest in Coronado at Newport - North,

and
      equity income from Funds I, II and joint ventures totaling approximately $2.0
      million.

Minority
      interests

increased by $1.7 million or 7% to $27.5 million in 2004 from $25.7 million
      in
      2003. This is primarily due to the increase in net income of the Operating
      Partnership.

Discontinued
      operations

decreased
      by $1.2 million to $1.4 million in 2004 from $2.6 million in 2003. The decrease
      in income from discontinued operations was mainly due to an impairment charge
      of
      approximately $718,000 in 2004 for Golden Village Recreational Vehicle Park,
      located in Hemet, California. This property was sold in July 2004 for $6.7
      million. The decrease in discontinued operations was offset by the sale of
      two
      small office buildings located in San Diego, California, aggregating 7,200
      square feet, and Eastridge Apartments, a 188-unit apartment community located
      in
      San Ramon, California, during 2005. In compliance with the provisions of SFAS
      No. 144, the results of operations of those properties are reported as a
      component of discontinued operations for 2005, 2004 and 2003.

Liquidity
      and Capital Resources

Standard
      and Poor's and Fitch ratings have existing issuer credit ratings of BBB/Stable
      for Essex Property Trust, Inc. and Essex Portfolio L.P.

At
      December 31, 2005, the Company had $14.3 million of unrestricted cash and cash
      equivalents. We believe that cash flows generated by our operations, existing
      cash balances, availability under existing lines of credit, access to capital
      markets and the ability to generate cash gains from the disposition of real
      estate are sufficient to meet all of our reasonably anticipated cash needs
      during 2006. The timing, source and amounts of cash flows provided by financing
      activities and used in investing activities are sensitive to changes in interest
      rates and other fluctuations in the capital markets environment, which can
      affect our plans for acquisitions, dispositions, development and redevelopment
      activities.

Non-revenue
      generating capital expenditures are improvements and upgrades that extend the
      useful life of the property.


For
      the
      year ended December 31, 2005, non-revenue generating capital expenditures
      totaled approximately $595 per unit. The Company expects to incur approximately
      $770 per unit in non-revenue generating capital expenditures for the year ended
      December 31, 2006. These expenditures do not include the improvements required
      in connection with the origination of mortgage loans, expenditures for deferred
      maintenance on acquisition properties, expenditures for property renovations
      and
      improvements which are expected to generate additional revenue, and renovation
      expenditures required pursuant to tax-exempt bond financings. The Company
      expects that cash from operations and/or its lines of credit will fund such
      expenditures. However, there can be no assurance that the actual expenditures
      incurred during 2006 and/or the funding thereof will not be significantly
      different than the Company’s current expectations.

The
      Company is currently developing three multifamily residential projects, with
      an
      aggregate of 505 units. Such projects involve certain risks inherent in real
      estate development. See discussion under caption “

Risks
      that development activities will be delayed or not completed and/or fail to
      achieve expected results

”
in
      Item
      1A, Risk Factors, of this Form 10-K. In connection with these development
      projects, the Company has directly, or in some cases through its joint venture
      partners entered into contractual construction related commitments with
      unrelated third parties and the total projected estimated cost for these
      projects is approximately $133.7 million. As of December 31, 2005, the remaining
      commitment to fund these development projects is approximately $96.6 million.
      The Company expects to fund such commitments by using a combination of some
      or
      all of the following sources: its working capital, amounts available on its
      lines of credit, net proceeds from public and private equity and debt issuances,
      and proceeds from the disposition of properties, if any.

Our
      redevelopment strategy strives to improve the financial and physical aspects
      of
      our redevelopment apartment communities and to target a 10 to 12 percent return
      on the incremental renovation investment. Many of the Company’s properties are
      older and in excellent neighborhoods, providing lower density with large floor
      plans that represent attractive redevelopment opportunities. As of December
      31,
      2005, we had six communities, aggregating 1,450 units in various stages of
      redevelopment. Total redevelopment cost of these projects as of December 31,
      2005 is approximately $36.8 million, of which $23.5 million remains to be
      expended.

Essex
      had
      a $185.0 million unsecured line of credit as of December 31, 2005, and $0 was
      outstanding with an average interest rate on the line of credit of approximately
      4.4%. This facility matures in April 2007, with an option for a one-year
      extension. The underlying interest rate on this line is based on a tiered rate
      structure tied to our corporate ratings and is currently LIBOR plus 1.0%. We
      also have a $100.0 million credit facility from Freddie Mac, which is secured
      by
      six of Essex's multifamily communities. As of December 31, 2005, we had $25.0
      million outstanding under this line of credit, which bears an average interest
      rate of 3.1 percent and matures in January 2009. The underlying interest rate
      on
      this line is between 55 and 59 basis points over the Freddie Mac Reference
      Rate.
      Fund II obtained a credit facility during the first quarter of 2005, aggregating
      $50.0 million, and during the second quarter of 2005 Fund II amended the credit
      facility increasing the facility to $115.0 million. This line bears interest
      at
      LIBOR plus 0.875%, and matures in June 30, 2007.

As
      of
      December 31, 2005, we had the capacity to issue up to $219.5 million in equity
      securities, and the Operating Partnership had the capacity to issue up to $250.0
      million of debt securities under our existing shelf registration
      statements.

During
      October and November 2005, the Company’s operating partnership, Essex Portfolio,
      L.P., raised $225 million from the sale of exchangeable senior notes (the
“Notes”) with a coupon of 3.625% due 2025. On or after November 1, 2020, the
      Notes will be exchangeable at the option of the holder into cash and, in certain
      circumstances at Essex’s option, shares of Company’s common stock at an initial
      exchange price of 103.25 per share subject to certain adjustments. The Notes
      will also be exchangeable prior to November 1, 2020, but only upon the
      occurrence of certain specified events. On or after November 4, 2010, the
      operating partnership may redeem all or a portion of the Notes at a redemption
      price equal to the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest (including
      additional interest, if any). Note holders may require the Operating Partnership
      to repurchase all or a portion of the Notes at a purchase price equal to the
      principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest (including additional
      interest, if any) on the Notes on November 1, 2010, November 1, 2015 and
      November 1, 2020.

With
      the
      proceeds from the sale of the Notes, the Company repurchased $25 million in
      common stock and paid down $135 million on the outstanding lines of credit.
      In
      part using proceeds from the sale of Notes, in the fourth quarter of 2005,
      the
      Company paid-off ten mortgage notes payable totaling $89 million with fixed
      rates ranging from 6.5% to 7.9%, and the Company originated two new mortgage
      notes payable totaling $35 million with fixed rates of 5.5% and
      5.6%.

As
      of
      December 31, 2005, our mortgage notes payable totaled $1.10 billion, which
      consisted of $918.2 million in fixed rate debt with interest rates varying
      from
      4.14% to 8.18% and maturity dates ranging from 2006 to 2026 and $186.7 million
      of tax-exempt variable rate demand bonds with a weighted average interest rate
      of 4.0%. The tax-exempt variable rate demand bonds have maturity dates ranging
      from 2020 to 2034, and are subject to interest rate caps.


The
      Company pays quarterly dividends from cash available for distribution. Until
      it
      is distributed, cash available for distribution is invested by the Company
      primarily in short-term investment grade securities or is used by the Company
      to
      reduce balances outstanding under its line of credit.

In
      an
      effort to hedge the cash flows associated with the forecasted issuance of debt
      expected to occur in 2007 and 2008, on February 16, 2005, Essex entered into
      a
      $50.0 million notional forward-starting swap with a commercial bank at a fixed
      rate of 4.927%, with a settlement date on or before October 1, 2007.
      Additionally, on August 18, 2005, Essex entered into a $50.0 million notional
      forward-starting swap with a commercial bank at a fixed rate of 4.869% and
      a
      settlement date on or before October 1, 2008. On February 22, 2006, the Company
      entered into additional notional forward-starting swaps. The first was for
      $25.0
      million with a commercial bank at a fixed rate of 5.082% and a settlement date
      on or before January 1, 2009. The second and third swaps are for a total of
      $100.0 million with two commercial banks at a fixed rate of 5.099% and a
      settlement date on or before January 1, 2011. These derivatives will be used
      to
      economically hedge the cash flows associated with the refinancing of debt that
      matures in 2008 and 2010, respectively

There
      can
      be no assurance that Essex will have access to the debt and equity markets
      in a
      timely fashion to meet such future funding requirements. Future working capital
      and borrowings under the lines of credit may not be available, or if available,
      may not be sufficient to meet the Company's requirements, and we may not be
      able
      to sell properties in a timely manner and under terms and conditions that we
      deem acceptable.

Alternative
      Capital Sources

The
      Essex
      Apartment Value Fund II (“Fund II”), a value added discretionary fund, is
      Essex’s investment vehicle (subject to certain exceptions) until October 31,
      2006, or when Fund II’s committed capital has been invested, whichever occurs
      first. Fund II invests in multifamily properties in the Company’s targeted West
      Coast markets with a focus on investment opportunities in the Seattle
      Metropolitan Area and the San Francisco Bay Area. Fund II announced its final
      closing on partner equity commitments on September 27, 2004. There are eight
      institutional investors including Essex with combined partner equity commitments
      of $265.9 million. Essex has committed $75.0 million, which represents a 28.2%
      interest as general partner and limited partner. Fund II expects to utilize
      leverage equal to approximately 65% of the estimated value of the underlying
      real estate. Consistent with Fund I, Essex will record revenue for its asset
      management, property management, development and redevelopment services, and
      promote distributions if Fund II’s returns exceed certain financial return
      benchmarks.

Contractual
      Obligations and Commercial Commitments

The
      following table summarizes the maturation or due dates of our contractual
      obligations and other commitments at December 31, 2005, and the effect such
      obligations could have on our liquidity and cash flow in future
      periods:


Variable
          Interest Entities

Consolidated
      Variable Interest Entities

In
      accordance FIN 46R, the Company consolidates EMC, EFC, 17 Down REIT limited
      partnerships (comprising ten properties), an office building that is subject
      to
      loans made by the Company, and the multifamily improvements owned by a third
      party in which the Company owns the land underlying these improvements and
      from
      which the Company receives fees, including land lease, subordination and
      property management fees, and a joint venture to develop a building in Los
      Angeles, California. The Company consolidated these entities because it is
      deemed the primary beneficiary under FIN 46R. The Company's total assets and
      liabilities related to these variable interest entities (VIEs), net of
      intercompany eliminations, were approximately $230.9 million and $146.7 million,
      respectively, at December 31, 2005 and $238.1 million and $155.1 million,
      respectively, at December 31, 2004.

Interest
      holders in VIEs consolidated by the Company are allocated net income equal
      to
      the cash payments made to those interest holders for services rendered or
      distributions from cash flow. The remaining results of operations are generally
      allocated to the Company.

Properties
      consolidated in accordance with FIN 46R were encumbered by third party,
      non-recourse loans totaling $141.8 million and $151.3 million as of December
      31,
      2005 and 2004, respectively.

Unconsolidated
      Variable Interest Entities

As
      of
      December 31, 2005 the Company is involved with four VIEs, of which it is not
      deemed to be the primary beneficiary. Total assets and liabilities of these
      entities as of December 31, 2005 were approximately $94.0 million and $73.7
      million, respectively. The Company does not have a significant exposure to
      loss
      resulting from its involvement with these unconsolidated VIEs.

Critical
      Accounting Policies and Estimates

The
      preparation of consolidated financial statements, in accordance with U.S.
      generally accepted accounting principles requires the Company to make estimates
      and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues
      and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities.
      We
      define critical accounting policies as those accounting policies that require
      our management to exercise their most difficult, subjective and complex
      judgments. Our critical accounting policies relate principally to the following
      key areas: (i) consolidation under applicable accounting standards of various
      entities; (ii) assessing the carrying values of our real estate properties
      and
      investments in and advances to joint ventures and affiliates; (iii) internal
      cost capitalization; (iv) and qualification as a REIT. The Company bases its
      estimates on historical experience, current market conditions, and on various
      other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.
      Actual results may differ from those estimates made by management.

The
      Company assesses each entity in which it has an investment or contractual
      relationship to determine if it may be deemed to be a VIE. If such an entity
      is
      a VIE, then the Company analyzes the expected losses and expected residual
      returns to determine who is the primary beneficiary. If the Company is the
      primary beneficiary, then the entity is consolidated. The analysis required
      to
      identify VIEs and primary beneficiaries is complex and judgmental, and the
      analysis must be applied to various types of entities and legal
      structures.

Rental
      properties are recorded at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation
      components on rental properties have been provided over estimated useful lives
      ranging from 3 to 30 years using the straight-line method. Development costs
      include acquisition, direct and indirect construction costs, interest and real
      estate taxes incurred during the construction and property stabilizations
      periods. Maintenance and repair expenses that do not add to the value or prolong
      the useful life of the property are expensed as incurred. Asset replacements
      and
      improvements are capitalized and depreciated over their estimated useful lives.

The
      Company assesses the carrying value of its real estate investments by monitoring
      investment market conditions and performance compared to budget for operating
      properties and joint ventures, and by monitoring estimated costs for properties
      under development. Local market knowledge and data is used to assess carrying
      values of properties and the market value of acquisition opportunities. Whenever
      events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a
      property held for investment may not be fully recoverable, the carrying amount
      is evaluated. If the sum of the property’s expected future cash flows
      (undiscounted and without interest charges) is less than the carrying amount
      of
      the property, then the Company will recognize an impairment loss equal to the
      excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of the property. Adverse
      changes in market conditions or poor operating results of real estate
      investments could result in impairment charges.


When
      the
      Company determines that a property is held for sale, it discontinues the
      periodic depreciation of that property. The criteria for determining when a
      property is held for sale requires judgment and has potential financial
      statement impact as depreciation would cease and an impairment loss could occur
      upon determination of held for sale status. Assets held for sale are reported
      at
      the lower of the carrying amount or estimated fair value less costs to sell.
      With respect to investments in and advances to joint ventures and affiliates,
      the Company looks to the underlying properties to assess performance and the
      recoverability of carrying amounts for those investments in a manner similar
      to
      direct investments in real estate properties. An impairment charge or investment
      valuation charge is recorded if the carrying value of the investment exceeds
      its
      fair value.

The
      Company capitalizes all direct and certain indirect costs, including interest
      and real estate taxes, incurred during development and redevelopment activities.
      Interest is capitalized on real estate assets that require a period of time
      to
      get them ready for their intended use. The amount of interest capitalized is
      based upon the average amount of accumulated development expenditures during
      the
      reporting period. Included in capitalized costs are management’s estimates of
      the direct and incremental personnel costs and indirect project costs associated
      with our development and redevelopment activities. Indirect project costs
      consist primarily of personnel costs associated with construction administration
      and development accounting, legal fees, and various office costs that clearly
      relate to projects under development.

The
      Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other
      assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual
      results may vary from those estimates and those estimates could be different
      under different assumptions or conditions.

Forward
      Looking Statements

Certain
      statements in this "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition
      and Results of Operations," and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K
      which are not historical facts may be considered forward looking statements
      within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended,
      and
      Section 21E of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, including
      statements regarding the Company's expectations, hopes, intentions, beliefs
      and
      strategies regarding the future. Forward looking statements include statements
      regarding the Company's expectations as to the timing of completion of current
      development and redevelopment projects and the stabilization dates of such
      projects, expectation as to the total projected costs and rental rates of
      development and redevelopment projects, beliefs as to the adequacy of future
      cash flows to meet operating requirements and to provide for dividend payments
      in accordance with REIT requirements, expectations as to the amount of capital
      expenditures, expectations as to the amount of non-revenue generating capital
      expenditures, future acquisitions, the Company's anticipated development
      projects in 2006, the anticipated performance of the second Essex Apartment
      Value Fund ("Fund II"), the anticipated performance of existing properties,
      anticipated results from various geographic regions and the Company’s investment
      focus in such regions, statements regarding the Company's financing activities,
      and the use of proceeds from such activities.

Such
      forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and
      other factors including, but not limited to, that the Company will fail to
      achieve its business objectives, that the actual completion of development
      projects will be subject to delays, that the stabilization dates of such
      projects will be delayed, that the total projected costs of current development
      projects will exceed expectations, that the Company's 2006 development strategy
      will change, that such development projects will not be completed, that
      development projects and acquisitions will fail to meet expectations, that
      estimates of future income from an acquired property may prove to be inaccurate,
      that future cash flows will be inadequate to meet operating requirements and/or
      will be insufficient to provide for dividend payments in accordance with REIT
      requirements, that the actual non-revenue generating capital expenditures will
      exceed the Company's current expectations, that the Company's partners in Fund
      II fail to fund capital commitments as contractually required, that there may
      be
      a downturn in the markets in which the Company's properties are located, that
      the terms of any refinancing may not be as favorable as the terms of existing
      indebtedness, as well as those risks, special considerations, and other factors
      discussed under the caption “

Potential
      Factors Affecting Future Operating Results

”
below
      and those discussed in Item 1A, Risk Factors, of this Form 10-K, and those
      risk
      factors and special considerations set forth in the Company's other filings
      with
      the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") which may cause the actual
      results, performance or achievements of the Company to be materially different
      from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by
      such forward-looking statements. All forward-looking statements are made as
      of
      today, and the Company assumes no obligation to update this
      information.


Potential
      Factors Affecting Future Operating Results

Many
      factors affect the Company’s actual financial performance and may cause the
      Company’s future results to be different from past performance or trends. These
      factors include those set forth under the caption “Risk Factors” in Item 1A. of
      this Annual Report on Form 10-K and the following:

Development
      and Redevelopment Activities

The
      Company pursues multifamily residential properties and development and
      redevelopment projects from time to time. These projects generally require
      various government and other approvals, the receipt of which cannot be assured.
      The Company's development and redevelopment activities generally entail certain
      risks, including the following:

These
      risks may reduce the funds available for distribution to the Company's
      stockholders. Further, the development and redevelopment of properties is also
      subject to the general risks associated with real estate
      investments.

Interest
      Rate Fluctuations

The
      Company monitors changes in interest rates and believes that it is well
      positioned from both a liquidity and interest rate risk perspective. However,
      current interest rates are at historic lows and potentially could increase
      rapidly to levels more in line with higher historical levels. The immediate
      effect of significant and rapid interest rate increases would result in higher
      interest expense on the Company's variable interest rate debt. The effect of
      prolonged interest rate increases could negatively impact the Company's ability
      to make acquisitions and develop properties at economic returns on investment
      and the Company's ability to refinance existing borrowings at acceptable
      rates.

Funds
      From Operations (FFO)

FFO
      is a
      financial measure that is commonly used in the REIT industry. Essex presents
      funds from operations as a supplemental performance measure. FFO is not used
      by
      Essex as, nor should it be considered to be, an alternative to net earnings
      computed under GAAP as an indicator of Essex’s operating performance or as an
      alternative to cash from operating activities computed under GAAP as an
      indicator of Essex’s ability to fund its cash needs.

FFO
      is
      not meant to represent a comprehensive system of financial reporting and does
      not present, nor does Essex intend it to present, a complete picture of its
      financial condition and operating performance. Essex believes that net earnings
      computed under GAAP remains the primary measure of performance and that FFO
      is
      only meaningful when it is used in conjunction with net earnings. Further,
      Essex
      believes that its consolidated financial statements, prepared in accordance
      with
      GAAP, provide the most meaningful picture of its financial condition and its
      operating performance.

In
      calculating FFO, Essex follows the definition for this measure published by
      the
      National Association of REITs (“NAREIT”), which is a REIT trade association.
      Essex believes that, under the NAREIT FFO definition, the two most significant
      adjustments made to net income are (i) the exclusion of historical cost
      depreciation and (ii) the exclusion of gains and losses from the sale of
      previously depreciated properties. Essex agrees that these two NAREIT
      adjustments are useful to investors for the following reasons:

(a)

historical
                cost accounting for real estate assets in accordance with GAAP assumes,
                through depreciation charges, that the value of real estate assets
                diminishes predictably over time. NAREIT stated in its White Paper
                on
                Funds from Operations “since real estate asset values have historically
                risen or fallen with market conditions, many industry investors have
                considered presentations of operating results for real estate companies
                that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient by themselves.”
                Consequently, NAREIT’s definition of FFO reflects the fact that real
                estate, as an asset class, generally appreciates over time and
                depreciation charges required by GAAP do not reflect the underlying
                economic realities.


(b)

REITs
                were created as a legal form of organization in order to encourage
                public
                ownership of real estate as an asset class through investment in
                firms
                that were in the business of long-term ownership and management of
                real
                estate. The exclusion, in NAREIT’s definition of FFO, of gains and losses
                from the sales of previously depreciated operating real estate assets
                allows investors and analysts to readily identify the operating results
                of
                the long-term assets that form the core of a REIT’s activity and assists
                in comparing those operating results between periods.

Management
      has consistently applied the NAREIT definition of FFO to all periods presented.
      However, other REITs in calculating FFO may vary from the NAREIT definition
      for
      this measure, and thus their disclosure of FFO may not be comparable to Essex’s
      calculation.

The
      following table sets forth the Company’s calculation of FFO for 2005 and 2004.

(1)

Amount
                includes the following: (i) depreciation addback from Fund II assets
                and
                minority interest, (ii) joint venture NOI, and (iii) City Heights
                land
                lease income not recognized for
                GAAP.

(2)

Assumes
                conversion of all dilutive outstanding operating partnership interests
                in
                the Operating Partnership.


The
      following table sets forth the Company’s cash flows for 2005 and
      2004.

Item
          7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

The
      Company is exposed to interest rate changes primarily as a result of its line
      of
      credit and long-term debt used to maintain liquidity and fund capital
      expenditures and expansion of the Company’s real estate investment portfolio and
      operations. The Company’s interest rate risk management objective is to limit
      the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower
      its
      overall borrowing costs. To achieve its objectives the Company borrows primarily
      at fixed rates and may enter into derivative financial instruments such as
      interest rate swaps, caps and treasury locks in order to mitigate its interest
      rate risk on a related financial instrument. The Company does not enter into
      derivative or interest rate transactions for speculative purposes.

The
      Company’s interest rate risk is monitored using a variety of techniques. The
      table below presents the principal amounts and weighted average interest rates
      by year of expected maturity to evaluate the expected cash flows. Management
      believes that the carrying amounts of its LIBOR debt approximates fair value
      as
      of December 31, 2005 because interest rates, yields and other terms for these
      instruments are consistent with yields and other terms currently available
      to
      the Company for similar instruments. Management has estimated that the fair
      value of the Company’s $1.14 billion of fixed rate mortgage notes payable and
      exchangeable bonds at December 31, 2005 is approximately $1.18 billion based
      on
      the terms of existing mortgage notes payable compared to those available in
      the
      marketplace.

(1)
      $50,000 covered by a forward-starting swap at a fixed rate of 4.927%, with
      a
      settlement date on or before October 1, 2007.

(2)
      $50,000 covered by a forward-starting swap at a fixed rate of 4.869%, with
      a
      settlement date on or before October 1, 2008. Also, effective February 2006,
      $25,000 covered by a forward-starting swap at a fixed rate of 5.082%, with
      a
      settlement date on or before January 1, 2009.

(3)
      Effective February 2006, $100,000 covered by two forward-starting swaps at
      a
      fixed rate of 5.099%, with a settlement date on or before January 1, 2011.

(4)
      $152,749 subject to interest rate caps.

The
      table
      incorporates only those exposures that exist as of December 31, 2005; it does
      not consider those exposures or positions that could arise after that date.
      As a
      result, our ultimate realized gain or loss, with respect to interest rate
      fluctuations, would depend on the exposures that arise during the period, our
      hedging strategies at the time, and interest rates.


The
      Company’s objective in using derivatives is to add stability to interest expense
      and to manage its exposure to interest rate movements or other identified
      risks.  To accomplish this objective, the Company primarily uses interest
      rate swaps as part of its cash flow hedging strategy. Interest rate swaps
      designated as cash flow hedges involve the receipt of variable-rate amounts
      in
      exchange for fixed-rate payments over the life of the agreements without
      exchange of the underlying principal amount.

      Disclosure

None.

Item
      9A. Controls and Procedures

As
      of
      December 31, 2005, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and
      with
      the participation of management, including our Chief Executive Officer and
      Chief
      Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our
      disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Rules 13a-15 of the Securities
      Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Based upon that evaluation, the Chief
      Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure
      controls and procedures are effective in timely alerting management to material
      information relating to the Company that is required to be included in our
      periodic filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

There
      were no changes in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting, that
      occurred during the quarter ended December 31, 2005, that have materially
      affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal
      control over financial reporting.

Our
      management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer,
      does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal
      controls over financial reporting will prevent all errors and all fraud. A
      control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only
      reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system
      are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that
      there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered
      relative to their costs. Because of their inherent limitations in all control
      systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all
      control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been
      detected.

Management’s
      Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

Our
      management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal
      control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the
      Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended). Our management assessed the
      effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of
      December 31, 2005. In making this assessment, our management used the
      criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
      Commission (“COSO”) in Internal Control-Integrated Framework. Our management has
      concluded that, as of December 31, 2005, our internal control over
      financial reporting was effective based on these criteria. Our independent
      registered public accounting firm, KPMG LLP, has issued an audit report on
      our
      assessment of our internal control over financial reporting, which is included
      herein.

Report
      of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

The
      Board
      of Directors

Essex
      Property Trust, Inc.:

We
      have
      audited management’s assessment, included in Management’s Report on Internal
      Control over Financial Reporting, appearing under Item 9A, that Essex Property
      Trust, Inc. maintained effective internal control over financial reporting
      as of
      December 31, 2005, based on criteria established in Internal
      Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations
      of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Essex Property Trust, Inc’s management is
      responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting
      and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial
      reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on management’s
      assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control
      over financial reporting based on our audit.

We
      conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
      Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we
      plan
      and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective
      internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material
      respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control
      over
      financial reporting, evaluating management’s assessment, testing and evaluating
      the design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing
      such
      other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe
      that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A
      company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to
      provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting
      and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance
      with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over
      financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain
      to
      the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
      reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2)
      provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to
      permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
      accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are
      being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors
      of
      the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely
      detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s
      assets that could have a material effect on the financial
      statements.

Because
      of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may
      not
      prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of
      effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
      inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance
      with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In
      our
      opinion, management’s assessment that Essex Property Trust, Inc. maintained
      effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31,
      2005, is fairly stated, in all material respects, based on criteria established
      in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
      Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Also, in our opinion, Essex
      Property Trust, Inc. maintained, in all material respects, effective internal
      control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2005, based on criteria
      established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee
      of
      Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).

We

      Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of Essex
      Property Trust, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2005 and 2004, and
      the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders’ equity, and
      cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended
      December 31, 2005 and the related financial statement schedule III, and our

Report
      of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

The
      Board
      of Directors

Essex
      Property Trust, Inc.:

We
      have
      audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Essex Property Trust,
      Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2005 and 2004, and the related
      consolidated statements of operations, stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for
      each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2005. In
      connection with our audits of the consolidated financial statements, we have
      also audited the accompanying financial statement schedule III. These
      consolidated financial statements and the accompanying financial statement
      schedule III are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our
      responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial
      statements and the accompanying financial statement schedule III based on our
      audits.

We
      conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
      Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we
      plan
      and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
      statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining,
      on a
      test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
      statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used
      and
      significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
      financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
      reasonable basis for our opinion.

In
      our
      opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly,
      in all material respects, the financial position of Essex Property Trust, Inc.
      and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2005 and 2004, and the results of their
      operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period
      ended December 31, 2005, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted
      accounting principles. Also in our opinion, the related financial statement
      schedule III, when considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial
      statements taken as a whole, presents fairly, in all material respects, the
      information set forth therein.

We
      also
      have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
      Oversight Board (United States), the effectiveness of Essex Property Trust,
      Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2005,
      based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued
      by
      the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO),
      and
      our report dated March 13, 2006, expressed an unqualified opinion on
      management’s assessment of, and the effective operation of, internal control
      over financial reporting.

(1)
      Organization

The
      accompanying consolidated financial statements present the accounts of Essex
      Property Trust, Inc. (the Company), which include the accounts of the Company
      and Essex Portfolio, L.P. (the Operating Partnership, which holds the operating
      assets of the Company). The Company was incorporated in the state of Maryland
      in
      March 1994. On June 13, 1994, the Company commenced operations with the
      completion of an initial public offering (the Offering) in which it issued
      6,275,000 shares of common stock at $19.50 per share. The net proceeds of the
      Offering of $112.1 million were used to acquire a 77.2% general partnership
      interest in the Operating Partnership.

The
      Company has a 90.4% general partner interest and the limited partners own a
      9.6%
      interest in the Operating Partnership as of December 31, 2005. The limited
      partners may convert their 2,296,973 Operating Partnership units into an
      equivalent number of shares of common stock. The Company has reserved shares
      of
      common stock for such conversions. These conversion rights may be exercised
      by
      the limited partners at any time through 2024.

On
      December 17, 2002, the Company acquired, by merger, John M. Sachs, Inc. (“Sachs
      Portfolio”) resulting in the acquisition of its real estate portfolio, which
      consisted of 20 multifamily properties, five recreational vehicle parks, two
      manufactured housing communities and two small office buildings. Total
      consideration in the transaction was $306.7 million and was structured as a
      tax-free reorganization whereby the Company: (i) issued 2,719,875 shares of
      its
      common stock valued at $136.8 million, (ii) assumed mortgages on four of the
      newly acquired properties for approximately $64.6 million with a fixed interest
      rate of 5.51%, maturing in January 2013, (iii) assumed and repaid unsecured
      liabilities in the amount of approximately $33.0 million, and (iv) paid the
      balance in cash of $72.2 million. The Company accounted for this transaction
      using the purchase method of accounting which resulted in the allocation of
      the
      purchase price to the assets and liabilities acquired based on their fair
      values. The fair value of assets and liabilities were based on management’s
      estimates. No goodwill was recognized in connection with this purchase.

As
      of
      December 31, 2005, the Company operates and has ownership interests in 126
      multifamily properties (containing 26,587 units), three recreational vehicle
      parks (containing 562 spaces), three office buildings (totaling approximately
      166,340 square feet), and one manufactured housing community (containing 157
      sites) (collectively, the “Properties”). The Properties are located in Southern
      California (Los Angeles, Ventura, Orange, San Diego, and Riverside counties),
      Northern California (the San Francisco Bay Area), the Pacific Northwest
      (Seattle, Washington, and Portland, Oregon metropolitan areas) and other areas
      (Nevada and Houston, Texas).

      Summary of Critical and Significant Accounting Policies

(a)
      Principles of Consolidation

The
      accounts of the Company, its controlled subsidiaries and its VIEs in which
      it is
      the primary beneficiary are consolidated in the accompanying financial
      statements. All significant inter-company accounts and transactions have been
      eliminated. We use the equity method to account for investments that do not
      qualify as variable interest entities and where we do not own a majority of
      the
      economic interest, but have the ability to exercise significant influence over
      the operating and financial policies of the investee. For an investee accounted
      for under the equity method, our share of net earnings or losses of the investee
      is reflected in income as earned and distributions are credited against the
      investment as received.

As
      of
      January 1, 2004, the Company adopted FASB Interpretation No. 46
“

Consolidation
      of Variable Interest Entities

”
      (revised) using the retroactive restatement approach and amounts have been
      restated for the year ended December 31, 2003. The accompanying consolidated
      financial statements for all periods present the consolidated financial position
      and results of operations of Essex Management Corporation (EMC), Essex Fidelity
      I Corporation (EFC), 17 Down REIT limited partnerships (comprising ten
      properties), an office building that is subject to loans made by the Company,
      and the multifamily improvements owned by a third party in which the Company
      owns the land underlying these improvements and from which the Company receives
      fees, including land lease, subordination and property management fees. The
      Company's total assets and liabilities related to these VIEs, net of
      intercompany eliminations, were approximately $230.9 million and $146.7 million,
      respectively, at December 31, 2005 and $238.1 million and $155.1 million,
      respectively, at December 31, 2004.

F-9

The
      Down
      REIT entities that collectively own ten multifamily properties (1,831 units)
      were investments made under arrangements whereby EMC became the general partner,
      the Operating Partnership became a special limited partner, and the other
      limited partners were granted rights of redemption for their interests. Such
      limited partners can request to be redeemed and the Company can elect to redeem
      their rights for cash or by issuing shares of its common stock on a one share
      per unit basis. Conversion values will be based on the market value of the
      Company's common stock at the time of redemption multiplied by the number of
      units stipulated under the above arrangements. The other limited partners
      receive distributions based on the Company's current dividend rate times the
      number of units held. At December 31, 2005, the maximum number of shares that
      could be issued to meet redemption of these Down REIT entities is 1,300,179.
      As
      of December 31, 2005 and 2004, the carrying value of the other limited partners'
      interests is presented at their historical cost and is classified within
      minority interests in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.

Minority
      interests include the 9.6% and 9.7% limited partner interests in the Operating
      Partnership not held by the Company at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively.
      The Company periodically adjusts the carrying value of minority interest in
      the
      Operating Partnership to reflect its share of the book value of the Operating
      Partnership. Such adjustments are recorded to stockholders’ equity as a
      reallocation of minority interest in the Operating Partnership in the
      accompanying consolidated statements of stockholders’ equity. The minority
      interest balance also includes the Operating Partnership’s cumulative redeemable
      preferred units (see Note 12).

Interest
      holders in VIEs consolidated by the Company are allocated a priority of net
      income equal to the cash payments made to those interest holders for services
      rendered or distributions from cash flow. The remaining results of operations
      are generally allocated to the Company.

Properties
      consolidated in accordance with FIN 46R were encumbered by third party,
      non-recourse loans totaling $141.8 million and $151.3 million as of December
      31,
      2005 and 2004, respectively.

As
      of
      December 31, 2005 the Company is involved with four VIEs, of which it is not
      deemed to be the primary beneficiary. Total assets and liabilities of these
      entities as of December 31, 2005 were approximately $94.0 million and $73.7
      million, respectively. The Company does not have a significant exposure to
      loss
      resulting from its involvement with these unconsolidated VIEs.

(b)
      Real Estate Rental Properties

Significant
      expenditures, which improve or extend the life of an asset and have a useful
      life of greater than one year, are capitalized. Operating real estate assets
      are
      stated at cost and consist of land, buildings and improvements, furniture,
      fixtures and equipment, and other costs incurred during their development,
      redevelopment and acquisition. Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are
      charged to expense as incurred.

The depreciable life of various categories of fixed assets are as
      follows:

In
      accordance with SFAS No. 67, “Accounting for Costs and Initial Rental Operations
      of Real Estate Projects,” the Company capitalizes pre-development costs incurred
      in pursuit of new development opportunities for which the Company currently
      believes future development is probable. Pre-development costs for which a
      future development is no longer considered probable are charged to expense.

Costs
      incurred with the development or redevelopment of real estate assets are
      capitalized if they are clearly associated with the development or redevelopment
      of rental property, or are associated with the construction or expansion of
      real
      property.

F-10

Such
      capitalized costs include land, land improvements, allocated costs of the
      Company’s project management staff, construction costs, as well as interest and
      related loan fees, property taxes and insurance. Capitalization begins when
      active development commences or when a redevelopment asset is taken
      out-of-service. Capitalization ends when the apartment home is completed and
      the
      property is available for a new residence.

In
      accordance with FASB’s Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS)
      No. 141, “Business Combinations,” the Company allocates the purchase price
      of real estate to land and building, and identifiable intangible assets, such
      as
      the value of above, below and at-market in-place leases. The values of the
      above
      and below market leases are amortized and recorded as either a decrease (in
      the
      case of above market leases) or an increase (in the case of below market leases)
      to rental revenue over the remaining term of the associated leases acquired.
      Acquired at-market leases are amortized to expense over the term the Company
      expects to retain the acquired tenant, which is generally 20
      months.

In
      accordance with SFAS 141 and its applicability to acquired in-place leases,
      we
      perform the following evaluation for properties we acquire:

(1)

estimate
                the value of the real estate “as if vacant” as of the acquisition
                date;

(2)

allocate
                that value among land and building and determine the associated asset
                life
                for each;

(3)

compute
                the value of the difference between the “as if vacant” value and the
                purchase price, which will represent the total intangible
                assets;

(4)

allocate
                the value of the above and below market leases to the intangible
                assets
                and determine the associated life of the above market/ below market
                leases;

(5)

allocate
                the remaining intangible value to the at-market in-place leases or
                customer relationships, if any, and the associated lives of these
                assets;

Whenever
      events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a
      property held for investment or held for sale may not be fully recoverable,
      the
      carrying amount will be evaluated for impairment. If the sum of the property’s
      expected future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) is less
      than the carrying amount (including intangible assets) of the property, then
      the
      Company will recognize an impairment loss equal to the excess of the carrying
      amount over the fair value of the property. Such fair value of a property is
      determined using conventional real estate valuation methods, such as discounted
      cash flow, the property’s unleveraged yield in comparison to the unleveraged
      yields and sales prices of similar properties that have been recently sold,
      and
      other third party information, if available. During the fourth quarter of 2005,
      the Company recorded an impairment loss of $1.3 million resulting from the
      write-down of a property in Houston, Texas, to reduce the property’s carrying
      value to its estimated fair value as of December 31, 2005, and the amount is
      recorded in other expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of
      operations.

In
      the
      normal course of business, the Company will receive offers for sale of its
      properties, either solicited or unsolicited. For those offers that are accepted,
      the prospective buyer will usually require a due diligence period before
      consummation of the transaction. It is not unusual for matters to arise that
      result in the withdrawal or rejection of the offer during this process. Essex
      classifies real estate as "held for sale" when all criteria under SFAS No.
      144,
      "

Accounting
      for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets

"
      (SFAS
      144) have been met. In accordance with SFAS 144, the Company presents income
      and
      gains/losses on properties sold as discontinued operations net of minority
      interests. Real estate investments accounted for under the equity method of
      accounting remain classified in continuing operations upon disposition. (See
      Note 7 for a description of the Company’s discontinued operations for 2005,
      2004, and 2003)

.

(c)
      Investments and Joint Ventures

The
      Company owns investments in joint ventures and affiliates and has significant
      influence but its ownership interest does not meet the criteria for
      consolidation in accordance with FIN 46R. Therefore, we account for our interest
      using the equity method of accounting. Under the equity method of accounting,
      the investment is carried at the cost of assets contributed or distributed,
      plus
      the Company’s equity in undistributed GAAP earnings or losses since its initial
      investment. The Company’s share of equity in income and gains on sales of real
      estate are included in other income in the accompanying consolidated statements
      of operations.

Some
      of
      these investments and/or joint ventures compensate the Company for its asset
      management services and may provide promote distributions if certain financial
      return benchmarks are achieved. Asset management fees and promote fees are
      recognized when the earnings events have occurred and there is GAAP earnings
      in
      the underlying entities. Asset management fees and promote fees are reflected
      in
      interest and other and equity income in co-investments respectively, in the
      accompanying consolidated statements of operations.

F-11

(d)
      Revenues and Gains on Sale of Real Estate

Revenues
      from tenants renting or leasing apartment units, recreational vehicle park
      spaces or manufactured housing community spaces are recorded when due from
      tenants and are recognized monthly as it is earned, which is not materially
      different than on a straight-line basis. Units or spaces are rented under
      short-term leases (generally, lease terms of 6 to 12 months) and may provide
      no
      rent for one or two months, depending on the market conditions and leasing
      practices of our competitors in each sub-market at the time the leases are
      executed.

The
      Company recognizes gains on sales of real estate when a contract is in place,
      a
      closing has taken place, the buyer’s initial and continuing investment is
      adequate to demonstrate a commitment to pay for the property and the Company
      does not have a substantial continuing involvement in the property.

(e)
      Income Taxes

Generally
      in any year in which the Company qualifies as a real estate investment trust
      (REIT) under the Internal Revenue Code (the Code), it is not subject to federal
      income tax on that portion of its income that it distributes to stockholders.
      No
      provision for federal income taxes, other than the taxable REIT subsidiaries
      discussed below has been made in the accompanying consolidated financial
      statements for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2005,
      as
      the Company believes it qualifies under the Code as a REIT and has made
      distributions during the periods in amounts to preclude us from paying federal
      income tax.

The
      Company has elected to be treated as a real estate investment trust (“REIT”) for
      federal income tax purposes, commencing with the year ended December 31, 1994.
      In order to maintain compliance with REIT tax rules, the Company utilizes
      taxable REIT subsidiaries (“TRS”) for various revenue generating or investment
      activities. The TRS’s are consolidated by the Company. The activities and tax
      related provisions, assets and liabilities are not material.

Cash
      dividends distributed for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004, and 2003
      are
      classified for tax purposes as follows:

(f)
        Notes Receivable and Interest Income

Notes
      receivable relate to real estate financing arrangements that exceed one year.
      They bear interest at a market rate based on the borrower’s credit quality and
      are recorded at face value. Interest is recognized over the life of the note.
      The Company requires collateral for the notes.

Each
      note
      is analyzed to determine if it is impaired pursuant to SFAS No. 114,
“

Accounting
      by Creditors for Impairment of a Loan”

.
      A note
      is impaired if it is probable that the Company will not collect all principal
      and interest contractually due. The impairment is measured periodically based
      on
      the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the note’s
      effective interest rate. The Company does not accrue interest when a note is
      considered impaired. All cash receipts on impaired notes are applied to reduce
      the principal amount of such notes until the principal has been recovered and,
      thereafter, are recognized as interest income.

(g)
      Interest Rate Protection, Swap, and Forward Contracts

The
      Company has from time to time used interest rate protection, swap and forward
      contracts to manage its interest rate exposure on current or identified future
      debt transactions. The Company accounts for such derivative contracts using
      SFAS
      No. 133. Under SFAS No. 133, derivative instruments are required to be included
      in the balance sheet at fair value. The changes in the fair value of the
      derivatives are accounted for depending on the use of the derivative and whether
      it has been designated and qualifies as a part of a hedging relationship.

The
      Company records all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value.  The
      accounting for changes in the fair value of derivatives depends on the intended
      use of the derivative and the resulting designation. Derivatives used to hedge
      the exposure to changes in the fair value of an asset, liability, or firm
      commitment attributable to a particular risk, such as interest rate risk, are
      considered fair value hedges. Derivatives used to hedge the exposure to
      variability in expected future cash flows, or other types of forecasted
      transactions, are considered cash flow hedges.

For
      derivatives designated as fair value hedges, changes in the fair value of the
      derivative and the hedged item related to the hedged risk are recognized in
      earnings. For derivatives designated as cash flow hedges, the effective portion
      of changes in the fair value of the derivative is initially reported in other
      comprehensive income (outside of earnings) and subsequently reclassified to
      earnings when the hedged transaction affects earnings, and the ineffective
      portion of changes in the fair value of the derivative is recognized directly
      in
      earnings. The Company assesses the effectiveness of each hedging relationship
      by
      comparing the changes in fair value or cash flows of the derivative hedging
      instrument with the changes in fair value or cash flows of the designated hedged
      item or transaction. For derivatives not designated as hedges, changes in fair
      value are recognized in earnings. All existing instruments are considered cash
      flow hedges, and the Company does not have any fair value hedges as of December
      31, 2005.

The
      Company’s objective in using derivatives is to add stability to interest expense
      and to manage its exposure to interest rate movements or other identified
      risks.  To accomplish this objective, the Company primarily uses interest
      rate swaps as part of its cash flow hedging strategy. Interest rate swaps
      designated as cash flow hedges involve the receipt of variable-rate amounts
      in
      exchange for fixed-rate payments over the life of the agreements without
      exchange of the underlying principal amount.

Amounts
      reported in accumulated other comprehensive income related to derivatives will
      be reclassified to interest expense as interest payments are made on the
      Company’s hedged debt. The Company is hedging its exposure to the variability in
      future cash flows for a portion of its forecasted transactions over a maximum
      period of 30 months as of December 31, 2005.

(h)
      Deferred Charges

Deferred
      charges are principally comprised of loan fees and related costs which are
      amortized over the terms of the related borrowing in a manner which approximates
      the effective interest method.

(i)
      Interest

The
      Company capitalized $1.1 million, $2.0 million, and $4.1 million of interest
      related to the development of real estate during 2005, 2004, and 2003,
      respectively.

(j)
      Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash

Highly
      liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less when
      purchased are classified as cash equivalents. Restricted cash relates to reserve
      requirements in connection with the Company’s mortgage debt.

(k)
      Stock-based Compensation

As
      of
      January 1, 2004, the Company adopted the fair value method of accounting for
      its
      stock-based compensation plans using the retroactive restatement method as
      provided by SFAS No. 123 (SFAS 123), "

Accounting
      for Stock-Based Compensation

."
      Under
      the fair value method, stock-based compensation cost is measured at the grant
      date based on the fair value of the award and is expensed over the vesting
      period. The fair value of stock options granted for the years ended December
      31,
      2005, 2004 and 2003 was $10.06, $8.84 and $4.18 per share, respectively, and
      was
      estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model
      with
      the following weighted average assumptions used for grants:

F-13

The
      Company has adopted an incentive program involving the issuance of Series Z
      Incentive Units and Series Z-1 Incentive Units (collectively referred to as
“Z
      Units”) of limited partnership interest in the Operating Partnership.

Vesting
      in the Z Units is based on performance criteria established in the plan. The
      criteria can be revised at the beginning of the year by the Board's Compensation
      Committee if the committee deems that the plan's criteria is unachievable for
      any given year.  The sale of Z units is contractually prohibited and cannot
      be converted into Operating Partnership units until certain conditions are
      met
      or 15 years after the inception of the plan. The estimated fair value of a
      Z
      unit is determined on the grant date and considers the company's current stock
      price, the dividends that are not paid on unvested units and marketability
      discount for the 8 to 15 years of illiquidity.  Compensation expense is
      calculated by taking annual vesting increases multiplied by the estimated fair
      value as of the grant date less its $1.00 purchase price.

(l)
      Legal costs

Legal
      costs associated with matters arising out of the normal course of our business
      are expensed as incurred. Legal costs incurred in connection with non-recurring
      litigation that is not covered by insurance are accrued when amounts are
      probable and estimable.

(m)
      Accounting Estimates and Reclassifications

The
      preparation of consolidated financial statements, in accordance with U.S.
      generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), requires the Company to make
      estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities,
      revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and
      liabilities. On an on-going basis, the Company evaluates its estimates,
      including those related to acquiring, developing and assessing the carrying
      values of its real estate properties, its investments in and advances to joint
      ventures and affiliates, its notes receivables and its qualification as a Real
      Estate Investment Trust (“REIT”). The Company bases its estimates on historical
      experience, current market conditions, and on various other assumptions that
      are
      believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may vary
      from
      those estimates and those estimates could be different under different
      assumptions or conditions.

Certain
      reclassifications have been made to prior year balances in order to conform
      to
      the current year presentation. Such reclassifications have no impact on reported
      earnings, total assets or total liabilities.

      New Accounting Pronouncements

In
      December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 153, “

Exchanges
      of Non-monetary Assets an amendment of APB No. 29

”.
      This
      Statement amends APB Opinion No. 29, “

Accounting
      for Non-monetary Transactions

”
to
      eliminate the exception for non-monetary exchanges of similar productive assets
      and replaces it with a general exception for exchanges of non-monetary assets
      that do not have commercial substance. That exception required that some
      non-monetary exchanges be recorded on a carryover basis versus this Statement,
      which requires that an entity record a non-monetary exchange at fair value
      and
      recognize any gain or loss if the transaction has commercial substance. This
      Statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2005. We
      do not believe that the adoption of SFAS No. 153 will have a material
      impact on our financial position, net earnings or cash flows.

In
      December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123 revised, “

Share-Based
      Payment”.

This
      statement is a revision of SFAS No. 123,

“Accounting
      for Stock-Based Compensation”,

and
      supersedes APB No. 25,

“Accounting
      for Stock Issued to Employees”.

The
      Statement requires companies to recognize in the income statement the grant-date
      fair value of stock options and other equity based compensation issued to
      employees. We will adopt the provisions of SFAS 123 revised effective January
      1,
      2006. The adoption of this Statement is not expected to have a material impact
      on our future results of operations.

In
      March
      2005, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation (FIN) No. 47, “

Accounting
      for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations, An Interpretation of FASB
      Statement No. 143

”.
      A
      conditional asset retirement obligation refers to a legal obligation to retire
      assets where the timing and/or method of settlement are conditioned on future
      events.

F-14

FIN
      No.
      47 requires an entity to recognize a liability for the fair value of a
      conditional asset retirement obligation when incurred if the liability’s fair
      value can be reasonably estimated. We adopted the provisions of FIN 47 in 2005.
      The adoption of this Interpretation did not have a material impact on our
      consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash
      flows.

In
      June
      2005, the FASB ratified the EITF’s consensus on Issue No. 04-5

“Determining
      Whether a General Partner, or the General Partners as a Group, Controls a
      Limited Partnership or Similar Entity When the Limited Partner Have Certain
      Rights.”

This
      consensus establishes the presumption that general partners in a limited
      partnership control that limited partnership regardless of the extent of the
      general partners’ ownership interest in the limited partnership. The consensus
      further establishes that the rights of the limited partners can overcome the
      presumption of control by the general partners, if the limited partners have
      either (a) the substantive ability to dissolve (liquidate) the limited
      partnership or otherwise remove the general partners without cause or (b)
      substantive participating rights. Whether the presumption of control is overcome
      is a matter of judgment based on the facts and circumstances, for which the
      consensus provides additional guidance. This consensus applies to limited
      partnerships or similar entities, such as limited liability companies that
      have
      governing provisions that are the functional equivalent of a limited
      partnership. This consensus is currently applicable to the Company for new
      or
      modified partnerships, and will otherwise be applicable to existing partnerships
      in 2006. We adopted the provisions of EITF 04-5 in 2005 with respect to
      agreements that were modified (Fund II), and we will adopt the provisions of
      EITF Issue

No. 04-5

in 2006
      for agreements that were not modified (Fund I). The adoption of this consensus
      did not and will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial
      position, results of operations or cash flows.

(3)
      Real Estate

(a)
      Sales of Real Estate and Assets Held for Sale

The
      Company recognizes sales of real estate when a contract has been executed,
      a
      closing has occurred, the buyer’s initial and continuing investment is adequate
      to demonstrate a commitment to pay for the property and the Company does not
      have a substantial continuing involvement in the property. Each property is
      considered a separately identifiable component of the Company and is reported
      in
      discontinued operations when the operations and cash flows of the property
      have
      been (or will be) eliminated from the ongoing operations of the Company as
      a
      result of a disposal transaction.

For
      the
      year ended December 31, 2004, the gain on the sale of The Essex at Lake Merritt
      was $12.9 million, of which $5.0 million was deferred in 2004 and recognized
      in
      2005 on the cost recovery method when the cash was received. The $5.0 million
      was deferred because of our continuing involvement with the property. The sale
      transaction was included in continuing operations as we continued to manage
      the
      rented apartment units in the project during the conversion
      process.

For
      the
      year ended December 31, 2005, the gain on the sale of The Eastridge Apartments
      was $28.0 million net of minority interest, of which $2.2 million was deferred
      as of December 31, 2005. The $2.2 million was deferred because of our continuing
      involvement with the property.

(b)
      Investments

The
      Company has investments in a number of affiliates, which are accounted for
      under
      the equity method. The affiliates own and operate multifamily rental properties.

Essex
      Apartment Value Fund, L.P. (“Fund I”), is an investment fund organized by the
      Company in 2001 to add value through rental growth and asset appreciation,
      utilizing the Company’s acquisition, development, redevelopment and asset
      management capabilities. Fund I was considered fully invested in 2003. An
      affiliate of the Company, Essex VFGP, L.P. (“VFGP”), is a 1% general partner and
      is a 20.4% limited partner. The Operating Partnership owns a 99% limited
      partnership interest in VFGP. Since its formation, Fund I acquired or developed
      ownership interests in 19 multifamily residential properties, representing
      5,406
      apartment units with an aggregate cost of approximately $618.0 million and
      a
      land parcel in Irvine, California.

In
      the
      third quarter of 2004, Fund I entered into a purchase and sale agreement with
      United Dominion Realty, L.P. (“UDR”) for a sale of sixteen apartment
      communities, totaling 4,646 units owned by Fund I and, with respect to Coronado
      at Newport North and South, both Fund I’s and the Company’s separate ownership
      interests, for a contract price of approximately $756.0 million. On October
      27,
      2004, an additional seven of the remaining nine properties, including the
      Company’s approximate 49.9% ownership interest in Coronado at Newport - North,
      were sold to UDR for a contract price of $322.0 million, of which $267.6 million
      represents Fund I’s allocated portion of the contract price based on its
      ownership interest.

F-15

The
      remaining two multifamily properties under the UDR agreement closed in 2005.
      Coronado at Newport - South, a 715-unit apartment community in Newport Beach,
      California was sold in the first quarter of 2005 for $106.0 million and River
      Terrace, a newly developed 250-unit apartment community in Santa Clara was
      sold
      in the third quarter of 2005 for $63.0 million. The remaining asset in Fund
      I,
      the Irvine, California land parcel, was sold in the fourth quarter for
      approximately $10.5 million. As of December 31, 2005, Fund I is in the process
      of liquidation and will wind-down affairs during 2006.

The
      Fund
      I dispositions in 2004, combined with the sale of its 49.9% direct ownership
      interest in Coronado at Newport North, resulted in the Company recognizing
      equity income from investments of $38.8 million. The Company’s share of the gain
      on the sale of real estate of $39.3 million was reduced by a $505 non-cash
      loss
      on the early extinguishment of debt related to the write-off of unamortized
      loan
      fees. The Company’s general partnership interest provides for “promote
      distributions” upon attainment of certain

financial return benchmarks. During 2004, the Company recognized $18.3 million
      in promote income from Fund I which is recorded in management and other fees
      from affiliates in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.
      The
      Fund I dispositions in 2005 resulted in the Company recognizing equity income
      from the gain on the sale of investments of $18.1 million, and $7.0 million
      in
      promote income.

On
      September 27, 2004 the Company announced the final closing of the Essex
      Apartment Value Fund II (“Fund II”). Fund II has eight institutional investors
      including Essex with combined equity commitments of $265.9 million. Essex has
      committed $75.0 million to Fund II, which represents a 28.2% interest as general
      partner and limited partner. Fund II expects to utilize leverage of
      approximately 65% of the estimated value of the underlying real estate. Fund
      II
      will invest in multifamily properties in the Company’s targeted West Coast
      markets with an emphasis on investment opportunities in the Seattle metropolitan
      area and the San Francisco Bay Area. Subject to certain exceptions, Fund II
      will
      be Essex’s exclusive investment vehicle until October 31, 2006, or when Fund
      II’s committed capital has been invested, whichever occurs first. Consistent
      with Fund I, Essex will be compensated for its asset management, property
      management, development and redevelopment services and may receive promote
      distributions if Fund II exceeds certain financial return benchmarks. As of
      December 31, 2005 Fund II owned eight apartment communities. There have been
      no
      sales in Fund II through December 31, 2005.

In
      August
      2005, the Company purchased 500,000 Series A Preferred shares in Multifamily
      Technology Solutions, Inc. (MTS). The Company owns less than 5% of the voting
      stock of MTS and therefore accounts for this investment on the cost method.

(A)

The
                preferred limited partnership interest is held in an entity that
                includes
                an affiliate of The Marcus & Millichap Company (“TMMC”). TMMC’s
                Chairman is also the Chairman of the
                Company.

F-16

The
      combined summarized financial information of investments in joint ventures,
      which are accounted for under the equity method, is as follows:

(c)
      Real Estate Under Development

The
      Company is developing three multifamily residential communities, with an
      aggregate of 505 units. In connection with these development projects, the
      Company has directly, or in some cases through its joint venture partners,
      entered into contractual construction related commitments with unrelated third
      parties and the total estimated cost for these projects is approximately
      $133,700. As of December 31, 2005, the Company’s remaining development
      commitment, including those held in joint ventures, is approximately $96,600.

(d)
      Depreciation

Beginning
      in 2003, the Company implemented an upgrade to its subsidiary ledger for
      accounting for fixed assets. The Company completed this system upgrade in the
      first quarter of 2004. In conjunction with this system upgrade, the Company
      determined that cumulative depreciation expense generated by consolidated or
      equity method rental properties was understated by approximately $2.1 million
      through December 31, 2003 and this amount was recorded during the quarter ended
      March 31, 2004.

(4)
      Notes Receivable and Other Receivables from Related
      Parties

Notes
      receivable and other receivables from related parties consist of the following
      as of December 31, 2005 and 2004:

F-17

Other
      related party receivables consist primarily of accrued interest income on
      related party notes receivable from loans to officers, advances, and accrued
      management fees from joint venture investees.

The
      Company’s officers and directors do not have an economic interest in these joint
      venture investees.

On
      January 2, 2006 the Compensation Committee of the Company’s Board of Directors
      voted to forgive certain loans made in 1996 by the Operating Partnership to
      the
      CEO and COO (then CFO). These loans were made to those officers to assist them
      with paying certain tax liabilities related to their ownership interest in
      the
      Operating Partnership. The loans bore interest at 8% per annum and were due
      and
      payable in 2006. The loans forgiven totaled $150 in principal and approximately
      $112 in accrued interest for the CEO, $100 in principal and approximately $75
      in
      accrued interest for the COO. The loans and accrued interest forgiven are
      recorded in general and administrative expenses in the accompanying consolidated
      statements of operations.

(5)
      Notes and Other Receivables

Notes
      and
      other receivables consist of the following as of December 31, 2005 and 2004:

Other
      receivables consist primarily of other advances and subordination fees and
      land
      lease fees for the Vista Pointe property.

      Related Party Transactions

The
      Company’s Chairman, George Marcus, is also the Chairman of TMMC, which is a real
      estate brokerage firm. During the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004, and
      2003,
      the Company paid brokerage commissions totaling $0, $350, and $854 to TMMC
      on
      the purchase and sales of real estate. The commissions are either capitalized
      as
      a cost of acquisition or are reflected as a reduction of the gain on sales
      of
      real estate in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.

Management
      and other fees from affiliates includes management, promote, development and
      redevelopment fees totaling $10,951, $23,146, and $6,027 for the years ended
      December 31, 2005, 2004, and 2003, respectively.

      Discontinued Operations

At
      June
      30, 2004, Golden Village Recreational Vehicle Park, a property located in Hemet,
      California and acquired as part of the John M. Sachs merger in December 2002,
      met the "held for sale" criteria under SFAS 144. In accordance with SFAS 144,
      assets and liabilities and the results of operations of the property were
      presented as discontinued operations in the consolidated financial statements
      for the period ended June 30, 2004. Upon reclassification as held for sale
      at
      June 30, 2004, the Company presented Golden Village at its estimated fair value
      less disposal costs which resulted in an impairment charge of approximately
      $718. Such fair value was determined using the contractual sales price pursuant
      to the contract with the buyer of the property. On July 18, 2004, the Company
      sold Golden Village for $6.7 million. No gain or loss was recognized on the
      sale.

In
      January 2005, the Company sold four non-core assets that were acquired in
      conjunction with the John M. Sachs’s merger in 2002 for $14.9 million. The four
      non-core assets were: The Riviera Recreational Vehicle Park and a Manufactured
      Home Park, located in Las Vegas, Nevada, for which the Company had previously
      entered into master lease and option agreements with an unrelated entity; and
      two small office buildings, located in San Diego California, aggregating 7,200
      square feet. The Company recorded a gain of $668 on the sale of these assets,
      net of minority interests. As of December 31, 2004 Riviera RV Resort and Riviera
      Mobile Home Park met the “held for sale” criteria under SFAS 144. In accordance
      with SFAS 144, assets and liabilities and the results of operations of the
      properties are presented as discontinued operations in the consolidated
      financial statements for all periods presented.

On
      June
      21, 2005, the Company sold Eastridge Apartments, a 188-unit apartment community
      located in San Ramon, California for a contract price of approximately $47.5
      million. The Company acquired Eastridge in 1996 for $19.2 million. In
      conjunction with the sale, the Company deferred $2.2 million of the gain on
      the
      sale of Eastridge because an affiliate of Essex originated a participating
      loan
      to the buyer in the amount of approximately $2.2 million, which allows the
      Company to financially participate in the buyer’s condominium conversion plan.
      The Company has recorded the operations and gain on sale of Eastridge Apartments
      as part of discontinued operations in the accompanying consolidated statement
      of
      operations for all periods presented.

The
      components of discontinued operations are outlined below and include the results
      of operations for the respective periods that the Company owned such assets,
      as
      described above.

      Lines of Credit

The
      Company has two outstanding lines of credit in the aggregate committed amount
      of
      $285,000. The first line, in the committed amount of $185,000, matures in April
      2007, with an option to extend it for one year thereafter. Outstanding balances
      under this line of credit bear interest at a rate, determined using a tiered
      rate structure tied to the Company’s corporate ratings, if any, and leverage
      rating, which has been priced at LIBOR plus 1.00% and LIBOR plus 1.10% during
      2005 and 2004, respectively. As of December 31, 2005 and 2004, the interest
      rate
      on the line of credit was approximately 4.82% and 3.40%, respectively. At
      December 31, 2005 the Company had $0 outstanding on this line of credit. In
      December 2003, the Company obtained a 5-year, $90,000 credit facility from
      Freddie Mac. The aggregate maximum principal amount of the facility increased
      to
      $100,000 in July 2004 and is secured by six of Essex’s multifamily communities.
      At December 31, 2005 the Company had outstanding $25,000 under this facility,
      at
      an all-in rate of 3.62% (59 basis points over Freddie Mac’s Reference Rate). The
      credit agreements contain debt covenants related to limitations on indebtedness
      and liabilities, maintenance of minimum levels of consolidated earnings before
      depreciation, interest and amortization and maintenance of minimum tangible
      net
      worth. The Company was in compliance with the line of credit covenants as of
      December 31, 2005.

      Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities

To
      hedge
      the cash flows associated with the refinancing of debt that matures in 2007
      and
      2008, on February 16, 2005, the Company entered into a $50.0 million notional
      forward-starting swap with a commercial bank at a fixed rate of 4.927%, with
      a
      settlement date on or before October 1, 2007. Additionally, on August 18, 2005,
      the Company entered into a $50.0 million notional forward-starting swap with
      a
      commercial bank at a fixed rate of 4.869% and a settlement date on or before
      October 1, 2008. The Company believes that these transactions will be effective
      in offsetting changes in future cash flows for forecasted transactions and
      qualify for hedge accounting. The increase in the fair value of these
      derivatives during 2005 was approximately $660 and is reflected in accumulated
      other comprehensive income in the Company’s consolidated financial statements.
      No hedge ineffectiveness on cash flow hedges was recognized during 2005. The
      Company did not have accumulated other comprehensive income in
      2004.

On
      February 22, 2006, the Company entered into additional notional forward-starting
      swaps. The first was for $25.0 million with a commercial bank at a fixed rate
      of
      5.082% and a settlement date on or before January 1, 2009. The second and third
      swaps are for a total of $100.0 million with two commercial banks at a fixed
      rate of $5.099% and a settlement date on or before January 1, 2011. These
      derivatives will be used to economically hedge the cash flows associated with
      the refinancing of debt that matures in 2008 and 2010,
      respectively.

      Lease Agreements

During
      the fourth quarter of 2003, the Company entered into lease and purchase option
      agreements with unrelated third parties related to its five recreational vehicle
      parks that are comprised of 1,717 spaces, and two manufactured housing
      communities that contain 607 sites. Based on the agreements, the unrelated
      third
      parties have an option to purchase the assets in approximately four years for
      approximately $41.7 million - a 5% premium to the gross book value of the
      assets. The Company received $474 as consideration for entering into the option
      agreement and a non-refundable upfront payment of $4.0 million, which was
      recorded as deferred revenue and has been amortized into income over the five
      year lease term. Under the lease agreements Essex receives fixed monthly lease
      payments and passes through all executory costs such as property taxes. In
      July
      2004, the Company sold Golden Village Recreational Vehicle Park and in January
      2005, the Company sold Riviera RV Resort and Riviera Mobile Home
      Park.

The
      Company is a lessor under a land lease associated with a property located in
      Southern California. The land lease entitles the Company to receive fixed annual
      land lease payments totaling a minimum of $477 over a thirty-four year term
      ended 2034. The Company has the option to purchase the property in 2006 or
      can
      be required to sell the land in 2006 as specified in the buyout provisions
      of
      the agreement.

The
      Company is a lessor of an office building located in Southern California. The
      tenants’ lease terms expire at various times through 2009 with average annual
      lease payments of approximately $737.

F-21

The
      future minimum non-cancelable base rent to be received under these operating
      leases for each of the years ending after December 31, 2005 are summarized
      as
      follows:

The
        carrying value of the rental properties as of December 31, 2005 and 2004
        is
        $34,957 and $33,970, respectively.

The
      Company is also a lessee of an office building located in Palo Alto next to
      the
      Company’s headquarters. The lease term expires on September 30, 2009, with
      average annual lease payments of approximately $146.

      Equity Transactions

As
      of
      December 31, 2005, the Company, either directly or through the Operating
      Partnership, has the following cumulative redeemable preferred securities
      outstanding:

Dividends
      on the securities are payable quarterly. The holders of the securities have
      limited voting rights if the required dividends are in arrears. The Series
      B and
      D preferred units represent preferred interests issued by the Operating
      Partnership and are included in minority interests in the accompanying
      consolidated balance sheets. The preferred units can be exchanged for Series
      B
      and D preferred stock of the Company under limited conditions.

On
      July
      30, 2003, in connection with the Company’s acquisition, by merger, of John M.
      Sachs, Inc. (“Sachs”) that was completed on December 17, 2002, and under the
      terms of the merger agreement, a final analysis was prepared, which indicated
      that the actual net liabilities of Sachs were less than the net liabilities
      of
      Sachs estimated to be outstanding as of the merger date.  Based on the
      final analysis and as a post-closing adjustment payment pursuant to the merger
      agreement, the Company made a final payment of approximately $1,766 in cash
      and issued an additional 35,860 shares of common stock valued at $2,170 to
      certain of the pre-merger shareholders of Sachs.

On
      September 23, 2003, the Company issued 1,000,000 shares of its Series F
      Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock (“Series F Preferred Stock”) at a fixed
      price of $24.664 per share, a discount from the $25.00 per share liquidation
      value of the shares.  The shares pay quarterly distributions at an
      annualized rate of 7.8125% per year of the liquidation value and will be
      redeemable by the Company on or after September 23, 2008. The shares were
      issued pursuant to the Company’s existing shelf registration statement. 
The Company used the net proceeds from this sale of Series F Preferred Stock
      to
      redeem all of the 9.125% Series C Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Units (the
      “Series C Preferred Units”) of Essex Portfolio, L.P., of which the Company is
      the general partner.

F-22

On
      October 6, 2003, the Company sold 1.6 million newly issued shares of common
      stock and received offering proceeds (before expenses) of $60.67 per share,
      representing a 3.25% discount to the common stock’s closing price on September
      30, 2003, the date of the underwriting agreement between the Company and the
      underwriter, pursuant to which the shares were sold.  The shares were
      issued pursuant to the Company’s existing shelf registration statement. 
The proceeds of the offering of approximately $97,072 were used for the
      acquisition of multifamily communities located in the Company’s targeted West
      Coast markets and general corporate purposes, including the repayment of debt
      and the funding of development activities.

On
      October 14, 2003, the Operating Partnership issued a notice of redemption to
      the
      holders of its 9.125% Series C Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Units. Pursuant
      to the provisions of the Amended and Restated Agreement of Limited Partnership
      of Essex Portfolio, L.P., the Company redeemed all outstanding Series C
      Preferred Units on November 24, 2003. In connection with this redemption the
      Company incurred a non-cash charge of $625 related to the write-off of the
      issuance costs.

In
      January 2004, the Operating Partnership restructured its previously issued
      $50,000, 9.30% Series D Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Units ("Series D
      Units"), and its previously issued $80,000, 7.875% Series B Cumulative
      Redeemable Preferred Units ("Series B Units"). The existing distribution rate
      of
      9.30% of the Series D Units continued until July 27, 2004 - the end of the
      non-call period. Effective July 28, 2004, the distribution rate on the Series
      D
      Units was reduced to 7.875%. The date that the Series D Units can first be
      redeemed at the Company's option was extended by six years to July 28, 2010.
      The
      date that the Series B Units can first be redeemed at the Company's option
      was
      extended from February 6, 2003 to December 31, 2009.

On
      June
      14, 2000 the Company purchased Waterford Place, a 238-unit apartment community
      located in San Jose, California for a contract price of $35,000 and an
      additional contingent payment. The amount of the contingent payment was disputed
      and submitted to binding arbitration. As a result of the arbitration, the
      Company was directed to issue an additional 109,874 units of limited partnership
      interest ("Units") in the Operating Partnership to the sellers of Waterford
      Place. On March 31, 2004, the Company completed the issuance of these Units
      to
      the sellers. In connection with this issuance, on March 31, 2004, the Company
      also redeemed for cash 55,564 Units from these sellers.

On
      September 3, 2004, the Company redeemed all of its outstanding, $55,000, 9.25%
      Series E Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Units of the Operating Partnership.
      In
      connection with this redemption the Company incurred a non-cash charge of $1,575
      related to the write-off of the issuance costs, which is classified as a
      component of minority interest in the accompanying statement of
      operations.

On
      August
      6, 2004, the Company acquired Vista Belvedere, a 76-unit apartment community
      located in the Marin County town of Tiburon, California. Essex acquired the
      multifamily community in a UPREIT structured transaction for an agreed upon
      value of approximately $17.1 million. The Company issued 73,088 limited
      operating partnership units to the prior owner.

      Net Income per Common Share

Basic
      and
      diluted income from continuing operations per share are calculated as follows
      for the years ended December 31:

Weighted
                convertible limited partnership units of 2,305,134, 2,333,935 and
                2,269,064 for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003,
                respectively, were not included in the determination of diluted EPS
                because they were anti-dilutive. The Company has the ability and
                intent to
                redeem DownREIT Limited Partnership units for cash and does not consider
                them as common stock equivalents.

Stock
                options of 22,229, 29,500, and 0 for the years ended December 31,
                2005,
                2004, and 2003, respectively, were not included in the diluted earnings
                per share calculation because the exercise price of the options were
                greater than the average market price of the common shares for the
                year
                and, therefore, were anti-dilutive.

      Stock Based Compensation Plans

The
      Essex
      Property Trust, Inc. 2004 Stock Incentive Plan provides incentives to attract
      and retain officers, directors and key employees. The Stock Incentive Plan
      provides for the grants of options to purchase a specified number of shares
      of
      common stock or grants of restricted shares of common stock. Under the Stock
      Incentive Plan, the total number of shares available for grant is approximately
      1,200,000. The Board of Directors (the Board) may adjust the aggregate number
      and type of shares reserved for issuance. Participants in the Stock Incentive
      Plans are selected by the Stock Incentive Plan Committee of the Board, which
      is
      comprised of independent directors. The Stock Incentive Plan Committee is
      authorized to establish the exercise price; however, the exercise price cannot
      be less than 100% of the fair market value of the common stock on the grant
      date. The Company’s options have a life of ten years. Option grants fully vest
      between one year and five years after the grant date. Stock-based compensation
      expense for stocks options and Z and Z-1 Units (as discussed below) under the
      fair value method for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003 was
      approximately $2.4 million, $784 and $991, respectively. A summary of the status
      of the Company’s stock option plans as of December 31, 2005, 2004, and 2003 and
      changes during the years ended on those dates is presented below:

F-24

The
        following table summarizes information about stock options outstanding as
        of
        December 31, 2005:

The
      issuance of Z Units is administered by the Company’s Compensation Committee
      which has the authority to select participants and determine the awards to
      be
      made up to a maximum of 600,000 Z Units. The conversion ratio (accounted for
      as
      vesting) of the Z Units into common units, will increase by up to 10% (up to
      20%
      in certain circumstances following their initial issuance) on January 1 of
      each year for each participating executive who remains employed by the Company
      if the Company has met a specified “funds from operations” per share target, or
      such other target as the Compensation Committee deems appropriate, for the
      prior
      year, up to a maximum conversion ratio of 100%. The Operating Partnership has
      the option to redeem Z Units held by any executive whose employment has been
      terminated with either common units of the Operating Partnership or shares
      of
      the Company’s Common Stock based on the then-effective conversion ratio.

In
      June
      2001, the Operating Partnership issued 200,000 Series Z Incentive Units of
      limited partner interest to eleven senior executives of the Company in exchange
      for a capital commitment of $1.00 per Series Z Incentive Unit, for an aggregate
      offering price of $200. The 2001 Z Unit grant had conversion ratios of 20,
      28,
      35.5 and 45.5 percent as of January 1, 2002, 2003, 2004 and 2005 respectively.

In
      June
      2004, the Operating Partnership issued 95,953 Series Z-1 Incentive Units of
      limited partner interest to fourteen senior executives of the Company in
      exchange for cash or a capital commitment of $1.00 per Series Z-1 Incentive
      Unit, for an aggregate offering price of $96.0. The 2004 Z Unit grant had a
      conversion ratio of 20 upon issuance and 30 percent as of January 1, 2004 and
      2005 respectively. In 2005 an additional 27,000 Z-1 Units were granted to two
      executives pursuant to the 2004 grant terms with a 20% conversion ratio at
      issuance.

In
      December 2005, the Operating Partnership issued 89,999 Series Z-1 Incentive
      Units of limited partner interest to fourteen senior executives of the Company
      in exchange for cash or a capital commitment of $1.00 per Series Z-1 Incentive
      Unit, for an aggregate offering price of $90. The 2005 Z-1 Unit grant had a
      conversion ratio of 20 percent as of December 31, 2005.

      Shareholder Rights Plan

On
      November 12, 1998, the Company’s Board of Directors adopted a Stockholder Rights
      Plan. A dividend of one right (a Right) per share of common stock was
      distributed to stockholders of record on November 21, 1998. Each Right, expiring
      November 11, 2008, represents a right to buy from the Company 1/100th of a
      share
      of Series A junior participating preferred stock at a price of $99.13 per Right.

Generally
      the Rights will not be exercisable unless a person or group acquires 15% or
      more, or announces an offer that could result in acquiring 15% or more, of
      the
      Company’s common stock unless such person is or becomes the beneficial owner of
      15% or more of the Company’s outstanding common stock and had a contractual
      right or the approval of the Company’s Board of Directors, provided that such
      percentage shall not be greater than 19.9%. Following an acquisition of 15%
      or
      more of the Company’s common stock, each Right holder, except the 15% or more
      shareholder, has the right to receive, upon exercise, shares of common stock
      valued at twice the then applicable exercise price of the Right, unless the
      15%
      or more shareholder has offered to acquire all of the outstanding shares of
      the
      Company under terms that a majority of the independent directors of the Company
      have determined to be fair and in the best interest of the Company and its
      shareholders.

F-25

Similarly,
      unless certain conditions are met, if the Company engages in a merger or other
      business combination following a stock acquisition where it does not survive
      or
      survives with a change or exchange of its common stock or if 50% or more of
      its
      assets, earning power or cash flow is sold or transferred, the Rights will
      become exercisable for shares of the acquirer’s stock having a value of twice
      the exercise price.

Generally,
      Rights may be redeemed for $0.01 each (in cash, common stock or other
      consideration the Company deems appropriate) until the tenth day following
      a
      public announcement that a 15% or greater position has been acquired of the
      Company’s stock.

      Segment Information

In
      accordance with FASB No. 131,

Disclosures
      about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information,

the
      Company defines its reportable operating segments as the three geographical
      regions in which its multifamily residential properties are located: Northern
      California, Southern California, and the Pacific Northwest.

Nonsegment
      revenues and net operating income included in the following schedule consist
      of
      revenue generated from the commercial properties, recreational vehicle parks,
      and manufactured housing communities. Also excluded from segment revenues are
      interest and other corporate income. Other nonsegment assets include
      investments, real estate under development, cash, notes receivables, other
      assets and deferred charges.

The
      accounting policies of the segments are the same as those described in Note
      2.
      The Company evaluates performance based upon net operating income from the
      combined properties in each segment.

F-26

The
      revenues, net operating income, and assets for each of the reportable operating
      segments are summarized as follows for the years ended and as of December 31,
      2005, 2004, and 2003:

        401(k) Plan

The
      Company has a 401(k) benefit plan (the Plan) for all full-time employees who
      have completed six months of service. Employees may contribute up to 23% of
      their compensation, limited by the maximum allowed under Section 401(k) of
      the
      Internal Revenue Code. The Company matches the employee contributions for
      nonhighly compensated personnel, up to 50% of their contribution up to a
      specified maximum. Company contributions to the Plan were approximately $189,
      $98, and $93 for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004, and 2003.

      Fair Value of Financial Instruments

Management
      believes that the carrying amounts of its variable rate mortgage notes payable,
      lines of credit, notes receivable from investees and other related parties
      and
      notes and other receivables approximate fair value as of December 31, 2005
      and
      2004, because interest rates, yields and other terms for these instruments
      are
      consistent with yields and other terms currently available to the Company for
      similar instruments. Management has estimated that the fair value of the
      Company’s $1,143,193 of fixed rate mortgage notes payable and exchangeable bonds
      at December 31, 2005 are approximately $1,184,182 based on the terms of existing
      mortgage notes payable compared to those available in the marketplace. At
      December 31, 2004, the Company’s fixed rate mortgage notes payable of $878,617
      had an approximate market value of $945,607. Management believes that the
      carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, accounts payable
      and accrued liabilities, other liabilities and dividends payable approximate
      fair value as of December 31, 2005 and 2004 due to the short-term maturity
      of
      these instruments.

      Commitments and Contingencies

At
      December 31, 2005 we had four non-cancelable ground leases for certain apartment
      communities and buildings that expire between 2027 and 2080. Land lease payments
      are typically the greater of a stated minimum or a percentage of gross rents
      generated by these apartment communities. Total lease commitments, under land
      leases and operating leases, are approximately $1,600 per year.

Company
      has a performance guarantee with a commercial bank related to the Northwest
      Gateway development.

To
      the
      extent that an environmental matter arises or is identified in the future that
      has other than a remote risk, as defined in SFAS 5, of having a material impact
      on the financial statements, the Company will disclose the estimated range
      of
      possible outcomes, and, if an outcome is probable, accrue appropriate liability
      for remediation and other potential liability. The Company will consider whether
      such occurrence results in an impairment of value on the affected property
      and,
      if so, accrue an appropriate reserve for impairment.

Except
      with respect to three Properties, the Company has no indemnification agreements
      from third parties for potential environmental clean-up costs at its Properties.
      The Company has no way of determining at this time the magnitude of any
      potential liability to which it may be subject arising out of unknown
      environmental conditions or violations with respect to the properties formerly
      owned by the Company. No assurance can be given that existing environmental
      studies with respect to any of the Properties reveal all environmental
      liabilities, that any prior owner or operator of a Property did not create
      any
      material environmental condition not known to the Company, or that a material
      environmental condition does not otherwise exist as to any one or more of the
      Properties. The Company has limited insurance coverage for the types of
      environmental liabilities described above.

The
      Company may enter into transactions that could require us to pay the tax
      liabilities of the partners in the Operating Partnership or in the Down REIT
      entities, which are within our control. Although the Company plans to hold
      the
      contributed assets or defer recognition of gain on their sale pursuant to
      like-kind exchange rules under Section 1031 of the Internal Revenue Code we
      can
      provide no assurance that we will be able to do so and if such tax liabilities
      were incurred they can expect to have a material impact on our financial
      position.

In
      April
      2004, an employee lawsuit was filed against the Company in the California
      Superior Court in the County of Alameda. In this lawsuit, two former Company
      maintenance employees seek unpaid wages, associated penalties and attorneys’
fees on behalf of a putative class of the Company’s current and former
      maintenance employees who were required to wear a pager while they were on
      call
      during evening and weekend hours. In June 2005, the Company recorded $1.5
      million for legal settlement costs. There has been no change to the settlement
      amount since the second quarter of 2005. However, litigation is subject to
      inherent uncertainties, and such amount represents management’s best estimate of
      the total cost of the litigation at this time.

F-28

Recently
      there has been an increasing number of lawsuits against owners and managers
      of
      multifamily properties alleging personal injury and property damage caused
      by
      the presence of mold in residential real estate. Some of these lawsuits have
      resulted in substantial monetary judgments or settlements. The Company has
      been
      sued for mold related matters and has settled some, but not all, of such
      matters. Insurance carriers have reacted to mold related liability awards by
      excluding mold related claims from standard policies and pricing mold
      endorsements at prohibitively high rates. The Company has, however, purchased
      pollution liability insurance, which includes coverage for mold. The Company
      has
      adopted programs designed to manage the existence of mold in its properties
      as
      well as guidelines for promptly addressing and resolving reports of mold to
      minimize any impact mold might have on residents or the property. Liabilities
      resulting from such mold related matters and the costs of carrying insurance
      to
      address potential mold related claims may also be substantial.

The
      Company is subject to various other lawsuits in the normal course of its
      business operations. Accordingly, such lawsuits, as well as the class action
      lawsuit described above, could result in substantial costs and diversion of
      resources and could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial
      condition, results of operations or cash flows.

      the
      first quarter of 2006, we sold Vista Capri East and Casa Tierra for
      approximately $7.0 million.
