Item 1. Business

Description of Business

Essex Property Trust, Inc. ("the Company" or
"Essex") is a self-administered and self-managed equity real estate
investment trust ("REIT") engaged in the ownership, acquisition,
development and management of multifamily apartment communities. The Company's
multifamily portfolio consists of ownership interests in 112 properties
(comprising 23,699 apartment units), of which 13,654 units are located in
Southern California (Los Angeles, Ventura, Orange and San Diego counties), 4,023
units are located in Northern California (the San Francisco Bay Area), 5,444 of
which are located in the Pacific Northwest (4,073 units in the Seattle
metropolitan area and 1,371 units in the Portland, Oregon metropolitan area),
and 578 are located in other areas (302 units in Houston, Texas and 276 units in
Hemet, California). In addition, the Company owns other real estate assets
consisting of five recreational vehicle parks (comprising 1,717 spaces), four
office buildings (totaling approximately 63,540 square feet) and two
manufactured housing communities (containing 607 sites), (collectively together with the
Company's multifamily residential properties, the "Properties").  One
of the office buildings located in Northern California (Palo Alto) has
approximately 17,400 square and houses the Company's headquarters and another
office building located in Southern California (Woodland Hills) has
approximately 38,940 square feet, of which the Company currently occupies
approximately 8,600 square feet. The Woodland Hills office building has ten
third-party tenants occupying approximately 27,300 feet. The Company along with
its affiliated entities and joint ventures also have entered into commitments
for the development of 1,518 units in six multifamily communities; three of
which are in Northern California and three in Southern California.


The Company was incorporated in the state of Maryland in March 1994. On June
13, 1994, the Company commenced operations with the completion of an initial
public offering ("the Offering") in which it issued 6,275,000 shares
of common stock at $19.50 per share.

The Company conducts substantially all of its activities through Essex
Portfolio, L.P. (the "Operating Partnership"). The Company currently
owns an approximate 90% general partnership interest and members of the
Company's Board of Directors, senior management and certain outside investors
own limited partnership interests of approximately 10% in the Operating
Partnership. As the sole general partner of the Operating Partnership, the
Company has control over the management of the Operating Partnership and over
each of the Properties.

The Company's website address is http://www.essexpropertytrust.com. The Company's

Business Objectives

The Company's primary business objective is to maximize funds from
operations and total returns to stockholders through active property and
portfolio management including redevelopment of properties. The Company's
strategies include:

Active Property Marketing and Management. Maximize, on a per share basis,
cash available for distribution and the capital appreciation of its property
portfolio through active property marketing and management and, if applicable,
redevelopment.

Selected Expansion of Property Portfolio. Increase, on a per share basis,
cash available for distribution through the acquisition and development of
multifamily residential properties in selected major metropolitan areas located
in the west coast region of the United States.

Optimal Portfolio Asset Allocations. Produce predictable financial
performance through a portfolio asset allocation program that seeks to increase
or decrease the investments in each market based on changes in regional economic
and local market conditions.

Management of Capital and Financial Risk. Optimize the Company's capital and
financial risk positions by maintaining a conservative leverage ratio and
minimizing the Company's cost of capital.

Business Principles

The Company was founded on, has followed, and intends to continue to
follow the business principles set forth below:

Property Management

.  Through its long-standing philosophy of active
property management and a customer satisfaction approach, coupled with a
discipline of internal cost control, the Company seeks to retain tenants,
maximize cash flow, enhance property values and compete effectively for new
tenants in the marketplace. The Company's Senior Vice President of Operations,
regional portfolio managers, and their staff are accountable for overall
property operations and performance. They supervise on-site managers, provide
training for the on-site staff, monitor fiscal performance against budgeted
expectations, monitor property performance against competing properties in the
area, prepare operating and capital budgets for executive approval, and
implement new strategies focused on enhancing tenant satisfaction, increasing
revenue, controlling expenses, and creating a more efficient operating
environment.

Business Planning and Control.

Real estate investment decisions are
accompanied by a multiple year plan, to which executives and other managers
responsible for obtaining future financial performance must agree. Performance
versus plan serves as a significant factor in determining compensation.


Property Type Focus.

The Company focuses on acquisition and
development of multifamily residential communities, containing between 75 and
750 units. These types of properties offer attractive opportunities because such
properties provide opportunities for value enhancement since many of these
properties have been owned by parties that are either inadequately capitalized
or lack the professional property management and redevelopment expertise of the
Company.

Geographic Focus.

The Company focuses its property investments in
markets that meet the following criteria:

Major Metropolitan Areas.

The Company focuses on metropolitan areas
having a regional population in excess of one million people. Real estate
markets in these areas are typically characterized by a greater number of buyers
and sellers and are, therefore, more liquid. Liquidity is an important element
for implementing the Company's strategy of varying its portfolio in response to
changing market conditions.

Supply Constraints.

The Company believes that properties located in
real estate markets with limited development opportunities are well suited to
produce increased rental income. When evaluating supply constraints, the Company
reviews: (i) availability of developable land sites on which competing
properties could be readily constructed; (ii) political barriers to growth
resulting from a restrictive local political environment regarding development
(such an environment, in addition to the restrictions on development itself, is
often associated with a lengthy development process and expensive development
fees); and (iii) physical barriers to growth, resulting from natural limitations
to development, such as mountains or waterways.

Rental Demand Created by High Cost of Housing.

The Company
concentrates on markets in which the cost of renting compares favorably to the
cost of owning a home. In such markets, rent levels tend to be higher and
operating expenses and capital expenditures, as a percentage of rent, are lower
in comparison with markets that have a lower cost of owning a home.

Job Proximity

.  The Company believes that most renters select housing
based on its proximity to their jobs and related commuting factors. The Company
obtains local area information relating to its residential properties and uses
this information when making multifamily property acquisition decisions. The
Company also reviews the location of major employers relative to its portfolio
and potential acquisition properties.

Following the above criteria, the Company is currently pursuing investment
opportunities in selected markets of Northern and Southern California and the
Pacific Northwest.

Active Portfolio Management Through Regional Economic Research and Local
Market Knowledge.

The Company was founded on the belief that the key
elements of successful real estate investment and portfolio growth include
extensive regional economic research and local market knowledge. The Company
utilizes its economic research and local market knowledge to make appropriate
portfolio allocation decisions that it believes will result in better overall
operating performance and lower portfolio risk. The Company maintains and
evaluates:

Regional Economic Data.

The Company evaluates and reviews regional
economic factors for the markets in which it owns properties and where it
considers expanding its operations. The Company's research focuses on regional
and sub-market supply and demand, economic diversity, job growth, market depth
and the comparison of rents to down payments and occupancy costs associated with
for-sale housing.

Local Market Conditions.

Local market knowledge includes (i) local
factors that influence whether a sub-market is desirable to tenants; (ii) the
extent to which the area surrounding a property is improving or deteriorating;
and (iii) local investment market dynamics, including the relationship between
the value of a property and its yield, the prospects for capital appreciation
and market depth.

Recognizing that all real estate markets are cyclical, the Company regularly
evaluates the results of regional economic and local market research and adjusts
portfolio allocations accordingly. The Company actively manages the allocation
of assets within its portfolio. The Company seeks to increase its portfolio
allocation in markets projected to have economic growth and to decrease such
allocations in markets projected to have declining economic conditions.
Likewise, the Company also seeks to increase its portfolio allocation in markets
that have attractive property valuations and to decrease such allocations in
markets that have inflated valuations and low relative yields. Although the
Company is generally a long-term investor, it does not establish defined or
preferred holding periods for its Properties.


Current Business Activities

The Company conducts substantially all of its activities through the
Operating Partnership, of which it owns an approximate 90.0% general partnership
interest. The approximate 10% limited partnership interests in the Operating
Partnership are owned by directors, officers and employees of the Company and
certain third-party investors. As the sole general partner of the Operating
Partnership, the Company has operating control over the management of the
Operating Partnership and each of the Properties. From time to time, the Company
may invest in properties through the acquisition of an interest in another
entity, based upon the criteria described above. The Company does not plan to
invest in the securities of other entities not engaged in real estate related
activities.

The Company has elected to be treated as a real estate investment trust
("REIT") for federal income tax purposes, commencing with the year
ended December 31, 1994. The Company provides some of its fee-based asset
management and disposition services as well as third-party property management
and leasing services through Essex Management Corporation ("EMC"), in
order to maintain compliance with REIT tax rules. The Company owns 100% of EMC's
19,000 shares of nonvoting preferred stock. Executives of the Company own 100%
of EMC's 1,000 shares of common stock.

Essex Apartment Value Fund, L.P. (the "Fund"), is an investment
fund organized by the Company in 2001.  The Fund will be, subject to specific
exceptions, the Company's exclusive investment vehicle for new investments until
the Fund's committed capital has been invested or committed for investments, or
if earlier, December 31, 2003. An affiliate of the Company, Essex VFGP, L.P.
("VFGP"), is a  1% general partner and is a 20.4% limited partner. The
Operating Partnership owns a 99% limited partnership interest in VFGP. The Fund
has total capital commitments of $250 million and is expected to utilize
leverage of approximately 65% of the value of the underlying real estate
portfolio. The Company is committed to invest 21.4% of the aggregate capital
committed to the Fund. In addition, the Company will be compensated by the Fund
for its asset management, property management, development and redevelopment
services and may receive incentive payments if the Fund exceeds certain
financial return benchmarks.  At December 31, 2002, the Fund has approximately
$400 million of investment capacity based on utilizing leverage of 65%.

Since its formation, the Fund has acquired ten multifamily residential
properties, representing 2,323 apartment units with an aggregate purchase price
of approximately $244 million, excluding redevelopment expenses, and disposed of
one multifamily residential property, consisting of 500 apartment units at a
gross sales price of approximately $69.0 million resulting in a net realized
gain of approximately $5.7 million. In addition, three development land parcels,
where approximately 612 apartment units are planned for construction, have been
purchased by the Fund with a total estimated cost for the projects of
approximately $122.3 million. As of December 31, 2002, the remaining commitments
to fund these development projects is approximately $85.6 million of which
approximately $18.3 million is the Company's commitment.

2002 is set forth below:

management, development and redevelopment services with respect to the Fund's

the Fund.

Acquisitions

On September 5, 2002, the Company purchased Wilshire Court, a 21-unit
apartment community located in Fullerton, California for a contract price of
$3.3 million. The property is adjacent to Wilshire Promenade, a 132-unit
property that the Company has owned since 1997. This newly acquired asset is not
encumbered by any mortgage.

On September 26, 2002, the Company purchased Marbrisa Apartments, a 202-unit
apartment community located in Long Beach, California for a contract price of
$23.5 million. The property was purchased in a tax deferred exchange transaction
on an all cash basis and was funded, in part, with the net sale proceeds from
the June 2002 sale of Tara Village, a 168-unit apartment community located in
Tarzana, California. This newly acquired asset is not encumbered by any
mortgage.

Other Acquisition Related Activities

On December 17, 2002, the Company acquired, by merger, John M. Sachs,
Inc. resulting in the acquisition of its real estate portfolio which consists of
18 apartment communities comprising 2,683 units located in San Diego County,
California, a 302-unit apartment community located in Houston, Texas, a 276-unit
apartment community located in Hemet, California, five recreational vehicle
parks comprising 1,717 spaces, 1,581 spaces of which are located in either San
Diego or Riverside County, California and 136 spaces of which are located in Las
Vegas, Nevada, two manufactured housing communities comprising 607 sites, 450
sites of which are located in Las Vegas, Nevada and 157 sites of which are
located in San Diego County, California and two small office buildings
comprising approximately 7,200 square feet located in San Diego, California.

The merger was structured as a tax-free reorganization with real estate
assets valued at approximately $301 million.  Consideration provided in the
merger was in the form of a common stock issuance, assumption of liabilities and
cash, as follows:

Issued 2,719,875 shares of Essex common stock.

Assumed mortgages on four of the newly acquired properties for approximately
$64.6 million with a fixed interest rate of 5.51% maturing in January 2013.

Assumed and repaid liabilities in the amount of approximately $33
million.

The balance was paid in cash.

Dispositions

On April 17, 2002, the AEW co-investment in which the Company is a 20
percent partner, sold two of its four assets.  Riverfront Apartments, a 229-unit
apartment community in San Diego, California and Casa Mango Apartments, a 96-
unit apartment community in Del Mar, California were sold to an unrelated third
party.  The combined sales price was approximately $52 million.  The buyer of
these two properties assumed two non-recourse mortgages in the cumulative amount
of approximately $26.5 million, with a 6.5% fixed interest rate, which matures
in February 2009.  The Company's equity in income from the gain on the sale of
real estate is $2 million and is presented as interest and other income in the
accompanying consolidated statement of operations.  The Company contributed the
assets to the joint venture in December 1999 at a value of approximately $41
million.  In addition, the Company earned a fee in connection with the sale of
these assets in the amount of $1.1 million and this fee is presented as interest
and other income in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations. In
the third quarter of 2002, the Company recognized an incentive fee it earned
related specifically to these two asset sales in the amount of $475,000.


On June 18, 2002, the Company sold Tara Village, a 168-unit apartment
community located in Tarzana, California to an unrelated third party for a
contract price of $20 million.  The Company acquired the property in January
1997 for $10.3 million.  The Company realized a gain on the sale of real estate
of $8.1 million, net of minority interest of $990,000.  This property was not
encumbered by any mortgage.  The Company utilized Internal Revenue Code Section
1031 to defer the taxable gain on the sale of this property with its September
26, 2002 acquisition of Marbrisa Apartments as discussed above.

On July 2, 2002, the Company through its taxable REIT subsidiary, Essex
Fidelity I Corporation (EFC), sold Moanalua Hillside Apartments, a 700-unit
apartment community in Honolulu, Hawaii to an unrelated third party for a
contract price of $44.1 million. In conjunction with this sale, the Company
originated a $40 million non-recourse mortgage on the property with a fixed
interest rate of 8.75%, maturing in July 2004. The Company received a $600,000
loan fee, a $450,000 consulting fee, and $1.6 million in prepaid interest in
connection with the transaction. EFC purchased the asset on June 29, 2001 for a
contract price of $42.2 million. On October 1, 2002, the Company received full
payment of the $40 million non-recourse mortgage and recognized in the fourth
quarter of 2002 approximately $1.1 million of miscellaneous non-recurring
income, which is net of accrued expenses.

Development

Development communities are defined by the Company as new apartment
properties that are being constructed or are newly constructed and in a phase of
lease-up and have not yet reached stabilized operations (defined as 95% physical
occupancy). As of December 31, 2002, the Company (including the Fund's
development communities) had ownership interests in six development communities,
with an aggregate of 1,518 multifamily units. During 2002, the Fund announced
one new development community, River Terrace, a 250-unit luxury apartment
community located in Santa Clara, California. During 2002, the Company began
lease-up at two development communities, The Essex on Lake Merritt, a 270-unit
high-rise luxury apartment community located in Oakland, California and The San
Marcos, a 312-unit apartment community located in Richmond, California. The
Essex on Lake Merritt achieved stabilized operations during the first quarter of
2003, and the Company expects that The San Marcos is projected to reach
stabilized operations during the third quarter of 2003.

On November 19, 2002, the Company sold a portion of the land for the second
phase of The San Marcos development to a third-party single-family home
developer for approximately $2.5 million at no gain or loss.  The Company had
originally considered building an additional 192 units on this parcel.   With
this sale, the number of units that the Company expects to build in the second
phase has been reduced to 120 units.

In connection with the properties currently under development, the Company
has directly, or in some cases through its joint venture entities, entered into
contractual construction related commitments with unrelated third parties. As of
December 31, 2002, the Company and its partners are committed to fund
approximately $118.5 million, of which approximately $51.2 million is the
Company's commitment.

______

(1) Estimated project cost as of December 31, 2002 includes total estimated
and incurred costs for the development projects.

(2) The Company is the sole owner of these development
projects.

(3) The Company has a 75% controlling interest in this
development project.

(4) This land is expected to be developed into phase II
of The San Marcos.

(5) The Company has a 21.4% interest in the Fund, which owns
these properties.

The Company is entitled to receive development fee income
on the joint venture development communities. The portion of the fees associated
with our ownership percentage is eliminated.

The Company intends to continue to pursue the development of multifamily
communities to the extent that the market conditions and the specific project
terms are considered favorable.

Redevelopment

Redevelopment communities are defined by the Company as existing
properties owned or recently acquired which have been targeted for additional
investment by the Company with the expectation of increased financial returns.
Redevelopment communities typically have apartment units that are under
construction and, as a result, may have less than stabilized operations. As of
December 31, 2002, the Company has no communities in redevelopment.

During 2002 the Company completed three redevelopment projects, which
comprised 380 units and had total project costs of approximately $10.1 million.

Debt Transactions

On May 15, 2002, the Company renewed and expanded its existing $120
million unsecured revolving credit facility.  The renewed facility was increased
to $165 million and carries an interest rate, based on a tiered rate structure,
which currently is equal to LIBOR plus 1.10%, representing a 0.05% reduction
from the previous facility.  The credit line has a two-year term with a one-year
extension option.  The credit agreements contain debt convenants related to
limitations on indebtedness and liabilities, maintenance of minimum levels of consolidated
earnings before depreciation, interest and amortization and maintenance of
minimum tangible net worth.

On June 5, 2002, the Company refinanced the construction loan that was in
place on Tierra Vista, a 404-unit apartment community, located in Oxnard,
California.  The construction loan amount at the time of payoff was
approximately $35.8 million and had a variable interest rate at LIBOR plus
1.795%. The new loan is a non-recourse mortgage in the amount of $38 million,
with a 5.93% fixed interest rate, which matures in June 2007. This asset and
mortgage are owned by the AEW co-investment in which the Company is a 20 percent
partner.


On July 17, 2002, an equity method investment of the Company refinanced the
loan in place on Capri at Sunny Hills, a 100-unit apartment community located in
Fullerton, California. The $8 million loan at the time of payoff had a variable
interest rate at the bank's reference rate plus 0.8%. The new loan is a non-
recourse mortgage in the amount of $12.5 million, with a 5.37% fixed interest
rate, which matures in August 2007. This asset and mortgage are owned by two
partnerships in which Essex Management Corporation, an unconsolidated preferred
stock subsidiary of the Company ("EMC"), is a 1% general partner and
the Operating Partnership holds a 1% special limited partnership interest.

On August 30, 2002, the Company paid off the then outstanding balance under
its $30 million unsecured revolving credit facility.  The line of credit at the
time of payoff had an interest rate based on a tiered rate structure at LIBOR
plus 1.175%.  On December 13, 2002, the Company renewed this facility.  The
interest rate on the renewed credit facility is based on a tiered rate structure
and is currently at LIBOR plus 1.10%.  This facility matures on December 12,
2003.

On November 14, 2002, the Company refinanced the variable rate loan that was
in place on Coronado at Newport-North and South, a 732-unit and 715-unit
apartment community, respectively, located in Newport Beach, California.  The
variable rate loans' cumulative balance at the time of payoff was
approximately $71.7 million and had a variable interest rate at LIBOR plus
2.25%. The new loans are non-recourse mortgages in the cumulative amount of
$106.9 million, with a 5.30% fixed interest rate, which mature in December
2012. This asset and mortgage are owned by the Lend Lease co-investment in which
the Company is a 49.9% partner.

On December 11, 2002, the Company obtained a commitment for a $30.0 million
of long-term variable rate indebtedness bearing interest at a floating rate tied
to the rate of short-term tax exempt revenue bond and a commitment for a $3.9
million variable rate loan at LIBOR plus 1.18%, maturing in December 2026 in
connection with Hidden-Valley Parker Ranch Apartments, a 324-unit apartment
community under development, in Simi Valley, California.  The Company has a 75%
controlling ownership interest in this development.  As of December 31, 2002,
the Company has an outstanding liability in the approximate amount of $600,000
on this indebtedness.

On December 17, 2002, the Company obtained four non-recourse mortgages
totaling $62 million on four previously unencumbered properties, with a weighted
average interest rate of 5.64%, maturing in January 2013. The proceeds from
these mortgages were used to fund the acquisition of the real estate portfolio
of John M. Sachs, Inc. as discussed earlier.

On December 27, 2002, an equity method investment of the Company obtained a
second non-recourse mortgage on Highridge Apartments, a 255-unit apartment
community located in Rancho Palos Verdes, California.  This new loan in the
amount of $8.1 million has a 4.25% fixed interest rate and matures in June 2007
concurrent with the existing first non-recourse mortgage on the property.
Highridge Apartments is owned by five partnerships in which Essex Management
Corporation, an unconsolidated preferred stock subsidiary of the Company
("EMC"), is a 1% general partner and the Operating Partnership holds a
1% special limited partnership interest.

On December 27, 2002, the Company repaid a non-recourse mortgage that matured
in the amount of $8.3 million, with an interest rate of 8.78%.

On January 15, 2003, the Company repaid a non-recourse mortgage that matured
in the amount of $18.8 million, with an interest rate of 7.6%.

Equity Transactions

In connection with the Company's 1994 initial public offering, the
Company provided a one-time grant of options to Marcus & Millichap
("MM") to purchase 220,000 shares of common stock at the initial
public offering price of $19.50 per share pursuant to an agreement whereby
Marcus & Millichap Real Estate Investment Brokerage Company, a subsidiary of
MM, provides real estate transaction, trend and other information to the Company
for a period of ten years. In February 2002, MM exercised and sold the shares
underlying this one-time grant. This option was exercised in a
"cashless" transaction, whereby MM was issued 129,302 shares of
Company common stock based on the current market price of the Company's common
stock of $47.30 at the time of exercise.

In May 2001, the Company's Board of Directors authorized the Operating
Partnership to purchase from time to time shares of the Company's Common Stock,
in an amount up to $50 million, at a price not to exceed $48.00 per share in the
open market or through negotiated or block transactions. The timing of any
repurchase will depend on the market price and other market conditions and
factors.  Essex expects to use working capital or proceeds from the sale of
properties to provide funds for this program.  The purpose of the program is to
acquire stock related to real estate transactions involving the issuance of
partnership units in the Operating Partnership and similar interests. This
program supersedes its common stock repurchase plan as announced on March 25,
1999.  In October 2001, March 2002 and July 2002 the Operating Partnership
acquired 100,700, 10,500 and 400,000 shares of the Company's outstanding Common
Stock, respectively. The weighted average exercise price paid for these
repurchase was approximately $48.00 per share.  Pursuant to these acquisitions,
since May 2001 and through December 2002, the Operating Partnership has
purchased approximately $24.5 million of the $50 million aggregate amount
authorized for repurchase by the Board of Directors. The amount paid for the
shares is reflected as a reduction of the common stock and additional-paid-in-
capital in the Company's consolidated balance sheets.


Notes and Other Receivables

In July 2000 the Company acquired the Kelvin Avenue development
parcel in Irvine, California. As a condition to the acquisition, an affiliate of
the Company acquired a vacant 110,000 square foot office building located
adjacent to the development site for a contract price of $14.6 million. In
August 2000 the Company's affiliate sold the office building to a third party
local developer for $15 million. The Company loaned the buyer $15 million as a
secured first mortgage on the property at 9.3% per annum. In addition, after the
buyer expended $500,000 for items such as tenant improvements, leasing
commissions, and carry costs, the Company would lend an additional $4.5 million
to the buyer for these related items. This mezzanine loan accrues interest at
15.0% and has participation features. The loan matured in May 2002, at which
time it was restructured to mature in March 2003. The current balance of the
mezzanine loan is approximately $3.8 million, of which $1.7 million is
guaranteed by the principal shareholder. The Company has evaluated the
realization potential of the first and mezzanine loan and effective June 2002,
ceased accruing interest income on these notes until it is clearer as to the cash
flow that the office building will generate upon lease up.

Private Equity Fund

Acquisition Activities of the Fund

During 2002, the Essex Apartment Value Fund, L.P. (the "Fund")
purchased three multifamily properties consisting of 446 units with an aggregate
purchase price of approximately $59.4 million. These investments were primarily
funded by the contribution of equity from joint venture partners, cash generated
from operations, proceeds from the dispositions of properties or proceeds from
the Fund's line of credit. All of these properties are located in Southern
California.

Multifamily properties acquired in 2002 are as follows:

                                                        ========  ===============

In addition, the Fund acquired a parcel of land in Santa Clara, California
for a purchase price of approximately $15.0 million.  The Fund plans to develop
River Terrace, a 250-unit luxury apartment community on the site.  In connection
with this transaction, the Fund obtained a $10.5 million fixed rate non-recourse
secured mortgage from the seller, bearing interest at 8% and maturing in January
2004.


Disposition Activities of the Fund

On May 9, 2002, the Fund sold Marbrisas Apartments, a 500-unit apartment
community located in Chula Vista, California, to an unrelated third party for an
approximate contract price of $69.0 million.  In connection with this
transaction, the buyer assumed a non-recourse secured mortgage of approximately
$40.0 million with a 7.988% fixed interest rate, which matures in July 2005.
The Fund purchased the property in August 2001 for $62.0 million and the net
proceeds from the sale were distributed to the Fund investors.  The Company's
equity in income from the gain on the sale of the real estate is $1.1 million
and is presented as interest and other income in the accompanying consolidated
statement of operations. In addition, at the inception of the Fund the Company
incurred approximately $7.2 million in placement fees and professional fees
related to the syndication of the Fund.  The Company will write off a portion of
these costs upon the sale of Fund assets as a reduction to its equity in income
from the Fund's gain on the sale of real estate.  On the sale of Marbrisas
Apartments, the Company wrote off approximately $900,000 of these costs. The
Company is eligible to receive incentive payments to the extent the Fund exceeds
certain financial return benchmarks, including a 10% compounded annual return on
the limited partners' total capital contributions.  The Company has not received
any incentive payments to date.

Debt Transactions of the Fund

In June 2002, the Fund amended and restated its existing $75 million
secured revolving subscription facility. The renewed facility was increased to
$125 million and bears interest at LIBOR plus 0.875%.  As of December 31, 2002,
the line had an outstanding balance of $86.4 million, with an interest rate of
approximately 2.4%. The credit line matures in December 2003.

Development Communities of the Fund

During 2002, the Fund announced one new development community located in
Santa Clara, California. At December 31, 2002 the Fund had three development
communities with an aggregate of 612 multifamily units and an estimated total
cost of $122.3 million of which $85.6 million remains to be expended and
approximately $18.3 million is expected to be funded by the Company.

Offices and Employees

The Company is headquartered in Palo Alto, California, and has
regional offices in Seattle, Washington, Portland, Oregon, Woodland Hills,
California and Tustin, California. As of December 31, 2002, the Company had
approximately 733 employees.

Environmental Matters

Under various federal, state and local laws, ordinances and
regulations, an owner or operator of real estate is liable for the costs of
removal or remediation of certain hazardous or toxic substances on, in or
migrating from such property. Such laws often impose liability without regard as
to whether the owner or operator knew of, or was responsible for, the presence
of such hazardous or toxic substances. The presence of such substances, or the
failure to properly remediate such substances, may adversely affect the owner's
or operator's ability to sell or rent such property or to borrow using such
property as collateral. Persons who arrange for the disposal or treatment of
hazardous or toxic substances or wastes also may be liable for the costs of
removal or remediation of such substances at the disposal or treatment facility
to which such substances or wastes were sent, whether or not such facility is
owned or operated by such person. In addition, certain environmental laws impose
liability for release of asbestos-containing materials ("ACMs"), into
the air, and third parties may seek recovery from owners or operators of real
properties for personal injury associated with ACMs. In connection with the
ownership (direct or indirect), operation, management and development of real
properties, the Company could be considered an owner or operator of such
properties or as having arranged for the disposal or treatment of hazardous or
toxic substances and, therefore, may be potentially liable for removal or
remediation costs, as well as certain other costs, including governmental fines
and costs related to injuries of persons and property.

Recently there has been an increasing number of lawsuits against owners and
managers of multifamily properties other than Essex alleging personal injury and
property damage caused by the presence of mold in residential real estate. Some
of these lawsuits have resulted in substantial monetary judgments or
settlements. Although Essex has not been sued for mold related matters, it has
received claim letters for such matters. Insurance carriers have reacted to mold
related liability awards by excluding mold related claims from standard policies
and pricing mold endorsements at prohibitively high rates. We have adopted
programs designed to manage the existence of mold in our properties as well as
guidelines for promptly addressing and resolving reports of mold to minimize any
impact mold might have on residents or the property.


All of the Properties have been subjected to preliminary environmental
assessments, including a review of historical and public data ("Phase I
assessments"), by independent environmental consultants. Phase I
assessments generally consist of an investigation of environmental conditions at
the Property, including a preliminary investigation of the site, an
identification of publicly known conditions occurring at properties in the
vicinity of the site, an investigation as to the presence of polychlorinated
biphenyl's ("PCBs"), ACMs and above-ground and underground storage
tanks presently or formerly at the sites, and preparation and issuance of
written reports. As a result of information collected in the Phase I
assessments, certain of the Properties were subjected to additional
environmental investigations, including, in a few cases, soil sampling or ground
water analysis to further evaluate the environmental conditions of those
Properties.

The environmental studies revealed the presence of groundwater contamination
on certain of the Properties. Certain of these Properties had contamination
which was reported to have migrated on-site from adjacent industrial
manufacturing operations, and one Property was previously occupied by an
industrial user that was identified as the source of contamination. The
environmental studies noted that certain of the Properties are located adjacent
to and possibly downgradient from sites with known groundwater contamination,
the lateral limits of which may extend onto such Properties. The environmental
studies also noted that contamination existed at certain Properties because of
the former presence of underground fuel storage tanks that have been removed.
There are asbestos-containing material in a number of the properties, primarily
in the form of ceiling texture, floor tiles and adhesives, which are generally
in good condition. At properties where radon, hydrogen sulfide or methane has
been identified as a potential concern, the Company has implemented remediating
measures and/or additional testing. Based on its current knowledge, the Company
does not believe that future liabilities associated with asbestos, radon,
hydrogen sulfide or methane will be material. Based on the information contained
in the environmental studies, the Company believes that the costs, if any, it
might bear as a result of environmental contamination or other conditions at
these Properties would not have a material adverse effect on the Company's
financial condition, result of operations, or liquidity.

Certain Properties that have been sold by the Company were identified as
having potential groundwater contamination. While the Company does not
anticipate any losses or costs related to groundwater contamination on
Properties that have been sold, it is possible that such losses or costs may
materialize in the future.

Except with respect to three Properties, the Company has no indemnification
agreements from third parties for potential environmental clean-up costs at its
Properties. The Company has no way of determining at this time the magnitude of
any potential liability to which it may be subject arising out of unknown
environmental conditions or violations with respect to the properties formerly
owned by the Company. No assurance can be given that existing environmental
studies with respect to any of the Properties reveal all environmental
liabilities, that any prior owner or operator of a Property did not create any
material environmental condition not known to the Company, or that a material
environmental condition does not otherwise exist as to any one or more of the
Properties. The Company has limited insurance coverage for the types of
environmental liabilities described above.

Insurance

The Company carries comprehensive liability, fire, extended coverage
and rental loss insurance for each of the Properties. There are, however,
certain types of extraordinary losses for which the Company does not have
insurance. Substantially all of the Properties are located in areas that are subject to
earthquake activity. The Company has obtained earthquake insurance for all the
Properties. Most of the Properties are included in an earthquake insurance
program that is subject to an aggregate limit of $40.0 million payable upon a
covered loss in excess of a $7.5 million self-insured retention amount and a 5%
deductible. In the future, the Company may selectively exclude properties from
being covered by earthquake insurance based on management's evaluation of the
following factors: (i) the availability of coverage on terms acceptable to the
Company, (ii) the location of the property and the amount of seismic activity
affecting that region, and, (iii) the age of the property and building codes in
effect at the time of construction. Despite earthquake coverage on most of the
Company's Properties, should a property sustain damage as a result of an
earthquake, the Company may incur losses due to deductibles, co-payments and
losses in excess of applicable insurance, if any.

Although the Company carries certain insurance for non-earthquake damages to
its properties and liability insurance, the Company may still incur losses due
to uninsured risks, deductibles, co-payments or losses in excess of applicable
insurance coverage.


Competition

The Company's Properties compete for tenants with similar properties
primarily on the basis of location, rent charged, services provided, and the
design and condition of the improvements. Competition for tenants from competing
properties affects the amount of rent charged as well as rental growth rates,
vacancy rates, deposit amounts, and the services and features provided at each
property. While economic conditions are generally stable in the Company's target
markets, a prolonged economic downturn could have a material adverse effect on
the Company's financial position, results of operations or liquidity.

The Company also experiences competition when attempting to acquire
properties that meet its investment criteria. Such competing buyers include
domestic and foreign financial institutions, other REITs, life insurance
companies, pension funds, trust funds, partnerships and individual investors.

Working Capital

The Company expects to meet its short-term liquidity requirements by
using its working capital, cash generated from operations, and its amounts
available on its lines of credit. The Company believes that its future net cash
flows will be adequate to meet operating requirements and to provide for payment
of dividends by the Company in accordance with REIT qualification requirements.
The Company has credit facilities in the committed amount of approximately
$195,000,000. At December 31, 2002 the Company had an outstanding balance of
$126,500,000 under these facilities.

Risk Factors

Our operations involve various risks that could have adverse consequences
to us. These risks include, among others, the following:

Debt Financing

At December 31, 2002, we had approximately $804,063,000 of
indebtedness (including $185,920,000 of variable rate indebtedness, of which
$59,420,000 is capped at interest rates ranging from 7.1% to 7.3%).

We are subject to the risks normally associated with debt financing,
including the following:

cash flow may not be sufficient to meet required payments
of principal and interest;

inability to refinance existing indebtedness on
encumbered properties; and

the terms of any refinancing may not be as favorable as
the terms of existing indebtedness.

Uncertainty of Ability to Refinance Balloon Payments

At December 31, 2002, we had an aggregate of approximately
$804,063,000 of mortgage debt and line of credit borrowings, some of which are
subject to balloon payments of principal. We do not expect to have sufficient
cash flows from operations to make all of such balloon payments when due under
these mortgages and the line of credit borrowings.

At December 31, 2002, these mortgages and lines of credit borrowings had the
following scheduled maturity dates:

2003--$55.6 million (includes lines of credit balance of $30 million as of
December 31, 2002);

2004--$104.6 million (includes lines of credit balance of $96.5 million as of
December 31, 2002);

2005--$41.1 million;

2006--$20.5 million;

2007--$63.2 million;

2008 and thereafter--$519.1 million.


We may not be able to refinance such mortgage indebtedness or lines of
credit. The properties subject to these mortgages could be foreclosed upon or
otherwise transferred to the mortgagee. This could mean a loss to us of income
and asset value. Alternatively, we may be required to refinance the debt at
higher interest rates. If we are unable to make such payments when due, a
mortgage lender could foreclose on the property securing the mortgage, which
could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of
operations.

Economic Environment and Impact on Operating Results

Both the national economy and the economies of the western states in
which we own, manage and develop properties, some of which are concentrated in
high-tech sectors, have been and continue to be in a recession. The impact of
such recession on operating results can include, and are not limited to,
reduction in rental rates, occupancy levels, property valuations and increases
in operating costs such as advertising, turnover and repair and maintenance
expense.

Our property type and diverse geographic locations provide some degree of
risk moderation but we are not immune to a prolonged down cycle in the real
estate markets in which we operate. Although we believe we are well positioned
to meet the challenges ahead, it is possible that further reductions in
occupancy and market rental rates will result in reduction of rental revenues,
operating income, cash flows, and the market value of our shares. Prolonged
recession could also affect our ability to obtain financing at acceptable rates
on interest and to access funds from the disposition of properties at acceptable
prices.

Risk of Rising Interest Rates

At December 31, 2002, we had approximately $59,420,000 of long-term
variable rate indebtedness bearing interest at a floating rate tied to the rate
of short-term tax-exempt revenue bonds (which matures at various dates from 2020
through 2026), and $126,500,000 of variable rate indebtedness under our lines of
credit bearing interest at 1.10% over LIBOR. The long-term variable rate
indebtedness of approximately $59,420,000 is subject to an interest rate
protection agreement, which may reduce the risks associated with fluctuations in
interest rates. The remaining $126,500,000 of long-term variable rate
indebtedness is not subject to any interest rate protection agreement, and
consequently, an increase in interest rates may have an adverse effect on net
income and results of operations of Essex.

Current interest rates are at historic lows and potentially could increase
rapidly to levels more in line with recent historic levels. The immediate effect
of significant and rapid interest rate increases would result in higher interest
expense in our variable rate indebtedness. The effect of prolonged interest rate
increases could negatively impact our ability to make acquisitions and develop
properties at economic returns on investment and our ability to refinance
existing borrowings at acceptable rates.

Risk of Losses on Interest Rate Hedging Arrangements

We have, from time to time, entered into agreements to reduce the
risks associated with increases in interest rates, and may continue to do so.
Although these agreements may partially protect against rising interest rates,
these agreements also may reduce the benefits to us when interest rates decline.
There can be no assurance that any such hedging arrangements can be refinanced
or that we will be able to enter into other hedging arrangements to replace
existing ones if interest rates decline. Furthermore, interest rate movements
during the term of interest rate hedging arrangements may result in a gain or
loss on our investment in the hedging arrangement. In addition, if a hedging
arrangement is not indexed to the same rate as the indebtedness that is hedged,
we may be exposed to losses to the extent that the rate governing the
indebtedness and the rate governing the hedging arrangement change independently
of each other. Finally, nonperformance by the other party to the hedging
arrangement may subject us to increased credit risks. In order to minimize
counterparty credit risk, our policy is to enter into hedging arrangements only
with large financial institutions.


Acquisition Activities: Risks that Acquisitions Will Fail to
Meet Expectations

We intend to continue to acquire multifamily residential properties.
There are risks that acquired properties will fail to perform as expected.
Estimates of future income, expenses and the costs of improvements necessary to
allow us to market an acquired property as originally intended may prove to be
inaccurate. In addition, we expect to finance future acquisitions, in whole or
in part, under various forms of secured or unsecured financing or through the
issuance of partnership units by the Operating Partnership or additional equity
by us. The use of equity financing, rather than debt, for future developments or
acquisitions could dilute the interest of our existing stockholders. If new
acquisitions are financed under existing lines of credit, there is a risk that,
unless substitute financing is obtained, further availability under the lines of
credit for new development may not be available or may be available only on
disadvantageous terms.

Also, we may not be able to refinance its existing lines of credit upon
maturity, or the terms of such refinancing may not be as favorable as the terms
of the existing indebtedness. Further, acquisitions of properties are subject to
the general risks associated with real estate investments. For further
information regarding these risks, pleas see "Adverse Effect to Property
Income and Value Due to General Real Estate Investment Risks."

On December 17, 2002, we completed the acquisition of John M. Sachs, Inc., a
real estate company pursuant to which we acquired a real estate portfolio,
consisting primarily of apartment communities located in San Diego County,
California. The assets in this transaction were valued at approximately $301
million. This is our largest real estate portfolio acquisition to date. The
integration of these properties into our company will place a burden on our
management team and infrastructure. These properties may not perform as
expected. In addition, as this transaction was structured as a merger, there is
the risk that we assumed unknown liabilities, which might adversely affect our
results of operations.

Risks that Development Activities Will Be Delayed, not
Completed, and/or Fail to Achieve Expected Results

We pursue multifamily residential property development projects from
time to time. Development projects generally require various governmental and
other approvals, the receipt of which cannot be assured. Our development
activities generally entail certain risks, including the following:

funds may be expended and management's time devoted to
projects that may not be completed;

construction costs of a project may exceed original
estimates possibly making the project economically unfeasible;

development projects may be delayed due to, among other
things, adverse weather conditions;

occupancy rates and rents at a completed project may be
less than anticipated; and

expenses at a completed development may be higher than
anticipated.

These risks may reduce the funds available for distribution to our
stockholders. Further, the development of properties is also subject to the
general risks associated with real estate investments. For further information
regarding these risks, please see "Adverse Effect to Property Income and
Value Due to General Real Estate Investment Risks."


The Geographic Concentration of the Properties and Fluctuations
in Local Markets May Adversely Impact

Significant amounts of rental revenues for the year ended December
31, 2002, were derived from properties concentrated in Northern California (the
San Francisco Bay Area), Southern California (Los Angeles, Ventura, Orange and
San Diego counties), and the Pacific Northwest (the Seattle, Washington and
Portland, Oregon metropolitan areas). As of December 31, 2002, of our 112
ownership interests in multifamily residential properties, 83 are located in
California. As a result of this geographic concentration, if a local property
market performs poorly, the income from the properties in that market could
decrease. As a result of such a decrease in income, we may be unable to pay
expected dividends to our stockholders. The performance of the economy in each
of these areas affects occupancy, market rental rates and expenses and,
consequently impacts the income generated from the properties and their
underlying values. The financial results of major local employers may also
impact the cash flow and value of certain of the properties. Economic downturns
in the local markets in which we own properties could have a negative impact on
the financial condition and results from operations.

Competition in the Multifamily Residential Market May
Adversely Affect Operations and the Rental Demand For Our Properties

There are numerous housing alternatives that compete with the
multifamily properties in attracting residents. These include other multifamily
rental apartments and single-family homes that are available for rent in the
markets in which the properties are located. The properties also compete for
residents with new and existing homes and condominiums that are for sale. If the
demand for our properties is reduced or if competitors develop and/or acquire
competing properties on a more cost-effective basis, rental rates may drop,
which may have a material adverse affect on our financial condition and results
of operations.

We also face competition from other real estate investment trusts, businesses
and other entities in the acquisition, development and operation of properties.
Some of the competitors are larger and have greater financial resources than we
do. This competition may result in increased costs of properties we acquire
and/or develop.

Debt Financing on Properties May Result in Insufficient Cash
Flow

Where possible, we intend to continue to use leverage to increase the
rate of return on our investments and to provide for additional investments that
we could not otherwise make. There is a risk that the cash flow from the
properties will be insufficient to meet both debt payment obligations and the
distribution requirements of the real estate investment trust provisions of the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"). We may obtain
additional debt financing in the future, through mortgages on some or all of the
properties. These mortgages may be recourse, non-recourse, or cross-
collateralized. As of December 31, 2002, the Company had 54 properties
encumbered by debt. Of the 54 properties, 35 are secured by deeds of trust
relating solely to those properties, and with respect to the remaining 19
properties, five cross-collateralized mortgages are secured by eight properties,
three properties, three properties, three properties and two properties,
respectively. The holders of this indebtedness will have a claim against these
properties and to the extent indebtedness is cross-collateralized, lenders may
seek to foreclose upon properties, which are not the primary collateral for
their loan. This may, in turn, accelerate other indebtedness secured by
properties. Foreclosure of properties would reduce our income and asset value.

Dividend Requirements as a Result Of Preferred Stock May Lead
to a Possible Inability to Sustain Dividends

In 1998 and 1999, the Operating Partnership issued $210 million in
aggregate of Series B Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Units (the "Series B
Preferred Units"), Series C Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Units, (the
"Series C Preferred Units"), Series D Cumulative Redeemable Preferred
Units (the "Series D Preferred Units") and Series E Cumulative
Redeemable Preferred Units (the "Series E Preferred Units"). The
Series B Preferred Units, the Series C Preferred Units, the Series D Preferred
Units and the Series E Preferred Units are collectively referred to as the
"Preferred Units".


The terms of the preferred stock into which each series of Preferred Units
are exchangeable provide for certain cumulative preferential cash distributions
per each share of preferred stock. These terms also provide that while such
preferred stock is outstanding, no distributions may be authorized, declared or
paid on the common stock unless all distributions accumulated on all shares of
such preferred stock have been paid in full. The distributions payable on such
preferred stock may impair our ability to pay dividends on our common stock.

If we wish to issue any common stock in the future (including, upon exercise
of stock options), the funds required to continue to pay cash dividends at
current levels will be increased. Our ability to pay dividends will depend
largely upon the performance of the properties and other properties that may be
acquired in the future.

Our ability to pay dividends on our stock is further limited by the Maryland
General Corporation Law. Under the Maryland General Corporation Law, we may not
make a distribution on stock if, after giving effect to such distribution,
either:

we would not be able to pay its indebtedness as it
becomes due in the usual course of business; or

our total assets would be less than its total
liabilities.

If we cannot pay dividends on our stock, our status as a real estate
investment trust may be jeopardized.

Registration and Resale of Shares Pursuant to our
Pending Registration Statement May Have an Adverse Effect on the Market Price of
the Shares

Pursuant to the acquisition of John M. Sachs, Inc., a real estate
company, in December 2002, we issued 2,719,875 shares of common stock, as
partial consideration for the acquisition, to the trusts that were the
shareholders of that company.  In connection with the acquisition, the Company
entered into a registration rights agreement with these trusts, pursuant to
which in January 2003 we filed a Registration Statement in order to enable their
resale of these shares of common stock. In this Registration Statement, we are
also registering, pursuant to certain registration rights, shares of common
stock, which are issuable upon exchange of limited partnership interests in the
Operating Partnership. These limited partnership interests are held by senior
members of our management, certain members of our Board of Directors and certain
outside investors, or the Operating Partnership holders, and comprise
approximately 10% of the limited partnership interests of the Operating
Partnership as of December 31, 2002. In addition, the Operating Partnership has
invested in certain real estate partnerships. In this Registration Statement, we
are also registering, pursuant to certain registration rights, shares of common
stock, which are issuable upon redemption of all of the limited partnership
interests on such real estate partnerships. The registration and resale of the
shares of common stock pursuant to the registration statement may have an
adverse effect of the market price of our shares.

Our Chairman is Involved in Other Real Estate Activities and
Investments, Which May Lead to Conflicts of Interest

Our Chairman, George M. Marcus, owns interests in various other real
estate-related business and investments. He is the Chairman of The Marcus &
Millichap Company, or MM, which is the holding company for real estate brokerage
and services companies. MM has an interest in Pacific Property Company, a
company that invests in West Coast multifamily residential properties. In 1999
we sold an office building which Essex previously occupied to MM.


Mr. Marcus has agreed not to divulge any information that may be received by
him in this capacity as Chairman of Essex to any of affiliated companies and
that he will absent himself from any and all discussions by the Essex Board of
Directors regarding any proposed acquisition and/or development of a multifamily
property where it appears that there may be a conflict of interest with any of his
affiliated companies.  Notwithstanding this agreement, Mr. Marcus and affiliated
entities may potentially compete with the Company in acquiring and/or developing multifamily
properties, which competition may be detrimental to the Company.  In addition,
due to such potential competition for real estate investments, Mr. Marcus and
affiliated entities may have a conflict of interest with the Company, which may
be detrimental to the interests of the Company's shareholders.

The Influence of Executive Officers, Directors and
Significant Stockholders May Be Detrimental to Holders of Common Stock

As of December 31, 2002, George M. Marcus, the Chairman of our Board
of Directors, wholly or partially owned 1,742,349 shares of common stock
(including shares issuable upon exchange of limited partnership interests in the
Operating Partnership and certain other partnerships and assuming exercise of
all vested options). This represents approximately 7.5% of the outstanding
shares of common stock. Mr. Marcus currently does not have majority control over
us. However, he currently has, and likely will continue to have, significant
influence with respect to the election of directors and approval or disapproval
of significant corporate actions. Consequently, his influence could result in
decisions that do not reflect the interests of all our stockholders.

Under the partnership agreement of the Operating Partnership, the consent of
the holders of limited partnership interests is generally required for any
amendment of the agreement and for certain extraordinary actions. Through their
ownership of limited partnership interests and their positions with us, our
directors and executive officers, including Messrs. Marcus and Millichap, have
substantial influence on us. Consequently, their influence could result in
decisions that do not reflect the interests of all stockholders.

Pursuant to our acquisition of John M. Sachs, Inc. in December 2002, we
issued, as partial consideration for the acquisition, 2,719,875 shares of our
common stock to the trusts that were the shareholders of that company. As a
result of this issuance, these trusts own, as of December 31, 2002, in
aggregate, approximately 13% of our outstanding common stock. The trusts have
common trustees, and pursuant to their ownership interest in the Company, these
trusts may have influence over us. Such influence could result in decisions that
do not reflect the interest of all our stockholders.

The Voting Rights of Preferred Stock May Allow Holders of
Preferred Stock to Impede Actions that Otherwise Benefit Holders of Common Stock

In general, the holders of the preferred stock into which our
Preferred Units are exchangeable do not have any voting rights. However, if full
distributions are not made on any outstanding preferred stock for six quarterly
distributions periods, the holders of preferred stock who have not received
distributions, voting together as a single class, will have the right to elect
two additional directors to serve on our Board of Directors. These voting rights
continue until all distributions in arrears and distributions for the current
quarterly period on the preferred stock have been paid in full. At that time,
the holders of the preferred stock are divested of these voting rights, and the
term and office of the directors so elected immediately terminates.

In addition, while any shares of preferred stock (into which the preferred
units are exchangeable) are outstanding, we:

may not authorize or create any class of series of stock that ranks senior
to this preferred stock with respect to the payment of dividends, rights upon
liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of our business;

amend, alter or repeal the provisions of our Charter or Bylaws, that would
materially and adversely affect these rights without the consent of the holders
of two-thirds of the outstanding shares of each series of preferred stock (as
applicable), each voting separately as a single class;

merge or consolidate with another entity; or

transfer substantially all of its assets to any corporation or other entity,
without the affirmative vote of the holders of at least two-thirds of each
series of preferred stock, each voting separately as a class, unless the
transaction meets certain criteria.

These voting rights of the preferred stock may allow holders of preferred
stock to impede or veto actions that would otherwise benefit the holders of our
common stock.


Exemption of George M. Marcus from the Maryland Business Combination
Law May Allow Certain Transactions Between us and George M. Marcus to Proceed Without
Compliance with Such Law

The Maryland General Corporation Law establishes special requirements
for "business combinations" between a Maryland corporation and "interested
stockholders" unless exemptions are applicable. An interested stockholder is any
person who beneficially owns ten percent or more of the voting power of the
then-outstanding voting stock.

The law also requires a supermajority stockholder vote for such transactions.
This means that the transaction must be approved by at least:

80% of the votes entitled to be cast by holders of
outstanding voting shares; and

66% of the votes entitled to be cast by holders of
outstanding voting shares other than shares held by the interested stockholder
with whom the business combination is to be effected.

However, as permitted by the statute, the Board of Directors irrevocably has
elected to exempt any business combination by us, George M. Marcus, William A.
Millichap, who are the chairman and a director of Essex, respectively, and MM or
any entity owned or controlled by Messrs. Marcus and Millichap and MM.
Consequently, the super-majority vote requirement described above will not apply
to any business combination between us and Mr. Marcus, Mr. Millichap, or MM. As
a result, we may in the future enter into business combinations with Messrs.
Marcus and Millichap and MM, without compliance with the super-majority vote
requirements and other provisions of the Maryland General Corporation Law.

Anti-Takeover Provisions Contained in the Operating Partnership
Agreement, Charter, Bylaws, and Certain Provisions of Maryland Law Could Delay, Defer or
Prevent a Change in Control

While we are the sole general partner of the Operating Partnership,
and generally have full and exclusive responsibility and discretion in the
management and control of the Operating Partnership, certain provisions of the
Operating Partnership's partnership agreement place limitations on our ability
to act with respect to the Operating Partnership. Such limitations could delay,
defer or prevent a transaction or a change in control that might involve a
premium price for our stock or otherwise be in the best interest of the
stockholders or that could otherwise adversely affect the interest of our
stockholders. The partnership agreement provides that if the limited partners
own at least 5% of the outstanding units of limited partnership interest in the
Operating Partnership, we cannot, without first obtaining the consent of a
majority-in-interest of the limited partners in the Operating Partnership,
transfer all or any portion of our general partner interest in the Operating
Partnership to another entity. Such limitations on our ability to act may result
in our being precluded from taking action that the Board of Directors believes
is in the best interests of our stockholders. In addition, as of December 31,
2002, two individuals together held more than 50% of the outstanding units of
limited partnership interest in the Operating Partnership, allowing such actions
to be blocked by a small number of limited partners.

Our Charter authorizes the issuance of additional shares of common stock or
preferred stock and the setting of the preferences, rights and other terms of
such preferred stock without the approval of the holders of the common stock.
Although we have no intention to issue any additional shares of preferred stock
at the present time, we may establish one or more series of preferred stock that
could delay, defer or prevent a transaction or a change in control. Such a
transaction might involve a premium price for our stock or otherwise be in the
best interests of the holders of common stock. Also, such a class of preferred
stock could have dividend, voting or other rights that could adversely affect
the interest of holders of common stock.

Our Charter, as well as its stockholder rights plan, also contains other
provisions that may delay, defer or prevent a transaction or a change in control
that might be in the best interest of our stockholders. Our stockholder rights
plan is designed, among other things, to prevent a person or group from gaining
control of us without offering a fair price to all of our stockholders. Also,
the Bylaws may be amended by the Board of Directors to include provisions that
would have a similar effect, although we presently have no such intention. The
Charter contains ownership provisions limiting the transferability and ownership
of shares of capital stock, which may have the effect of delaying, deferring or
preventing a transaction or a change in control. For example, subject to
receiving an exemption from the Board of Directors, potential acquirers may not
purchase more than 6% percent in value of the stock (other than qualified
pension trusts which can acquire 9.9%). This may discourage tender offers that
may be attractive to the holders of common stock and limit the opportunity for
stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of common stock.


In addition, the Maryland General Corporations Law restricts the voting
rights of shares deemed to be "control shares." Under the Maryland General
Corporations Law, "control shares" are those which, when aggregated with any
other shares held by the acquirer, entitle the acquirer to exercise voting power
within specified ranges. Although the Bylaws exempt us from the control share
provisions of the Maryland General Corporations Law, the provisions of the
Bylaws may be amended or eliminated by the Board of Directors at any time in the
future. Moreover, any such amendment or elimination of such provision of the
Bylaws may result in the application of the control share provisions of the
Maryland General Corporations Law not only to control shares which may be
acquired in the future, but also to control shares previously acquired. If the
provisions of the Bylaws are amended or eliminated, the control share provisions
of the Maryland General Corporations Law could delay, defer or prevent a
transaction or change in control that might involve a premium price for the
stock or otherwise be in the best interests of our stockholders.

Bond Compliance Requirements May Limit Income From Certain
Properties

At December 31, 2002, we had approximately $59.4 million of variable
rate tax-exempt financing relating to the Inglenook Court Apartments, Wandering
Creek Apartments, Treetops Apartments, Huntington Breakers Apartments, Camarillo
Oaks Apartments and Parker Ranch Apartments and $16.2 million of fixed rate tax-
exempt financing related to Meadowood Apartments. This tax-exempt financing
subjects these properties to certain deed restrictions and restrictive
covenants. We expect to engage in tax-exempt financings in the future. In
addition, the Internal Revenue Code and rules and regulations thereunder impose
various restrictions, conditions and requirements excluding interest on
qualified bond obligations from gross income for federal income tax purposes.
The Internal Revenue Code also requires that at least 20% of apartment units be
made available to residents with gross incomes that do not exceed 50% of the
median income for the applicable family size as determined by the Housing and
Urban Development Department of the federal government. In addition to federal
requirements, certain state and local authorities may impose additional rental
restrictions. These restrictions may limit income from the tax-exempt financed
properties if we are required to lower rental rates to attract residents who
satisfy the median income test. If Essex does not reserve the required number of
apartment homes for residents satisfying these income requirements, the tax-
exempt status of the bonds may be terminated, the obligations under the bond
documents may be accelerated and we may be subject to additional contractual
liability.

Adverse Effect To Property Income And Value Due To General
Real Estate Investment Risks

Real property investments are subject to a variety of risks. The
yields available from equity investments in real estate depend on the amount of
income generated and expenses incurred. If the properties do not generate
sufficient income to meet operating expenses, including debt service and capital
expenditures, cash flow and ability to make distributions to stockholders will
be adversely affected. The performance of the economy in each of the areas in
which the properties are located affects occupancy, market rental rates and
expenses.

Consequently, the income from the properties and their underlying values may
be impacted. The financial results of major local employers may have an impact
on the cash flow and value of certain of the properties as well.

Income from the properties may be further adversely affected by, among other
things, the following factors:

the general economic climate;

local economic conditions in which the properties are
located, such as oversupply of space or a reduction in demand for rental space;

the attractiveness of the properties to tenants;

competition from other available space;

Essex's ability to provide for adequate maintenance and
insurance; and

increased operating expenses.


Also, as leases on the properties expire, tenants may enter into new leases
on terms that are less favorable to us. Income and real estate values may also
be adversely affected by such factors as applicable laws (e.g., the Americans
With Disabilities Act of 1990 and tax laws), interest rate levels and the
availability and terms of financing. In addition, real estate investments are
relatively illiquid and, therefore, our ability to vary our portfolio promptly
in response to changes in economic or other conditions may be quite limited.

The Company's Joint Ventures and Joint Ownership of Properties
and Partial Interests in Corporations and Limited Partnerships Could Limit the Company's
Ability to Control Such Properties and Partial Interests

Instead of purchasing properties directly, we have invested and may
continue to invest as a co-venturer. Joint venturers often have shared control
over the operation of the joint venture assets. Therefore, it is possible that
the co-venturer in an investment might become bankrupt, or have economic or
business interests or goals that are inconsistent with our business interests or
goals, or be in a position to take action contrary to our instructions or
requests, or our policies or objectives. Consequently, a co-venturer's actions
might subject property owned by the joint venture to additional risk. Although
we seek to maintain sufficient influence of any joint venture to achieve its
objectives, we may be unable to take action without our joint venture partners'
approval, or joint venture partners could take actions binding on the joint
venture without consent. Additionally, should a joint venture partner become
bankrupt, we could become liable for such partner's share of joint venture
liabilities.

From time to time, we, through the Operating Partnership, invest in
corporations, limited partnerships, limited liability companies or other
entities that have been formed for the purpose of acquiring, developing or
managing real property. In certain circumstances, the Operating Partnership's
interest in a particular entity may be less than a majority of the outstanding
voting interests of that entity. Therefore, the Operating Partnership's ability
to control the daily operations of such an entity may be limited. Furthermore,
the Operating Partnership may not have the power to remove a majority of the
board of directors (in the case of a corporation) or the general partner or
partners (in the case of a limited partnership) of such an entity in the event
that its operations conflict with the Operating Partnership's objectives. In
addition, the Operating Partnership may not be able to dispose of its interests
in such an entity. In the event that such an entity becomes insolvent, the
Operating Partnership may lose up to its entire investment in and any advances
to the entity. In addition, we have and in the future may enter into
transactions that could require us to pay the tax liabilities of partners, which
contribute assets into joint ventures or the Operating Partnership, in the event
that certain taxable events, which are within our control, occur. Although we
plan to hold the contributed assets or defer recognition of gain on their sale
pursuant to the like-kind exchange rules under Section 1031 of the Internal
Revenue Code we can provide no assurance that we will be able to do so and if
such tax liabilities were incurred they can expect to have a material impact on
our financial position.

Dedicated Investment Activities and Other Factors Specifically
Related to Essex Apartment Fund, L.P.

We have recently organized an investment fund, Essex Apartment Value
Fund, L.P., or the Fund, which will be, subject to specific exceptions, Essex's
exclusive investment vehicle for new investment until at least 90% of the Fund's
committed capital has been invested or committed for investments, or if earlier,
December 31, 2003. We are committed to invest 21.4% of the aggregate capital
committed to the Fund. This Fund involves risks to Essex such as the following:
Essex's partners in the Fund might become bankrupt (in which event Essex might
become generally liable for the liabilities of the Fund), have economic or
business interests or goals that are inconsistent with our business interests or
goals, fail to fund capital commitments as contractually required, or fail to
approve decisions regarding the Fund that are in our best interest. We will,
however, generally seek to maintain sufficient influence over the Fund to permit
it to achieve its business objectives.

Investments In Mortgages And Other Real Estate Securities

We may invest in securities related to real estate, which could
adversely affect our ability to make distributions to stockholders. We may
purchase securities issued by entities, which own real estate and may also
invest in mortgages or unsecured debt obligations. These mortgages may be first,
second or third mortgages that may or may not be insured or otherwise
guaranteed. In general, investments in mortgages include the following risks:


that the value of mortgaged property may be less than the
amounts owed;

that interest rates payable on the mortgages may be lower
than our cost of funds; and

in the case of junior mortgages, that foreclosure of a
senior mortgage would eliminate the junior mortgage.

If any of the above were to occur, cash flows from operations and our ability
to make expected dividends to stockholders could be adversely affected.

Possible Environmental Liabilities

Investments in real property create a potential for environmental
liabilities on the part of the owner of such real property. We carry certain
insurance coverage for this type of environmental risk. We have conducted
environmental studies which revealed the presence of groundwater contamination
at certain properties; such contamination at certain of these properties was
reported to have migrated on-site from adjacent industrial manufacturing
operations. The former industrial users of the properties were identified as the
source of contamination. The environmental studies noted that certain properties
are located adjacent to any possible down gradient from sites with known
groundwater contamination, the lateral limits of which may extend onto such
properties. The environmental studies also noted that at certain of these
properties, contamination existed because of the presence of underground fuel
storage tanks, which have been removed. In general, in connection with the
ownership, operation, financing, management and development of real properties,
we may be potentially liable for removal or clean-up costs, as well as certain
other costs and environmental liabilities. We may also be subject to
governmental fines and costs related to injuries to persons and property.

Recently there has been an increasing number of lawsuits against owners and
managers of multifamily properties other than us alleging personal injury and
property damage caused by the presence of mold in residential real estate. Mold
related claims are often excluded from standard insurance policies. Should an
uninsured mold related claim arise against us, we could be required to use our
own funds to resolve the claim and to make any needed cleanups to the involved
property.

California has enacted legislation commonly referred to as "Proposition 65"
requiring that "clear and reasonable" warnings be given to consumers who are
exposed to chemicals known to the State of California to cause cancer or
reproductive toxicity, including tobacco smoke. Although we have sought to
comply with Proposition 65 requirements, there can be no assurance that we will
not be adversely affected by litigation relating to Proposition 65.

We cannot be assured that existing environmental assessments of our
properties reveal all environmental liabilities, that any prior owner of any of
our properties did not create a material environmental condition not known to
us, or that a material environmental condition does not otherwise exist as to
any one or more of our properties.

General Uninsured Losses

We carry comprehensive liability, fire, extended coverage and rental
loss insurance for each of the properties. There are, however, certain types of
extraordinary losses for which we do not have insurance. Certain of the
properties are located in areas that are subject to earthquake activity. We have
obtained certain limited earthquake insurance coverage. We may sustain losses
due to insurance deductibles, co-payments on insured losses or uninsured losses,
or losses in excess of applicable coverage.

Changes In Real Estate Tax And Other Laws

Generally we do not directly pass through costs resulting from
changes in real estate tax laws to residential property tenants. We also do not
generally pass through increases in income, service or other taxes, to tenants
under leases. These costs may adversely affect funds from operations and the
ability to make distributions to stockholders. Similarly, compliance with
changes in (i) laws increasing the potential liability for environmental
conditions existing on properties or the restrictions on discharges or other
conditions or (ii) rent control or rent stabilization laws or other laws
regulating housing may result in significant unanticipated expenditures, which
would adversely affect funds from operations and the ability to make
distributions to stockholders. In addition, recent proposed changes to the tax
law to eliminate most taxes on stock dividends may adversely affect us and other
REITs by reducing the demand for REIT stocks generally.


Changes In Financing Policy; No Limitation On Debt

We have adopted a policy of maintaining a debt-to-total-market-
capitalization ratio of less than 50%. The calculation of debt-to-total-market-
capitalization is as follows: total property indebtedness divided by the sum of
total property indebtedness plus total equity market capitalization.

As used in the above formula, total market capitalization is equal to the
aggregate market value of the outstanding shares of common stock (based on the
greater of current market price or the gross proceeds per share from public
offerings of the outstanding shares plus any undistributed net cash flow),
assuming the conversion of all limited partnership interests in the Operating
Partnership into shares of common stock and the gross proceeds of the preferred
units of the Operating Partnership. Based on this calculation (including the
current market price and excluding undistributed net cash flow), our debt-to-
total-market-capitalization ratio was approximately 36.4% as of December 31,
2002.

Our organizational documents and the organizational documents of the
Operating Partnership do not limit the amount or percentage of indebtedness that
may be incurred. Accordingly, the Board of Directors could change current
policies and the policies of the Operating Partnership regarding indebtedness.
If these policies were changed, we and the Operating Partnership could incur
more debt, resulting in an increased risk of default on our obligations and the
obligations of the Operating Partnership, and an increase in debt service
requirements that could adversely affect the financial condition and results of
operations of Essex. Such increased debt could exceed the underlying value of
the properties.

Failure To Qualify As A REIT

We have elected to be taxed as a REIT under the Internal Revenue
Code. However, we cannot assure you that we have qualified as a REIT or that we
will continue to so qualify in the future. To qualify as a REIT, we must satisfy
numerous requirements (some on an annual and quarterly basis) established under
highly technical and complex Internal Revenue Code provisions. Only limited
judicial or administrative interpretation exists for these provisions and
involves the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not
entirely within our control. In addition, future legislation, new regulations,
administrative interpretations or court decisions may apply to us, potentially
with retroactive effect, and adversely affect of ability to qualify as a REIT.
We may receive significant non-qualifying income or acquire non-qualifying
assets, which as a result, may cause us to approach the income and assets test
limits imposed by the Internal Revenue Code. There is a risk that we may not
satisfy these tests. If we fail to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, we
would be subject to federal income tax on our taxable income at corporate rates.
We may also be disqualified from treatment as a REIT for the four taxable years
following the year in which we failed to qualify. This would reduce our net
earnings available for investment or distribution to stockholders because of the
additional tax liability. Even if we continue to qualify as a REIT, we will
continue to be subject to certain federal, state and local taxes on our income
and property.

Other Matters

Certain Policies of the Company

The Company intends to continue to operate in a manner that will not
subject it to regulation under the Investment Company Act of 1940. The Company
has in the past five years and may in the future (i) issue securities senior to
its Common Stock, (ii) fund acquisition activities with borrowings under its
line of credit and (iii) offer shares of Common Stock and/or units of limited
partnership interest in the Operating Partnership as partial consideration for
property acquisitions. The Company from time to time acquires partnership
interests in partnerships and joint ventures, either directly or indirectly
through subsidiaries of the Company, when such entities' underlying assets are
real estate. In general, the Company does not (i) underwrite securities of other
issuers or (ii) actively trade in loans or other investments.

The Company primarily invests in multifamily properties in Southern
California (Los Angeles, Ventura, Orange and San Diego counties), Northern
California (the San Francisco Bay Area), and the Pacific Northwest (the Seattle,
Washington and Portland, Oregon metropolitan areas). The Company currently
intends to continue to invest in multifamily properties in such regions, but may
change such policy without a vote of the stockholders. In connection with the
Sachs' portfolio acquisition in December 2002, the Company did acquire
properties in Nevada and Texas.


The policies discussed above may be reviewed and modified from time to time
by the Board of Directors without the vote of the stockholders.

Item 2. Properties

The Company's property portfolio (including partial ownership interests)
consists of ownership interests in 112 multifamily properties (comprising 23,699
apartment units), of which 13,654 units are located in Southern California (Los
Angeles, Ventura, Orange and San Diego counties), 4,023 units are located in
Northern California (the San Francisco Bay Area), 5,444 of which are located in
the Pacific Northwest (4,073 units in the Seattle metropolitan area and 1,371
units in the Portland, Oregon metropolitan area), and 578 are located in other
areas (302 units in Houston, Texas and 276 units in Hemet, California). In
addition, the Company owns other real estate assets consisting of five
recreational vehicle parks (comprising 1,717 spaces), four office buildings
(totaling approximately 63,540 square feet) and two manufactured housing
communities (containing 607 sites).  One of the office buildings located in
Northern California (Palo Alto) has approximately 17,400 square feet and houses
the Company's headquarters and another office building located in Southern
California (Woodland Hills) has approximately 38,940 square feet, of which the
Company currently occupies approximately 6,800 square feet. The Woodland Hills
office building has ten third party tenants occupying approximately 27,300 feet.
The Company along with its affiliated entities and joint ventures also have
entered into commitments for the development of 1,518 units in six multifamily
communities; three of which are in Northern California and three in Southern
California.   See page 7 for a list of our properties under development.

The Company's multifamily Properties accounted for in excess of 94% of the
Company's revenues for the year ended December 31, 2002.

Occupancy Rates

The 112 multifamily residential properties had an average
occupancy, based on "financial occupancy," during the year ended December 31,
2002, of approximately 95%. With respect to stabilized multifamily properties
with sufficient operating history, occupancy figures are based on financial
occupancy, which is defined as the percentage resulting from dividing actual
rental revenue by total possible rental revenue. Actual rental revenue
represents contractual revenue pursuant to leases without considering
delinquency and concessions. Total possible rental revenue represents the value
of all apartment units, with occupied units valued at contractual rental rates
pursuant to leases and vacant units valued at estimated market rents. We believe
that financial occupancy is a meaningful measure of occupancy because it
considers the value of each vacant unit at its estimated market rate. Financial
occupancy may not completely reflect short-term trends in physical occupancy and
financial occupancy rates as disclosed by other REITs may not be comparable to
our calculation of financial occupancy.

As of December 31, 2002, the headquarters building was 100% occupied by the
Company and the Southern California office building was 88% occupied, based on
physical occupancy. With respect to office buildings, occupancy figures are
based on "physical occupancy" which refers to the percentage resulting from
dividing leased and occupied square footage by rentable square footage. With
respect to recreational vehicle parks, manufactured housing communities, or
multifamily properties which have not yet stabilized or have insufficient
operating history, occupancy figures are based on "physical occupancy" which
refers to the percentage resulting from dividing leased and occupied units by
rentable units.


For the year ended December 31, 2002, none of the Company's Properties had
book values equal to 10% or more of total assets of the Company or gross
revenues equal to 10% or more of aggregate gross revenues of the Company.

Multifamily Residential Properties

The Company's multifamily Properties are generally suburban garden
apartments and townhomes comprising multiple clusters of two and three story
buildings situated on three to fifteen acres of land. The multifamily properties
have on average 212 units, with a mix of studio, one, two and some three-bedroom
units. A wide variety of amenities are available at each apartment community,
including, covered parking, wood-burning fireplaces, swimming pools, clubhouses
with complete fitness facilities, volleyball and playground areas and tennis
courts.

Most of the multifamily Properties are designed for and marketed to people in
white-collar or technical professions. The Company selects, trains and
supervises a full team of on-site service and maintenance personnel. The Company
believes that its customer service approach enhances its ability to retain
tenants and that its multifamily Properties were built well and have been
maintained well since acquisition.

Office Buildings

The Company's corporate headquarters is located in a two-story office
building with approximately 17,400 square feet located at 925 East Meadow Drive,
Palo Alto, California. The Company acquired this property in 1997. The Company
also owns an office building in Southern California (Woodland Hills), comprised
of approximately 38,940 square feet building, of which the Company currently
occupies approximately 8,600 square feet. The building has ten third party
tenants occupying approximately 28,700 feet. The largest single tenant occupies
approximately 10,900 square feet. The Company acquired this property in 2001.
The Company also has two small office buildings comprising approximately 7,200
square feet and located in San Diego, California.

Recreational Vehicle Parks

The Company owns five recreational vehicle parks, acquired in the
Sachs' merger, (comprising of 1,717 spaces) located in El Cajon, California,
Hemet, California and Las Vegas Nevada.

Manufactured Housing Communities

Sachs' merger, (containing 607 sites) located in Vista, California and Las
Vegas, Nevada.

Return of Capital

Under provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended,

capital. The return of capital is generated due to the deduction of non-cash
expenses, primarily depreciation, in the determination of earnings and profits.

The status of the cash dividends distributed for the years ended December 31,
2002, 2001 and 2000 for tax purposes is as follows:

Future distributions by the Company will be at the discretion of
the Board of Directors and will depend on the actual funds from operations of
the Company, its financial condition, capital requirements, the annual
distribution requirements under the REIT provisions of the Internal Revenue
Code, applicable legal restrictions and such other factors as the Board of
Directors deems relevant. There are currently no contractual restrictions on the
Company's present or future ability to pay dividends.

Dividend Reinvestment and Share Purchase Plan

The Company has adopted a dividend reinvestment and share purchase
plan designed to provide holders of Common Stock with a convenient and
economical means to reinvest all or a portion of their cash dividends in shares
of Common Stock and to acquire additional shares of Common Stock through
voluntary purchases. Computershare, LLC, which serves as the Company's transfer
agent, administers the dividend reinvestment and share purchase plan. For a copy
of the plan, contact Computershare, LLC at (310) 360-5354.

Stockholder Rights Plan

In 1998, the Company adopted a stockholder rights plan that is
designed to enhance the ability of all of the Company's stockholders to realize
the long-term value of their investment. The rights plan is designed, among
other things, to prevent a person or group from gaining control of the Company
without offering a fair price to all of the Company's stockholders.

On October 13, 1998, the Board declared a one for one preferred share
purchase right (a "Right") for each outstanding share of Common Stock. Each
Right entitles the registered holder to purchase from the Company one one-
hundredth of a share of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock, par value
$.0001 per share, of the Company, at a price of $99.13 per one-hundredth of a
share, subject to adjustment. The description and terms of the Rights are set
forth in a Rights Agreement dated as of November 11, 1998, as amended between
the Company and Computershare, LLC as Rights Agent.

Unregistered Sales of Securities

On December 17, 2002, in connection with Essex's acquisition, by
merger, of John M. Sachs, Inc., ("Sachs"), Essex issued to the Sachs'
shareholders 2,719,875 shares of common stocks. This private placement of Units
was completed pursuant to the exemption from registration contained in Section 4(2)
of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.

______

(1) Interest coverage ratio represents earnings before minority interest,
gain on sales of real estate, interest expense, taxes, depreciation and
amortization ("EBITDA") divided by interest expense.

(2) Gross operating margin represents rental revenues and other property
income less property operating expenses, exclusive of depreciation and
amortization divided by rental revenues and other property income.

(3) Same property apartment units are those units in properties that the
Company has consolidated for the entire two years ended as of the end of the
period set forth. The number of same property apartment units in such properties
may vary at each year-end. Percentage changes in averages per unit do not
correspond to total same property revenues and expense percent changes which are
discussed in Item 7--Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition
and Results of Operations.

(4) Average same property monthly rental rate per apartment unit represents
total scheduled rent for the same property apartment units for the period
(actual rental rates on occupied apartment units plus market rental rates on
vacant apartment units) divided by the number of such apartment units and
further divided by the number of months in the period.

(5) Average same property monthly expenses per apartment unit represents
total monthly operating expenses, exclusive of depreciation and amortization,
for the same property apartment units for the period divided by the total number
of such apartment units and further divided by the number of months in the
period.

(6) Occupancy rates are based on financial occupancy. For an explanation of
how financial occupancy is calculated, see "Properties-Occupancy
Rates" in Item 2 of Part I of this Form 10-K.

Item 7. Management's Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

The following discussion is based on the consolidated financial
statements of Essex Property Trust, Inc. ("Essex" or the "Company") as of and
for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000. This information should be
read in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements and
notes thereto.

Substantially all the assets of the Company are held by, and substantially
all operations are conducted through, Essex Portfolio, L.P. (the "Operating
Partnership"). The Company is the sole general partner of the Operating
Partnership and, as of December 31, 2002, 2001, and 2000 owned an approximate
90.0%, 89.0% and 89.6% general partnership interest in the Operating
Partnership, respectively. The Company has elected to be treated as a real
estate investment trust (a "REIT") for federal income tax purposes.


Certain statements in this "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations," and elsewhere in this Annual Report which
are not historical facts may be considered forward looking statements within the
meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section
21E of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, including statements
regarding the Company's expectations, hopes, intentions, beliefs and strategies
regarding the future. Forward looking statements include statements under the
caption "Business Objectives" in this Part I, statements regarding the
Company's expectation as to the timing of completion of current development
projects and the stabilization dates of such projects, expectation as to the
total projected costs and rental rates of current development projects, beliefs
as to the adequacy of future cash flows to meet operating requirements and to
provide for dividend payments in accordance with REIT requirements,
expectations as to the amount of capital expenditures, expectations as to the
amount of non-revenue generating capital expenditures, future acquisitions and
developments, the anticipated performance of the Essex Apartment Value Fund,
L.P., the anticipated performance of existing properties, and statements
regarding the Company's financing activities. Such forward-looking statements
involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors including, but
not limited to, that the Company will fail to achieve its business objectives,
that the actual completion of development projects will be subject to delays,
that the stabilization dates of such projects will be delayed, that the total
projected costs of current development projects will exceed expectations, that
such development projects will not be completed, that development projects and
acquisitions will fail to meet expectations, that estimates of future income
from an acquired property may prove to be inaccurate, that future cash flows
will be inadequate to meet operating requirements and/or will be insufficient to
provide for dividend payments in accordance with REIT requirements, that the
actual non-revenue generating capital expenditures will exceed the Company's
current expectations, that the Essex Apartment Value Fund will fail to perform
as anticipated, that the Company's partners in this Fund fail to fund capital
commitments as contractually required, that there may be a downturn in the
markets in which the Company's properties are located, and that the terms of any
refinancing may not be as favorable as the terms of existing indebtedness, as
well as those risks, special considerations, and other factors discussed under
the caption "Other Matters/Risk Factors" in Item 1 of this Report on
Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2002, and those other risk factors and
special considerations set forth in the Company's other filings with the
Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") which may cause the
actual results, performance or achievements of the Company to be materially
different from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or
implied by such forward-looking statements. All forward-looking statements and
reasons why results may differ included in this Form 10-K are made as of the
date hereof, and we assume no obligation to update any such forward-looking
statement or reason why actual results may differ.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

The preparation of consolidated financial statements, in accordance
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America,
requires the Company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported
amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosures of
contingent assets and liabilities. On an on-going basis, the Company evaluates
its estimates, including those related to acquiring, developing and assessing
the carrying values of its real estate properties, its investments in and
advances to joint ventures and affiliates and qualification as a REIT. The
Company bases its estimates on historical experience, current market conditions,
and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the
circumstances. Actual results may differ from those estimates made by
management.

Rental properties are recorded at cost less accumulated depreciation.
Depreciation on rental properties has been provided over estimated useful lives
ranging from 3 to 30 years using the straight-line method. Development costs
include acquisition, direct and indirect construction costs, interest and real
estate taxes incurred during the construction and property stabilizations
periods. Maintenance and repair expenses that do not add to the value or prolong
the useful life of the property are expensed as incurred. Asset replacements and
improvements are capitalized and depreciated over their estimated useful lives.

The Company assesses the carrying value of its real estate investments by
monitoring performance compared to budget for operating properties and joint
ventures, and by monitoring contract performance for properties under
development. Local market knowledge and data is used to assess carrying values
of properties and the market value of acquisition opportunities. Whenever events
or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a property held
for investment may not be fully recoverable, the carrying amount is evaluated.
If the sum of the property's expected future cash flows (undiscounted and
without interest charges) is less than the carrying amount of the property, then
the Company will recognize an impairment loss equal to the excess of the
carrying amount over the fair value of the property. Adverse changes in market
conditions or poor operating results of real estate investments could result in
impairment charges. When the Company determines that a property is held for
sale, it discontinues the periodic depreciation of that property. The criteria for
determining when a property is held for sale requires judgment and has potential financial
statement impact as depreciation would cease and an impairment loss could occur upon determination
of held for sale status.  Assets held for sale are reported at the lower of the
carrying amount or estimated fair value less costs to sell.

With respect to investments in and advances to joint ventures and affiliates,
the Company looks to the underlying properties to assess performance and the
recoverability of carrying amounts for those investments in a manner similar to
direct investments in real estate properties. An impairment charge or investment
valuation charge is recorded if the carrying value of the investment exceeds its
fair value.

We have elected to be taxed as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code.
However, we cannot assure you that we have qualified as a REIT or that we will
continue to so qualify in the future. If we fail to qualify as a REIT in any
taxable year, we would be subject to federal income tax on our taxable income at
corporate rates. We may also be disqualified from treatment as a REIT for the
four taxable years following the year in which we failed to qualify. This would
reduce our net earnings available for investment or distribution to stockholders
because of the additional tax liability. Even if we continue to qualify as a
REIT, we will continue to be subject to certain federal, state and local taxes
on our income and property.


The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other
assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual
results may vary from those estimates and those estimates could be different
under different assumptions or conditions.

General Background

The Company's property revenues are generated primarily from
multifamily property operations, which accounted for greater than 95% of its
property revenues for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001, and 2000. The
Company's properties ("the Properties") are located in Northern California (the
San Francisco Bay Area), Southern California (Los Angeles, Ventura, Orange and
San Diego counties), the Pacific Northwest (The Seattle, Washington and
Portland, Oregon metropolitan areas), and other areas (Hemet, California, Las
Vegas, Nevada, and Houston, Texas). The average occupancy level of the Company's
portfolio has equaled or exceeded 95% for the last five years.

Essex Apartment Value Fund, L.P. (the "Fund"), is an investment
fund organized by the Company in 2001. The Fund will be, subject to specific
exceptions, the Company's exclusive investment vehicle for new investments until
the Fund's committed capital has been invested or committed for investments, or
if earlier, December 31, 2003. The Fund has total capital commitments of $250
million and is expected to utilize leverage of approximately 65% of the value of
the underlying real estate portfolio. The Company is committed to invest 21.4%
of the aggregate capital committed to the Fund. In addition, the Company will be
compensated by the Fund for its asset management, property management,
development and redevelopment services and may receive incentive payments if the
Fund exceeds certain financial return benchmarks. Since its formation, the Fund
has acquired ten multifamily residential properties, representing 2,323
apartment units with an aggregate purchase price of approximately $244 million,
excluding redevelopment expenses, and disposed of one multifamily residential
property, consisting of 500 apartment units at a gross sales price of
approximately $69.0 million resulting in a net realized gain of approximately
$5.7 million. In addition, three development land parcels, where approximately
612 apartment units are planned for construction, have been purchased by the
Fund with a total estimated cost for the projects of approximately $122.3
million. As of December 31, 2002, the remaining commitments to fund these
projects is approximately $85.6 million of which approximately $18.3 million is
the Company's commitment.

The Company has elected to be treated as a real estate investment trust
("REIT") for federal income tax purposes, commencing with the year ended
December 31, 1994. The Company provides some of its fee based asset management
and disposition services as well as third-party property management and leasing
services through Essex Management Corporation ("EMC"), in order to maintain
compliance with REIT tax rules. The Company owns 100% of EMC's 19,000 shares of
nonvoting preferred stock. Executives of the Company own 100% of EMC's 1,000
shares of Common Stock.

Since the Company's initial public offering (the "IPO") in June 1994, the
Company has acquired ownership interests in 100 multifamily residential
properties, its headquarters building, three Southern California office
buildings, five recreational vehicle parks, and two manufactured housing
communities. With respect to the multifamily residential properties that the
Company acquired, 14 are located in Northern California, 64 are located in
Southern California, 15 are located in the Seattle Metropolitan Area, five are
located in the Portland Metropolitan Area and two are located in other areas. In
total, these acquisitions consist of 20,380 units with total capitalized
acquisition costs of approximately $1,254.3 million. Additionally, since its
IPO, the Company has developed and has ownership interests in nine multifamily
development properties that have reached stabilized operations. These
development properties consist of 1,944 units with total capitalized development
costs of $236.8 million. As part of its active portfolio management strategy,
the Company has disposed of, since its IPO, twelve multifamily residential
properties (six in Northern California, five in Southern California and one in
the Pacific Northwest) consisting of a total of 2,014 units, six retail shopping
centers in the Portland, Oregon metropolitan area and its former headquarters
building located in Northern California at an aggregate gross sales price of
approximately $259.5 million resulting in a net realized gain of approximately
$53.8 million.

The Company (including the Fund's development communities) has ownership
interests in and is developing six multifamily residential communities, with an
aggregate of 1,518 multifamily units. In connection with these development
projects, the Company has directly, or in some cases through its joint venture
partners, entered into contractual construction related commitments with
unrelated third parties and the total projected estimated cost for these
projects is approximately $299.0 million. As of December 31, 2002, the remaining
commitment to fund these projects is approximately $118.5 million, of which
approximately $51.2 million is the Company's commitment.


Results of Operations

Comparison of Year Ended December 31, 2002 to Year Ended
December 31, 2001

Average financial occupancy rates of the Company's multifamily "Same
Store Properties" (properties consolidated by the Company for each of the
years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001) decreased to 94.5% for the year ended
December 31, 2002 from 94.7% for the year ended December 31, 2001. Financial
occupancy is defined as the percentage resulting from dividing actual rental
revenue by total possible rental revenue. Actual rental revenue represents
contractual rental revenue pursuant to leases without considering delinquency
and concessions. Total possible rental revenue represents the value of all
apartment units, with occupied units valued at contractual rental rates pursuant
to leases and vacant units valued at estimated market rents. We believe that
financial occupancy is a meaningful measure of occupancy because it considers
the value of each vacant unit at its estimated market rate. Financial occupancy
may not completely reflect short-term trends in physical occupancy and financial
occupancy rates as disclosed by other REITs may not be comparable to our
calculation of financial occupancy.

The regional breakdown of financial occupancy for the Same Store Properties
for the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001 are as follows:

______

(1) Also includes four office buildings, five recreational vehicle parks, two
manufactured housing communities, redevelopment communities and development
communities.

As set forth in the above table, the $3,417,000 net decrease in total
revenues was the result of a decrease in property revenues from Same Store
Properties, which was offset in part by $4,173,000 attributable to properties
acquired or disposed of subsequent to January 1, 2001, four office buildings,
five recreational vehicle parks, two manufactured housing communities,
redevelopment communities and development communities. During this period, the
Company acquired interests in 42 properties and achieved stabilized operations
at one development community, (the "Acquisition Properties"), and disposed of
three retail shopping centers and four multifamily properties (the "Disposition
Properties").


Of the net decrease in total revenues, $8,295,000 was mainly attributable to
a decrease in property revenues from the Same Store Properties. Property
revenues from the Same Store Properties decreased by 5.3% to $148,062,000 in
2002 from $156,357,000 in 2001. The majority of this decrease was attributable
to the 14 Same Store Properties located in Northern California and the 23 Same
Store Properties located in the Pacific Northwest. The property revenues of the
Same Store Properties in Northern California decreased by $7,114,000 or 12.5% to
$49,829,000 in 2002 from $56,943,000 in 2001. The decrease in Northern
California is primarily attributable to rental rate decreases offset by an
increase in average financial occupancy to 95.6% in 2002 from 95.4% in 2001. The
property revenues of the Same Store Properties in the Pacific Northwest
decreased by $3,120,000 or 6.9% to $41,989,000 in 2002 from $45,109,000 in 2001.
The $3,120,000 decrease in the Pacific Northwest is primarily attributable to
rental rate decreases and a decrease in average financial occupancy to 93.1% in
2002 from 93.9% in 2001. The 19 multifamily residential properties located in
Southern California partially offset the net decrease in total revenues. The
property revenues of these properties increased by $1,939,000 or 3.6% to
$56,244,000 in 2002 from $54,305,000 in 2001. The $1,939,000 increase is
primarily attributable to rental rate increases, which were and offset by a
slight decrease in average financial occupancy to 94.7% in 2002 from 94.8% in
2001.

Interest and other income increased by $705,000 or 3.2% to $22,857,000 in
2002 from $22,152,000 in 2001. The increase of $705,000 primarily relates to the
equity in income from the gain on sale of co-investment assets and additional
fee income earned in connection with the sale of co-investment assets.

Total Expenses

decreased by $3,689,000 or approximately 2.7% to
$131,404,000 in 2002 from $135,093,000 in 2001. This decrease was attributable
to a decrease in interest expense, which decreased by $3,734,000 or 9.6% to
$35,012,000 in 2002 from $38,746,000 in 2001, a decrease in maintenance and
repairs expense, which decreased by $1,471,000 or 11.8% to $10,971,000 in 2002
from $12,442,000 in 2001, offset by an increase in insurance expense of
$919,000 or 80.9% to $2,055,000 in 2002 from $1,136,000 in 2001. The interest
expense decrease was primarily due to declining interest rates. The increase in
insurance expense is due to the current conditions in the insurance industry
resulting in higher premiums.

General and administrative expenses represent the
costs of the Company's various acquisition and administrative departments as
well as partnership administration and non-operating expenses. Such expenses
decreased by $1,207,000 or 16.1% to $6,291,000 in 2002 from $7,498,000 in 2001.
This decrease is largely due to a reduction in incentive compensation expense as
compared to 2001.

Discontinued Operations

increased by $7,653,000 to $8,286,000 in 2002
from $633,000 in 2001.  This is due to the gain on sale of Tara Village in 2002
of $8,061,000, partially offset by a reduction in operating income from such
property due to its sale in 2002.

Minority interests

decreased by $192,000 or 0.8% to $24,130,000 in
2002 from $24,322,000 in 2001. This is primarily due to the decrease in net
income of the Operating Partnership.

Net income

increased by $4,329,000 or 8.9% to
$52,874,000 in 2002 from $48,545,000 in 2001. The increase in net income is
mainly attributable to the factors noted above and the gain on sale of real
estate of $8,061,000 recognized in 2002 as compared to the gain on sale of real
estate of $3,788,000 recognized in 2001.

Comparison of Year Ended December 31, 2001 to Year Ended
December 31, 2000

Average financial occupancy rates of the Company's multifamily "2001/2000
Same Store Properties" (properties consolidated by the Company for each of the
years ended December 31, 2001 and 2000) decreased to 95.1% for the year ended
December 31, 2001 from 96.8% for the year ended December 31, 2000. Financial
occupancy is defined as the percentage resulting from dividing actual rental
revenue by total possible rental revenue. Actual rental revenue represents
contractual rental revenue pursuant to leases without considering delinquency
and concessions. Total possible rental revenue represents the value of all
apartment units, with occupied units valued at contractual rental rates pursuant
to leases and vacant units valued at estimated market rents. We believe that
financial occupancy is a meaningful measure of occupancy because it considers
the value of each vacant unit at its estimated market rate. Financial occupancy
may not completely reflect short-term trends in physical occupancy and financial
occupancy rates as disclosed by other REITs may not be comparable to our
calculation of financial occupancy.


The regional breakdown of financial occupancy for the
2001/2000 Same Store Properties for the years ended December 31, 2001 and 2000
are as follows:

______

(1) Also includes two office buildings, redevelopment communities and
development communities.

As set forth in the above table, $8,804,000 of the $26,683,000 net increase
in total revenues is attributable to properties acquired or disposed of
subsequent to January 1, 2000, the two commercial properties, redevelopment
communities and development communities. During this period, the Company
acquired interests in 20 properties and achieved stabilized operations at six
development communities, (the "Acquisition Properties"), and disposed of three
retail shopping centers (the "Disposition Properties").

Of the increase in total revenues, $6,696,000 is attributable to increases in
property revenues from the 2001/2000 Same Store Properties. Property revenues
from the 2001/2000 Same Store Properties increased by approximately 5.2% to
$135,727,000 in 2001 from $129,031,000 in 2000. A significant portion of this
increase was attributable to the 14 multifamily 2001/2000 Same Store Properties
located in Southern California; the property revenues of these properties
increased by $3,832,000 or 7.3% to $56,646,000 in 2001 from $52,814,000 in 2000.
This $3,832,000 increase is primarily attributable to rental rate increases,
which were offset by a decrease in average financial occupancy to 95.1% in 2001
from 96.2% in 2000. The 15 multifamily 2001/2000 Same Store Properties located
in Northern California accounted for the next largest contribution to the Same
Store Properties revenues increased. The property revenues of these properties
increased by $2,243,000 or 5.5 % to $43,338,000 in 2001 from $41,095,000 in
2000. This $2,243,000 increase is primarily attributable to rental rate
increases, which were offset by a decrease in average financial occupancy to
95.4% in 2001 from 98.0% in 2000. The 19 multifamily 2001/2000 Same Store
Properties located in the Pacific Northwest accounted for the next largest
contribution to the 2001/2000 Same Store Properties revenues increase. The
property revenues of these properties increased by $621,000 or 1.8% to
$35,743,000 in 2001 from $35,122,000 in 2000. This $621,000 increase is
attributable to rental rate increases, which were offset by a decrease in
average financial occupancy to 94.5% in 2001 from 95.9% in 2000.


The increase in total revenue also reflected an increase of $11,183,000
attributable to interest and other income, which primarily relates to income and
fees earned on the Company's investments in joint ventures and interest income
earned on outstanding notes receivable and cash balances.

Total expenses

increased by $21,815,000 or approximately 19.3% to
$135,093,000 in 2001 from $113,278,000 in 2000. The most significant factor
contributing to this increase was the growth in the Company's multifamily
portfolio from 83 properties (18,673 units) at January 1, 2001 to 92 properties
(20,762 units) at December 31, 2001. Interest expense increased by $8,702,000 or
29.0% to $38,746,000 in 2001 from $30,044,000 in 2000. Such interest expense
increase was primarily due to the net addition of mortgage debt in connection
with property acquisitions and investments. Property operating expenses, exclusive of
depreciation and amortization, increased by $6,186,000 or 13.4% to $52,277,000 in 2001 from
$46,091,000 in 2000. Of such increase, $4,624,000 is attributable to properties
acquired or disposed of subsequent to January 1, 2000, and the balance is
attributable to an increase in operating expenses for the 2001/2000 Same Store
Properties. Property operating expenses, exclusive of depreciation and
amortization, as a percentage of property revenues were 28.8% for 2001 and 27.8%
for 2000. Depreciation and amortization increased by $5,473,000 or approximately
18.0% to $35,915,000 in 2001 from $30,442,000 in 2000, primarily due to the
acquisition of assets. General and administrative expenses represent the costs
of the Company's various acquisition and administrative departments as well as
corporate and partnership administration and non-operating expenses. Such
expenses increased by $1,436,000 in 2001 from the amount incurred in 2000. This
increase is largely due to additional staffing requirements resulting from the
growth of the Company. General and administrative expenses as a percentage of
total revenues were 3.7 % for 2001 and 3.4% for 2000.

Minority interests

increased by $636,000 or 2.7% to $24,322,000 in
2001 from $23,686,000 in 2000. This is primarily due to the increase in net
income of the Company.

Net income

increased by $4,192,000 to $48,545,000 in 2001 from
$44,353,000 in 2000. Net income for 2001 included a gain on sales of real estate
of $3,788,000 as compared with $4,022,000 in 2000. Net operating income of the
Acquisition Properties and the increase in net operating income from the Same
Store Properties represent the largest contributions to the increase in net
income.

Liquidity and Capital Resources Including Non-consolidated
Investments

At December 31, 2002, the Company had $8,562,000 of unrestricted cash
and cash equivalents. The Company expects to meet its short-term liquidity
requirements by using its working capital, cash generated from operations, and
amounts available under lines of credit or other financings. The Company
believes that its current net cash flows will be adequate to meet operating
requirements and to provide for payment of dividends by the Company in
accordance with REIT qualification requirements. The Company expects to meet its
long-term liquidity requirements relating to property acquisitions and
development (beyond the next 12 months) and balloon debt maturities by using a
combination of some or all of the following sources: working capital, amounts
available on lines of credit, net proceeds from public and private debt and
equity issuances, and proceeds from the disposition of properties that may be
sold from time to time. There can, however, be no assurance that the Company
will have access to the debt and equity markets in a timely fashion to meet such
future funding requirements or that future working capital and borrowings under
the lines of credit will be available, or if available, will be sufficient to
meet the Company's requirements or that the Company will be able to dispose of
properties in a timely manner and under terms and conditions that the Company
deems acceptable.


The Company has two outstanding unsecured lines of credit for an aggregate
amount of $195,000,000. The first line, in the amount of $165,000,000, matures
in May 2004, with an option to extend it for one year thereafter. Outstanding
balances under this line of credit bear interest at a rate, which uses a tiered
rate structure tied to the Company's corporate ratings, if any, and leverage
rating, which has been priced at LIBOR plus 1.10% during 2002 and LIBOR plus
1.15% during 2001. At December 31, 2002 the Company had $96,500,000 outstanding
on this line of credit. A second line of credit in the amount of $30,000,000
matures in December 2003. Outstanding balances, if any, on this second line bear
interest based on a tiered rate structure currently at LIBOR plus 1.10%. At
December 31, 2002 the Company had $30,000,000 outstanding on this line of
credit. At December 31, 2002, these lines of credit bore interest rates of
approximately 2.6%. The credit agreements contain debt covenants related to
limitations on indebtedness and liabilities, maintenance of minimum levels of
consolidated earnings before depreciation, interest and amortization and
maintenance of minimum tangible net worth.

In addition, the Fund, the investment fund managed by the Company, has an
unsecured line of credit for an aggregate amount of $125,000,000. This line
matures in December 2003. The line bears interest at LIBOR plus 0.875%. As of
December 31 2002, the line had an outstanding balance of $86,399,000. The line
provides for debt covenants relating to limitations on mortgage indebtedness.

In addition to the Company's unsecured lines of credit, the Company had
$677,563,000 of secured indebtedness at December 31, 2002. Such indebtedness
consisted of $618,143,000 in fixed rate debt with interest rates varying from
5.5% to 8.2% and maturity dates ranging from 2003 to 2026. The indebtedness also
includes $59,420,000 of tax-exempt variable rate demand bonds with interest
rates paid during 2002 ranging from approximately 4.5% to 5.5% and maturity
dates ranging from 2020 to 2026. The tax-exempt variable rate demand bonds are
capped at interest rates ranging from 7.1% to 7.3%.

The Company's unrestricted cash balance increased by $2,122,000 from
$6,440,000 as of December 31, 2001 to $8,562,000 as of December 31, 2002. The
Company generated $85,730,000 in cash from operating activities, used $85,718,000 of
cash in investing activities and generated $2,110,000 in of cash from financing
activities. Of the $85,718,000 net cash used in investing activities,
$44,864,000 was received as repayments of notes from investees, other related
parties and other receivables, and $41,221,000 was received as net distributions
from investments in corporations and limited partnerships. These proceeds were
offset by $51,917,000 used to fund real estate under development and $96,637,000
used in the acquisition of the Sachs' Portfolio. The $2,110,000 net cash provided by
financing activities was primarily a result of $221,640,000 of proceeds from
mortgages and other notes payable as offset by$120,877,000 of repayments of mortgages
and other notes payable and lines of credit, $55,603,000 of dividends paid,
$25,184,000 of distributions to minority interest partners and $19,715,000 in
shares repurchased by Operating Partnership.

Non-revenue generating capital expenditures are improvements and upgrades
that extend the useful life of the property and are not related to preparing a
multifamily property unit to be rented to a tenant. For the year ended December
31, 2002, non-revenue generating capital expenditures totaled approximately $354
per weighted average occupancy unit. The Company expects to incur approximately
$360 per weighted average occupancy unit in non-revenue generating capital
expenditures for the year ended December 31, 2003. These expenditures do not
include the improvements required in connection with the origination of mortgage
loans, expenditures for acquisition properties' renovations and improvements,
which are expected to generate additional revenue, and renovation expenditures
required pursuant to tax-exempt bond financings. The Company expects that cash
from operations and/or its lines of credit will fund such expenditures. However,
there can be no assurance that the actual expenditures incurred during 2003
and/or the funding thereof will not be significantly different than the
Company's current expectations.

The Company is currently developing six multifamily residential projects,
with an aggregate of 1,518 multifamily units. Such projects involve certain
risks inherent in real estate development. See "Other Matters/ Risk Factors--
Risks that Development Activities Will be Delayed or Not Completed and/or Fail
to Achieve Expected Results" in Item 1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for
the year ended December 31, 2002. In connection with these development projects,
the Company has directly, or in some cases through its joint venture partners
entered into contractual construction related commitments with unrelated third
parties and the total projected estimated cost for these projects is
approximately $299,000,000. As of December 31, 2002, the remaining commitment to
fund these development projects is approximately $118,500,000, of which
approximately $51,200,000 is the Company's commitment. The Company expects to
fund such commitments by using a combination of some or all of the following
sources: its working capital, amounts available on its lines of credit, net
proceeds from public and private equity and debt issuances, and proceeds from
the disposition of properties, if any.

On December 17, 2002, the Company acquired, by merger, John M. Sachs, Inc.
("Sachs Portfolio") resulting in the acquisition of its real estate
portfolio, which consists of 20 multifamily properties, five recreational
vehicle parks, two manufactured housing communities and two small office
buildings. The cost of the transaction was $306.7 million and was structured as
a tax-free reorganization whereby the Company: (i) issued 2,719,875 shares of
its common stock valued at $136.8 million, (ii) assumed mortgages on four of the
newly acquired properties for approximately $64.6 million with a fixed interest
rate of 5.51%, maturing in January 2013, (iii) assumed and repaid unsecured
liabilities in the amount of approximately $33 million, and (iv) paid the
balance in cash of $72.2 million. The cash portion was funded through four new
non-recourse mortgages on four previously unencumbered properties, with a
weighted average interest rate of 5.64%, maturing in January 2013 and draws upon
new and existing lines of credit. The Company accounted for this transaction
using the purchase method of accounting; which resulted in the allocation of the
purchase price to the assets and liabilities acquired based on their fair
values.  The fair value of assets and liabilities were based on management's
evaluation.  No goodwill was recognized in connection with this purchase. The
Company's results of operations for the period December 17, 2002 through
December 31, 2002 included the Sachs Portfolio.


Pursuant to existing shelf registration statements, the Company has the
capacity to issue up to $342,000,000 of equity securities and the Operating
Partnership has the capacity to issue up to $250,000,000 of debt securities.

The Company pays quarterly dividends from cash available for distribution.
Until it is distributed, cash available for distribution is invested by the
Company primarily in short-term investment grade securities or is used by the
Company to reduce balances outstanding under its line of credit.

Essex Apartment Value Fund, L.P. (the "Fund"), is an investment fund managed
organized by the Company in 2001. The Fund will be, subject to specific
exceptions, the Company's exclusive investment vehicle for new investments until
the Fund's committed capital has been invested or committed for investments, or
if earlier, December 31, 2003. The Fund has total capital commitments of $250
million and is expected to utilize leverage of approximately 65% of the value of
the underlying real estate portfolio. The Company is committed to invest 21.4%
of the aggregate capital committed to the Fund. In addition, Essex will be
compensated by the Fund for its asset management, property management,
development and redevelopment services and may receive incentive distributions
if the Fund exceeds certain financial return benchmarks. The Company's remaining
unfunded capital commitment as of December 31, 2002 is approximately $42.3
million.

In May 2001, the Company's Board of Directors authorized the Operating
Partnership to purchase from time to time shares of the Company's Common Stock,
in an amount up to $50,000,000, at a price not to exceed $48.00 per share in the
open market or through negotiated or block transactions. The timing of any
repurchase will depend on the market price and other market conditions and
factors.  Essex expects to use working capital or proceeds from the sale of
properties to provide funds for this program.  The purpose of the program is to
acquire stock related to real estate transactions involving the issuance of
partnership units in the Operating Partnership and similar interests. This
program supersedes its common stock repurchase plan as announced on March 25,
1999.  In October 2001, March 2002 and July 2002 the Operating Partnership
acquired 100,700, 10,500 and 400,000 shares of the Company's outstanding Common
Stock, respectively.  The weighted average exercise price paid for these
repurchase was approximately $48.00 per share.  Pursuant to these acquisitions,
since May 2001 and through December 2002, the Operating Partnership has
purchased $24,536,000 of the $50,000,000 aggregate amount authorized for
repurchase by the Board of Directors. The amount paid for the shares is
reflected as a reduction of the common stock and additional-paid-in-capital in
the Company's consolidated balance sheets.

The Company invests in joint ventures, which generally involve single
multifamily property acquisitions. The Company accounts for these investments
under the equity or consolidation methods of accounting based on the voting
control it exercises through its ownership interests in these affiliates. Under
the equity method of accounting, the investment is carried at the cost of assets
contributed or distributed, plus the Company's equity in undistributed earnings
or losses since its initial investment. The individual assets, liabilities,
revenues and expenses of the joint venture are not recorded in the Company's
consolidated financial statements.

At December 31, 2002 and 2001, the Company did not have any other
relationship with unconsolidated entities or financial partnership, such as
entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities,
which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance
sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. As such,
the Company is not materially exposed to any financing, liquidity, market or
credit risk that could arise if the Company had engaged in such relationships.

Included in the Company's investments accounted for under the equity method
investments are limited partnership interests in 17 partnerships (Down REIT
entities), which collectively own ten multifamily properties, comprised of 1,831
units. These investments were made under arrangements whereby Essex Management
Corporation (EMC) became the general partner, the Operating Partnership became a
special minority interest limited partner, and the other limited partners were
granted rights of redemption for their interests. Such partners can request to
be redeemed and the Company can elect to redeem their rights for cash or by
issuing shares of its common stock on a one share per unit basis. Conversion
values will be based on the market value of the Company's common stock at the
time of redemption multiplied by the number of units stipulated under the above
arrangements. The other limited partners receive distributions based on the
Company's current dividend rate times the number of redemption shares. At
December 31, 2002, the maximum number of shares that could be required to meet
redemption of these Down REIT entities is 1,474,515. The equity in income or
loss reported by the Company under the equity method of accounting for these
down REIT entities is the net income of these down REIT entities as reduced by
the income allocated to the other limited partners which is equal to the
distributions they received.

New Accounting Pronouncements

In June 2001, the FASB issued FAS 143, "Accounting for Asset
Retirement Obligations." Under FAS 143, the fair value of a liability for
an asset retirement obligation must be recognized in the period in which it is
incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made. The associated
asset retirement costs are capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the
long-lived asset. FAS 143 is effective for fiscal years beginning after June 15,
2002. The Company does not believe that FAS 143 will have a material impact on
their financial position or results of operations.

In April 2002, the FASB issued FAS 145, "Rescission of FASB Statements
No. 4, 44, and 64, Amendment of FAS Statement No. 13, and Technical
Correction." FAS 145 eliminates the presumption that all early
extinguishments of debt are to be reported as extraordinary items, and amends
other existing authoritative pronouncements to make various technical
corrections, clarifies meanings, or describes their applicability under changed
conditions. The provisions of FAS 145 are effective for the Company with the
beginning of fiscal year 2003. Debt extinguishments reported as extraordinary
items prior to scheduled adoption of FAS 145 would be reclassified in most cases following
adoption. The Company does not anticipate the reclassification of previously recognized
extraordinary losses to have a significant impact on their results of operations.

In July 2002, the FASB issued FAS 146, "Accounting For Costs Associated
With Exit Or Disposal Activities." FAS 146 addresses financial accounting
and reporting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities. Under FAS
146, a commitment to an exit or disposal plan no longer will be a sufficient
basis for recording a liability for those activities. The provisions of FAS 146
are effective for the Company with the beginning of fiscal year 2003. The
Company does not anticipate a significant impact on their financial position or
results of operations from adopting FAS 146.

In December 2002, the FASB issued FAS 148, "Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation - Transition and Disclosure - an amendement of SFAS 123." FAS
148 amends FAS 123, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation," to
provide alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair
value based method of accounting for stock-based employee compensation.  In
addition, FAS 148 amends the disclosure requirements of FAS 123 to require
prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements about the
method of accounting for stock-based employee compensation and the effect of the
method used on reported results.  The disclosure requirements are effective for
interim and annual financial statements ending after December 15, 2002.

The other provisions of FAS 148 are effective for the Company with the beginning
of fiscal year 2003. We do not plan to change our method of accounting for stock options,
therefore the adoption of the remaining provisions of FAS 148 will not have an impact
on our financial position or results of operations.

In November 2002, the FASB approved for issuance FASB Interpretation No. 45 (FIN 45),
"Guarantor's Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees
of Indebtedness of Others." FIN 45 elaborates on the disclosures to be made by a guarantor
in its interim and annual financial statements about its obligations under certain guarantees
guarantees that it has issued. It also clarifies that a guarantor is required to recognize, at
the inception of a guarantee, a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken in
issuing the guarantee. The initial recognition and initial measurement provisions of FIN 45
are applicable on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after December 31, 2002.
The disclosure requirements are effective for financial statements of interim and annual periods
ending after December 15, 2002.

In January 2003, the FASB approved for issuance FASB Interpretation No. 46 (FIN 46),
"Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities." FIN 46 clarifies the application of Accounting
Research Bulletin No. 51, "Consolidated Financial Statements" to certain entities in which
equity investors do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not
do not sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional
subordinated financial support from other parties. FIN 46 applies immediately to variable
interest entities created after January 31, 2003, and to variable interest entities in which an
enterprise obtains an interest after that date. It applies in the first fiscal year or interim
period beginning after June 15, 2003, to variable interest entities in which an enterprise holds
a variable interest that it acquired before February 1, 2003. FIN 46 may be applied prospectively
with a cumulative-effect adjustment as of the date on which it is first applied or by
restating previously issued financial statements for one or more years with a cumulative-effect
adjustment as of the beginning of the first year restated.  The disclosure requirements of FIN
46 are effective effective for all financial statements initially issued after January 31, 2003.
It is possible that certain of the entities through which and with which the Company conducts
business, including those described in Notes 3(b) and 5 to the accompanying consolidated financial
statements will be deemed to be Variable Interest Entities (VIEs) under the provisions of FIN 46.
The total assets and liabilities of such entities were approximately $81,228,000 and $79,458,000
at December 31, 2002.  The Company's maximum exposure to loss would be equal to its investments
in these arrangements, plus the related debt guarantees, which totaled $29,239,000 as of December
31, 2002.  The disclosures provided reflect management's understanding and analysis of FIN 46
based upon information currently available. The evaluation of the Company's various arrangements
arrangements is ongoing and is subject to change in the event additional interpretive guidance
is provided by the Financial Accounting Standards Board or others.


Potential Factors Affecting Future Operating Results

Many factors affect the Company's actual financial performance and
may cause the Company's future results to be different from past performance or
trends. These factors include:

Economic Environment

Both the national economy and the economies of the western states in
which the Company owns, manages and develops properties have been and continue
to be in a recession. This has resulted in reduced occupancy rates, increased
concessions and reductions in market rental rates.

The Company's property type and diverse geographic locations provide some
degree of risk moderation but are not immune to a prolonged down cycle in the
real estate markets in which the Company operates. Although the Company believes
it is well positioned to meet the challenges ahead, it is possible that further
reductions in occupancy and market rental rates will result in reduction of
rental revenues, operating income, cash flows, and the market value of the
Company's shares. A prolonged recession could also affect the Company's ability
to obtain financing at acceptable rates of interest and to access funds from the
disposition of properties at acceptable disposition prices.

Interest Rate Fluctuations

The Company monitors changes in interest rates and believes that it
is well positioned from both a liquidity and interest rate risk perspective.
However, current interest rates are at historic lows and potentially could
increase rapidly to levels more in line with recent historic levels. The
immediate effect of significant and rapid interest rate increases would result
in higher interest expense on the Company's variable interest rate debt (see
Item 7A and Notes 7 and 8 to consolidated financial statements). The effect of
prolonged interest rate increases could negatively impact the Company's ability
to make acquisitions and develop properties at economic returns on investment
and the Company's ability to refinance existing borrowings at acceptable rates.


Inflation

Inflationary increases would likely have a negative effect on
property operating results and such increases may be at a greater rate than
property rental rates. The Company believes it effectively manages its property
and other expenses, but realizes that higher annual rates of inflation could
result in increases to operating expense.

Funds from Operations

Funds from Operations, as defined by the National Association of
Real Estate Investment Trusts ("NAREIT") is generally considered by
industry analysts as an appropriate measure of performance of an equity REIT.
Generally, Funds from Operations adjusts the net income of equity REITS for non-
cash charges such as depreciation and amortization of rental properties, gains/
losses on sales of real estate and extraordinary items. Management considers
Funds from Operations to be a useful financial performance measurement of an
equity REIT because, together with net income and cash flows, Funds from
Operations provides investors with an additional basis to evaluate the
performance of a REIT to incur and service debt and to fund acquisitions and
other capital expenditures. Funds from Operations does not represent net income
or cash flows from operations as defined by generally accepted accounting
principles (GAAP) and is not intended to indicate whether cash flows will be
sufficient to fund cash needs. It should not be considered as an alternative to
net income as an indicator of the REIT's operating performance or to cash flows
as a measure of liquidity. Funds from Operations does not measure whether cash
flow is sufficient to fund all cash needs including principal amortization,
capital improvements and distributions to shareholders. Funds from Operations
also does not represent cash flows generated from operating, investing or
financing activities as defined under GAAP. Further, Funds from Operations as
disclosed by other REITs may not be comparable to the Company's calculation of
Funds from Operations.

Operations for 2002, 2001 and 2000.

Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About
Market Risk

The Company is exposed to interest rate changes primarily as a result of
its line of credit and long-term debt used to maintain liquidity and fund
capital expenditures and expansion of the Company's real estate investment
portfolio and operations. The Company's interest rate risk management objective
is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and
to lower its overall borrowing costs. To achieve its objectives the Company
borrows primarily at fixed rates and may enter into derivative financial
instruments such as interest rate swaps, caps and treasury locks in order to
mitigate its interest rate risk on a related financial instrument. The Company
does not enter into derivative or interest rate transactions for speculative
purposes.

The Company's interest rate risk is monitored using a variety of techniques.
The table below presents the principal amounts and weighted average interest
rates by year of expected maturity to evaluate the expected cash flows and
sensitivity to interest rate changes.

For the Years Ended December 31
                            ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                             2003      2004     2005     2006     2007    Thereafter      Total    Fair value

The table incorporates only those exposures that exist as of December 31, 2002;
it does not consider those exposures or positions that could arise after that date.
As a result, our ultimate realized gain or loss, with respect to interest rate fluctuations,
would depend on the exposures that arise during the period, our hedging strategies at the
time, and interest rates.

Independent Auditors' Report

The Board of Directors

Essex Property Trust, Inc.:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Essex
Property Trust, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2002 and 2001, and the
related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders' equity, and cash
flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2002. In
connection with our audits of the consolidated financial statements, we have
also audited the related financial statement schedule of Real Estate and
Accumulated Depreciation. These consolidated financial
statements and the financial statement schedule are the responsibility of the
management of Essex Property Trust, Inc. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these consolidated financial statements and the financial statement
schedule based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally
accepted in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above
present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Essex
Property Trust, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2002 and 2001, and the
results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the
three-year period ended December 31, 2002, in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also, in our
opinion, the related financial statement schedule when considered in relation to
the consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly, in all
material respects, the information set forth therein.

ESSEX PROPERTY TRUST, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000

(Dollars in thousands, except for per share amounts)

(1) Organization and Basis of Presentation

The accompanying consolidated financial statements present the accounts
of Essex Property Trust, Inc. (the Company), which include the accounts of the
Company and Essex Portfolio, L.P. (the Operating Partnership, which holds the
operating assets of the Company). The Company was incorporated in the state of
Maryland in March 1994. On June 13, 1994, the Company commenced operations with
the completion of an initial public offering (the Offering) in which it issued
6,275,000 shares of common stock at $19.50 per share. The net proceeds of the
Offering of $112,070 were used to acquire a 77.2% general partnership interest
in the Operating Partnership.

The Company has a 90.0% general partner interest and the limited partners own
a 10.0% interest in the Operating Partnership as of December 31, 2002. The
limited partners may convert their 2,280,304 Operating Partnership units into an
equivalent number of shares of common stock. The Company has reserved shares of
common stock for such conversions. These conversion rights may be exercised by
the limited partners at any time through 2024.

On December 17, 2002, the Company acquired, by merger, John M. Sachs, Inc.
("Sachs Portfolio") resulting in the acquisition of its real estate
portfolio, which consists of 20 multifamily properties, five recreational
vehicle parks, two manufactured housing communities and two small office
buildings. The cost of the transaction was $306.7 million and was structured as
a tax-free reorganization whereby the Company: (i) issued 2,719,875 shares of
its common stock valued at $136.8 million, (ii) assumed mortgages on four of the
newly acquired properties for approximately $64.6 million with a fixed interest
rate of 5.51%, maturing in January 2013, (iii) assumed and repaid unsecured
liabilities in the amount of approximately $33 million, and (iv) paid the
balance in cash of $72.2 million. The cash portion was funded through four new
non-recourse mortgages on four previously unencumbered properties, with a
weighted average interest rate of 5.64%, maturing in January 2013 and draws upon
new and existing lines of credit. The Company accounted for this transaction
using the purchase method of accounting; which resulted in the allocation of the
purchase price to the assets and liabilities acquired based on their fair
values.  The fair value of assets and liabilities were based on management's
evaluation.  No goodwill was recognized in connection with this purchase.  The
Company's results of operations for the period December 17, 2002 through
December 31, 2002 include the Sachs Portfolio.

Unaudited pro forma information reflecting the acquisition of the Sachs
Portfolio is presented in the following table. The amounts included therein
assume that the acquisition had taken place at the beginning of the year.

The Company operates and has ownership interest in 112 multifamilly properties
(containing 23,699 units), five recreational vehicle parks
(containing 1,717 spaces), four office buildings (totaling approximately 63,540
square feet), and two manufactured housing communities (containing 607 sites)
(collectively, the Properties). The Properties are located in Northern
California (the San Francisco Bay Area), Southern California (Los Angeles,
Ventura, Orange, and San Diego counties), the Pacific Northwest (Seattle,
Washington, and Portland, Oregon metropolitan areas) and other areas (Hemet,
California, Las Vegas, Nevada and Houston, Texas).

F-7

Essex Apartment Value Fund, L.P. (the "Fund"), is an investment
fund organized by the Company in 2001. The Fund will be, subject to specific
exceptions, the Company's exclusive investment vehicle for new investments until
the Fund's committed capital has been invested or committed for investments, or
if earlier, December 31, 2003. The Fund has total capital commitments of $250
million and is expected to utilize leverage of approximately 65% of the value of
the underlying real estate portfolio.  The Company is committed to invest 21.4%
of the aggregate capital committed to the Fund.  In addition, Essex will be
compensated by the Fund for its asset management, property management,
development and redevelopment services and may receive incentive payments if the
Fund exceeds certain financial return benchmarks. The Company accounts for its
investment in the Fund following the equity method.

All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated
in the consolidated financial statements.

(2) Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

(a) Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

The preparation of consolidated financial statements, in accordance
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America,
requires the Company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported
amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosures of
contingent assets and liabilities. On an on-going basis, the Company evaluates
its estimates, including those related to acquiring, developing and assessing
the carrying values of its real estate properties, its investments in and
advances to joint ventures and affiliates, and its qualification as a Real
Estate Investment Trust ("REIT"). The Company bases its estimates on
historical experience, current market conditions, and on various other
assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual
results may vary from those estimates and those estimates could be different
under different assumptions or conditions.

(b) Real Estate Rental Properties and Discontinued
Operations

Rental properties are recorded at cost less accumulated depreciation.
Depreciation on rental properties has been provided over estimated useful lives
ranging from 3 to 30 years using the straight-line method. Development costs
include acquisition, direct and indirect construction costs, interest and real
estate taxes incurred during the construction and property stabilization
periods.

Maintenance and repair expenses that do not add to the value or prolong the
useful life of the property are expensed as incurred. Asset replacements and
improvements are capitalized and depreciated over their estimated useful lives.

Certain rental properties are pledged as collateral for the related mortgage
notes payable.

Whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount
of a property held for investment may not be fully recoverable, the carrying
amount will be evaluated. If the sum of the property's expected future cash
flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) is less than the carrying
amount of the property, then the Company will recognize an impairment loss equal
to the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of the property.

The Company presents income and gains/losses on properties sold as
discontinued operations net of minority interests. Real estate investments
accounted for under the equity method of accounting remain classified in
continuing operations upon disposition.

F-8

(c) Investments and Joint Ventures

The Company owns investments in joint ventures and affiliates and has
significant influence but does not have voting control. Therefore, we account
for our interest using the equity method of accounting. Under the equity method
of accounting, the investment is carried at the cost of assets contributed or
distributed, plus the Company's equity in undistributed earnings or losses since
its initial investment. The Company's share of equity in income and gain on sales of
real estate are included in other income in the Company's accompanying consolidated
statement of operations.

(d) Revenues and Gains on Sale of Real Estate

Rental revenue is reported on the accrual basis of accounting.

Revenue from tenants renting or leasing apartment units is
recorded when due from tenants and is recognized monthly as it is earned, which
is not materially different than on a straight-line basis. Apartment units are
rented under short-term leases (generally, lease terms of 6 to 12 months) and
may provide for no rent for the first month, depending on the market conditions
and leasing practices of our competitors in each sub-market at the time the
leases are executed.

The Company recognizes gains on sales of real estate when a contract is in
place, a closing has taken place, the buyer's initial and continuing investment
is adequate to demonstrate a commitment to pay for the property and the Company
does not have a substantial continuing involvement in the property.

(e) Income Taxes

Generally in any year in which the Company qualifies as a real estate
investment trust (REIT) under the Internal Revenue Code (the Code), it is not
subject to federal income tax on that portion of its income that it distributes
to stockholders. No provision for federal income taxes has been made in the
accompanying consolidated financial statements for each of the three years in
the period ended December 31, 2002, as the Company believes it qualifies under
the code as a REIT and has made distributions during the periods in excess of
its taxable income.

Cash dividends distributed for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001, and
2000 are classified for tax purposes as follows:

2002      2001      2000
                           --------- --------- ---------
      Taxable portion.....   100.00%   100.00%   100.00%
      Return of capital...       --        --        --
                           --------- --------- ---------
                             100.00%   100.00%   100.00%
                           ========= ========= =========

(f) Notes Receivable and Interest Income

Notes receivable relate to real estate financing arrangements that
exceed one year. They bear interest at a market rate based on the borrower's
credit quality and are recorded at face value. Interest is recognized over the
life of the note. The Company requires collateral for the notes.

A note is considered impaired pursuant to Financial Accounting Standards
Board's (FASB) Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 114,
Accounting by Creditors for Impairment of a Loan. Pursuant to SFAS No. 114,
a note is impaired if it is probable that the Company will not collect all
principal and interest contractually due. The impairment is measured based on
the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the note's
effective interest rate. The Company does not accrue interest when a note is
considered impaired. When ultimate collectibility of the principal balance of
the impaired note is in doubt, all cash receipts on impaired notes are applied
to reduce the principal amount of such notes until the principal has been
recovered and are recognized as interest income, thereafter.

F-9

(g) Interest Rate Protection, Swap, and Forward
Contracts

The Company has from time to time used interest rate protection, swap
and forward contracts to manage its interest rate exposure on current or
identified future debt transactions. Prior to January 1, 2001, amounts paid in
connection with such contracts were capitalized and amortized over the term of
the contract or related debt. If the original contract was terminated, the gain
or loss on termination was deferred and amortized over the remaining term of the
contract. If the related debt was repaid, the unamortized portion of the
deferred amount was charged to income or the contract was marked to market, as
appropriate.

The Company adopted SFAS 133 "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and
Hedging Activities" effective January 1, 2001. Under SFAS 133 derivative
instruments are required to be included in the balance sheet at fair value. The
changes in the fair value of the derivatives are accounted for depending on the
use of the derivative and whether it has been designated and qualifies as a part
of a hedging relationship. If the hedged exposure is a cash flow exposure,
changes in fair value of the effective portion of the gain or loss on the
derivative instrument are reported initially as a component of other
comprehensive income and subsequently reclassified into earnings when the
forecasted transaction affects earnings. Changes in the ineffective portion of
the gain or loss are reported in earnings immediately.

(h) Deferred Charges

Deferred charges are principally comprised of loan fees and related
costs which are amortized over the terms of the related borrowing in a manner
which approximates the effective interest method.

(i) Interest

The Company capitalized $6,139, $3,917, and $2,906 of interest
related to the development of real estate during 2002, 2001, and 2000,
respectively.

(j) Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash

Highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or
less when purchased are classified as cash equivalents. Restricted cash relates
to reserve requirements in connection with the Company's tax exempt variable
rate bond financings.

F-10

(k) Minority Interest

Minority interest includes the 10.0% and 11.0% limited partner
interest in the Operating Partnership not held by the Company at December 31,
2002 and 2001, respectively. The Company periodically adjusts the carrying value
of minority interest in the Operating Partnership to reflect its share of the book
value of the Operating Partnership. Such adjustments are recorded to stockholders'
equity as a reallocation of minority interest in the Operating Partnership in the
accompanying consolidated statement of stockholders' equity.  The minority interest
balance also includes the Operating Partnership's cummulative redemable preferred
units (note 9).

(l) Stock-based Compensation

The Company applies APB Opinion No. 25 (APB 25) and related
interpretations in accounting for its stock-based compensation plans granted to
employees and directors. Under APB 25, no compensation cost has been recognized
for stock options granted to employees and directors since all such stock
options were granted with an exercise price equal to the fair market value of
the underlying common stock. For the Company's other plans, compensation expense
recognized during the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001, and 2000 was $646,
$0, and $0, respectively. Had compensation cost for these stock options
and the Company's other plans been determined based on the fair value at the
grant dates consistent with the fair value method pursuant to FAS 123, the
Company's net income applicable to common stockholders for the years ended
December 31, 2002, 2001, and 2000 would have been reduced to the pro forma
amounts indicated below:

2002       2001       2000
                                         ---------  ---------  ---------
Net income availabe to common stockholders:
    As reported........................ $  52,874  $  48,545  $  44,107
    Pro forma..........................    52,369     48,024     43,665

Basic earnings per common share:
    As reported........................ $    2.85  $    2.63  $    2.42
    Pro forma..........................      2.83       2.60       2.39

Diluted earnings per common share:
    As reported........................ $    2.82  $    2.59  $    2.37
    Pro forma..........................      2.80       2.56       2.35

Weighted-average fair value of stock
  options granted during the year...... $    4.69  $    5.82  $    7.57

Fair value of junior stock
  (Series Z units) granted............. $      --  $   16.16  $      --

The fair value of stock options granted each year was estimated
on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the
following weighted average assumptions used for grants: risk-free interest rates
ranging from 3.08% to 4.62% in 2002, from 3.54% to 4.96% in 2001, and from 5.67%
to 6.72% in 2000; expected lives of 6 years for 2002, 6 years for 2001 and 6
years for 2000; volatility of 18.92% for 2002, 18.93% for 2001 and 19.26% for
2000; and dividend yield of 6.3% for 2002, 5.7% for 2001 and 4.3% for 2000.

F-11

(m) New Accounting Pronouncements Adopted

The Company adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board's ("FASB")
Statement of Financial Accounting Standard ("FAS")144, "Accounting for the
Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets" on January 1, 2002.  FAS 144 supersedes
FAS 121, "Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets
to Be Disposed of." The primary objectives of FAS 144 are to develop one accounting model
based on the framework established in FAS 121 for long-lived assets to be disposed of by
sale, and to address significant implementation issues regarding impairment of long-lived
assets held for use.  FAS 144 requires discontinued operations presentation for an operating
property considered held for sale beginning on January 1, 2002. In accordance with FAS 144,
the Company classifies real estate assets as held for sale in the period in which all of
the following criteria are met: (a) management, having the authority to approve the action,
commits to a plan to sell the asset; (b) the asset is available for immediate sale in its present
condition subject only to terms that are usual and customary for sale of such assets; (c)
an active program to locate a buyer and other actions required to complete the plan to sell
the asset have been initiated; (d) the sale of the asset is probable and the transfer of the
asset is expected to qualify for recognition as a completed sale within one year; (e) the asset
is being actively marketed for sale at a price that is reasonable in relation to its current
fair market; and (f) actions required to complete the plan indicate that it is unlikely
that significant changes to the plan will be made or the plan with be withdrawn.

When the Company determines that a real estate asset is held for sale, it
discontinues the periodic depreciation of the property. Real estate assets held for sale
are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or estimated fair value less costs to sell.

The Company's adoption of FAS 144 resulted in: (i) the presentation of the net
operating results of properties sold during the year ended December 31, 2002, less allocated
interest expense, as income from discontinued operations for all periods presented and (ii)
the presentation of the gain on sale of operating properties sold, net of sale costs, as
income form discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2002. The Company
allocated interest expense based on the percentage of the cost basis of properties sold
to the total cost basis of real estate assets as of the approximate date of their sale, and
pro-rated the allocated interest for the number of days prior to sale. Implementation of FAS
144 only impacted the income statement classification but had no effect on results of operations.

In December of 2002, the FASB 148, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation -
Transition and Disclosure - an amendment of SFAS 123."  FAS 148 amends FAS 123, "Accounting
for Stock-Based Compensation," to provide alternative methods of transition for a voluntary
change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock-based employee compensation.
In addition, FAS 148 amends the disclosure requirements of FAS 123 to require prominent
disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting
for stock-based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results.
The disclosure requirements are effective for interim and annual financial statements ending
after December 15, 2002. The other provisions of FAS 148 are effective for the Company
with the beginning of fiscal year 2003. The Company does not plan to change its method
of accounting for stock options therefore, the adoption of the remaining provisions
of FAS 148 will not have an impact on our financial position or results of operations.

In November 2002, the FASB approved for issuance FASB Interpretation No. 45
(FIN 45), "Guarantor's Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for
Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others." FIN
45 elaborates on the disclosures to be made by a guarantor in its interim and
annual financial statements about its obligations under certain guarantees that
it has issued. It also clarifies that a guarantor is required to recognize, at
the inception of a guarantee, a liability for the fair value of the obligation
undertaken in issuing the guarantee. The initial recognition and initial
measurement provisions of FIN 45 are applicable on a prospective basis to
guarantees issued or modified after December 31, 2002.  The disclosure
requirements are effective for financial statements of interim and annual
periods ending after December 15, 2002.

In January 2003, the FASB approved for issuance FASB Interpretation No. 46
(FIN 46), "Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities." FIN 46
clarifies the application of Accounting Research Bulletin No. 51,
"Consolidated Financial Statements" to certain entities in which
equity investors do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial
interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its
activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties.
FIN 46 applies immediately to variable interest entities created after January
31, 2003, and to variable interest entities in which an enterprise obtains an
interest after that date. It applies in the first fiscal year or interim period
beginning after June 15, 2003, to variable interest entities in which an
enterprise holds a variable interest that it acquired before February 1, 2003.
FIN 46 may be applied prospectively with a cumulative-effect adjustment as of
the date on which it is first applied or by restating previously issued
financial statements for one or more years with a cumulative-effect adjustment
as of the beginning of the first year restated.  The disclosure requirements of
FIN 46 are effective for all financial statements initially issued after January

arrangements and through two separate private REITs, Newport Beach North, Inc.
and Newport Beach South, Inc., received an approximate 49.9% equity interest in
each. Generally, profit and loss are allocated to the partners in accordance

incentive payments based on the financial success of the joint ventures.

F-13

In December 1999, the Company entered into a joint venture arrangement (AEW
joint venture) and received an approximate 20% equity interest in the joint
venture. The Company contributed its investment in Riverfront Apartments, Casa
Mango Apartments, and Westwood Apartments into the joint venture. The Company
also contributed land and development rights for a development community, Tierra
Vista, located in Oxnard, California. The AEW joint venture completed
construction and reached stabilized operations of Tierra Vista in 2001. On April
17, 2002, Riverfront Apartments and Casa Mango Apartments were sold to an
unrelated third party.  The combined sales price was approximately $52,000.  The
buyer of these two properties assumed two non-recourse mortgages in the
cumulative amount of approximately $26,500, with a 6.5% fixed interest rate,
which matures in February 2009.  The Company's equity in income from the gain on
the sale of real estate is $2,000 and is presented as interest and other income
in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations.  The Company
contributed the assets to the joint venture in December 1999 at costs of
approximately $41,000.  In addition, the Company earned a fee in conjunction
with the sale of these assets in the amount of $1,110 and this fee is presented
as interest and other income in the accompanying consolidated statement of
operations. In the third quarter of 2002, the Company recognized an incentive
fee it earned related specifically to these two asset sales in the amount of
$475. Generally, profit and loss are allocated to the partners in accordance
with their ownership interests. In addition to its equity earnings, the Company
is entitled to management, redevelopment and development fees from the joint
venture and incentive payments based on the financial success of the joint
venture.

The Company holds limited partnership interests in 17 partnerships which
collectively own ten multifamily properties, comprised of 1,831 units (Down REIT
entities). These investments were made under arrangements whereby Essex
Management Corporation (EMC) became the general partner, the Operating
Partnership became a special limited partner, and the other limited partners
were granted rights of redemption for their interests. Such partners can request
to be redeemed and the Company can elect to redeem their rights for cash or by
issuing shares of its common stock on a one unit per share basis. Redemption
values will be based on the market value of the Company's common stock at the
time of redemption multiplied by the number of units stipulated under the above
arrangements. The other limited partners receive distributions based on the
Company's current dividend rate times the number of redemption shares. The
equity in income or loss reported by the Company under the equity method of
accounting by these down REIT entities is the net income of these down REIT
entities as reduced by the income allocated to the other limited partners which
is equal to the distributions they received.

F-14

The Company has investments in two taxable REIT subsidiaries, EMC and Essex
Fidelity I Corporation (EFC). The Company has a 99% economic interest in these

In October 1997, the Company entered into four forward treasury contracts for an
aggregate notional amount of $60,000, locking the 10-year treasury rate at between
6.15% and 6.26%.  These contracts were entered into to
limit the interest rate exposure on identified future debt financing
requirements relating to real estate under development and the refinancing of a
$18,101 fixed rate loan. These contracts were settled by June 2000. During 2000,
the four contracts were sold, resulting in a net realized gain of $1,384, which
is being amortized over the life of the related debt.

During the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001, and 2000, the Company
refinanced various mortgages and incurred a loss on the early extinguishment of
debt of $0, $0, and $119 related to the write-off of the unamortized mortgage
loan fees and prepayment penalties.

Through 1999, the Company purchased interest rate cap contracts in order to
reduce the risks associated with increases in interest rates on its tax exempt
variable rate demand bonds. The Company has the right to receive cash if
interest rates increase above a specified level. The purpose of the caps is to
hedge the exposure to variability in expected future interest cash flows above a
fixed interest rate, and, accordingly, they are accounted for as cash flow
hedges under SFAS 133. The Company determines the fair value of the caps and
assesses the ineffectiveness of the hedge based on changes in the time value of
the caps. As of January 1, 2001, there were no changes in the intrinsic value of
the caps since the date the caps were purchased, and the changes in fair value
of the caps is attributable entirely to changes in time value. The amortized
cost of the cap contracts exceeded their fair value by approximately $450, which
resulted in a transition adjustment (charge to earnings) of that amount in the
quarter ended March 31, 2001.

(8) Lines of Credit

The Company has two outstanding unsecured lines of credit for an
aggregate amount of $195,000. The first line, in the amount of $165,000, matures
in May 2004, with an option to extend it for one year thereafter. Outstanding
balances under this line of credit bear interest at a rate which uses a tiered
rate structure tied to the Company corporate ratings, if any, and leverage
rating, which has been priced at LIBOR + 1.10% during 2002 and LIBOR + 1.15%
2001. As of December 31, 2002 and 2001, the interest rate was approximately 2.6%
and 3.0%, respectively. As of December 31, 2002 and 2001, the Company had
$96,500 and $44,459 outstanding on this line of credit, respectively. A second
line of credit in the amount of $30,000 matures in December 2003. Outstanding
balances, if any, on this second line bear interest based on a tiered-rate
structure currently at LIBOR plus 1.10%. As of December 31, 2002, the
interest rate was approximately 2.6%. As of December 31, 2002 and 2001,
the Company had $30,000 outstanding on this line of credit, respectively.
The Company had no outstanding letters of credit as of December 31, 2002. As of
December 31, 2002, the 30-day LIBOR rate was approximately 1.5%.

The credit agreements contain debt covenants related to limitations on
indebtedness and liabilities, maintenance of minimum levels of consolidated
earnings before depreciation, interest and amortization and maintenance of
minimum tangible net worth.

(9) Equity Transactions

As of December 31, 2002, the Operating Partnership has the following
cumulative redeemable preferred units outstanding.

Liquidation
    Description         Issue Date         Units     Preference
- ------------------ -------------------- -----------  ----------
7.875% Series B          February 1998   1,200,000  $   60,000
7.875% Series B           April 1998       400,000  $   20,000
9.125% Series C          November 1998     500,000  $   25,000
9.300% Series D            July 1999     2,000,000  $   50,000
9.250% Series E         September 1999   2,200,000  $   55,000

Dividends on the units are payable quarterly. The holders of the
units do not have any voting rights. Holders of the units generally have the
right to exchange their units on or after the tenth anniversary of the Issue
Date, or in some cases later than such tenth anniversary, for shares of the
Company's cumulative redeemable preferred stock at identical economic terms. The
Company has the right to redeem the units on the fifth anniversary after the
issue date. These preferred units are included in minority interests in the
accompanying consolidated balance sheet.

In May 2001, the Company's Board of Directors authorized the Operating
Partnership to purchase from time to time shares of the Company's Common Stock,
in an amount up to $50,000, at a price not to exceed $48.00 per share in the
open market or through negotiated or block transactions. The timing of any
repurchase will depend on the market price and other market conditions and
factors.  Essex expects to use working capital or proceeds from the sale of
properties to provide funds for this program.  The purpose of the program is to
acquire stock related to real estate transactions involving the issuance of
partnership units in the Operating Partnership and similar interests. This
program supersedes its common stock repurchase plan as announced on March 25,
1999.  In October 2001, March 2002 and July 2002 the Operating Partnership
acquired 100,700, 10,500 and 400,000 shares of the Company's outstanding Common
Stock.  The weighted average exercise price paid for these repurchase was
approximately $48.00 per share.  Pursuant to these acquisitions, since May 2001
and through December 2002, the Operating Partnership has purchased $24,536 of
the $50,000 aggregate amount authorized for repurchase by the Board of
Directors. The amount paid for the shares is reflected as a reduction of the
common stock and additional-paid-in-capital in the Company's consolidated
balance sheets.

Pursuant to existing shelf registration statements, the Company has the
capacity to issue up to $342,000 of equity securities and the Operating
Partnership has the capacity to issue up to $250,000 of debt securities.

(11) Stock Based Compensation Plans

The Essex Property Trust, Inc. 1994 Stock Incentive Plan provides
incentives to attract and retain officers, directors and key employees. The
Stock Incentive Plan provides for the grants of options to purchase a specified
number of shares of common stock or grants of restricted shares of common stock.
Under the Stock Incentive Plan, the total number of shares available for grant
is approximately 1,375,400. The Board of Directors (the Board) may adjust the
aggregate number and type of shares reserved for issuance. Participants in the
Stock Incentive Plans are selected by the Stock Incentive Plan Committee of the
Board, which is comprised of independent directors. The Compensation Committee
is authorized to establish the exercise price; however, the exercise price
cannot be less than 100% of the fair market value of the common stock on the
grant date. The Company's options have a life of ten years. Option grants fully
vest between one year and five years after the grant date.

In connection with the Company's 1994 initial public offering, the Company
provided a one-time grant of options to Marcus & Millichap ("MM")
to purchase 220,000 shares of common stock at the initial public offering price
of $19.50 per share pursuant to an agreement whereby Marcus & Millichap Real
Estate Investment Brokerage Company, a subsidiary of MM, will provide real
estate transaction, trend and other information to the Company for a period of
ten years. In February 2002, MM exercised and sold the shares underlying this
one-time grant. This option was exercised in a "cashless" transaction
pursuant to FAS 123, whereby MM was issued 129,302 shares of Company common
stock based on the current market price of the Company's common stock of $47.30
at the time of exercise.

The Company has also reserved 406,500 shares of common stock in connection
with the Essex Property Trust, Inc. 1994 Employee Stock Purchase Plan. There was
no activity in this plan during 2002, 2001, and 2000.

On June 28, 2001, the Operating Partnership issued 200,000
Series Z Incentive Units of limited partner interest (the "Series Z Incentive
Units") to eleven senior executives of the Company in exchange for a capital
commitment of $1.00 per Series Z Incentive Unit, for an aggregate offering price
of $200. Upon certain triggering events, the Series Z Incentive Units will
automatically convert into common Operating Partnership units based on a
conversion ratio that may increase over time upon satisfaction of specific
conditions. The conversion ratio, initially set at zero, will increase by 10%
(20% in 2002) on January 1 of each year for each participating executive who
remains employed by the Company if the Company has met a specified "funds from
operations" per share target for the prior year, up to a maximum conversion
ratio of 1.0. The conversion ratio as of January 1, 2002 was 20% which resulted
in 40,000 Series Z Incentive Units being convertible into up to an equal amount
of common Operating Partnership Units. On January 1, 2003, the conversion ratio
increased by 8%, to 28% based on the approval of the Board of Directors. In
certain change of control situations, the participating executives will also be
given the option to convert their units at the then-effective conversion ratio.
In addition, the Operating Partnership has the option to redeem Series Z
Incentive Units held by any executive whose employment has been terminated for
any reason and the obligation to redeem any such units following the death of
the holder. In such event, the Operating Partnership will redeem the units for,
at its option, either common Operating Partnership units or shares of the
Company's common stock based on the then-effective conversion ratio.

F-23

Through December 31, 2002, the Company has granted 42,586 stock
units under the Company's Phantom Stock Unit Agreement to two of the Company's
executives. The units vest in installments in accordance with the vesting
schedule set forth in the Phantom Stock Unit Agreement such that the units will
be fully vested five years from the date of issuance. At that time, the Company
expects to issue to the executives the number of shares of common stock equal to
the number of units vested, or at the Company's option, an equivalent amount in
cash. The Company has historically chosen the cash payment option at the end of
each year since inception of the agreement. Dividends are paid by the Company on
the vested and unvested portion of shares and are recorded as a component of
general and administrative expense. For the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001,
and 2000, compensation cost was $265, $327, and $262, respectively, related to
this plan.

(12) Shareholder Rights Plan

On November 12, 1998, the Company's Board of Directors adopted a
Stockholder Rights Plan. A dividend of one right (a Right) per share of common
stock was distributed to stockholders of record on November 21, 1998. Each
Right, expiring November 11, 2008, represents a right to buy from the Company
1/100th of a share of Series A junior participating preferred stock at a price
of $99.13 per Right.

Generally the Rights will not be exercisable unless a person or group
acquires 15% or more, or announces an offer that could result in acquiring 15%
or more, of the Company's common stock unless such person is or becomes the
beneficial owner of 15% or more of the Company's outstanding common stock and
had a contractual right or the approval of the Company's Board of Directors,
provided that such percentage shall not be greater than 19.9%. Following an
acquisition of 15% or more of the Company's common stock, each Right holder,
except the 15% or more shareholder, has the right to receive, upon exercise,
shares of common stock valued at twice the then applicable exercise price of the
Right, unless the 15% or more shareholder has offered to acquire all of the
outstanding shares of the Company under terms that a majority of the independent
directors of the Company have determined to be fair and in the best interest of
the Company and its shareholders.

Similarly, unless certain conditions are met, if the Company engages in a
merger or other business combination following a stock acquisition where it does
not survive or survives with a change or exchange of its common stock or if 50%
or more of its assets, earning power or cash flow is sold or transferred, the
Rights will become exercisable for shares of the acquiror's stock having a value
of twice the exercise price.

Generally, Rights may be redeemed for $0.01 each (in cash, common stock or
other consideration the Company deems appropriate) until the tenth day following
a public announcement that a 15% or greater position has been acquired of the
Company's stock.

(13) Segment Information

In accordance with FASB No. 131, Disclosures about Segments of an
Enterprise and Related Information, the Company defines its reportable operating
segments as the three geographical regions in which its multifamily residential
properties are located: Northern California, Southern California, and the
Pacific Northwest.

Nonsegment revenues and net operating income included in the following
schedule consist of revenue generated from the commercial properties,
recreational vehicle parks, and manufactured housing communities. Also excluded
from segment revenues are interest and other corporate income. Other nonsegment
assets include investments, real estate under development, cash, notes
receivables, other assets and deferred charges.

The accounting policies of the segments are the same as those described in
note 2. The Company evaluates performance based upon net operating income from
the combined properties in each segment.

The revenues, net operating income, and assets for each of the reportable
operating segments are summarized as follows for the years ended and as of

(14) 401(k) Plan

The Company has a 401(k) benefit plan (the Plan) for all full-time
employees who have completed six months of service. Employees may contribute up
to 23% of their compensation, limited by the maximum allowed under Section
401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code. The Company matches the employee
contributions for non-highly compensated personnel, up to 50% of their
contribution to a maximum of $.5 (per individual) per year. Company
contributions to the Plan were approximately $107, $116, and $98 for the years
ended December 31, 2002, 2001, and 2000.

(15) Fair Value of Financial Instruments

Management believes that the carrying amounts of its variable rate mortgage notes
payable, lines of credit, notes receivable from investees and other related parties and
notes and other receivables approximate fair value as of December 31, 2002 and
2001, because interest rates, yields and other terms for these instruments are
consistent with yields and other terms currently available to the Company for
similar instruments. Management has estimated that the fair value of the Company's
$618,143 of fixed rate mortgage notes payable at December 31, 2002 is approximately $576,894
based on the terms of existing mortgage notes payable compared to those available in the marketplace.
At December 31, 2001, the Company's fixed rate mortgage notes payable of $505,381 had an
approximate market value of $497,989. Management believes that the carrying amounts of cash
and cash equivalents, restricted cash, accounts payable and accrued liabilities,
other liabilities and dividends payable approximate fair value as of December
31, 2002 and 2001 due to the short-term maturity of these instruments.

(16) Commitments and Contingencies

The Company had no outstanding letters of credit relating to financing
and development transactions as of December 31, 2002.

In conjunction with an acquisition of a property by the Company in 2000, the
Company has committed to provide a loan of up to $4,400 subject to conditions.
The commitment expired in February 2003 without any loan being provided by
the Company.

The Company is involved in various lawsuits arising out of the ordinary
course of business and certain other legal matters. In the opinion of
management, the resolution of these matters will not have a material adverse
effect on the Company's financial position, results of operations or liquidity.

In September 1999, the Company formed a program in which directors and
management of the Company can participate indirectly in an investment in the
Company's common stock. The participants have entered into a swap agreement with
a securities broker whereby the securities broker has acquired, in open market
transactions, 223,475 shares of the Company's common stock. The agreement
terminates in five years at which time the settlement amount is determined by
comparing the original purchase price of the stock plus interest at a rate of
LIBOR plus 1.5% to the termination date market value of the shares and all
dividends received during the investment period. In certain circumstances, the
participants may be required to provide collateral to the securities broker. The
Company has guaranteed performance of the participants with respect to any
obligations relating to the swap agreement. From August 2001 through May 2002,
the directors and management effected an early termination of the agreement with respect to
the 223,475 shares, realizing a gain of approximately $15 per share.
