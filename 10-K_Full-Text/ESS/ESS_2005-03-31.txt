the office buildings located in Northern California (Palo Alto) has
approximately 17,400 square feet and houses the Company’s headquarters and
another office building located in Southern California (Woodland Hills) has
approximately 38,940 square feet, of which the Company occupies approximately
11,200 square feet. The Woodland Hills office building has eight third-party

affiliated entities and joint ventures also has entered into commitments for
the development of 645 units in four multifamily communities; of which two are
in Northern California and two are in Southern California.

The Company was
incorporated in the state of Maryland in March 1994. On June 13,
1994, the Company commenced operations with the completion of an initial public

partnership interest and members of the Company’s Board of Directors, senior
management and certain third-party investors own limited partnership interests
of approximately 9.7% in the Operating Partnership. As the sole general partner

Business
Objectives

The Company’s primary
business objective is to maximize funds from operations and total returns to
stockholders through active property and portfolio management. The Company’s
primary business objectives include:

•

Active
Property Marketing and Management. Maximize, on a per share basis, cash
available for distribution and the capital appreciation of its property
portfolio through active property marketing and management and, if applicable,
redevelopment.

•

Selected
Expansion of Property Portfolio. Increase, on a per share basis, cash available
for distribution through the acquisition and development of multifamily
residential properties in selected major metropolitan areas located primarily
in the west coast region of the United States.

•

Optimal
Portfolio Asset Allocations. Enhance financial performance through a portfolio
asset allocation program that seeks to increase or decrease the investments in
each market based on projected changes in regional economic and local market
conditions.

•

Management
of Capital and Financial Risk. Optimize the Company’s capital and financial
risk positions by maintaining a conservative leverage ratio and seeking a lower
cost of capital.

Business
Principles

The Company was founded
on, has followed, and intends to continue to follow the business principles set
forth below:

Property
Management

.  Through
its long-standing philosophy of active property management and a customer
satisfaction approach, coupled with a discipline of internal cost control, the
Company seeks to retain tenants, maximize cash flow, enhance property values
and compete effectively for new tenants in the marketplace. The Company’s Chief
Operating Officer, its Senior Vice President of Operations, its Division
Managers, its area and regional portfolio managers, and their staff are
accountable for the performance and maintenance of the Properties. They
supervise on-site managers, provide training for the on-site staff, monitor
fiscal performance against budgeted expectations, monitor property performance
against competing properties in the area, prepare operating and capital budgets
for executive approval, and implement new strategies focused on enhancing
tenant satisfaction, increasing revenue, controlling expenses, and creating a
more efficient operating environment.

Business
Planning and Control.

Real estate investment decisions are accompanied by a multiple year
plan, to which executives and other managers responsible for obtaining future
financial performance must agree. Performance versus plan serves as a
significant factor in determining compensation.

Property
Type Focus.

The
Company focuses on acquisition and development of multifamily residential
communities, containing between 75 and 750 units.

Geographic
Focus.

The Company
focuses its property investments in markets that meet the following criteria:

•

Major Metropolitan Areas.

The Company focuses on metropolitan areas
having a regional population in excess of one million people. Real estate
markets in these areas are typically characterized by a greater number of
buyers and sellers and are, therefore, more liquid. Liquidity is an important
element for implementing the Company’s strategy of varying its portfolio in
response to changing market conditions.

•

Supply Constraints.

The Company believes that properties located
in real estate markets with limited housing development opportunities may
produce increased rental income. When evaluating supply constraints, the
Company reviews: (i) availability of developable land sites on which
competing properties could be readily constructed; (ii) political barriers
to growth resulting from a restrictive local political environment regarding
development (such an environment, in addition to the restrictions on
development itself, is often associated with a lengthy and expensive
development process); and (iii)


physical
barriers to growth, resulting from natural limitations to development, such as
mountains or waterways.

•

Rental Demand Created by High Cost of Housing

.  The Company concentrates on markets in which
the cost of renting compares favorably to the cost of owning a home. In such
markets, rent levels tend to be higher and operating expenses and capital
expenditures, as a percentage of rent, are often lower in comparison with
markets that have a lower cost of owning a home.

•

Job Proximity

.  The Company believes that most renters select
housing based on its proximity to their jobs and related commuting factors. The
Company obtains local area information relating to its residential properties
and uses this information when making multifamily property acquisition
decisions. The Company also reviews the location of major employers relative to
its portfolio and potential acquisition properties.

Following the above
criteria, the Company is currently pursuing investment opportunities in
selected markets of Northern and Southern California and the Pacific Northwest.

Active
Portfolio Management Through Regional Economic Research and Local Market
Knowledge.

The Company
was founded on the belief that the key elements of successful real estate
investment and portfolio growth include extensive regional economic research
and local market knowledge. The Company utilizes its economic research and
local market knowledge to make appropriate portfolio allocation decisions that
it believes will result in better overall operating performance and lower
portfolio risk. The Company maintains and evaluates:

•

Regional Economic Data.

The Company evaluates and reviews regional
economic factors for the markets in which it owns properties and where it
considers expanding its operations. The Company’s research focuses on regional
and sub-market supply and demand for all types of housing, economic diversity,
job growth, market depth and the comparison of rents to down payments and
occupancy costs associated with for-sale housing.

•

Local Market Conditions.

Local market knowledge includes (i) local
factors that influence whether a sub-market is desirable to tenants; (ii) the
extent to which the area surrounding a property is improving or deteriorating;
and (iii) local investment market dynamics, including the relationship
between the value of a property and its yield, the prospects for capital
appreciation and market depth.

Recognizing that all real
estate markets are cyclical, the Company regularly evaluates the results of
regional economic and local market research and adjusts its portfolio
allocations accordingly. The Company actively manages the allocation of assets
within its portfolio. The Company seeks to increase its portfolio allocation in
markets projected to have the strongest local economies and to decrease such
allocations in markets projected to have declining economic conditions.
Likewise, the Company also seeks to increase its portfolio allocation in
markets that have attractive property valuations and to decrease such
allocations in markets that have inflated valuations and low relative yields.

Current
Business Activities

The Company conducts
substantially all of its activities through the Operating Partnership, of which
it owns an approximate 90.3% general partnership interest. The approximate 9.7%
limited partnership interests in the Operating Partnership are owned by
directors, officers and employees of the Company and certain third-party
investors. As the sole general partner of the Operating Partnership, the
Company has operating control over the management of the Operating Partnership.
The Operating Partnership either controls or has significant influence over the
Properties. From time to time, the Company may invest in properties through the
acquisition of an interest in another entity. The Company does not plan to
invest in the securities of other entities not engaged in real estate related
activities.

The Company has elected
to be treated as a real estate investment trust (“REIT”) for federal income tax
purposes, commencing with the year ended December 31, 1994. In order to
maintain compliance with REIT tax rules, the Company utilizes taxable REIT
subsidiaries (“TRS”) for various revenue generating or investment activities.
The TRS’s are consolidated by the Company.


Acquisitions

On January 21, 2004,
the Company purchased the improvements comprising Marina City Club, located in
Marina del Rey, California, which include a 101-unit apartment community, an
adjacent marina with approximately 340 boat slips and assorted retail
space.  The total contract price was
approximately $27.7 million.  The
improvements are subject to a long-term ground lease with the County of Los
Angeles that expires in 2067.  The
property is unencumbered.

On January 28, 2004,
the Company purchased Mountain View Apartments, a 106-unit multifamily

property is unencumbered.

On February 27,
2004, the Company purchased Fountain Park Apartments, a 705-unit multifamily
community located in Playa Vista, California, for a contract price of
approximately $124.5 million.  In
connection with the transactions, the Company assumed tax-exempt variable rate
bond obligations totaling $83.2 million that mature in 2033.  Financing and other agreements require 53% of
the apartment homes in Fountain Park to be subject to various rent restrictions
based on resident income criteria.

During the second quarter
of 2004, the Company acquired its partner’s 80% interests in Tierra Vista
Apartments, a 404-unit apartment community located in Oxnard, California and
The Pointe at Cupertino, a 116-unit apartment community located in Cupertino,
California.  The combined contract price
for the interests was approximately $74.6 million.  In conjunction with the transaction, the
Company assumed a $37.3 million loan with an interest rate of 5.93% that
matures on July 1, 2007 for Tierra Vista, and a $14.1 million loan with an
interest rate of 4.86%, which matures on November 1, 2012 for The Pointe
at Cupertino.  As a result of these
transactions, the Company now consolidates these properties.

On August 6, 2004,
the Company acquired Vista Belvedere, a 76-unit apartment community located in
the Marin County town of Tiburon, California. 
Essex acquired the multifamily community in a UPREIT structured
transaction for an agreed upon value of approximately $17.1 million.  The Company issued 73,088 operating
partnership units to the prior owner. 
The property is encumbered by a mortgage loan in the principal amount of
$11.8 million, with a 5.375% fixed interest rate, an August 2013 maturity
date and an option to extend the maturity for one year thereafter at a floating
rate of 2.5% over Freddie Mac’s Reference Bill.

On September 29,
2004, the Company acquired its partner’s 55% interest in Park Hill, a 245-unit
apartment community located in Issaquah, Washington for approximately $1.3
million.  In conjunction with the
transaction, the Company assumed approximately a $21.2 million loan with an
interest rate of 6.9%, which matures in July 2009.  The Company now consolidates this property.

In November 2004,
the Company acquired Fairwood Pond Apartments, a 194-unit apartment community
located in Renton, Washington for approximately $21.1 million and The Esplanade
Apartments, a 278-unit apartment community located in San Jose, California for
approximately $60.5 million. These properties are unencumbered.

In December 2004,
the Company acquired two apartment communities – Woodside Village and Pinehurst
Apartments – aggregating 173 apartment units, located in Ventura, California,
for approximately $28.3 million. These properties are unencumbered.

Subsequent
Events – Acquisition

On February 2, 2005,
the Company acquired Cedar Terrace Apartments, a 180-unit apartment community,
located in Bellevue, Washington, for approximately $22.3 million. The property
is unencumbered.

Dispositions

On August 3, 2004,
the Company sold The Essex at Lake Merritt, a 270-unit multifamily community
located in Oakland, California for an approximate contract price of $88.0
million.  In conjunction with this
transaction, a company owned TRS originated a participating loan to the buyer
in the amount of $5.0 million, which


allows the Company to
participate in approximately one-third of the potential profits related to the
condominium conversion of the property. 
The Company’s gain on the sale of The Essex at Lake Merritt is
approximately $12.9 million, of which $5.0 million is deferred under the
provisions of FAS 66.  The deferred gain
will be recognized as a realized gain on sale as payments on the participating
loan are received.  The Company continues
to provide property management services for the portion of the property not yet
converted to condominiums.  Recognition
of interest income on the loan and the Company’s share of the profits, if any,
associated with the condominium conversions has been deferred until realized.

At June 30, 2004,
Golden Village Recreational Vehicle Park, a property located in Hemet,
California and acquired as part of the John M. Sachs merger in December 2002,
met the “held for sale” criteria under SFAS 144.   In accordance with SFAS 144, assets and
liabilities and the results of operations of the property were presented as
discontinued operations in the consolidated financial statements for all
periods presented.  Upon reclassification
as held for sale at June 30, 2004, the Company presented Golden Village at
its estimated fair value less disposal costs which resulted in an impairment
charge of approximately $756,000.  Such
fair value was determined using the contractual sales price pursuant to the
contract with the buyer of the property. 
On July 18, 2004, the Company sold Golden Village for $6.7
million.  No gain or loss was recognized
on the sale.

In the fourth quarter of 2004, the Company sold its
approximate 49.9% ownership interest in Coronado at Newport – North in
connection with the sale of the Fund I assets to an unrelated entity. Please
refer to Fund I discussion on page 7.

Subsequent
Events – Dispositions

In January 2005, the
Company sold four non-core assets that were acquired in conjunction with the
merger with John M. Sachs, Inc. in 2002. 
The four non-core assets were: The Riviera Recreational Vehicle Park and
The Riviera Manufactured Home Park, both located in Las Vegas, Nevada, and for
which the Company had previously entered into master lease and option
agreements with an unrelated entity; and two small office buildings, located in
San Diego California, aggregating 7,200 square feet.

Development

Development communities
are defined by the Company as new apartment properties that are being
constructed or are newly constructed and in a phase of lease-up and have not yet
reached stabilized operations (defined as 95% physical occupancy). As of December 31,
2004, the Company had direct ownership interests in two development communities
with an aggregate of 395 multifamily units. During 2004, the Company achieved
stabilized operations at one development community-- Hidden Valley at Parker
Ranch, a 324-unit apartment community located in Simi Valley, California, which
achieved stabilized operations during the fourth quarter of 2004.

In the fourth quarter of 2004, the Company
entered into a joint venture to develop a 5-story apartment building
aggregating 275 apartment homes in Los Angeles, California. It is anticipated
that, upon completion, the community will offer 220 market-rate units and 55
affordable-rate units. The cost to develop this project is estimated at
approximately $62.6 million.  The joint
venture has obtained $47.0 million of tax-exempt bond financing on the project,
which will be drawn to fund future construction costs.  Essex has originated a $7.4 million mezzanine
loan to the joint venture, which bears an interest rate of 14.0%, is subject to
various conditions, and matures in December 2009. The Company’s limited
partnership equity investment is approximately $3.2 million and will, subject
to the provisions of the agreements, generally allow the Company to receive 75%
of the cash flow up to a 22.67% priority return, and 50% of cash flow
thereafter.  Essex has also provided a
construction completion guarantee in the amount of $4.8 million.  Pursuant to FIN46R the Company has
consolidated this joint venture and eliminated all intercompany accounts.

In connection with the
properties currently under development, the Company has directly, or in some
cases through affiliated joint venture entities, entered into contractual
construction-related commitments with unrelated third parties. As of December 31,
2004, the Company and its partners are committed to approximately $51.3 million
in estimated development expenditures to complete these projects.


The following table sets forth information regarding
the Company’s development communities at December 31, 2004.

(1)   Estimated project cost as of December 31,
2004 includes incurred costs and estimated costs to complete the development
projects.

(2)

The
Company is the sole owner of this development project.

Redevelopment

Redevelopment communities
are defined by the Company as existing properties owned or recently acquired
which have been targeted for additional investment by the Company with the
expectation of increased financial returns. Redevelopment communities are
typically affected by significant construction activity and, as a result, may
have less than stabilized operations. As of December 31, 2004, the Company
has direct ownership interests in six redevelopment communities, which contain
2,512 units.

The following table sets

Debt
Transactions

On February 20, 2004
the Company prepaid an $8.7 million non-recourse mortgage with an interest rate
of 7.8% that was to mature in January 2007.  In conjunction with this transaction, the
Company paid a $175,000 prepayment fee.

On April 30, 2004
the Company renewed its $185.0 million unsecured line of credit facility for a
three-year


term, with an option to
extend it for one year thereafter. The underlying interest rate on this line is
based on a tiered rate structure tied to the Company’s corporate ratings and is
currently LIBOR plus 1.0%.

On May 13, 2004, the
Company obtained a non-recourse mortgage on a previously unencumbered property
in the amount of $30.7 million, with a 5.19% fixed interest rate for a 9-year
term, maturing in May 2013, with an option to extend the maturity for one
year thereafter at a floating rate of 2.5% over Freddie Mac’s Reference
Bill.  During the extension period, the
loan may be paid in full with no prepayment penalty.

On November 15,
2004, the Company repaid a non-recourse mortgage that matured in the amount of
$25.6 million.  The interest rate on the
loan was 7.1%.

Subsequent
Event – Debt

On February 1, 2005,
the Company obtained a non-recourse mortgage on a previously unencumbered
property in the amount of $21.8 million with a 4.94% fixed interest rate for a 9-year
term, maturing in March 2014, with an option to extend the maturity for
one year thereafter at a floating rate of 2.4% over one month LIBOR. During the
extension period, the loan may be paid in full with no prepayment penalty.

On February 16,
2005, the Company entered into a $50 million notional forward starting interest
rate swap with PNC Bank at a fixed rate of 4.927% and a settlement date on or
around October 1, 2007. The Company expects to refinance up to $113
million of mortgages that mature in 2007. These mortgages have an effective
interest rate of approximately 6.3% as of December 31, 2004. This notional
forward starting interest rate swap will be designated as a cash flow hedge
under FAS 133 and changes to its fair value prior to settlement will be
reflected in Other Comprehensive Income on the Company’s consolidated financial
statements.

Equity
Transactions

On June 14, 2000 the
Company purchased Waterford Place, a 238-unit apartment community located in
San Jose, California for a contract price of $35.0 million and an additional
contingent payment.  The amount of the contingent payment was disputed and
submitted to binding arbitration.   As a result of the arbitration,
the Company was directed to issue an additional 109,874 units of limited
partnership interest (“Units”) in the Operating Partnership to the sellers of
Waterford Place.  On March 31, 2004, the Company completed the
issuance of these Units to the sellers and redeemed for cash 55,564 Units from
these sellers.

In January 2004, the
Company restructured its previously issued $50.0 million, 9.30% Series D
Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Units (“Series D Units”), and its
previously issued $80.0 million, 7.875% Series B Cumulative Redeemable
Preferred Units (“Series B Units”). 
The existing distribution rate of 9.30% of the Series D Units
continued until July 27, 2004 – the end of the non-call period.  On July 28, 2004, the distribution rate
on the Series D Units was reduced to 7.875%.  The date that the Series D Units can
first be redeemed at the Company’s option was extended by six years to July 28,
2010.  The date that the Series B
Units can first be redeemed at the Company’s option was extended from February 6,
2003 to December 31, 2009.

On September 3,
2004, the Company redeemed all of its outstanding, $55 million, 9.25% Series E
Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Units of the Operating Partnership, which
resulted in a non-cash charge of $1.6 million related to the write-off of the
issuance costs. This charge is included in minority interest in the
accompanying consolidated statement of operations.

Essex
Apartment Value Fund I (“Fund I”)

Essex Apartment Value
Fund, L.P. (“Fund I”), is an investment fund organized by the Company in 2001
to add value through rental growth and asset appreciation, utilizing the
Company’s acquisition, development, redevelopment and asset management
capabilities. Fund I was considered fully invested in 2003. An affiliate of the
Company, Essex VFGP, L.P. (“VFGP”), is a 1% general partner and is a 20.4%
limited partner. The Operating Partnership owns a 99% limited partnership
interest in VFGP.


Since its formation, Fund
I has acquired or developed ownership interests in 19 multifamily residential
properties, representing 5,406 apartment units with an aggregate cost of
approximately $618.0 million.  Fund I
also owns the Kelvin Ave. land parcel in Irvine, California, which is planned
for development into a 132-unit apartment community.

Prior to 2004, Fund I
disposed of two multifamily residential properties, consisting of 530
apartments units for a aggregate contract sales price of approximately $73.2
million.

On August 26, 2004,
Fund I sold Palermo Apartments, 230-unit multifamily community located in San
Diego, California for a net sales price of $58.2 million.  Fund I completed the development of this
property at an approximate cost of  $44.9
million in 2004.

In the third quarter of
2004, Fund I entered into a purchase and sale agreement with United Dominion
Realty, L.P. (“UDR”) for a sale of sixteen apartment communities, totaling
4,646 units owned by Fund I and, with respect to Coronado at Newport North and
South, both Fund I’s and the Company’s separate ownership interests, for a
contract price of $756.0 million.  In
connection with the transaction, UDR remitted a $10 million earnest money
deposit directly to Fund I, which is refundable only in limited circumstances.  On September 30, 2004, pursuant to the
UDR purchase and sale agreement, Fund I sold seven of the multifamily
communities, aggregating 1,777 apartment units at a contract price of
approximately $264.0 million. On October 27, 2004, an additional seven of
the remaining nine properties, including the Company’s approximate 49.9%
ownership interest in Coronado at Newport – North, were sold to UDR for a
contract price of $322.0 million, of which $267.6 million represents Fund I’s
allocated portion of the contract price based on its ownership interest.  The remaining two multifamily properties
under the UDR agreement that are anticipated to close in 2005 are Coronado at
Newport - South, a 715-unit apartment community in Newport Beach, California
currently undergoing redevelopment and River Terrace, a newly developed 250-unit
apartment community in Santa Clara which is currently in lease up.

The Fund I dispositions
in 2004, combined with the sale of its 49.9% direct ownership interest in
Coronado at Newport North, resulted in the Company recognizing equity income
from investments of $38.8 million. The Company’s share of the gain on the sale
of real estate of $39.3 million was reduced by a $505,000 non-cash loss on the
early extinguishment of debt related to the write-off of unamortized loan
fees.  The Company’s general partnership
interest provides for “promote distributions” upon attainment of certain
financial return benchmarks.  During
2004, the Company recognized $18.3 million of additional equity income
associated with its promote distribution. 
The Company accrued $4.0 million of employee incentive compensation
expense related to the Fund I sale, which is included in general and
administrative expense in the accompanying consolidated statement of

At December 31, 2004
Fund I owned two development communities with an aggregate of 250 multifamily
units and an estimated total cost of $64.1 million, of which $3.6 million
remains to be expended and approximately $770,000 is expected to be funded by the
Company through its capital commitments.

The following table sets forth information regarding
Fund I’s development communities at December 31, 2004.

Estimated
project cost as of December 31, 2004 includes incurred costs and estimated
costs to complete the development projects. Estimated project costs for Kelvin
Avenue have not been determined.


Essex
Apartment Value Fund II (“Fund II”)

On September 27,
2004 the Company announced the final closing of the Essex Apartment Value Fund
II (“Fund II”). Fund II has eight institutional investors including Essex with
combined equity commitments of $265.9 million. Essex has committed $75.0
million to Fund II, which represents a 28.2% interest as general partner and
limited partner. Fund II expects to utilize leverage of approximately 65% of
the estimated value of the underlying real estate. Fund II will invest in
multifamily properties in the Company’s targeted West Coast markets with an
emphasis on investment opportunities in the Seattle metropolitan area and the
San Francisco Bay Area. Subject to certain exceptions, Fund II will be Essex’s
exclusive investment vehicle until October 31, 2006, or when Fund II’s
committed capital has been invested, whichever occurs first. Consistent with
Fund I, Essex will be compensated for its asset management, property
management, development and redevelopment services and may receive promote
distributions if Fund II exceeds certain financial return benchmarks.

Acquisition Activities

During 2004, Fund II
acquired ownership interests in three multifamily properties consisting of 907
units with an aggregate purchase price of approximately $130.0 million. These
investments were primarily funded by mortgage loans in the aggregate amount of
$76.6 million and the contribution of equity from joint venture partners.

Multifamily properties
acquired in 2004 are as follows:

Subsequent
Events – Acquisition

On March 2, 2005,
the Fund II acquired Regency Tower Apartment Homes, a 178-unit apartment
community, located in Oakland, California, for approximately $21.2 million. In
conjunction with the transaction, Fund II originated a new mortgage loan
totaling approximately $11.5 million with a fixed interest rate of 5.16%, which
matures in February 2014 and has a 1-year variable rate extension period.

Offices
and Employees

The Company is
headquartered in Palo Alto, California, and has regional offices in Woodland
Hills, California; Irvine, California; San Diego, California; Bellevue,
Washington; and Portland, Oregon. As of December 31, 2004, the Company had
approximately 800 employees.

Environmental
Matters

Under various federal,
state and local laws, ordinances and regulations, an owner or operator of real
estate is liable for the costs of removal or remediation of certain hazardous
or toxic substances on, in, to or migrating from such property. Such laws often
impose liability without regard as to whether the owner or operator knew of, or
was responsible for, the presence of such hazardous or toxic substances. The
presence of such substances, or the failure to properly remediate such
substances, may adversely affect the owner’s or operator’s ability to sell or
rent such property or to borrow using such property as collateral. In addition,
persons exposed to such substances, either through soil vapor or ingestion of
the substance, may claim personal injury damages. Persons who arrange for the
disposal or treatment of hazardous or toxic substances or wastes also may be
liable for the costs of removal or remediation of such substances at the
disposal or treatment facility to which such substances or wastes were sent,


whether or not such
facility is owned or operated by such person. In addition, certain
environmental laws impose liability for release of asbestos-containing
materials (“ACMs”) into the air, and third parties may seek recovery from
owners or operators of real properties for personal injury associated with ACMs. In
connection with the ownership (direct or indirect), operation, management and
development of real properties, the Company could be considered an owner or
operator of such properties or as having arranged for the disposal or treatment
of hazardous or toxic substances and, therefore, may be potentially liable for
removal or remediation costs, as well as certain other costs, including
governmental fines and costs related to injuries of persons and property.

California has enacted
legislation commonly referred to as “Proposition 65” requiring that “clear and
reasonable” warnings be given to consumers who are exposed to chemicals known
to the State of California to cause cancer or reproductive toxicity, including
tobacco smoke. Although we have sought to comply with Proposition 65
requirements, we cannot assure you that we will not be adversely affected by
litigation relating to Proposition 65.

Methane gas is a
naturally-occurring gas that is commonly found below the surface in several
areas of California, particularly in the Southern California coastal
areas.  Methane is a non-toxic gas, but can be ignitable in confined
spaces.  Although naturally-occurring, methane gas is not regulated at the
state or federal level, some local governments, such as the County of Los
Angeles, have imposed requirements that new buildings install detection systems
in areas where methane gas is known to be located.  Methane gas is also
associated with certain industrial activities, such as former municipal waste
landfills.

Recently there has been
an increasing number of lawsuits against owners and managers of multifamily
properties alleging personal injury and property damage caused by the presence
of mold in residential real estate. Some of these lawsuits have resulted in
substantial monetary judgments or settlements. Essex has been sued for mold
related matters and has settled some, but not all, of such matters. Insurance
carriers have reacted to mold related liability awards by excluding mold
related claims from standard policies and pricing mold endorsements at
prohibitively high rates. We have adopted programs designed to manage the
existence of mold in our properties as well as guidelines for promptly
addressing and resolving reports of mold to minimize any impact mold might have
on residents or the property.

All of the Properties
have been subjected to preliminary environmental assessments, including a
review of historical and public data (“Phase I assessments”), by independent
environmental consultants. Phase I assessments generally consist of an
investigation of environmental conditions at the Property, including a
preliminary investigation of the site, an identification of publicly known
conditions occurring at properties in the vicinity of the site, an
investigation as to the presence of polychlorinated biphenyl’s (“PCBs”), ACMs
and above-ground and underground storage tanks presently or formerly at the
sites, and preparation and issuance of written reports. As a result of
information collected in the Phase I assessments, certain of the Properties
were subjected to additional environmental investigations, including, in a some
cases, soil sampling or ground water analysis to further evaluate the
environmental conditions of those Properties.

The environmental studies
revealed the presence of soil and groundwater contamination and the presence of
methane and associated gases at certain of the Properties.  Based on its
current knowledge, the Company does not believe the future liabilities
associated with the contamination or with the methane gas is material and is
not in receipt of any cleanup order from a regulatory agency.   
Environmental studies also indicate that one of the Properties is located on a
former municipal landfill, which has been closed for approximately eighty
years.  To the Company’s knowledge, the property has not been subject to
any regulatory requirements since it was initially closed; however, state
regulatory agencies have discretion to impose various requirements on closed
landfills, including monitoring for methane gas.  Limited sampling
has indicated there is no methane gas above explosive limits at the
property.  Based on its current knowledge, the Company does not believe
that any regulatory requirements or other liabilities associated with this
property are material.  The environmental studies have also indicated that
many of the Properties contain ACM, a common building material prior to the
1980s.  The ACM is found primarily in the ceiling textures, floor tiles,
and adhesives.  To the Company’s knowledge, the ACM is in good
condition.  The Company has implemented an operations and maintenance plan
to inspect and monitor the ACM to ensure that the ACM remains in good condition
and is properly managed.  Based on the information contained in the
environmental studies, the Company believes that there is only a remote risk
that the environmental contamination or other conditions at these Properties
would lead to a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition,
result of operations, or liquidity.

Certain
Properties that have been sold by the Company were identified as having
potential groundwater contamination. While the Company does not anticipate any
losses or costs related to groundwater contamination on Properties that have
been sold, it is possible that such losses or costs may materialize in the
future.


Except with respect to
three Properties, the Company has no indemnification agreements from third
parties for potential environmental clean-up costs at its Properties. The
Company has no way of determining at this time the magnitude of any potential
liability to which it may be subject arising out of unknown environmental conditions
or violations with respect to the properties formerly owned by the Company. No
assurance can be given that existing environmental studies with respect to any
of the Properties reveal all environmental liabilities, that any prior owner or
operator of a Property did not create any material environmental condition not
known to the Company, or that a material environmental condition does not
otherwise exist as to any one or more of the Properties. The Company has
limited insurance coverage for the types of environmental liabilities described
above.

Insurance

The Company carries
comprehensive liability, fire, extended coverage and rental loss insurance for
each of the Properties. There are, however, certain types of extraordinary
losses, such as, for example, losses for terrorism or earthquake, for which the
Company may not have sufficient insurance coverage. Substantially all of the
Properties are located in areas that are subject to earthquake activity. The
Company has obtained earthquake insurance for most the Properties. Most of the
Properties are included in an earthquake insurance program that is subject to
an aggregate limit of $80.0 million payable upon a covered loss in excess of a
$15.0 million self-insured retention amount and a 5% deductible. In the future,
the Company may selectively exclude properties from being covered by earthquake
insurance based on management’s evaluation of the following factors: (i) the
availability of coverage on terms acceptable to the Company, (ii) the
location of the property and the amount of seismic activity affecting that
region, and, (iii) the age of the property and building codes in effect at
the time of construction. Despite earthquake coverage on most of the Company’s
Properties, should a property sustain damage as a result of an earthquake, the
Company may incur losses due to deductibles, co-payments and losses in excess
of applicable insurance, if any.

Although the Company may
carry insurance for potential losses associated with its properties, employees,
residents, and compliance with applicable laws, it may still incur losses due
to uninsured risks, deductibles, co-payments or losses in excess of applicable
insurance coverage.

Competition

The Company’s Properties
compete for tenants with similar properties primarily on the basis of location,
rent charged, services provided, and the design and condition of the
improvements. Competition for tenants from competing properties affects the
amount of rent charged as well as rental growth rates, vacancy rates, rental
concessions, deposit amounts, and the services and features provided at each
property. While economic conditions are generally stable in the Company’s
target markets, a prolonged economic downturn could have a material adverse
effect on the Company’s financial position, results of operations or liquidity.

The Company also
experiences competition when attempting to acquire properties that meet its
investment criteria. Such competing buyers include domestic and foreign
financial institutions, other REITs, life insurance companies, pension funds,
trust funds, partnerships and individual investors.

Working
Capital

The Company expects to
meet its short-term liquidity requirements by using its working capital, cash
generated from operations, and its amounts available on lines of credit. The
Company believes that its future net cash flows and borrowing capacity will be
adequate to meet operating requirements and to provide for payment of dividends
by the Company in accordance with REIT qualification requirements. The Company
has line of credit facilities in the committed amount of approximately $285.0
million. At December 31, 2004 the Company had an outstanding balance of
$249.5 million under these line of credit facilities.


Risk Factors

Our operations involve
various risks that could have adverse consequences including, without
limitation, reductions in funds from operations, impairing our ability to make
distributions to shareholders, and failure to qualify as a REIT. These risks
include, among others, the following:

We depend on our key personnel

Our success depends on
our ability to attract and retain the services of executive officers, senior
officers and company managers. There is substantial competition for qualified
personnel in the real estate industry and the loss of several of our key
personnel could have an adverse effect on us.

Debt
Financing

At December 31,
2004, we had approximately $1.317 billion of indebtedness (including $438.3
million of variable rate indebtedness, of which $152.7 million is subject to
interest rate protection agreements).

We are subject to the
risks normally associated with debt financing, including the following:

•

cash
flow may not be sufficient to meet required payments of principal and interest;

•

inability
to refinance existing indebtedness on encumbered properties;

•

the
terms of any refinancing may not be as favorable as the terms of existing
indebtedness;

•

inability
to comply with debt covenants which could cause an acceleration of the maturity
date; and

•

repaying
debt before the scheduled maturity date could result in prepayment penalties.

Uncertainty
of Ability to Refinance Balloon Payments

At December 31,
2004, we had an aggregate of approximately $1.317 billion of mortgage debt and
line of credit borrowings, most of which are subject to balloon payments of
principal. We do not expect to have sufficient cash flows from operations to
make all of such balloon payments when due under these mortgages and the line
of credit borrowings.

At December 31,
2004, these mortgages and lines of credit borrowings had the following
scheduled principal payments:

2005—$18.7 million;

2006—$24.7 million;

2007—$280.7 million
(includes lines of credit balance of $155.8 million as of December 31,
2004);

2008—$154.5 million;

2009—$139.9 million
(includes lines of credit balance of $93.7 million as of December 31,
2004);

2010 and thereafter—$698.5
million.

We may not be able to
refinance such mortgage indebtedness or lines of credit. The properties subject
to these mortgages could be foreclosed upon or otherwise transferred to the
mortgagee. This could cause us to lose income and asset value. Alternatively,
we may be required to refinance the debt at higher interest rates. If we are
unable to make such payments when due, a mortgage lender could foreclose on the
property securing the mortgage, which could have a material adverse effect on
our financial condition and results of operations.


Economic
Environment and Impact on Operating Results

Both the national economy
and the economies of the western states in which we own, manage and develop
properties, some of which are concentrated in high-tech sectors, have been
affected by an economic downturn and may in the future again be affected by an
economic downturn. The impact of such downturn on our operating results can
include, without limitation, reduction in rental rates, occupancy levels, property
valuations and increases in operating costs such as advertising, turnover and
repair and maintenance expense.

Our property type and
diverse geographic locations provide some degree of risk moderation but we are
not immune to a prolonged economic downturn in the real estate markets in which
we operate. Although we believe we are well positioned to meet the challenges
ahead, it is possible that reductions in occupancy and market rental rates will
result in reduction of rental revenues, operating income, cash flows, and the
market value of our shares. A prolonged downturn could also affect our ability
to obtain financing at acceptable rates of interest and to access funds from
the disposition of properties at acceptable prices.

Risk
of Rising Interest Rates

At December 31,
2004, we had approximately $188.8 million of long-term variable rate
indebtedness bearing interest at 
floating rates tied to the rate of short-term tax-exempt revenue bonds
(which mature at various dates from 2006 through 2034), and $249.5 million of
variable rate indebtedness under our lines of credit, of which $155.8 million
bears interest at 1.0% over LIBOR and $93.7 million bearing interest at the
Freddie Mac Reference Rate plus from 0.55% to 0.60%. A portion of the long-term
variable rate indebtedness of approximately $152.7 million is subject to
interest rate protection agreements, which may reduce the risks associated with
fluctuations in interest rates. The remaining $285.6 million of long-term
variable rate indebtedness is not subject to any interest rate protection
agreements. An increase in interest rates may have an adverse effect on our net
income and results of operations.

Current interest rates
are at historic lows and could potentially 
increase rapidly.  Significant and
rapid interest rate increases would result in higher interest expense on our
variable rate indebtedness. Prolonged interest rate increases could negatively
impact our ability to make acquisitions and develop properties at economic
returns on investment and our ability to refinance existing borrowings at
acceptable rates.

Risk of
Inflation /Deflation

Substantial inflationary
or deflationary pressures could have a negative effect on rental rates and
property operating expenses.

Risk
of Losses on Interest Rate Hedging Arrangements

We have, from time to
time, entered into agreements to reduce the risks associated with increases in
interest rates, and may continue to do so. Although these agreements may
partially protect against rising interest rates, these agreements also may
reduce the benefits to us when interest rates decline. We cannot assure you
that we can refinance any such hedging arrangements or that we will be able to
enter into other hedging arrangements to replace existing ones if interest rates
decline. Furthermore, interest rate movements during the term of interest rate
hedging arrangements may result in a gain or loss on our investment in the
hedging arrangement. In addition, if a hedging arrangement is not indexed to
the same rate as the indebtedness that is hedged, we may be exposed to losses
to the extent that the rate governing the indebtedness and the rate governing
the hedging arrangement change independently of each other. Finally,
nonperformance by the other party to the hedging arrangement may subject us to
increased credit risks. In order to minimize counterparty credit risk, our
policy is to enter into hedging arrangements only with large financial
institutions.


Acquisition
Activities: Risks that Acquisitions Will Fail to Meet Expectations

We intend to continue to
acquire multifamily residential properties. There are risks that acquired
properties will fail to perform as expected. Our estimates of future income,
expenses and the costs of improvements or redevelopment that are necessary to
allow us to market an acquired property as originally intended may prove to be
inaccurate. We expect to finance future acquisitions, in whole or in part,
under various forms of secured or unsecured financing or through the issuance
of partnership units by the Operating Partnership or related partnerships or
additional equity by Essex. The use of equity financing, rather than debt, for
future developments or acquisitions could dilute the interest of Essex’s
existing stockholders. If we finance new acquisitions under existing lines of
credit, there is a risk that, unless we obtain substitute financing, Essex may
not be able to secure further lines of credit for new development or such lines
of credit may be not available on advantageous terms.

Also, we may not be able
to refinance our existing lines of credit upon maturity, or the terms of such
refinancing may not be as favorable as the terms of the existing indebtedness.
Further, acquisitions of properties are subject to the general risks associated
with real estate investments. For further information regarding these risks,
please see “Adverse Effect to Property Income and Value Due to General Real
Estate Investment Risks.”

Risks
that Development Activities Will Be Delayed, not Completed, and/or Fail to
Achieve Expected Results

We pursue multifamily
residential property development projects and these projects generally require
various governmental and other approvals, which we cannot assure you that we
will receive. Our development activities generally entail certain risks,
including the following:

•

funds
may be expended and management’s time devoted to projects that may not be
completed;

•

construction
costs of a project may exceed original estimates, possibly making the project
economically unfeasible;

•

development
projects may be delayed due to, without limitation, adverse weather conditions,
labor shortages, or unforeseen complications;

•

occupancy
rates and rents at a completed project may be less than anticipated; and

•

costs
at a completed development may be higher than anticipated.

These risks may reduce
the funds available for distribution to Essex’s stockholders. Further, the
development of properties is also subject to the general risks associated with
real estate investments. For further information regarding these risks, please
see “Adverse Effect to Property Income and Value Due to General Real Estate
Investment Risks.”

The
Geographic Concentration of the Properties and Fluctuations in Local Markets May Adversely
Impact Our Financial Conditions and Results of Operations

We derived significant
amounts of rental revenues for the year ended December 31, 2004 from
properties concentrated in Southern California (Los Angeles, Ventura, Orange,
San Diego and Riverside counties), Northern California (the San Francisco Bay
Area), and the Pacific Northwest (the Seattle, Washington and Portland, Oregon
metropolitan areas). As of December 31, 2004, of our 120 ownership
interests in multifamily residential properties, 90 are located in California.
As a result of this geographic concentration, if a local property market
performs poorly, the income from the properties in that market could decrease.
As a result of such a decrease in income, we may be unable to pay expected
dividends to our stockholders. The performance of the economy in each of these
areas affects occupancy, market rental rates and expenses and, consequently,
impacts the income generated from the properties and their underlying values.
The financial results of major local employers also may impact the cash flow
and value of certain of the properties. Economic downturns in the local markets
in which we own properties could have a negative impact on our financial
condition and results of operations.


Competition
in the Multifamily Residential Market May Adversely Affect Operations and
the Rental Demand For Our Properties

There are numerous
housing alternatives that compete with our 
multifamily properties in attracting residents. These include other
multifamily rental apartments and single-family homes that are available for
rent in the markets in which the properties are located. The properties also
compete for residents with new and existing homes and condominiums that are for
sale. If the demand for our properties is reduced or if competitors develop
and/or acquire competing properties on a more cost-effective basis, rental
rates may drop, which may have a material adverse affect on our financial
condition and results of operations.

We also face competition
from other real estate investment trusts, businesses and other entities in the
acquisition, development and operation of properties. Some of the competitors
are larger and have greater financial resources than we do. This competition
may result in increased costs of properties we acquire and/or develop.

Debt
Financing on Properties May Result in Insufficient Cash Flow

Where possible, we intend
to continue to use leverage to increase the rate of return on our investments
and to provide for additional investments that we could not otherwise make.
There is a risk that the cash flow from the properties will be insufficient to
meet both debt payment obligations and the distribution requirements of the
real estate investment trust provisions of the Internal Revenue Code. We may
obtain additional debt financing in the future, through mortgages on some or
all of the properties. These mortgages may be recourse, non-recourse, or
cross-collateralized. As of December 31, 2004, Essex had 75 of its 115
consolidated multifamily properties encumbered by debt. Of the 75 properties,
53 are secured by deeds of trust relating solely to those properties, and with
respect to the remaining 22 properties, 5 cross-collateralized mortgages are
secured by 8 properties, 6 properties, 3 properties, 3 properties and 2
properties, respectively. The holders of this indebtedness will have a claim
against these properties and, to the extent indebtedness is
cross-collateralized, lenders may seek to foreclose upon properties, which are
not the primary collateral for their loan. This, in turn, may accelerate other
indebtedness secured by properties. Foreclosure of properties would reduce our
income and asset value.

Dividend
Requirements as a Result Of Preferred Stock May Lead to a Possible
Inability to Sustain Dividends

The Operating Partnership
currently has $130 million in aggregate of Series B Cumulative Redeemable
Preferred Units (the “Series B Preferred Units”)and Series D
Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Units (the “Series D Preferred Units”)
outstanding. In addition, the Company has approximately $25 million of Series F
Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock (“Series F Preferred Stock”)
outstanding. The Series B Preferred Units, the Series D Preferred
Units, and the Series F Preferred Stock are collectively referred to as
the “Preferred Equity”.

The terms of the Series F
Preferred Stock and of the preferred stock into which each series of Preferred
Units are exchangeable provide for certain cumulative preferential cash
distributions per each share of preferred stock. These terms also provide that
while such preferred stock is outstanding, Essex cannot authorize, declare, or
pay any distributions on the Common Stock, unless all distributions accumulated
on all shares of such preferred stock have been paid in full. The distributions
payable on such preferred stock may impair Essex’s ability to pay dividends on
its Common Stock.

If Essex wishes to issue
any Common Stock in the future (including, upon exercise of stock options), the
funds required to continue to pay cash dividends at current levels will be
increased. Essex’s ability to pay dividends will depend largely upon the
performance of the Properties and other properties that may be acquired in the
future.

Essex’s ability to pay
dividends on its stock is further limited by the Maryland General Corporation
Law. Under the Maryland General Corporation Law, Essex may not make a
distribution on stock if, after giving effect to such distribution, either:

•

we
would not be able to pay our indebtedness as it becomes due in the usual course
of business; or

•

our
total assets would be less than our total liabilities.


If Essex cannot pay
dividends on its stock, Essex’s status as a real estate investment trust may be
jeopardized.

Resale
of Shares Pursuant to our Effective Registration Statement May Have an
Adverse Effect on the Market Price of the Shares

Pursuant to the
acquisition of John M. Sachs, Inc., a real estate company, in December 2002,
we issued 2,719,875 shares of common stock, as partial consideration for the
acquisition, to the trusts that were the shareholders of that company.  In connection with the acquisition, Essex
entered into a registration rights agreement with these trusts, pursuant to
which in January 2003 we filed a registration statement on Form S-3
in order to enable the resale of these shares of common stock. In an amendment
to this registration statement filed in April 2003, we also registered,
pursuant to certain registration rights, 50,000 shares of common stock which
are issuable to the trusts in connection with certain contractual obligations
and 2,270,490 shares of common stock which are issuable upon exchange of
limited partnership interests in the Operating Partnership. These limited
partnership interests are held by senior members of our management, certain
members of our Board of Directors and certain outside investors, or the
Operating Partnership holders, and comprise approximately 9.7% of the limited
partnership interests of the Operating Partnership as of December 31,
2004. In addition, the Operating Partnership has invested in certain real
estate partnerships. In the 2003 registration statement, we also registered,
pursuant to certain registration rights, 1,473,125 shares of common stock,
which are issuable upon redemption of all of the limited partnership interests
in such real estate partnerships. In sum, this 2003 registration statement
covers in aggregate 6,513,490 shares of our common stock. The resale of the
shares of common stock pursuant to the registration statement may have an
adverse effect on the market price of our shares.

Our
Chairman is Involved in Other Real Estate Activities and Investments, Which May Lead
to Conflicts of Interest

Our Chairman, George M.
Marcus is not an employee of Essex. Mr. Marcus owns interests in various
other real estate-related businesses and investments. He is the Chairman of The
Marcus & Millichap Company, or “MM”, which is a holding company for
certain real estate brokerage and services companies. MM has an interest in
Pacific Property Company, a company that invests in West Coast multifamily
residential properties. In 1999 we sold an office building to MM, which Essex
previously occupied as its corporate headquarters.

Mr. Marcus has
agreed not to divulge any information that may be received by him in his
capacity as Chairman of Essex to any of his affiliated companies and that he
will absent himself from any and all discussions by the Essex Board of
Directors regarding any proposed acquisition and/or development of a
multifamily property where it appears that there may be a conflict of interest
with any of his affiliated companies.  Notwithstanding this agreement, Mr. Marcus
and his affiliated entities may potentially compete with us in acquiring and/or
developing multifamily properties, which competition may be detrimental to
us.  In addition, due to such potential
competition for real estate investments, Mr. Marcus and his affiliated
entities may have a conflict of interest with us, which may be detrimental to
the interests of Essex’s stockholders.

The
Influence of Executive Officers, Directors and Significant Stockholders May Be
Detrimental to Holders of Common Stock

As of December 31,
2004, George M. Marcus, the Chairman of our Board of Directors, wholly or
partially owned 1,752,111 shares of common stock (including shares issuable
upon exchange of limited partnership interests in the Operating Partnership and
certain other partnerships and assuming exercise of all vested options). This
represents approximately 7.6% of the outstanding shares of our common stock. Mr. Marcus
currently does not have majority control over us. However, he currently has,
and likely will continue to have, significant influence with respect to the
election of directors and approval or disapproval of significant corporate
actions. Consequently, his influence could result in decisions that do not
reflect the interests of all our stockholders.


Under the partnership
agreement of the Operating Partnership, the consent of the holders of limited
partnership interests is generally required for any amendment of the agreement
and for certain extraordinary actions. Through their ownership of limited
partnership interests and their positions with us, our directors and executive
officers, including Mr. Marcus and Mr. William A. Millichap, a
director of Essex, have substantial influence on us. Consequently, their
influence could result in decisions that do not reflect the interests of all
stockholders.

Further pursuant
to our acquisition of John M. Sachs, Inc. in December 2002, we
issued, as partial consideration for the acquisition, 2,719,875 shares of our
common stock and an additional 35,860 shares of common stock in July 2003
to the trusts that were the shareholders of that company. As a result of this
issuance, these trusts own, as of December 31, 2004, in aggregate,
approximately 10% of our outstanding common stock. Pursuant to their ownership
interest in Essex, these trusts may have significant influence over us. Such
influence could result in decisions that do not reflect the interest of all our
stockholders.

The
Voting Rights of Preferred Stock May Allow Holders of Preferred Stock to
Impede Actions that Otherwise Benefit Holders of Common Stock

In general, the
holders of Series F Preferred stock and of the preferred stock into which
our preferred units are exchangeable do not have any voting rights. However, if
full distributions are not made on any outstanding preferred stock for six
quarterly distributions periods, the holders of preferred stock who have not
received distributions, voting together as a single class, will have the right
to elect two additional directors to serve on Essex’s Board of Directors. These
voting rights continue until all distributions in arrears and distributions for
the current quarterly period on the preferred stock have been paid in full. At
that time, the holders of the preferred stock are divested of these voting
rights, and the term and office of the directors so elected immediately
terminates.

In addition, while
any shares of Series F Preferred Stock or shares of preferred stock into
which the preferred units are exchangeable are outstanding, Essex may not
without the consent of the holders of two-thirds of the outstanding shares of
each series of preferred stock, each voting separately as a single class:

•

authorize
or create any class of series of stock that ranks senior to such preferred
stock with respect to the payment of dividends, rights upon liquidation,
dissolution or winding-up of our business;

•

amend,
alter or repeal the provisions of Essex’s Charter or Bylaws, that would
materially and adversely affect the rights of such preferred stock; or

•

in
the case of the preferred stock into which our preferred units are
exchangeable, merge or consolidate with another entity or transfer
substantially all of its assets to another entity, except if such preferred
stock remains outstanding with the surviving entity and has the same terms and
in certain other circumstances.

These voting
rights of the preferred stock may allow holders of preferred stock to impede or
veto actions that would otherwise benefit the holders of Essex’s Common Stock.

The
Redemption Rights of the Series B Preferred Units, Series D Preferred
Units and Series F Preferred Stock may be Detrimental to Holders of Common
Stock

Upon the occurrence of one of the following
events, the terms of the Operating Partnership’s Series B and D Preferred
Units require it to redeem all of such units and the terms of the Company’s Series F
Preferred Stock provide the holders of the majority of the outstanding Series F
Preferred Stock the right to require the Company to redeem all of such stock:

•

the
Company completes a “going private” transaction and its common stock is no
longer registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended:

•

the
Company completes a consolidation or merger or sale of substantially all of its
assets and the surviving entity’s debt securities do not possess an investment
grade rating; or


•

the
Company fails to qualify as a REIT

The aggregate
redemption price of the Series B Preferred Units would be $80 million, the
aggregate redemption price of the Series D Preferred Units would be $50
million and the aggregate redemption price of the Series F Preferred Stock
would be $25 million, plus, in each case, any accumulated distributions.

These redemption
rights may discourage or impede transactions that might otherwise be in the
interest of holders of common stock. Further, these redemption rights might
trigger in situations where the Company needs to conserve its cash reserves, in
which event such redemption might adversely affect the Company and its common
holders.

Maryland
Business Combination Law May Not Allow Certain Transactions Between us and
Affiliates to Proceed Without Compliance with Such Law

The Maryland General
Corporation Law establishes special requirements for “business combinations”
between a Maryland corporation and “interested stockholders” unless exemptions
are applicable. An interested stockholder is any person who beneficially owns
ten percent or more of the voting power of the then-outstanding voting stock.

The law also requires a
supermajority stockholder vote for such transactions. This means that the
transaction must be approved by at least:

•

80%
of the votes entitled to be cast by holders of outstanding voting shares; and

•

66%
of the votes entitled to be cast by holders of outstanding voting shares other
than shares held by the interested stockholder with whom the business
combination is to be effected.

However, as permitted by
the statute, the Board of Directors of Essex irrevocably has elected to exempt
any business combination by us, George M. Marcus, William A. Millichap, who are
the chairman and a director of Essex, respectively, and MM or any entity owned
or controlled by Messrs. Marcus and Millichap and MM. Consequently, the
super-majority vote requirement described above will not apply to any business
combination between us and Mr. Marcus, Mr. Millichap, or MM. As a
result, we may in the future enter into business combinations with Messrs. Marcus
and Millichap and MM, without compliance with the super-majority vote
requirements and other provisions of the Maryland General Corporation Law.

Anti-Takeover
Provisions Contained in the Operating Partnership Agreement, Charter, Bylaws,
and Certain Provisions of Maryland Law Could Delay, Defer or Prevent a Change
in Control

While Essex is the sole
general partner of the Operating Partnership, and generally has full and
exclusive responsibility and discretion in the management and control of the
Operating Partnership, certain provisions of the Operating Partnership’s
partnership agreement place limitations on Essex’s ability to act with respect
to the Operating Partnership. Such limitations could delay, defer or prevent a
transaction or a change in control that might involve a premium price for our
stock or otherwise be in the best interest of the stockholders or that could
otherwise adversely affect the interest of Essex’s stockholders. The partnership
agreement provides that if the limited partners own at least 5% of the
outstanding units of limited partnership interest in the Operating Partnership,
Essex cannot, without first obtaining the consent of a majority-in-interest of
the limited partners in the Operating Partnership, transfer all or any portion
of our general partner interest in the Operating Partnership to another entity.
Such limitations on Essex’s ability to act may result in our being precluded
from taking action that the Board of Directors believes is in the best
interests of Essex’s stockholders. In addition, as of December 31, 2004,
one individual, George M. Marcus, held or controlled more than 50% of the
outstanding units of limited partnership interest in the Operating Partnership,
allowing such actions to be blocked by a small number of limited partners.

Essex’s Charter
authorizes the issuance of additional shares of common stock or preferred stock
and the setting of the preferences, rights and other terms of such preferred
stock without the approval of the holders of the common stock. We may establish
one or more series of preferred stock that could delay, defer or prevent a
transaction or a change in control. Such a transaction might involve a premium
price for our stock or otherwise be in


the best interests of the
holders of common stock. Also, such a class of preferred stock could have
dividend, voting or other rights that could adversely affect the interest of
holders of common stock.

Essex’s Charter, as well
as Essex’s stockholder rights plan, also contains other provisions that may
delay, defer or prevent a transaction or a change in control that might be in
the best interest of Essex’s stockholders. Essex’s stockholder rights plan is
designed, among other things, to prevent a person or group from gaining control
of us without offering a fair price to all of Essex’s stockholders. Also, the
Bylaws may be amended by the Board of Directors to include provisions that would
have a similar effect, although Essex presently has no such intention. The
Charter contains ownership provisions limiting the transferability and
ownership of shares of capital stock, which may have the effect of delaying,
deferring or preventing a transaction or a change in control. For example,
subject to receiving an exemption from the Board of Directors, potential
acquirers may not purchase more than 6% in value of the stock (other than
qualified pension trusts which can acquire 9.9%). This may discourage tender
offers that may be attractive to the holders of common stock and limit the
opportunity for stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of common
stock.

In addition, the Maryland
General Corporations Law restricts the voting rights of shares deemed to be “control
shares.” Under the Maryland General Corporations Law, “control shares” are
those which, when aggregated with any other shares held by the acquirer,
entitle the acquirer to exercise voting power within specified ranges. Although
the Bylaws exempt Essex from the control share provisions of the Maryland
General Corporations Law, the Board of Directors may amend or eliminate the
provisions of the Bylaws at any time in the future. Moreover, any such
amendment or elimination of such provision of the Bylaws may result in the
application of the control share provisions of the Maryland General
Corporations Law not only to control shares which may be acquired in the
future, but also to control shares previously acquired. If the provisions of
the Bylaws are amended or eliminated, the control share provisions of the
Maryland General Corporations Law could delay, defer or prevent a transaction
or change in control that might involve a premium price for the stock or
otherwise be in the best interests of Essex’s stockholders.

Bond
Compliance Requirements May Limit Income From Certain Properties

At December 31,
2004, we had approximately $188.8 million of variable rate tax-exempt financing
relating to the Inglenook Court Apartments, Wandering Creek Apartments,
Treetops Apartments, Huntington Breakers Apartments, Camarillo Oaks Apartments,
Fountain Park and Parker Ranch Apartments and $15.5 million of fixed rate
tax-exempt financing related to Meadowood Apartments. This tax-exempt financing
subjects these properties to certain deed restrictions and restrictive
covenants. We expect to engage in tax-exempt financings in the future. In
addition, the Internal Revenue Code and rules and regulations thereunder
impose various restrictions, conditions and requirements excluding interest on
qualified bond obligations from gross income for federal income tax purposes.
The Internal Revenue Code also requires that at least 20% of apartment units be
made available to residents with gross incomes that do not exceed a specified
percentage, generally 50%, of the median income for the applicable family size
as determined by the Housing and Urban Development Department of the federal
government. In addition to federal requirements, certain state and local
authorities may impose additional rental restrictions. These restrictions may
limit income from the tax-exempt financed properties if we are required to
lower rental rates to attract residents who satisfy the median income test. If
Essex does not reserve the required number of apartment homes for residents
satisfying these income requirements, the tax-exempt status of the bonds may be
terminated, the obligations under the bond documents may be accelerated and we
may be subject to additional contractual liability.

Adverse
Effect To Property Income And Value Due To General Real Estate Investment Risks

Real property investments
are subject to a variety of risks. The yields available from equity investments
in real estate depend on the amount of income generated and expenses incurred.
If the properties do not generate sufficient income to meet operating expenses,
including debt service and capital expenditures, cash flow and the ability to
make distributions to stockholders will be adversely affected. The performance of
the economy in each of the areas in which the properties are located affects
occupancy, market rental rates and expenses.

Consequently, the income
from the properties and their underlying values may be impacted. The financial
results of major local employers may have an impact on the cash flow and value
of certain of the properties as well.


Income from the
properties may be further adversely affected by, among other things, the
following factors:

•

the
general economic climate;

•

local
economic conditions in which the properties are located, such as oversupply of
housing or a reduction in demand for rental housing;

•

the
attractiveness of the properties to tenants;

•

competition
from other available space;

•

Essex’s
ability to provide for adequate maintenance and insurance; and

•

increased
operating expenses.

Also, as leases on the
properties expire, tenants may enter into new leases on terms that are less
favorable to us. Income and real estate values also may be adversely affected
by such factors as applicable laws (e.g., the Americans With Disabilities Act
of 1990 and tax laws), interest rate levels and the availability and terms of
financing. In addition, real estate investments are relatively illiquid and,
therefore, our ability to vary our portfolio promptly in response to changes in
economic or other conditions may be quite limited.

Essex’s
Joint Ventures and Joint Ownership of Properties and Partial Interests in
Corporations and Limited Partnerships Could Limit Essex’s Ability to Control
Such Properties and Partial Interests

Instead of purchasing
properties directly, we have invested and may continue to invest as a
co-venturer. Joint venturers often have shared control over the operation of
the joint venture assets. Therefore, it is possible that the co-venturer in an
investment might become bankrupt, or have economic or business interests or
goals that are inconsistent with our business interests or goals, or be in a
position to take action contrary to our instructions or requests, or our
policies or objectives. Consequently, a co-venturer’s actions might subject
property owned by the joint venture to additional risk. Although we seek to
maintain sufficient influence of any joint venture to achieve its objectives,
we may be unable to take action without our joint venture partners’ approval,
or joint venture partners could take actions binding on the joint venture
without consent. Additionally, should a joint venture partner become bankrupt,
we could become liable for such partner’s share of joint venture liabilities.

From time to time, we,
through the Operating Partnership, invest in corporations, limited
partnerships, limited liability companies or other entities that have been formed
for the purpose of acquiring, developing or managing real property. In certain
circumstances, the Operating Partnership’s interest in a particular entity may
be less than a majority of the outstanding voting interests of that entity.
Therefore, the Operating Partnership’s ability to control the daily operations
of such an entity may be limited. Furthermore, the Operating Partnership may
not have the power to remove a majority of the board of directors (in the case
of a corporation) or the general partner or partners (in the case of a limited
partnership) of such an entity in the event that its operations conflict with
the Operating Partnership’s objectives. In addition, the Operating Partnership
may not be able to dispose of its interests in such an entity. In the event
that such an entity becomes insolvent, the Operating Partnership may lose up to
its entire investment in and any advances to the entity. In addition, we have
and in the future may enter into transactions that could require us to pay the tax
liabilities of partners, which contribute assets into joint ventures or the
Operating Partnership, in the event that certain taxable events, which are
within our control, occur. Although we plan to hold the contributed assets or
defer recognition of gain on their sale pursuant to the like-kind exchange rules under
Section 1031 of the Internal Revenue Code we can provide no assurance that
we will be able to do so and if such tax liabilities were incurred they can
expect to have a material impact on our financial position.

Dedicated
Investment Activities and Other Factors Specifically Related to Essex Apartment
Value Fund II, L.P.

In 2004, we organized an
investment fund, Essex Apartment Value Fund II, L.P.(“Fund II”), which will be,
subject to specific exceptions, our exclusive investment vehicle for new
investment until at least 90% of Fund II’s committed capital has been invested
or committed for investments, or if earlier, October 31, 2006. We are
committed to invest 28.2% of the aggregate capital committed to Fund II. Fund
II involves risks to us such as the


following: our partners
in Fund II might become bankrupt (in which event we might become generally
liable for the liabilities of Fund II); have economic or business interests or
goals that are inconsistent with our business interests or goals; fail to fund
capital commitments as contractually required; or fail to approve decisions
regarding Fund II that are in our best interest. We will, however, generally
seek to maintain sufficient influence over Fund II to permit it to achieve its
business objectives.

Investments
In Mortgages And Other Real Estate Securities

We may invest in
securities related to real estate, which could adversely affect our ability to
make distributions to stockholders. We may purchase securities issued by
entities, which own real estate and may also invest in mortgages or unsecured
debt obligations. These mortgages may be first, second or third mortgages that
may or may not be insured or otherwise guaranteed. In general, investments in
mortgages include the following risks:

•

that
the value of mortgaged property may be less than the amounts owed, causing
realized or unrealized losses;

•

the
borrower may not pay indebtedness under the mortgage when due, requiring us to
foreclose, and the amount recovered in connection with the foreclosure may be
less than the amount owed;

•

that
interest rates payable on the mortgages may be lower than our cost of funds;
and

•

in
the case of junior mortgages, that foreclosure of a senior mortgage would
eliminate the junior mortgage.

If any of the above were
to occur, cash flows from operations and our ability to make expected dividends
to stockholders could be adversely affected.

Possible
Environmental Liabilities

Under various federal,
state and local laws, ordinances and regulations, an owner or operator of real
estate is liable for the costs of removal or remediation of certain hazardous
or toxic substances on, in, to or migrating from such property. Such laws often
impose liability without regard as to whether the owner or operator knew of, or
was responsible for, the presence of such hazardous or toxic substances. The
presence of such substances, or the failure to properly remediate such
substances, may adversely affect the owner’s or operator’s ability to sell or
rent such property or to borrow using such property as collateral. In addition,
persons exposed to such substances, either through soil vapor or ingestion of
the substances, may claim personal injury damages. Persons who arrange for the
disposal or treatment of hazardous or toxic substances or wastes also may be
liable for the costs of removal or remediation of such substances at the
disposal or treatment facility to which such substances or wastes were sent,
whether or not such facility is owned or operated by such person. In addition,
certain environmental laws impose liability for release of asbestos-containing
materials (“ACMs”) into the air, and third parties may seek recovery from
owners or operators of real properties for personal injury associated with ACMs. In
connection with the ownership (direct or indirect), operation, management and
development of real properties, the Company could be considered an owner or
operator of such properties or as having arranged for the disposal or treatment
of hazardous or toxic substances and, therefore, may be potentially liable for
removal or remediation costs, as well as certain other costs, including
governmental fines and costs related to injuries of persons and property.

Investments in real
property create a potential for environmental liabilities on the part of the
owner of such real property. We carry certain limited insurance coverage for
this type of environmental risk. We have conducted environmental studies which
revealed the presence of groundwater contamination at certain properties. Such
contamination at certain of these properties was reported to have migrated
on-site from adjacent industrial manufacturing operations. The former
industrial users of the properties were identified as the source of
contamination. The environmental studies noted that certain properties are
located adjacent to any possible down gradient from sites with known
groundwater contamination, the lateral limits of which may extend onto such
properties. The environmental studies also noted that at certain of these
properties, contamination existed because of the presence of underground fuel
storage tanks, which have been removed. In general, in connection with the


ownership, operation,
financing, management and development of real properties, we may be potentially
liable for removal or clean-up costs, as well as certain other costs and
environmental liabilities. We may also be subject to governmental fines and
costs related to injuries to persons and property.

Recently there has been
an increasing number of lawsuits against owners and managers of multifamily
properties alleging personal injury and property damage caused by the presence
of mold in residential real estate. Some of these lawsuits have resulted in
substantial monetary judgments or settlements. Essex has been sued for mold
related matters and has settled some, but not all, of  such matters. Insurance carriers have reacted
to mold related liability awards by excluding mold related claims from standard
policies and pricing mold endorsements at prohibitively high rates. We have
adopted programs designed to manage the existence of mold in our properties as
well as guidelines for promptly addressing and resolving reports of mold to
minimize any impact mold might have on residents or the property.

California has enacted
legislation commonly referred to as “Proposition 65” requiring that “clear and
reasonable” warnings be given to consumers who are exposed to chemicals known
to the State of California to cause cancer or reproductive toxicity, including
tobacco smoke. Although we have sought to comply with Proposition 65
requirements, we cannot assure you that we will not be adversely affected by
litigation relating to Proposition 65.

Methane gas is a
naturally-occurring gas that is commonly found below the surface in several
areas of California, particularly in the Southern California coastal areas. 
Methane is a non-toxic gas, but can be ignitable in confined spaces. 
Although naturally-occurring, methane gas is not regulated at the state or
federal level, some local governments, such as the County of Los Angeles, have
imposed requirements that new buildings install detection systems in areas
where methane gas is known to be located.  Methane gas is also associated
with certain industrial activities, such as former municipal waste
landfills.

Except with respect to
three Properties, the Company has no indemnification agreements from third
parties for potential environmental clean-up costs at its Properties. The
Company has no way of determining at this time the magnitude of any potential
liability to which it may be subject arising out of unknown environmental
conditions or violations with respect to the properties formerly owned by the
Company. No assurance can be given that existing environmental studies with
respect to any of the Properties reveal all environmental liabilities, that any
prior owner or operator of a Property did not create any material environmental
condition not known to the Company, or that a material environmental condition
does not exist as to any one or more of the Properties. The Company has limited
insurance coverage for the types of environmental liabilities described above.

General
Uninsured Losses

We have a comprehensive
insurance program covering our property and operating activities. There are,
however, certain types of extraordinary losses for which we may not have
sufficient insurance. Accordingly, we may sustain uninsured losses due to
insurance deductibles, self-insured retention, uninsured claims or
casualties,  or losses in excess of
applicable coverage.

Changes
In Real Estate Tax And Other Laws

Generally we do not
directly pass through costs resulting from changes in real estate tax laws to
residential property tenants. We also do not generally pass through increases
in income, service or other taxes, to tenants under leases. These costs may
adversely affect funds from operations and the ability to make distributions to
stockholders. Similarly, compliance with changes in (i) laws increasing
the potential liability for environmental conditions existing on properties or
the restrictions on discharges or other conditions or (ii) rent control or
rent stabilization laws or other laws regulating housing may result in
significant unanticipated expenditures, which would adversely affect funds from
operations and the ability to make distributions to stockholders.

Changes
In Financing Policy; No Limitation On Debt

We have adopted a policy
of maintaining a debt-to-total-market-capitalization ratio of less than 50%.
The calculation of debt-to-total-market-capitalization is as follows: total
property indebtedness divided by the sum of


total property
indebtedness plus total equity market capitalization.

As used in the above
formula, total equity market capitalization is equal to the aggregate market
value of the outstanding shares of common stock (based on the greater of
current market price or the gross proceeds per share from public offerings of
the outstanding shares plus any undistributed net cash flow), assuming the
conversion of all limited partnership interests in the Operating Partnership
into shares of common stock and the gross proceeds of the preferred units of
the Operating Partnership. Based on this calculation (including the current
market price and excluding undistributed net cash flow), our debt-to-total-market-capitalization
ratio was approximately 36.4% as of December 31, 2004.

Our organizational
documents do not limit the amount or percentage of indebtedness that may be
incurred. Accordingly, the Board of Directors of Essex could change current
policies and the policies of the Operating Partnership regarding indebtedness.
If we changed these policies, we could incur more debt, resulting in an
increased risk of default on our obligations and the obligations of the
Operating Partnership, and an increase in debt service requirements that could
adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. Such
increased debt could exceed the underlying value of the properties.

We are Subject to Certain Tax Risks

We
have elected to be taxed as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code. Our
qualification as a REIT requires us to satisfy numerous requirements (some on
an annual and quarterly basis) established under highly technical and complex
Internal Revenue Code provisions for which there are only limited judicial or
administrative interpretations, and involves the determination of various
factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control. Although we
intend that our current organization and method of operation enable us to
qualify as a REIT, we cannot assure you that we so qualify or that we will be
able to remain so qualified in the future. 
Future legislation, new regulations, administrative interpretations or
court decisions could adversely affect our ability to qualify as a REIT or adversely
affect our stockholdersIf we fail to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, we
would be subject to federal income tax (including any applicable alternative
minimum tax) on our taxable income at corporate rates, and would not be allowed
to deduct dividends paid to our shareholders in computing our taxable income.
We may also be disqualified from treatment as a REIT for the four taxable years
following the year in which we failed to qualify. The additional tax liability
would reduce our net earnings available for investment or distribution to
stockholders. In addition, we would no longer be required to make distributions
to our stockholders. Even if we continue to qualify as a REIT, we will continue
to be subject to certain federal, state and local taxes on our income and
property.

We
have established several taxable REIT subsidiaries. Despite our qualifications
as a REIT, our taxable REIT subsidiaries must pay federal income tax on their
taxable income. While we will attempt to ensure that our dealings with our
taxable REIT subsidiaries will not adversely affect our REIT qualification, we
cannot provide assurance that we will successfully achieve that result.
Furthermore, we may be subject to a 100% penalty tax, or our taxable REIT
subsidiaries may be denied deductions, to the extent our dealings with our
taxable REIT subsidiaries are not deemed to be arm’s length in nature.

Other Matters

Certain
Policies of the Company

The Company intends to
continue to operate in a manner that will not subject it to regulation under
the Investment Company Act of 1940. The Company has in the past five years and
may in the future (i) issue securities senior to its Common Stock, (ii) fund
acquisition activities with borrowings under its line of credit and (iii) offer
shares of Common Stock and/or units of limited partnership interest in the
Operating Partnership or affiliated partnerships as partial consideration for
property acquisitions. The Company from time to time acquires partnership
interests in partnerships and joint ventures, either directly or indirectly
through subsidiaries of the Company, when such entities’ underlying assets are
real estate. In general, the Company does not (i) underwrite securities of
other issuers or (ii) actively trade in loans or other investments.


The Company primarily
invests in multifamily properties in Southern California (Los Angeles, Ventura,
Orange, San Diego and Riverside counties), Northern California (the San
Francisco Bay Area), and the Pacific Northwest (the Seattle, Washington and
Portland, Oregon metropolitan areas). The Company currently intends to continue
to invest in multifamily properties in such regions, but may change such policy
without a vote of the stockholders. In connection with the Sachs’ portfolio
acquisition in December 2002, the Company has acquired two properties in
Nevada and one property in Texas. The two properties located in Nevada were
disposed of in January 2005.

The policies discussed
above may be reviewed and modified from time to time by the Board of Directors without
the vote of the stockholders.

Item 2. Properties

The Company’s property
portfolio as of December 31, 2004 (including partial ownership interests)
consists of ownership interests in 120 multifamily properties (comprising
25,518 apartment units), of which 13,755 units are located in Southern
California (Los Angeles, Ventura, Orange, San Diego and Riverside counties),
5,810 units are located in Northern California (the San Francisco Bay Area),
5,651 of which are located in the Pacific Northwest (4,776 units in the Seattle
metropolitan area and 875 units in the Portland, Oregon metropolitan area), and
302 units are located in Houston, Texas. In addition, at December 31,
2004, the Company owns other real estate assets consisting of four recreational
vehicle parks (comprising 698 spaces), five office buildings (totaling
approximately 173,540 square feet) and two manufactured housing communities
(containing 607 sites).  One office
building, which is located in Northern California (Palo Alto), has approximately
17,400 square feet and houses the Company’s headquarters. Another office
building, located in Southern California (Woodland Hills), has approximately
38,940 square feet, of which the Company occupies approximately 11,200 square
feet. The Woodland Hills office building has eight third party tenants
occupying approximately 26,600 feet. The Company along with its affiliated
entities and joint ventures also have entered into commitments for the
development of 645 units in four multifamily communities; two of which are in
Northern California and two in Southern California.  See “Development” in Item 1 of this Annual
Report on Form 10-K for a list of our properties under development.

The Company’s multifamily
properties accounted for 99% of the Company’s property revenues for the year
ended December 31, 2004.

Occupancy
Rates

The 120 multifamily
residential properties had an average occupancy, based on “financial occupancy,”
during the year ended December 31, 2004, of approximately 96%. With
respect to stabilized multifamily properties with sufficient operating history,
occupancy figures are based on financial occupancy, which is defined as the
percentage resulting from dividing actual rental revenue by total possible
rental revenue. Actual rental revenue represents contractual revenue pursuant
to leases without considering delinquency and concessions. Total possible
rental revenue represents the value of all apartment units, with occupied units
valued at contractual rental rates pursuant to leases and vacant units valued
at estimated market rents. We believe that financial occupancy is a meaningful
measure of occupancy because it considers the value of each vacant unit at its
estimated market rate. Financial occupancy may not completely reflect
short-term trends in physical occupancy and financial occupancy rates as
disclosed by other REITs may not be comparable to our calculation of financial
occupancy.

As of December 31,
2004, the headquarters building was 100% occupied by the Company and the
Southern California office building was 97% occupied, based on physical
occupancy. With respect to office buildings, occupancy figures are based on “physical
occupancy” which refers to the percentage resulting from dividing leased and
occupied square footage by rentable square footage. With respect to
recreational vehicle parks, manufactured housing communities, or multifamily
properties which have not yet stabilized or have insufficient operating
history, occupancy figures are based on “physical occupancy” which refers to
the percentage resulting from dividing leased and occupied units by rentable
units.

For the year ended December 31,
2004, none of the Company’s Properties had book values equal to 10% or more of
total assets of the Company or gross revenues equal to 10% or more of aggregate
gross revenues of the Company.


Multifamily
Residential Properties

The Company’s multifamily
Properties are generally suburban garden apartments and townhomes comprising
multiple clusters of two and three story buildings situated on three to fifteen
acres of land. The multifamily properties have on average 210 units, with a mix
of studio, one, two and some three-bedroom units. A wide variety of amenities
are available at each apartment community, including covered parking,
fireplaces, swimming pools, clubhouses with complete fitness facilities,
volleyball and playground areas and tennis courts.

The Company selects,
trains and supervises a full team of on-site service and maintenance personnel.
The Company believes that its customer service approach enhances its ability to
retain tenants and that its multifamily Properties were built well and have
been maintained well since acquisition.

Office
Buildings

The Company’s corporate
headquarters is located in a two-story office building with approximately
17,400 square feet located at 925 East Meadow Drive, Palo Alto, California. The
Company acquired this property in 1997. The Company also owns an office
building in Southern California (Woodland Hills), comprised of approximately
38,940 square feet building, of which the Company occupies approximately 11,200
square feet at December 31, 2004. The building has eight third party
tenants occupying approximately 26,600 feet. The largest single tenant occupies
approximately 10,900 square feet. The Company acquired this property in 2001.
The Company also has two small office buildings comprising approximately 7,200
square feet that are located in San Diego, California, which were sold in January 2005
for $1.3 million.  The Company has a
mortgage loan receivable on an office building with approximately 110,000
square feet located in Irvine, California, which is consolidated  under FIN 46R.

Recreational
Vehicle Parks

The Company owns four
recreational vehicle parks (comprising of 698 spaces), acquired in the Company’s
December 2002 acquisition of John M. Sachs, Inc., located in El Cajon,
California; San Jaciento, California; and Las Vegas Nevada. The recreational
vehicle park located in Las Vegas, Nevada was sold in January 2005.

Manufactured Housing Communities

The Company owns
manufactured housing communities (containing 607 sites), acquired in the
Company’s December 2002 acquisition of John M. Sachs, Inc., located in
Vista, California and Las Vegas, Nevada.

During the fourth quarter
of 2003, the Company entered into lease and purchase option agreements with
unrelated third parties related to its five recreational vehicle parks that are
comprised of 1,717 spaces, and two manufactured housing communities that
contain 607 sites.  Based on the
agreements, the unrelated third parties have an option to purchase the assets
in approximately four years for approximately $41.7 million - a 5% premium to
the gross book value of the assets. 
Under the lease agreements Essex is to receive a fixed monthly lease
payment in addition to a non-refundable upfront payment that will be amortized
over approximately five years (the life of the lease).  During 2004, the Company granted the lessees
of one manufactured housing community and two recreational vehicle parks the
right to exercise their purchase agreements in 2004. On July 18, 2004 the
Company sold Golden Village Recreational Vehicle Park for $6.7 million. As of December 31,
2004 Riviera RV Resort and Riviera Mobile Home Park met the “held for sale”
criteria under SFAS 144. In accordance with SFAS 144, assets and liabilities
and the results of operations of the properties are presented as discontinued
operations in the consolidated financial statements for all periods presented.
On January 20, 2005 the Company sold Riviera RV Resort and Riviera Mobile

describe the Company’s Properties as of December 31, 2004. The first table
describes the Company’s multifamily residential properties and the second table
describes the Company’s other real estate assets.





(1)

Unless
otherwise specified, the Company has a 100% ownership interest in each
Property.

(2)

For multifamily
residential properties, occupancy rates are based on financial occupancy for
the year ended December 31, 2004; for the office buildings, recreational
vehicle parks, manufactured housing communities or properties which have not
yet stabilized or have insufficient operating history, occupancy rates are
based on physical occupancy as of December 31, 2004. For an explanation of
how financial occupancy and physical occupancy are calculated, see “Properties-Occupancy
Rates” in this Item 2.

(3)

The
Company has a 30% special limited partnership interest in the entity, that owns

Item 3.    Legal
Proceedings

In April 2004, a
lawsuit entitled Chace Nelson and Douglas Korte, et al. v. Essex Property Trust
was filed against the Company in the California Superior Court in the County of
Alameda.  In this lawsuit, two former
Company maintenance employees seek unpaid wages, associated penalties and
attorneys’ fees on behalf of a putative class of the Company’s current and
former maintenance employees who were required to wear a pager while they were
on call during evening and weekend hours. 
The Company intends to vigorously defend against the claims alleged in
this litigation. However, litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties, and
no assurance can be given that the Company will prevail in this lawsuit.

The Company is subject to
various other lawsuits arising in the ordinary course of its business
operations.  Accordingly, such lawsuits,
as well as the class action lawsuit described above, could result in
substantial costs and diversion of resources and could have a material adverse
effect on the Company’s financial condition, results of operation or cash
flows.

stock has been traded on the NYSE since June 13, 1994. The high, low and
closing price per share of common stock reported on the NYSE for the quarters
indicated are as follows:

The closing price as of March 1,
2005 was $73.89.

Holders

The approximate number of
holders of record of the shares of the Company’s common stock was 224 as of March 1,
2005. This number does not include stockholders whose shares are held in trust

Return
of Capital

Under provisions of the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, the portion of the cash dividend, if
any, that exceeds earnings and profits is considered a return of capital. The
return of capital is generated due to a variety of factors, including the
deduction of non-cash expenses, primarily depreciation, in the determination of
earnings and profits.

The status of the cash
dividends distributed for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002
for tax purposes is as follows:


Dividends
and Distributions

Future distributions by
the Company will be at the discretion of the Board of Directors and will depend
on the actual funds from operations of the Company, its financial condition,
capital requirements, the annual distribution requirements under the REIT
provisions of the Internal Revenue Code, applicable legal restrictions and such
other factors as the Board of Directors deems relevant. There are currently no
contractual restrictions on the Company’s present or future ability to pay
dividends.

Dividend
Reinvestment and Share Purchase Plan

The Company has adopted a
dividend reinvestment and share purchase plan designed to provide holders of
Common Stock with a convenient and economical means to reinvest all or a
portion of their cash dividends in shares of Common Stock and to acquire
additional shares of Common Stock through voluntary purchases. Computershare,
LLC, which serves as the Company’s transfer agent, administers the dividend
reinvestment and share purchase plan. For a copy of the plan, contact
Computershare, LLC at

360-5354.

Stockholder
Rights Plan

In 1998, the Company
adopted a stockholder rights plan that is designed to enhance the ability of
all of the Company’s stockholders to realize the long-term value of their
investment. The rights plan is designed, in part, to prevent a person or group
from gaining control of the Company without offering a fair price to all of the
Company’s stockholders.

On October 13, 1998,
the Board declared a one for one preferred share purchase right (a “Right”) for
each outstanding share of Common Stock. Each Right entitles the registered
holder to purchase from the Company one one-hundredth of a share of Series A
Junior Participating Preferred Stock, par value $.0001 per share, of the
Company, at a price of $99.13 per one-hundredth of a share, subject to
adjustment. The description and terms of the Rights are set forth in a Rights
Agreement dated as of November 11, 1998, as amended between the Company
and Computershare, LLC as Rights Agent.

Securities
Authorized for Issuance under Equity Compensation Plans

2005 Proxy Statement under the heading “Equity Compensation Plan Information”,
which disclosure is incorporated herein by reference.


Item 6. Selected Financial Data

The following
tables set forth summary financial and operating information for the Company
from January 1, 2000 through December 31, 2004.


(1)

The
above financial and operating information from January 1, 2002 through December 31,
2003 reflect the retroactive adoption of FIN 46R and SFAS 123. The above
financial and operating information from January 1, 2000 through December 31,
2001 have not been restated to reflect the retroactive adoption of FIN 46R and
SFAS 123 and have not been reclassified to present properties sold as
discontinued operations. Because the 2000 and 2001 balances have not been
restated, the results for those periods may not be comparable to the results
for the later periods set forth above.


(2)

Extraordinary
item – loss on early extinguishment of debt of $119 for the year ended December 31,
2000 has been reclassified as interest expense in accordance with the adoption
of SFAS No. 145 on January 1, 2003.

(3)

Interest coverage ratio
represents earnings before minority interests, gain on sales of real estate,
interest expense, taxes, depreciation and amortization (“adjusted EBITDA”)
divided by interest expense.  The Company
believes that the interest coverage ratio is useful to readers because it is
frequently used by investors, lenders, security analysts and other interested
parties in the evaluation of companies in our industry.  In addition, the Company believes that this
ratio is useful in evaluating our performance compared to that of other
companies in our industry because the calculation of the adjusted EBITDA
component of the interest coverage ratio generally eliminates the effects of
financing costs, income taxes, and depreciation and amortization, which items
may vary for different companies for reasons unrelated to operating
performance.

The adjusted
EBITDA component of the interest coverage ratio, however, is not a recognized
measurement under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP.  When analyzing our operating performance,
readers should use the interest coverage ratio and its adjusted EBITDA
component in addition to, and not as an alternative for, net income, as
determined in accordance with GAAP. 
Because not all companies use identical calculations, our presentation
of the interest coverage ratio and its adjusted EBITDA component may not be
comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies.  Furthermore, the interest coverage ratio is
not intended to be a measure of free cash flow for our management’s
discretionary use, as it does not consider certain cash requirements such as
income tax payments, debt service requirements, capital expenditures and other
fixed charges.  The amounts shown for the
interest coverage ratio and adjusted EBITDA may also differ from the amounts
calculated under similarly titled definitions in our debt instruments, which
can be further adjusted to reflect certain other cash and non-cash charges and
are used to determine compliance with financial covenants and our ability to
engage in certain activities such as incurring additional debt and making
certain restricted payments.

(4)

Gross operating margin
represents rental revenues and other property income less property operating
expenses, exclusive of depreciation and amortization, divided by rental
revenues and other property income.

(5)

Same property apartment
units are those units in properties that the Company has consolidated for the
entire two years ended as of the end of the period set forth. The number of
same property apartment units in such properties may vary at each year-end.
Percentage changes in averages per unit do not correspond to total same
property revenues and expense percent changes which are discussed in Item
7—Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations.

(6)

Average same property
monthly rental rate per apartment unit represents total scheduled rent for the
same property apartment units for the period (actual rental rates on occupied
apartment units plus market rental rates on vacant apartment units) divided by
the number of such apartment units and further divided by the number of months
in the period.

(7)

Average same property
monthly expenses per apartment unit represents total monthly operating
expenses, exclusive of depreciation and amortization, for the same property
apartment units for the period divided by the total number of such apartment
units and further divided by the number of months in the period.

(8)

Occupancy rates are
based on financial occupancy. For an explanation of how financial occupancy is
calculated, see “Properties-Occupancy Rates” in Item 2 of Part I of this Form
10-K.


Item 7. M

anagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results
of Operations

The following discussion
is based on the consolidated financial statements of Essex Property Trust, Inc.
(“Essex” or the “Company”) as of and for the years ended December 31,
2004, 2003 and 2002. This information should be read in conjunction with the
accompanying consolidated financial statements and notes thereto.  These consolidated financial statements
include all adjustments which are, in the opinion of management, necessary to
reflect a fair statement of the results and all such adjustments are of a
normal recurring nature.

Substantially all of the
assets of the Company are held by, and substantially all operations are
conducted through, Essex Portfolio, L.P. (the “Operating Partnership”).  Effective January 1, 2004, the Operating
Partnership consolidated various entities pursuant to its adoption of FIN 46R,
which is discussed further below.  The
Company is the sole general partner of the Operating Partnership and, as of December 31,
2004, owned an approximate 90.3% general partnership interest in the Operating
Partnership. The Company has elected to be treated as a real estate investment
trust (“REIT”) for federal income tax purposes.

2004, and those other risk factors and special considerations set forth in the
Company’s other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”)
which may cause the actual results, performance or achievements of the Company
to be materially different from any future results, performance or achievements
expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. All forward-looking
statements and reasons why results may differ included in this Form 10-K are
made as of the date hereof, and we assume no obligation to update any such
forward-looking statement or reason why actual results may differ.


Overview

The Company believes that its operating results have
largely been a result of its business strategy of investing in submarkets that
provide the greatest potential for rental growth at the lowest relative
risk.  Essex believes that its market
research process, which includes an analysis of both metropolitan statistical
areas (MSAs) and submarkets, provides it with a distinct competitive advantage.  Essex researches markets by reviewing data
from private and government sources as well as information developed or
verified by its field personnel.  Essex
then utilizes its proprietary research model to project market rent trends,
allowing the Company to allocate capital to the markets with the best
risk-adjusted return potential.

Essex’s research process begins with a macro-economic
analysis of various MSAs, followed by an evaluation of the submarkets within
that MSA.  The objective of the economic
research department is to estimate the amount of new demand for housing,
comparing it to the number of single family and multifamily homes being
constructed within a submarket. 
Historically, markets with demand for multifamily housing that is
greater than supply generate increasing occupancy levels and growth in rents.

Key components of Essex’s analysis are as follows:

Job Growth:  The
Company believes that quality job growth will lead to demand for multifamily
and for-sale housing.  Based on a variety
of considerations, the Company estimates how the total demand for housing will
be allocated between rental and for-sale housing.

Housing Supply: 
Limited housing supply, both rental and for-sale, is a very important
factor in maintaining high occupancy levels, particularly in periods of
recession or slow economic growth.  The
Company seeks to identify markets in which there is a low level of housing
construction, measured as a percentage of existing housing stock.

Cost of for-sale housing:  The Company prefers areas with relatively
expensive for-sale housing, which is usually caused by an insufficient amount
of single-family housing construction. 
The Company seeks to identify areas where the cost of rent is low
relative to both median income levels and the cost of homeownership.

Demographic trends: 
The Company evaluates areas with long-term positive immigration and
demographic trends, and areas that provide an attractive quality of life.

Based on its evaluation of multifamily housing supply
and demand factors, the Company forecasts the occupancy and rent trends for its
targeted submarkets, and actively seeks to expand its multifamily portfolio in
the submarkets with the greatest risk-adjusted return.

By region, the Company’s operating results and
investment strategy are as follows:

Southern California Region:  At the time of the Company’s 1994 initial
public offering (IPO), the Company had ownership interests in this region
representing 17% of its multifamily units. 
Following the IPO, the Company, using its research process, determined
that various markets in the Southern California region were attractive for
multifamily property investment and, accordingly, the Company increased its
ownership in such markets. As of December 31, 2004, we had ownership
interests in this region representing 54% of our multifamily units.  During the year ended December 31, 2004,
the region continued to perform well, with same property revenues increasing by
3.6% as compared to 2003.  The Company
expects this region to generate positive rent growth of approximately 3.3% in
2005.

Northern California Region:  As of December 31, 2004, the Company had
ownership interests in this region representing 23% of its multifamily
units.  In 2004, same property revenues
decreased 4.0% as compared to 2003.  The Company
expects market rents to increase by approximately 1.0% in 2005.  As a result, the Company will begin to
increase its investment focus in this region.

Pacific Northwest Region: As of December 31,
2004, the Company had ownership interests in this region representing 22% of
its multifamily units.  This region
created jobs in 2004, and same property revenues increased by 1.4% as compared
to 2003.  The Company expects continued
job growth, lending to rental revenue growth of approximately 1.8% in 2005.


Accounting Changes

Variable Interest Entities

In December, 2003 the
Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Interpretation No. 46
Revised (FIN 46R), “Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, an
Interpretation of ARB No. 51.” FIN 46R established new measurement techniques
to evaluate whether entities should be consolidated in accordance with
Accounting Research Bulletin (ARB) No. 51, “Consolidated Financial Statements.”  FIN 46R defined variable interest entities
(VIEs), in which equity investors lack an essential characteristic of a
controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity investment at
risk to permit the entity to finance its activities without additional
subordinated financial support from other parties.  As of January 1, 2004, the Company
adopted the provisions of FIN 46R using the retroactive restatement approach,
and amounts have been restated for the years ended December 31, 2003 and
2002 to reflect the adoption of FIN 46R.

Based on our analysis of
FIN 46R, the Company consolidated Essex Management Corporation (EMC), Essex
Fidelity I Corporation (EFC), 17 Down REIT limited partnerships (comprising ten
properties), an office building that is subject to loans made by the Company,
and the multifamily improvements owned by a third party in which the Company
owns the land underlying these improvements and from which the Company receives
fees, including land lease, subordination and property management fees.  The Company consolidated these entities
because it is deemed the primary beneficiary under FIN 46R.  The Company’s total assets and liabilities
related to these VIEs, net of intercompany eliminations, were approximately
$238.1 million and $155.1 million, respectively, at December 31, 2004 and
$246.1 million and $156.5 million, respectively, at December 31, 2003.

The Down REIT entities
that collectively own ten multifamily properties (1,831 units) were investments
made under arrangements whereby EMC became the general partner, the Operating
Partnership became a special limited partner, and the other limited partners
were granted rights of redemption for their interests. Such limited partners
can request to be redeemed and the Company can elect to redeem their rights for
cash or by issuing shares of its common stock on a one share per unit basis.
Conversion values will be based on the market value of the Company’s common
stock at the time of redemption multiplied by the number of units stipulated
under the above arrangements. The other limited partners receive distributions
based on the Company’s current dividend rate times the number of units held. At
December 31, 2004, the maximum number of shares that could be issued to
meet redemption of these Down REIT entities is 1,345,003.  As of December 31, 2004 and December 31,
2003, the carrying value of the other limited partners’ interests is presented
at their historical cost and is classified within minority interests in the
accompanying consolidated balance sheets.

Interest holders in VIEs
consolidated by the Company are allocated a priority of net income equal to the
cash payments made to those interest holders for services rendered or
distributions from cash flow.  The
remaining results of operations are generally allocated to the Company.

Properties consolidated
in accordance with FIN 46R were encumbered by third party, non-recourse loans
totaling $151.3 million and $152.7 million as of December 31, 2004 and December 31,
2003, respectively.

During 2004, the Company
entered into two new arrangements that are deemed to be VIEs:

1) The entity that
purchased The Essex at Lake Merritt property as discussed in Item 1 –
Dispositions, is a VIE. The Company’s participating loan to the entity, while
representing a variable interest, does not result in the Company being the
primary beneficiary.

2) The joint venture the
Company entered into to develop a 5-story building in Los Angeles, California
as discussed in Item 1 – Development, is an entity in which the Company is the
primary beneficiary, and the joint venture was consolidated as of December 31,
2004.

As of December 31,
2004 the Company is involved with two VIEs in which the Company is not deemed
to be the primary beneficiary.  Total
assets and liabilities of these entities as of December 31, 2004 were
approximately $116.0 million and $107.0 million, respectively.  The Company does not have a significant
exposure to loss resulting from its involvement with these unconsolidated VIEs.


Stock-Based Compensation

As of January 1, 2004, the Company adopted the
fair value method of accounting for its stock-based compensation plans using
the retroactive restatement method as provided by Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 123 (SFAS 123), “Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation.”  Under the fair value
method, stock-based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on
the fair value of the award and is expensed over the vesting period.  Stock-based compensation expense under the
fair value method for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002 was

Depreciation

Beginning in 2003, the Company implemented an upgrade
to its subsidiary ledger for accounting for fixed assets.  The Company completed this system upgrade in
the first quarter of 2004.  In
conjunction with this system upgrade, the Company has determined that
cumulative depreciation expense generated by consolidated or equity method
rental properties was understated by approximately $2.1 million through December 31,
2003 and this amount was recorded during the quarter ended March 31,
2004.  Had the correction been made in
2003, depreciation expense would have increased by approximately $640,000, $1.3
million, and $1.0 million in the first, second and third quarters of 2003,
respectively.  In the fourth quarter
2003, depreciation expense would have decreased by approximately $1.4 million.  The Company does not believe that the correction
is material to any previously reported financial statements and is not material
to any consolidated earnings trends.

Critical
Accounting Policies and Estimates

The preparation of
consolidated financial statements, in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America, requires the Company to
make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets,
liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets
and liabilities. We define critical accounting policies as those accounting
policies that require our management to exercise their most difficult,
subjective and complex judgments. Our critical accounting policies relate
principally to the following key areas: (i) consolidation under applicable
accounting standards of various entities; (ii) assessing the carrying values of
our real estate properties and investments in and advances to joint ventures
and affiliates;(iii) internal cost capitalization; (iiii) and qualification as
a REIT. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience, current
market conditions, and on various other assumptions that are believed to be
reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from those
estimates made by management.

The Company assesses each
entity in which it has an investment or contractual relationship to determine
if it may be deemed to be a VIE.  If such
an entity is a VIE, then the Company analyzes the expected losses and expected
residual returns to determine who is the primary beneficiary.  If the Company is the primary beneficiary,
then the entity is consolidated.  The
analysis required to identify VIEs and primary beneficiaries is complex and
judgmental, and the analysis must be applied to various types of entities and
legal structures.

Rental properties are
recorded at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation components on
rental properties have been provided over estimated useful lives ranging from 3
to 30 years using the straight-line method. Development costs include
acquisition, direct and indirect construction costs, interest and real estate
taxes incurred during the construction and property stabilizations periods.
Maintenance and repair expenses that do not add to the value or prolong the
useful life of the property are expensed as incurred. Asset replacements and
improvements are capitalized and depreciated over their estimated useful lives.

The Company assesses the
carrying value of its real estate investments by monitoring investment market
conditions and performance compared to budget for operating properties and
joint ventures, and by monitoring estimated costs for properties under
development. Local market knowledge and data is used to assess carrying values
of properties and the market value of acquisition opportunities. Whenever
events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a
property held for investment may not be fully recoverable, the carrying


amount is evaluated. If
the sum of the property’s expected future cash flows (undiscounted and without
interest charges) is less than the carrying amount of the property, then the
Company will recognize an impairment loss equal to the excess of the carrying
amount over the fair value of the property. Adverse changes in market
conditions or poor operating results of real estate investments could result in
impairment charges. When the Company determines that a property is held for
sale, it discontinues the periodic depreciation of that property. The criteria
for determining when a property is held for sale requires judgment and has
potential financial statement impact as depreciation would cease and an
impairment loss could occur upon determination of held for sale status. Assets
held for sale are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or estimated
fair value less costs to sell. With respect to investments in and advances to
joint ventures and affiliates, the Company looks to the underlying properties
to assess performance and the recoverability of carrying amounts for those
investments in a manner similar to direct investments in real estate
properties. An impairment charge or investment valuation charge is recorded if
the carrying value of the investment exceeds its fair value.

The Company capitalizes
all direct and certain indirect costs, including interest and real estate
taxes, incurred during development and redevelopment activities. Interest is
capitalized on real estate assets that require a period of time to get them
ready for their intended use. The amount of interest capitalized is based upon
the average amount of accumulated development expenditures during the reporting
period. Included in capitalized costs are management’s estimates of the direct
and incremental personnel costs and indirect project costs associated with our
development and redevelopment activities. Indirect project costs consist
primarily of personnel costs associated with construction administration and
development accounting, legal fees, and various office costs that clearly
relate to projects under development.

The Company bases its
estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are
believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may vary from
those estimates and those estimates could be different under different
assumptions or conditions.

General
Background

The Company’s property
revenues are generated primarily from multifamily property operations, which
accounted for greater than 95% of its property revenues for the years ended December 31,
2004, 2003, and 2002. The Company’s properties (“the Properties”) are located
in Southern California (Los Angeles, Ventura, Orange, San Diego and Riverside
counties), Northern California (the San Francisco Bay Area), the Pacific
Northwest (The Seattle, Washington and Portland, Oregon metropolitan areas),
and other areas (Las Vegas, Nevada, and Houston, Texas). The average occupancy
level of the Company’s portfolio has equaled or exceeded 95% for the last five
years.

Essex Apartment Value
Fund, L.P. (“Fund I”), is an investment fund organized by the Company in 2001
to add value through rental growth and asset appreciation, utilizing the
Company’s acquisition, development, redevelopment and asset management capabilities.
Fund I was considered fully invested in 2003. An affiliate of the Company,
Essex VFGP, L.P. (“VFGP”), is a 1% general partner and is a 20.4% limited
partner. The Operating Partnership owns a 99% limited partnership interest in
VFGP.

Since its formation, Fund
I has acquired or developed ownership interests in 19 multifamily residential
properties, representing 5,406 apartment units with an aggregate cost of
approximately $618.0 million.  Fund I
also owns the Kelvin Ave. land parcel in Irvine, California, which has been
planned for development into a 132-unit apartment community.

Prior to 2004, Fund I had
disposed of two multifamily residential properties, consisting of 530
apartments units for a aggregate contract sales price of approximately $73.2
million.

On August 26, 2004,
Fund I sold Palermo Apartments, 230-unit multifamily community located in San
Diego, California for a net sales price of $58.2 million.  Fund I completed the development of this
property at an approximate cost of  $44.9
million in 2004.

In the third quarter of
2004, Fund I entered into a purchase and sale agreement with United Dominion
Realty, L.P. (“UDR”) for a sale of sixteen apartment communities, totaling
4,646 units owned by Fund I and with respect to Coronado at Newport North and
South, both Fund I’s and the Company’s separate ownership interests, for a
contract price of $756.0 million.  In
connection with the transaction, UDR remitted a $10 million earnest money


deposit directly to Fund
I, which is refundable only in limited circumstances.  On September 30, 2004, under the UDR
purchase and sale agreement, Fund I sold seven of the multifamily communities,
aggregating 1,777 apartment units at a contract price of approximately $264.0
million. On October 27, 2004, an additional seven of the remaining nine
properties were sold to UDR for a contract price of $322.0 million, of which
$267.6 million is Fund I’s allocated portion of the contract price based on its
ownership interest.  The remaining two
multifamily properties under the UDR agreement that are anticipated to close in
2005 are Coronado at Newport - South, a 715-unit apartment community in Newport
Beach, California currently undergoing redevelopment and River Terrace, a newly
developed 250-unit apartment community in Santa Clara which is currently in
lease up.

In connection with the
Fund I dispositions which occurred in 2004, based on the Company’s limited
partnership interest in Fund I, combined with the sale of its 49.9% direct
ownership interest in Coronado at Newport North, the Company recognized equity
income in investments of $38.8 million representing the Company’s share of the
gain on the sale of real estate of $39.3 million and a $505,000 non-cash loss
on the early extinguishment of debt related to the write-off of un-amortized
loan fees on those property sales.  The
Company’s general partnership interest provides for “promote distributions”
upon attainment of certain financial return benchmarks.  During 2004, the Company recognized $18.3
million of additional equity income associated with its promote interest.  The Company accrued $4.0 million of employee
incentive compensation expense related to the Fund I sale, which is included in
general and administrative expense.

On September 27,
2004 the Company announced the final closing of the Essex Apartment Value Fund
II (“Fund II”). Fund II has eight institutional investors including Essex with
combined equity commitments of $265.9 million. Essex has committed $75.0
million to Fund II, which represents a 28.2% interest as general partner and
limited partner. Fund II expects to utilize leverage of approximately 65% of
the estimated value of the underlying real estate. Fund II will invest in
multifamily properties in the Company’s targeted West Coast markets with an
emphasis on investment opportunities in the Seattle metropolitan area and the
San Francisco Bay Area. Subject to certain exceptions, Fund II will be Essex’s
exclusive investment vehicle until October 31, 2006, or when Fund II’s
committed capital has been invested, whichever occurs first. Consistent with
Fund I, Essex will be compensated for its asset management, property
management, development and redevelopment services and may receive promote
distributions if Fund II exceeds certain financial return benchmarks.

The Company has elected
to be treated as a real estate investment trust (“REIT”) for federal income tax
purposes, commencing with the year ended December 31, 1994. The Company
utilizes taxable REIT subsidiaries (“TRS”) for various revenue generating or
investment activities. The TRS’s are consolidated by the Company.

The Company (excluding
Fund I’s development communities) has ownership interests in and is developing
two multifamily residential communities, with an aggregate of 395 multifamily
units. In connection with these development projects, the Company has directly,
or in some cases through its joint venture partners, entered into contractual
construction related commitments with unrelated third parties. The total
projected estimated cost for these projects is approximately $89.6 million. As
of December 31, 2004, the remaining commitment to fund these projects is
approximately $51.3 million.

Comparison of Year Ended December 31,
2004 to Year Ended December 31, 2003

Average financial
occupancy rates of the Company’s multifamily “Same Store Properties”
(properties consolidated by the Company for each of the years ended December 31,
2004 and 2003) increased to 96.0% for the year ended December 31, 2004
from 95.8% for the year ended December 31, 2003. Financial occupancy is
defined as the percentage resulting from dividing actual rental revenue by
total possible rental revenue. Actual rental revenue represents contractual
rental revenue pursuant to leases without considering delinquency and
concessions. Total possible rental revenue represents the value of all
apartment units, with occupied units valued at contractual rental rates
pursuant to leases and vacant units valued at estimated market rents. We
believe that financial occupancy is a meaningful measure of occupancy because
it considers the value of each vacant unit at its estimated market rate.
Financial occupancy may not completely reflect short-term trends in physical occupancy
and financial occupancy rates as disclosed by other REITs may not be comparable
to our calculation of financial occupancy.


The regional breakdown of
financial occupancy for the Same Store Properties for the years ended December 31,
2004 and 2003 are as follows:

Total Property Revenues
increased by $31,907,000 or by 12.7% to $283,483,000 in 2004 from $251,576,000
in 2003. The following table sets forth a breakdown of these revenue amounts,
including the revenues attributable to the Same Store Properties.

(1)

Also includes five
office buildings (one consolidated in accordance with FIN 46R), four recreational
vehicle parks, two manufactured housing communities, redevelopment communities,
development communities, and 12 multifamily properties consolidated
retroactively as of January 1, 2004 in accordance with FIN 46R.

As set forth in the above
table, the $31,907,000 net increase in total revenues was primarily due to an
increase of $30,339,000 attributable mostly to multifamily properties acquired
subsequent to January 1, 2003. 
Subsequent to January 1, 2003, the Company acquired interests in 14
multifamily properties and achieved stabilized operations in three development
communities and had five communities in redevelopment (the “Acquisition
Properties”).

Property
revenues

from the Same Store Properties increased by
$1,568,000 or 0.9% to $179,533,000 in 2004 from $177,965,000 in 2003. The
majority of this increase was attributable to the 40 Same Store Properties
located in Southern California and the 22 Same Store Properties located in the
Pacific Northwest. The property revenues of the Same Store Properties in
Southern California increased by $3,145,000 or 3.6% to $89,605,000 in 2004 from
$86,460,000 in 2003. The increase in Southern California is primarily
attributable to rental rate increases and a slight increase in financial
occupancy to 96.1% in 2004 from 96.0% in 2003. The property revenues of the
Same Store Properties in the Pacific Northwest increased by $533,000 or 1.4% to
$39,572,000 in 2004 from $39,039,000 in 2003. The $533,000 increase in the
Pacific Northwest is primarily attributable to rental rate increases and an
increase in financial occupancy to 95.6% in 2004 from 95.1% in 2003. The 17
multifamily residential properties located in Northern California offset the
net increase in total property revenues from the other Same Store Properties. The
property revenues for these properties decreased by $2,110,000 or 4.0% to
$50,356,000 in 2004 from $52,466,000 in 2003. The $2,110,000 decrease is
primarily attributable to rental rate decreases offset by an increase in
financial occupancy to 96.1% in 2004 from 95.9% in 2003.


Total
Expenses

increased by $50,208,000 or approximately 24.8% to
$252,423,000 in 2004 from $202,215,000 in 2003. This increase was mainly due to
an increase in property operating expenses of $30,501,000 or 21.9% to
$169,472,000 in 2004 from $138,971,000 in 2003. Of such operating expense
increase, $13,461,000 was attributable to the Acquisition Properties, excluding
depreciation and amortization expense. Depreciation and amortization expense
increased by $15,426,000, which was attributable to the Acquisition Properties
and a correction of depreciation expense recorded in the first quarter of 2004.
Interest expense increased by $10,613,000 or 20.2% to $63,023,000 in 2004 from
$52,410,000 in 2003.  The increase in
interest expense is primarily due to increases in the mortgage notes payable
and line of credit balances, the majority of which relates to the Acquisition
Properties. General and Administrative (G&A) expenses increased by $8,704,000
or 90.3% to $18,341,000 in 2004 from $9,637,000 in 2003.  The increase in G&A was primarily
attributable to incentive compensation, increases in headcount and related
compensation expense, compliance with Rule 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of
2002, and accrued litigation costs.

Gain on
sale of real estate

increased to $7,909,000 in 2004 from $0
in 2003 due to the sale of The Essex at Lake Merritt, a 270-unit multifamily
community located in Oakland, California, which was sold on August 3,
2004.

Interest
and other income

increased by $1,312,000 or 19.5% to
$8,027,000 in 2004 from $6,715,000 in 2003. The increase relates primarily  to an increase in leasing income related to
the recreational vehicle parks and manufactures housing communities.

Equity
income in co- investments

increased by $56,226,000 or
1,705.9% to $59,522,000 in 2004 from $3,296,000 in 2003. The increase relates
primarily to an increase in promote distributions from Fund I of $18,300,000
and the net gain on sale of co-investments of $38,800,000 which represents the
Company’s pro-rata allocation of gain from the Fund I sale and the sale of its
direct interest in Coronado at Newport - North.

Minority
interests

increased by $1,697,000 or 6.6% to $27,542,000 in
2004 from $25,845,000 in 2003. This is primarily due to the increase in net
income of the Operating Partnership.

Discontinued
operations

decreased
by $846,000 to $717,000 in 2004 from $1,563,000 in 2003. The decrease in income
from discontinued operations was mainly due to an impairment charge of $756,000
in 2004 for Golden Village Recreational Vehicle Park, located in Hemet,
California. This property was sold on July 18, 2004 for $6.7 million.

Comparison of Year Ended December 31,
2003 to Year Ended December 31, 2002

Average financial
occupancy rates of the Company’s multifamily “2003/2002 Same Store Properties”
(properties consolidated by the Company for each of the years ended December 31,
2003 and 2002) increased to 95.8% for the year ended December 31, 2003
from 94.7% for the year ended December 31, 2002. Financial occupancy is
defined as the percentage resulting from dividing actual rental revenue by
total possible rental revenue. Actual rental revenue represents contractual
rental revenue pursuant to leases without considering delinquency and
concessions. Total possible rental revenue represents the value of all
apartment units, with occupied units valued at contractual rental rates
pursuant to leases and vacant units valued at estimated market rents. We
believe that financial occupancy is a meaningful measure of occupancy because
it considers the value of each vacant unit at its estimated market rate.
Financial occupancy may not completely reflect short-term trends in physical
occupancy and financial occupancy rates as disclosed by other REITs may not be
comparable to our calculation of financial occupancy.

The regional breakdown of
financial occupancy for the 2003/2002 Same Store Properties for the years ended
December 31, 2003 and 2002 are as follows:


Total Property Revenues
increased by $40,493,000 or 19.2% to $251,576,000 in 2003 from $211,083,000 in
2002. The following table sets forth a breakdown of these revenue amounts,
including the revenues attributable to the 2003/2002 Same Store Properties.

(1)

Also includes five
office buildings (one consolidated in accordance with FIN 46R), four
recreational vehicle parks, two manufactured housing communities, redevelopment
communities, development communities, and 12 multifamily properties
consolidated retroactively as of January 1, 2004 in accordance with FIN
46R.

As set forth in the above
table, the $40,493,000 net increase in total revenues was due primarily to an
increase of $43,679,000 attributable to multifamily properties acquired
subsequent to January 1, 2002, offset by a decrease in 2003/2002 Same
Store Property revenue of $3,186,000. 
Subsequent to January 1, 2002 and prior to December 31, 2003,
the Company acquired interests in 25 multifamily properties and achieved
stabilized operations in two development communities and had three communities
in redevelopment (the “2003/2002 Acquisition Properties”).

Property
revenues

from the 2003/2002 Same Store Properties decreased
by $3,186,000 or 1.9% to $162,264,000 in 2003 from $165,450,000 in 2002. The
majority of this decrease was attributable to the 16 2003/2002 Same Store
Properties located in Northern California and the 23 2003/2002 Same Store Properties
located in the Pacific Northwest. The property revenues of the 2003/2002 Same
Store Properties in Northern California decreased by $5,210,000 or 9.4% to
$50,346,000 in 2003 from $55,556,000 in 2002. The decrease in Northern
California is primarily attributable to rental rate decreases and a slight
decrease in financial occupancy to 95.8% in 2003 from 95.9% in 2002. The
property revenues of the 2003/2002 Same Store Properties in the Pacific
Northwest decreased by $1,263,000 or 3.0% to $40,726,000 in 2003 from
$41,989,000 in 2002. The $1,263,000 decrease in the Pacific Northwest is
primarily attributable to rental rate decreases offset by an increase in
financial occupancy to 95.1% in 2003 from 93.1% in 2002. The 22 multifamily
residential properties located in Southern California offset the net decrease
in total property revenues from the other 2003/2002 Same Store Properties. The
property revenues for these properties increased by $3,287,000 or 4.8% to
$71,192,000 in 2003 from $67,905,000 in 2002. The $3,287,000 increase is
primarily attributable to an increase in rental rates and financial occupancy
to 96.3% in 2003 from 94.7% in 2002.

Total
Expenses

increased by $40,991,000 or approximately 25.4% to
$202,215,000 in 2003 from $161,224,000 in 2003. This increase was mainly due to
an increase in property operating expenses of $30,383,000 or 28.0% to
$138,971,000 in 2003 from $108,588,000 in 2002. Of such operating expense
increase, $15,736,000 was attributable to the 2003/2002 Acquisition Properties,
excluding depreciation and amortization expense. Depreciation and amortization
expense increased by $13,281,000, which was mainly attributable to the
2003/2002 Acquisition Properties. Interest expense increased by $9,224,000 or
21.4% to $52,410,000 in 2003 from $43,186,000 in 2002.  The increase in interest expense is due to
increases in mortgage notes payable.

Interest
and other income

decreased by $5,790,000 or 46.3% to
$6,715,000 in 2003 from $12,505,000 in 2002. The decrease primarily relates to
the repayment of notes receivable which resulted in a decrease in interest
income on notes receivable.


Equity
income in co- investments

decreased by $2,106,000 or 39.0% to
$3,296,000 in 2003 from $5,402,000 in 2002. The decrease relates primarily to
the sale of certain co-investment assets resulting in the decrease in income
earned on the Company’s co-investments.

Minority
interests

decreased by $1,783,000 or 6.5% to $25,845,000 in
2003 from $27,628,000 in 2002. This is primarily due to the decrease in net
income of the Operating Partnership.

Discontinued
Operations

decreased
by $6,794,000 to $1,563,000 in 2003 from $8,357,000 in 2002. This decrease is
due to the reduction of gain on sale of real estate and operating income from
Tara Village, a 168-unit apartment community located in Tarzana, California,
which was sold on June 18, 2002.

Liquidity
and Capital Resources Including Non-consolidated Investments

On July 26, 2004,
Standard and Poor’s publicly announced its existing issuer credit ratings of
BBB/Stable for Essex Property Trust, Inc. and Essex Portfolio L.P., and issued
a new rating of BBB- on its Senior Unsecured Debt for Essex Portfolio L.P.

At December 31,
2004, the Company had $10,644,000 of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents.
The Company expects to meet its short-term liquidity requirements by using its
working capital, cash generated from operations, and amounts available under
lines of credit or other financings. The Company believes that its current net
cash flows will be adequate to meet operating requirements and to provide for
payment of dividends by the Company in accordance with REIT qualification
requirements. The Company expects to meet its long-term liquidity requirements
relating to property acquisitions and development (beyond the next 12 months)
and balloon debt maturities by using a combination of some or all of the
following sources: working capital, amounts available on lines of credit, net
proceeds from public and private debt and equity issuances, and proceeds from
the disposition of properties that may be sold from time to time. There can,
however, be no assurance that the Company will have access to the debt and
equity markets in a timely fashion to meet such future funding requirements or
that future working capital and borrowings under the lines of credit will be
available, or if available, will be sufficient to meet the Company’s
requirements or that the Company will be able to dispose of properties in a
timely manner and under terms and conditions that the Company deems acceptable.

Non-revenue generating
capital expenditures are improvements and upgrades that extend the useful life
of the property. For the year ended December 31, 2004, non-revenue
generating capital expenditures totaled approximately $406 per weighted average
occupancy unit. The Company expects to incur approximately $410 per weighted
average occupancy unit in non-revenue generating capital expenditures for the
year ended December 31, 2005. These expenditures do not include the
improvements required in connection with the origination of mortgage loans,
expenditures for unidentified deferred maintenance renovations on acquisition
properties, expenditures for property renovations and improvements which are
expected to reposition a property and generate additional revenue, and
renovation expenditures required pursuant to tax-exempt bond financings. The
Company expects that cash from operations and/or its lines of credit will fund
such expenditures. However, there can be no assurance that the actual
expenditures incurred during 2005 and/or the funding thereof will not be
significantly different than the Company’s current expectations.

The Company is currently
developing two multifamily residential projects, with an aggregate of 395
units. Such projects involve certain risks inherent in real estate development.
See “Risk Factors—Risks that Development Activities Will be Delayed or Not
Completed and/or Fail to Achieve Expected Results” in Item 1 of this Annual
Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2004. In connection
with these development projects, the Company has directly, or in some cases
through its joint venture partners entered into contractual construction
related commitments with unrelated third parties and the total projected
estimated cost for these projects is approximately $89,600,000. As of December 31,
2004, the remaining commitment to fund these development projects is
approximately $51,300,000. The Company expects to fund such commitments by using
a combination of some or all of the following sources: its working capital,
amounts available on its lines of credit, net proceeds from public and private
equity and debt issuances, and proceeds from the disposition of properties, if
any.

On September 27,
2004 the Company announced the final closing of the Essex Apartment Value Fund
II (“Fund II”). Fund II has eight institutional investors including Essex with
combined equity commitments of $265.9 million. Essex has committed $75.0
million to Fund II, which represents a 28.2% interest as general partner and
limited partner. Fund II expects to utilize leverage of approximately 65% of
the estimated value of the underlying real estate. Fund II will invest in
multifamily properties in the Company’s targeted West Coast markets with an


emphasis on investment
opportunities in Seattle and the San Francisco Bay Area. Subject to certain
exceptions, Fund II will be Essex’s exclusive investment vehicle until October 31,
2006, or when Fund II’s committed capital has been invested, whichever occurs
first. Consistent with Fund I, Essex will be compensated for its asset
management, property management, development and redevelopment services and may
receive promote distributions if Fund II exceeds certain financial return
benchmarks. The Company’s remaining unfunded capital commitment as of December 31,
2004 is approximately $58.2 million.

The Company has an
outstanding unsecured line of credit for an aggregate amount of $185,000,000,
which could be expandable to $225,000,000. 
At December 31, 2004, the Company had $155,800,000 outstanding on
this line of credit.  At December 31,
2004, this line of credit bore an interest rate of approximately 3.4%.  This facility matures in April 2007,
with an option to extend it for one year thereafter.  The underlying interest rate on this line is
based on a tiered rate structure tied to the Company’s corporate ratings and is
currently LIBOR plus 1.0%. In addition, the Company has a $100 million credit
facility from Freddie Mac secured by five of Essex’s multifamily
communities.  At December 31, 2004,
the Company had $93,735,000 outstanding under this line of credit. At December 31,
2004, this line of credit bore an interest rate of approximately 2.9%.  This facility matures in December 2008.
The underlying interest rate on this line is between 55 and 59 basis points
over the Freddie Mac Reference Rate.

On February 23,
2005, Fund II obtained a credit facility for an aggregate amount of
$50,000,000. This line bears interest at LIBOR plus 0.875%, and matures in August 2005.

The Company has
$1,067,449,000 of secured indebtedness at December 31, 2004. Such
indebtedness consisted of $878,617,000 in fixed rate debt with interest rates
varying from 4.3% to 8.2% and maturity dates ranging from 2005 to 2026. The
secured indebtedness includes $188,832,000 of tax-exempt variable rate demand
bonds with interest rates paid during 2004 ranging from approximately 1.4% to
3.3% and maturity dates ranging from 2006 to 2034. Most of the tax-exempt
variable rate demand bonds are subject to interest rates caps.

Pursuant to existing
shelf registration statements, the Company has the capacity to issue up to
$219,455,250 of equity securities and the Operating Partnership has the
capacity to issue up to $250,000,000 of debt securities

.

The Company pays quarterly dividends from
cash available for distribution. Until it is distributed, cash available for
distribution is invested by the Company primarily in short-term investment
grade securities or is used by the Company to reduce balances outstanding under
its line of credit.

Financing
and equity issuances

On July 30, 2003,
in connection with the Company’s acquisition, by merger, of John M. Sachs, Inc.
(“Sachs”) that was completed on December 17, 2002, and under the terms of the
merger agreement, a final analysis was prepared, which indicated that the
actual net liabilities of Sachs were less than the net liabilities of Sachs
estimated to be outstanding as of the merger date.  Based on the final analysis and as a
post-closing adjustment payment pursuant to the merger agreement, the Company
made a final payment of approximately $1,766,000 in cash and issued an
additional 35,860 shares of common stock to certain of the pre-merger
shareholders of Sachs.

On September 23,
2003, the Company issued 1,000,000 shares of its Series F Cumulative Redeemable
Preferred Stock (“Series F Preferred Stock”) at a fixed price of $24.664 per
share, a discount from the $25.00 per share liquidation value of the
shares.  Quarterly distributions are at
an annualized rate of 7.8125% per year of the liquidation value and are
redeemable by the Company on or after September 23, 2008.  The Company amortized the original discount
in connection with the issuance of these shares in the fourth quarter of 2003,
resulting in a charge of approximately $336,000.  The shares were issued pursuant to the
Company’s existing shelf registration statement.  The Company used the net proceeds from this
sale of Series F Preferred Stock to redeem all of the 9.125% Series C
Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Units (the “Series C Preferred Units”) of Essex
Portfolio, L.P., of which the Company is the general partner.

On October 6,
2003, the Company sold 1.6 million newly issued shares of common stock and
received offering proceeds (before expenses) of $60.67 per share, representing
a 3.25% discount to the common stock’s closing price on September 30, 2003, the
date of the underwriting agreement between the Company and the underwriter,
pursuant to which the shares were sold. 
The shares were issued pursuant to the Company’s existing shelf
registration statement.  The proceeds of
the offering were approximately $97,072,000. Subsequent to the offerings, the
net proceeds generated from the offering were used to acquire multifamily
communities located in the Company’s targeted West Coast markets and for
general corporate purposes, including the repayment of debt and the funding of
development activities.


Using the proceeds of its
September 2003 sale of its 7.8125% Series F Cumulative Redeemable
Preferred Stock, the Company on November 24, 2003, redeemed all of the
outstanding 9.125% Series C Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Units of the
Operating Partnership. In connection with this redemption the Company incurred
a non-cash charge of $625,000 related to the write-off of the issuance costs.

In January 2004, the
Company restructured its previously issued $50 million, 9.30% Series D
Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Units (“Series D Units”), and its previously
issued $80 million, 7.875% Series B Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Units (“Series
B Units”).  The existing distribution
rate of 9.30% of the Series D Units continued until July 27, 2004 — the
end of the current non-call period.  On July 28,
2004, the distribution rate on the Series D Units was reduced to 7.875%.  The date that the Series D Units can first be
redeemed at the Company’s option has been extended by six years to July 28,
2010.  The dates that the Series B Units
can first be redeemed at the Company’s option will be extended from February 6,
2003 to December 31, 2009.

On June 14, 2000 the
Company purchased Waterford Place, a 238-unit apartment community located in San
Jose, California for a contract price of $35.0 million and an additional
contingent payment.  The amount of the
contingent payment was disputed and submitted to binding arbitration.   As a result of the arbitration, the Company
was directed to issue an additional 109,874 units of limited partnership
interest (“Units”) in the Operating Partnership to the sellers of Waterford
Place.  On March 31, 2004, the
Company completed the issuance of these Units to the sellers.  In connection with this issuance, on March 31,
2004, the Company also redeemed for cash 55,564 Units from these sellers.

On September 3,
2004, the Company redeemed all of its outstanding, $55 million, 9.25% Series E
Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Units of the Operating Partnership.  In connection with this redemption the
Company incurred a non-cash charge of $1.6 million related to the write-off of
the issuance costs, which is classified as a component of minority interest in
the accompanying statement of operations.

Contractual
Obligations and Commercial Commitments

The following table
summarizes the maturation or due dates of our contractual obligations and other
commitments at December 31, 2004, and the effect such obligations could
have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods:

New
Accounting Pronouncements Issued But Not Yet Adopted

In December 2004,
the FASB issued SFAS No. 123 revised, “

Share-Based
Payment”.

This statement is a revision of SFAS No. 123,

“Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation”,

and
supercedes APB No. 25,

“Accounting for Stock
Issued to Employees”.

The Statement requires companies to recognize
in the income statement the grant-date fair value of stock options and other
equity based compensation issued to employees. This Statement is effective as
of the beginning of the first interim or annual period that commences after June 15,
2005. We do not believe that the adoption of SFAS No. 123 revised will have a
material impact on our financial position, net earnings or cash flows.

In December, 2004, the
FASB issued SFAS No. 152, “Accounting for Real Estate Time-Sharing
Transactions an amendment of FASB Statements No. 66 and 67”. This
Statement amends SFAS No. 66, “Accounting for Sales of Real Estate”
to reference the financial accounting and reporting guidance for real estate
time-sharing transactions that is provided in AICPA Statement of Position
(SOP) 04-2, “Accounting for Real Estate Time-Sharing Transactions.” This
Statement also amends SFAS No. 67, “Accounting for Costs and Initial
Rental Operations of Real Estate Projects” to specify that guidance relating to
(a) incidental operations (b) costs incurred to


sell real estate projects
does not apply to real estate time-sharing transactions. This Statement is
effective for fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2005. We do not
believe that the adoption of SFAS No. 152 will have a material impact
on our financial position, net earnings or cash flows.

In December 2004,
the FASB issued SFAS No. 153, “Exchanges of Non-monetary Assets an
amendment of APB No. 29”. This Statement amends APB Opinion No. 29, “Accounting
for Non-monetary Transactions” to eliminate the exception for non-monetary
exchanges of similar productive assets and replaces it with a general exception
for exchanges of non-monetary assets that do not have commercial substance.
That exception required that some non-monetary exchanges be recorded on a
carryover basis versus this Statement, which requires that an entity record a
non-monetary exchange at fair value and recognize any gain or loss if the
transaction has commercial substance. This Statement is effective for fiscal
years beginning after June 15, 2005. We do not believe that the adoption
of SFAS No. 153 will have a material impact on our financial
position, net earnings or cash flows.

In March 2004, the
FASB issued EITF Issue No. 03-6, “Participating Securities and the
Two-Class Method under FASB Statement No. 128, Earnings per Share”
(EITF No. 03-6). This issue address whether the two-class method requires
the presentation of basic and diluted EPS for all participating securities and
how a participating security should be defined. The guidance to this issue
should be applied to reporting periods beginning after March 31, 2004.
Prior period earnings per share amounts presented for comparative purposes
should be restated to conform to the guidance in this consensus. The impact of
adopting EITF No. 03-6 on earnings per share has not yet been determined.

In October 2004, the
FASB issued EITF Issue No. 04-8,

“The
Effect of Contingently Convertible Instruments on Diluted Earnings Per Share”

(EITF
No. 04-8). This Issue addresses when contingently convertible instruments
should be included in diluted earnings per share and should be applied for
reporting periods ending after December 15, 2004. The adoption of EITF
No. 04-8 had no impact on our financial position, net earnings or cash
flows.

In November 2004,
the FASB issued EITF Issue No. 03-13, “Applying the Conditions in
Paragraph 42 of FASB Statement No. 144, Accounting for Impairment or
Disposal of Long-Lived Assets, in Determining Whether to Report Discontinued
Operations” (EITF No. 03-13). This issue assists in the development
of a model for evaluating (a) which cash flows are to be considered in
determining whether cash flows have been or will be eliminated and
(b) what types of continuing involvement constitute significant continuing
involvement. The guidance in this issue should be applied to a component of an
enterprise that is either disposed of or classified as held for sale in fiscal
periods beginning after December 15, 2004. Previously reported operating
results related to disposal transactions initiated within an enterprise’s
fiscal year that includes the date that this consensus was ratified (November 30,
2004) may be reclassified. The adoption of EITF No. 03-13 had no
impact on our financial position, net earnings or cash flows. This EITF may
have an impact in future periods.

In September 2004,
the FASB issued EITF Issue No. 03-1, “The Meaning of
Other-Than-Temporary Impairment and Its Application to Certain Investments”
(EITF No. 03-1). The guidance in EITF No. 03-1 was effective for
other-than-temporary impairment evaluations made in reporting periods beginning
after June 15, 2004. Certain provisions regarding the assessment of
whether an impairment is other than temporary have been delayed. e. The
adoption of EITF No. 03-1 had no impact on our financial position,
net earnings or cash flows.

Potential Factors Affecting Future Operating
Results

Many factors affect the
Company’s actual financial performance and may cause the Company’s future
results to be different from past performance or trends. These factors include
those set forth under the caption “Risk Factors” in Item I of this Annual
Report on Form 10-K and the following: Economic Environment and Impact on
Operating Results

Both the national economy
and the economies of the western states in which the Company owns, manages and
develops properties, some of which are concentrated in high-tech sectors, have
been and may be in an economic downturn. The impacts of such downturns on
operating results can include, and are not limited to, reduction in rental
rates, occupancy levels, property valuations and increases in operating costs
such as advertising, turnover and repair and maintenance expense.


The Company’s property type and diverse geographic
locations provide some degree of risk moderation but are not immune to a
prolonged down cycle in the real estate markets in which the Company operates.
Although the Company believes it is well positioned to meet the challenges
ahead, it is possible that reductions in occupancy and market rental rates will
result in a reduction of rental revenues, operating income, cash flows, and
market value of the Company’s shares. Prolonged recession could also affect the
Company’s ability to obtain financing at acceptable rates of interest and to
access funds from the refinance or disposition of properties at acceptable
prices.

Interest
Rate Fluctuations

The Company monitors changes in interest rates and
believes that it is well positioned from both a liquidity and interest rate
risk perspective. However, current interest rates are at historic lows and
potentially could increase rapidly to levels more in line with historic levels.
The immediate effect of significant and rapid interest rate increases would be
higher interest expense on the Company’s variable interest rate debt (see Item
7A and Notes 7 and 8 to consolidated financial statements). The effect of
prolonged interest rate increases could negatively impact the Company’s ability
to make acquisitions and develop properties at economic returns on investment
and the Company’s ability to refinance existing borrowings at acceptable rates.

Inflation/Deflation

Substantial inflationary or deflationary pressures
could have a negative effect on rental rates and property operating expenses.
The Company believes it effectively manages its property and other expenses but
understands that substantial annual rates of inflation or deflation could
adversely impact operating results.

Failure
to Qualify as A REIT

We have elected to be taxed as a REIT under the
Internal Revenue Code. However, we cannot assure you that we have qualified as
a REIT or that we will continue to so qualify in the future. If we fail to
qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, we would be subject to federal income
tax on our taxable income at corporate rates. We may also be disqualified from
treatment as a REIT for the four taxable years following the year in which we
failed to qualify. This would reduce our net earnings available for investment
or distribution to stockholders because of the additional tax liability. Even
if we continue to qualify as a REIT, we will continue to be subject to certain
federal, state and local taxes on our income and property.

Funds from Operations

Funds from operations is a financial measure that is
commonly used in the REIT industry. 
Essex presents funds from operations as a supplemental performance
measure.  Funds from operations is not
used by Essex as, nor should it be considered to be, an alternative to net
earnings computed under GAAP as an indicator of Essex’s operating performance
or as an alternative to cash from operating activities computed under GAAP as
an indicator of Essex’s ability to fund its cash needs.

Funds from operations is not meant to represent a
comprehensive system of financial reporting and does not present, nor does
Essex intend it to present, a complete picture of its financial condition and
operating performance.  Essex believes
that net earnings computed under GAAP remains the primary measure of
performance and that funds from operations is only meaningful when it is used
in conjunction with net earnings. Further, Essex believes that its consolidated
financial statements, prepared in accordance with GAAP, provide the most
meaningful picture of its financial condition and its operating performance.

In calculating funds from operations, Essex follows
the definition for this measure published by the National Association of REITs
(“NAREIT”), which is a REIT trade association. 
Essex believes that, under the NAREIT funds from operation definition,
the two most significant adjustments made to net income are (i) the exclusion
of historical cost depreciation and (ii) the exclusion of gains and losses from
the sale of previously depreciated properties. 
Essex agrees that these two NAREIT adjustments are useful to investors
for the following


reasons:

(a)            historical
cost accounting for real estate assets in accordance with GAAP assumes, through
depreciation charges, that the value of real estate assets diminishes
predictably over time. NAREIT stated in its White Paper on Funds from
Operations “since real estate asset values have historically risen or fallen
with market conditions, many industry investors have considered presentations
of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost
accounting to be insufficient by themselves.” Consequently, NAREIT’s definition
of funds from operations reflects the fact that real estate, as an asset class,
generally appreciates over time and depreciation charges required by GAAP do
not reflect the underlying economic realities.

(b)           REITs were
created as a legal form of organization in order to encourage public ownership
of real estate as an asset class through investment in firms that were in the
business of long-term ownership and management of real estate.  The exclusion, in NAREIT’s definition of
funds from operations, of gains and losses from the sales of previously
depreciated operating real estate assets allows investors and analysts to
readily identify the operating results of the long-term assets that form the
core of a REIT’s activity and assists in comparing those operating results
between periods.

Other REITs in calculating funds from operations may
vary from the NAREIT definition for this measure, and thus their disclosure of
funds from operations may not be comparable to Essex’s calculation.


The following table sets forth the Company’s
calculation of Funds from Operations for 2004 through 2000.


(1)

Assumes conversion of
all dilutive outstanding operating partnership interests in the Operating
Partnership.

(2)

Amounts from January 1,
2002 through December 31, 2003 reflect the retroactive adoption of FIN 46R and
SFAS 123. Amounts from January 1, 2000 through December 31, 2001 do not reflect
the retroactive adoption of FIN 46R and SFAS 123. Because such retroactive
adoption was not applied to the 2000 and 2001 periods, the results for those
periods may not be comparable to the results for the later periods set forth
above.

Item 7A

. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

The Company is exposed to interest rate changes
primarily as a result of its line of credit and long-term debt used to maintain
liquidity and fund capital expenditures and expansion of the Company’s real
estate investment portfolio and operations. The Company’s interest rate risk
management objective is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on
earnings and cash flows and to lower its overall borrowing costs. To achieve
its objectives the Company borrows primarily at fixed rates and may enter into
derivative financial instruments such as interest rate swaps, caps and treasury
locks in order to mitigate its interest rate risk on a related financial
instrument. The Company does not enter into derivative or interest rate
transactions for speculative purposes.

The Company’s interest rate risk is monitored using a
variety of techniques. The table below presents the principal amounts and
weighted average interest rates by year of expected maturity to evaluate the
expected cash flows. Management believes that the carrying amounts of its LIBOR
debt approximates fair value as of December 31, 2004 because interest rates,
yields and other terms for these instruments are consistent with yields and
other terms currently available to the Company for similar instruments.
Management has estimated that the fair value of the Company’s $878,617,000 of
fixed rate mortgage notes payable at December 31, 2004 is approximately
$945,607,000 based on the terms of existing mortgage notes payable compared to
those available in the marketplace.

(1)

$152,749 subject to
interest rate caps.

The table incorporates only those exposures that exist
as of December 31, 2004; it does not consider those exposures or positions that
could arise after that date. As a result, our ultimate realized gain or loss,
with respect to interest rate fluctuations, would depend on the exposures that
arise during the period, our hedging strategies at the time, and interest
rates.

Item 9A.

Controls and Procedures

As of December 31, 2004, we carried out an evaluation,
under the supervision and with the participation of management, including our
Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of
the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to
Rules 13a-15 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.  Based upon that evaluation, the Chief
Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure
controls and procedures are effective in timely alerting management to material
information relating to the Company that is required to be included in our
periodic filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

There were no changes in
the Company’s internal control over financial reporting, that occurred during
the quarter ended December 31, 2004, that have materially affected, or are
reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over
financial reporting.

Our management, including
our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that
our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal controls over financial
reporting will prevent all error and all fraud. A control system, no matter how
well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute,
assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the
design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints,
and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs.
Because of their inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of
controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances
of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected.

Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial
Reporting

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate
internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f)
under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended). Our management assessed
the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of
December 31, 2004. In making this assessment, our management used the
criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission (“COSO”) in Internal Control-Integrated Framework. Our management
has concluded that, as of December 31, 2004, our internal control over
financial reporting was effective based on these criteria. Our independent
registered public accounting firm, KPMG LLP, has issued an audit report on our
assessment of our internal control over financial reporting, which is included
herein.

Report
of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

The Board of Directors

Essex Property Trust, Inc.:

We have audited management’s assessment, included in Management’s
Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting, appearing under Item 9A,
that Essex Property Trust, Inc. maintained effective internal control over
financial reporting as of December 31, 2004, based on criteria established
in Internal Control–Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Essex Property Trust, Inc’s
management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over
financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal
control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion
on management’s assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s
internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require
that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether
effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all
material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal
control over financial reporting, evaluating management’s assessment, testing
and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and
performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process
designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial
reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal
control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that
(1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail,
accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets
of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded
as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of
the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management
and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding
prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition
of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial
statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial
reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any
evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that
controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the
degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, management’s assessment that Essex Property Trust, Inc.
maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of
December 31, 2004, is fairly stated, in all material respects, based on
criteria established in Internal Control–Integrated Framework issued by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Also,
in our opinion, Essex Property Trust, Inc. maintained, in all material
respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of
December 31, 2004, based on criteria established in Internal Control–Integrated
Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission (COSO).

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance
sheets of Essex Property Trust, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31,
2004 and 2003, and the related consolidated statements of operations,
stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year

Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require
that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether
the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting
principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as
evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our
audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above
present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Essex
Property Trust, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2004 and 2003,
and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the years
in the three-year period ended December 31, 2004, in conformity with U.S.
generally accepted accounting principles. Also in our opinion, the related
financial statement schedule III, when considered in relation to the basic
consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly, in all
material respects, the information set forth therein.

As further discussed in Note 2(a), the Company implemented Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 123

Accounting
for Stock Based Compensation

and Financial Accounting Standards
Board Interpretation No. 46R

Consolidation
of Variable Interest Entities

effective January 1, 2004 and applied
the retroactive restatement method of adoption. 
Accordingly, all periods presented have been restated to give effect to
the change.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the effectiveness of Essex
Property Trust, Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting as of
December 31, 2004, based on criteria established in Internal Control–Integrated
Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission (COSO), and our report dated March 30, 2005, expressed an
unqualified opinion on management’s assessment of, and the effective operation
of, internal control over financial reporting.

(Dollars

(1) Organization

The accompanying consolidated financial statements
present the accounts of Essex Property Trust, Inc. (the Company), which include
the accounts of the Company and Essex Portfolio, L.P. (the Operating
Partnership, which holds the operating assets of the Company). The Company was
incorporated in the state of Maryland in March 1994. On June 13, 1994, the
Company commenced operations with the completion of an initial public offering
(the Offering) in which it issued 6,275,000 shares of common stock at $19.50 per
share. The net proceeds of the Offering of $112,070 were used to acquire a
77.2% general partnership interest in the Operating Partnership.

The Company has a 90.3% general partner interest and
the limited partners own a 9.7% interest in the Operating Partnership as of
December 31, 2004. The limited partners may convert their 2,386,938 Operating
Partnership units into an equivalent number of shares of common stock. The
Company has reserved shares of common stock for such conversions. These
conversion rights may be exercised by the limited partners at any time through
2024.

On December 17, 2002, the Company acquired, by merger,
John M. Sachs, Inc. (“Sachs Portfolio”) resulting in the acquisition of its
real estate portfolio, which consisted of 20 multifamily properties, five
recreational vehicle parks, two manufactured housing communities and two small
office buildings. Total consideration in the transaction was $306,700 and was
structured as a tax-free reorganization whereby the Company: (i) issued 2,719,875
shares of its common stock valued at $136,800, (ii) assumed mortgages on four
of the newly acquired properties for approximately $64,600 with a fixed
interest rate of 5.51%, maturing in January 2013, (iii) assumed and repaid
unsecured liabilities in the amount of approximately $33,000, and (iv) paid the
balance in cash of $72,200. The cash portion was funded through four new
non-recourse mortgages on four previously unencumbered properties, with a
weighted average interest rate of 5.64%, maturing in January 2013 and draws
upon new and existing lines of credit. The Company accounted for this
transaction using the purchase method of accounting which resulted in the
allocation of the purchase price to the assets and liabilities acquired based
on their fair values.  The fair value of
assets and liabilities were based on management’s estimates.  No goodwill was recognized in connection with
this purchase.  The Company’s results of
operations for the period December 17, 2002 through December 31, 2002 include
the Sachs Portfolio. On July 30, 2003, and under terms of the merger agreement,
a final analysis was prepared, which indicated that the actual net liabilities
of Sachs were less than the net liabilities of Sachs estimated to be
outstanding as of the merger date.  Based
on this final analysis and as a post-closing adjustment pursuant to the merger
agreement, the Company made a final payment of $1,800 in cash and issued an
additional 35,860 shares of common stock valued at $2,170 to certain of the
pre-merger shareholders of Sachs.

Unaudited pro forma information reflecting the
acquisition of the Sachs Portfolio is presented in the following table. The
amounts included therein assume that the acquisition had taken place at the
beginning of the year.

F-9

As of December 31, 2004, the Company operates and has
ownership interests in 120 multifamily properties (containing 25,518 units),
four recreational vehicle parks (containing 698 spaces), five office buildings
(totaling approximately 173,540 square feet), and two manufactured housing
communities (containing 607 sites) (collectively, the Properties). The
Properties are located in Southern California (Los Angeles, Ventura, Orange,
San Diego, and Riverside counties), Northern California (the San Francisco Bay
Area), the Pacific Northwest (Seattle, Washington, and Portland, Oregon
metropolitan areas) and other areas (Las Vegas, Nevada and Houston, Texas).

(2) Summary of Critical and Significant Accounting
Policies

(a) Adoption of New Accounting Principles

As more fully described below in Notes 2 (b), 2(m) and
2(n), the accompanying 2003 and 2002 consolidated financial statements have
been restated.  The restatement for the
retroactive adoption of the provisions of FASB Interpretation No. 46R and
Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 123 has been reflected in all of
the notes to the consolidated financial statements including the unaudited
quarterly results of operations.

(b) Principles of Consolidation

The accounts of the Company, its controlled
subsidiaries and its variable interest entities in which it is the primary
beneficiary are consolidated in the accompanying financial statements. All
significant inter-company accounts and transactions have been eliminated. We use
the equity method to account for investments that do not qualify as variable
interest entities or where we do not own a majority of the economic interest,
but have the ability to exercise significant influence over the operating and
financial policies of the investee. For an investee accounted for under the
equity method, our share of net earnings or losses of the investee is reflected
in income as earned and distributions are credited against the investment as
received.

As of January 1, 2004, we adopted FASB Interpretation
No. 46 “Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities” (revised) using
the retroactive restatement approach, and amounts have been restated for the
years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002. As a result, the accompanying
consolidated financial statements have been restated to reflect the
consolidated financial position and results of operations of Essex Property
Trust, Essex Management Corporation (EMC), Essex Fidelity I Corporation (EFC),
17 Down REIT limited partnerships (comprising ten properties), an office
building that is subject to loans made by the Company, and the multifamily
improvements owned by a third party in which the Company owns the land
underlying these improvements and from which the Company receives fees,
including land lease, subordination and property management fees in accordance
with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The Company’s total assets
and liabilities related to these VIEs, net of intercompany eliminations, were
approximately $238.1 million and $155.1 million, respectively, at December 31,
2004 and $246.1 million and $156.5 million, respectively, at December 31, 2003.
We previously accounted for EMC, EFC, and the Down REIT limited partnerships
using the equity method of accounting.

The Down REIT entities that collectively own ten
multifamily properties (1,831 units) were investments made under arrangements
whereby EMC became the general partner, the Operating Partnership became a
special limited partner, and the other limited partners were granted rights of
redemption for their interests. Such limited partners can request to be
redeemed and the Company can elect to redeem their rights for cash or by
issuing shares of its common stock on a one share per unit basis. Conversion
values will be based on the market value of the Company’s common stock at the
time of redemption multiplied by the number of units stipulated under the above
arrangements. The other limited partners receive distributions based on the
Company’s current dividend rate times the number of units held. At December 31,
2004, the maximum number of shares that could be issued to meet redemption of
these Down REIT entities is 1,345,003. 
As of December 31, 2004 and December 31, 2003, the carrying value of the
other limited partners’ interests is presented at their historical cost and is
classified within minority interests in the accompanying consolidated balance
sheets.

Interest holders in VIEs consolidated by the Company
are allocated a priority of net income equal to the cash payments made to those
interest holders for services rendered or distributions from cash flow.  The remaining results of operations are
generally allocated to the Company.

Properties consolidated in accordance with FIN 46R
were encumbered by third party, non-recourse loans totaling $151.3 million and
$152.7 million as of December 31, 2004 and December 31, 2003, respectively.

During December 31, 2004, the Company entered into two
arrangements that are deemed VIEs. The entity

F-10

that purchased The Essex
at Lake Merritt property as discussed in Note 3 — Dispositions, is a VIE. We
have concluded that the Company’s participating loan to the entity does not
result in the Company being the primary beneficiary.  The Company entered into a joint venture to
develop a 5-story building in Los Angeles, California. The Company is the
primary beneficiary, and the joint venture is consolidated as of December 31,
2004.

As of December 31, 2004 the Company is involved with
two VIEs in which the Company is not deemed to be the primary beneficiary.  Total assets and liabilities of these
entities as of December 31, 2004 were approximately $116.0 million and $107.0
million, respectively.  The Company’s
maximum exposure to loss resulting from these unconsolidated VIEs is not
considered significant.

(c) Real Estate Rental Properties and Discontinued Operations

Significant expenditures, which improve or extend the
life of an asset and have a useful life of greater than one year, are
capitalized.  Operating real estate
assets are stated at cost and consist of land, buildings and improvements,
furniture, fixtures and equipment, and other costs incurred during their
development, redevelopment and acquisition. 
Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as
incurred.

The depreciable
life of various categories of fixed assets are as follows:

In accordance with SFAS No. 67, “Accounting for Costs
and Initial Rental Operations of Real Estate Projects,” the Company capitalizes
pre-development costs incurred in pursuit of new development opportunities for
which the Company currently believes future development is probable.  Pre-development costs for which a future
development is no longer considered probable are charged to expense.

Costs incurred with the development or redevelopment
of real estate assets are capitalized if they are clearly associated with the
development or redevelopment of rental property, or are associated with the
construction or expansion of real property. 
Such capitalized costs include land, land improvements, allocated costs
of the Company’s project management staff, construction costs, as well as
interest and related loan fees, property taxes and insurance Capitalization
begins when active development commences or when a redevelopment asset is taken
out-of-service. Capitalization ends when the apartment home is completed and
the property is available for a new residence.

In accordance with Financial Accounting Standards
Board’s (FASB) Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 141,
“Business Combinations,” the Company allocates the purchase price of real
estate to land and building, and identifiable intangible assets, such as the
value of above, below and at-market in-place leases. The values of the above
and below market leases are amortized and recorded as either a decrease (in the
case of above market leases) or an increase (in the case of below market
leases) to rental revenue over the remaining term of the associated leases
acquired. Acquired at-market leases are amortized to expense over the term the
Company expects to retain the acquired tenant, which is generally 20 months.

In accordance with SFAS
141 and its applicability to acquired in-place leases, we perform the following
evaluation for properties we acquire:

(1)

estimate the value of the real estate “as if vacant”
as of the acquisition date;

(2)

allocate that value among land and building and
determine the associated asset life for each;

(3)

compute the value of the difference between the “as if
vacant” value and the purchase price, which will represent the total intangible
assets;

(4)

allocate the value of the above and below market
leases to the intangible assets and determine the associated life of the above
market/ below market leases;

F-11

(5)

allocate the remaining intangible value to the
at-market in-place leases or customer relationships, if any, and the associated
lives of these assets;

Whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate
that the carrying amount of a property held for investment or held for sale may
not be fully recoverable, the carrying amount will be evaluated for impairment.
If the sum of the property’s expected future cash flows (undiscounted and
without interest charges) is less than the carrying amount (including
intangible assets) of the property, then the Company will recognize an
impairment loss equal to the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value
of the property.  Such fair value of a
property is determined using conventional real estate valuation methods, such
as discounted cash flow, the property’s unleveraged yield in comparison to the
unleveraged yields and sales prices of similar properties that have been
recently sold, and other third party information, if available. As of December
31, 2004 no properties were impaired.

In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting
Standard No. 144 “Accounting for Impairment of Disposal of Long-Lived Assets”
the Company presents income and gains/losses on properties sold as discontinued
operations net of minority interests. Real estate investments accounted for
under the equity method of accounting remain classified in continuing
operations upon disposition. During 2004, the Company granted the lessees of
one manufactured housing community and two recreational vehicle parks the right
to exercise their purchase agreements in 2004. On July 18, 2004 the Company
sold Golden Village Recreational Vehicle Park for $6,700. As of December 31,
2004 Riviera RV Resort and Riviera Mobile Home Park met the “held for sale”
criteria under SFAS 144. In accordance with SFAS 144, assets and liabilities
and the results of operations of the properties are presented as discontinued
operations in the consolidated financial statements for all periods presented.

(d) Investments and Joint Ventures

The Company owns investments in joint ventures and
affiliates and has significant influence but its ownership interest does not
meet the criteria for consolidation in accordance with FIN 46R and Accounting
Research Bulletin No. 51. Therefore, we account for our interest using the
equity method of accounting. Under the equity method of accounting, the
investment is carried at the cost of assets contributed or distributed, plus
the Company’s equity in undistributed GAAP earnings or losses since its initial
investment. The Company’s share of equity in income and gains on sales of real
estate are included in other income in the accompanying consolidated statements
of operations.

Some of these investments and/or joint ventures
compensate the Company for its asset management services and may provide
promote distributions if certain financial return benchmarks are achieved.  Asset management fees and promote fees are
recognized when the earnings events have occurred and there is GAAP earnings in
the underlying entities. Asset management fees and promote fees are reflected
in interest and other and equity income in co-investments respectively, in the
accompanying consolidated statements of operations.

(e) Revenues and Gains on Sale of Real Estate

Rental revenue is reported on the accrual basis of
accounting.

Revenues from tenants renting or leasing apartment
units, recreational vehicle park spaces or manufactured housing community
spaces are recorded when due from tenants and are recognized monthly as it is
earned, which is not materially different than on a straight-line basis.  Units or spaces are rented under short-term
leases (generally, lease terms of 6 to 12 months) and may provide no rent for
one or two months, depending on the market conditions and leasing practices of
our competitors in each sub-market at the time the leases are executed.

The Company recognizes gains on sales of real estate
when a contract is in place, a closing has taken place, the buyer’s initial and
continuing investment is adequate to demonstrate a commitment to pay for the
property and the Company does not have a substantial continuing involvement in
the property.

(f) Income Taxes

Generally in any year in which the Company qualifies
as a real estate investment trust (REIT) under the Internal Revenue Code (the
Code), it is not subject to federal income tax on that portion of its income
that it distributes to stockholders. No provision for federal income taxes,
other than the taxable REIT subsidiaries discussed below has been made in the accompanying
consolidated financial statements for each of the three years in the period
ended December 31, 2004, as the Company believes it qualifies under the Code as
a REIT and has made distributions during the periods in amounts to preclude us
from paying federal income tax.

The Company has elected to be treated as a real estate
investment trust (“REIT”) for federal income tax

F-12

purposes, commencing with
the year ended December 31, 1994. In order to maintain compliance with REIT tax
rules, the Company utilizes taxable REIT subsidiaries (“TRS”) for various
revenue generating or investment activities. The TRS’s are consolidated by the
Company. The activities and tax related provisions, assets and liabilities are
not material.

Cash dividends distributed for the years ended
December 31, 2004, 2003, and 2002 are classified for tax purposes as follows:

(g) Notes Receivable and Interest Income

Notes receivable relate to real estate financing
arrangements that exceed one year. They bear interest at a market rate based on
the borrower’s credit quality and are recorded at face value. Interest is
recognized over the life of the note. The Company requires collateral for the
notes.

Each note is analyzed to determine if it is impaired
pursuant to FASB’s SFAS No. 114, Accounting by Creditors for Impairment of
a Loan. A note is impaired if it is probable that the Company will not collect
all principal and interest contractually due. The impairment is measured
periodically based on the present value of expected future cash flows
discounted at the note’s effective interest rate. The Company does not accrue
interest when a note is considered impaired. All cash receipts on impaired
notes are applied to reduce the principal amount of such notes until the
principal has been recovered and, thereafter, are recognized as interest
income.

(h) Interest Rate Protection, Swap, and Forward Contracts

The Company has from time to time used interest rate
protection, swap and forward contracts to manage its interest rate exposure on
current or identified future debt transactions. The Company accounts for such
derivative contracts using SFAS No. 133. Under SFAS No. 133, derivative
instruments are required to be included in the balance sheet at fair value. The
changes in the fair value of the derivatives are accounted for depending on the
use of the derivative and whether it has been designated and qualifies as a
part of a hedging relationship. If the hedged exposure is a cash flow exposure,
changes in fair value of the effective portion of the gain or loss on the
derivative instrument are reported initially as a component of other
comprehensive income and subsequently reclassified into earnings when the
forecasted transaction affects earnings. Changes in the ineffective portion of
the gain or loss are reported in earnings immediately.

(i) Deferred Charges

Deferred charges are principally comprised of loan
fees and related costs which are amortized over the terms of the related
borrowing in a manner which approximates the effective interest method.

(j) Interest

The Company capitalized $1,997, $4,084, and $6,814 of
interest related to the development of real estate during 2004, 2003, and 2002,
respectively.

(k) Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash

Highly liquid investments with original maturities of
three months or less when purchased are classified as

F-13

cash equivalents.
Restricted cash relates to reserve requirements in connection with the Company’s
mortgage debt.

(l) Minority Interest

Minority interests includes the 9.7% and 9.2% limited
partner interests in the Operating Partnership not held by the Company at
December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The Company periodically adjusts the
carrying value of minority interest in the Operating Partnership to reflect its
share of the book value of the Operating Partnership. Such adjustments are
recorded to stockholders’ equity as a reallocation of minority interest in the
Operating Partnership in the accompanying consolidated statements of
stockholders’ equity. The minority interest balance also includes the Operating
Partnership’s cumulative redeemable preferred units (Note 10).

The Down REIT entities that collectively own ten
multifamily properties (1,831 units) were investments made under arrangements
when EMC became the general partner, the Operating Partnership became a special
limited partner, and the other limited partners were granted rights of
redemption for their interests. Such limited partners can request to be
redeemed and the Company can elect to redeem their rights for cash or by issuing
shares of its common stock on a one share per unit basis. Conversion values
will be based on the market value of the Company’s common stock at the time of
redemption multiplied by the number of units stipulated under the above
arrangements. The other limited partners receive distributions based on the
Company’s current dividend rate times the number of units held. At December 31,
2004, the maximum number of shares that could be issued to meet redemption of
these Down REIT entities is 1,345,003. 
As of December 31, 2004 and December 31, 2003, the carrying value of the
other limited partners’ interests is presented at their historical cost and is
classified within minority interests in the accompanying consolidated balance
sheets.

(m) Stock-based
Compensation

As of January 1, 2004, the Company adopted the fair
value method of accounting for its stock-based compensation plans using the
retroactive restatement method as provided by Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 123 (SFAS 123), “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation.”  Under the fair value method, stock-based
compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the
award and is expensed over the vesting period. 
Stock-based compensation expense under the fair value method for the
years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002 was $784, $991 and $933,
respectively.  The fair value of stock
options granted for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002 was $8.84,
$4.18 and $4.69, respectively, and was estimated on the date of grant using the
Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following weighted average
assumptions used for grants:

F-14

(n) Reconciliation
to previously reported amounts

The accounting effect of adopting FIN 46R and SFAS 123 on net income
previously reported for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002 is as
follows (dollars in thousands, except per share amounts):

The accounting effect of adopting FIN 46R and SFAS 123 on stockholders’
equity at January 1, 2002 for previously reported amounts is as follows
(dollars in thousands):

(o) Legal costs

Legal costs associated with matters arising out of the
normal course of our business are expensed as incurred. Legal costs incurred in
connection with non-recurring litigation that is not covered by insurance are
accrued when amounts are probable and estimatable.

(p)

Accounting Estimates and Reclassifications

The preparation of consolidated financial statements,
in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States of America, requires the Company to make estimates and judgments that
affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and
related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. On an on-going basis,
the Company evaluates its estimates, including those related to acquiring,
developing and assessing the carrying values of its real estate properties, its
investments in and advances to joint ventures and affiliates, its notes
receivables and its qualification as a Real Estate Investment Trust (“REIT”).
The Company bases its estimates on historical experience, current market
conditions, and on various other assumptions

F-15

that are believed to be
reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may vary from those
estimates and those estimates could be different under different assumptions or
conditions.

Certain prior year balances
have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation. Interest
and other income are considered non-operating income and have been reclassified
for all periods presented.

(3) Real Estate

(a) Rental Properties

Rental properties consist of multifamily properties
with a net book value of $1,990,607 and other rental properties (office
buildings, recreational vehicle parks, and manufactured housing communities)
with a net book value of $45,345.

The properties are located in California, Washington,
Oregon, Nevada and Texas. The operations of the properties could be adversely
affected by a recession, general economic downturn or a natural disaster in the
areas where the properties are located.

For the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003, and 2002,
depreciation expense on real estate within continuing operations was $72,616,
$57,190, and $43,909, respectively.  For
the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003, and 2002, depreciation expense on real
estate within discontinued operations was $308, $397, and $191, respectively.

(b) Sales of Real
Estate and Assets Held for Sale

The Company recognizes sales of real estate when a
contract has been executed, a closing has occurred, the buyer’s initial and
continuing investment is adequate to demonstrate a commitment to pay for the
property and the Company does not have a substantial continuing involvement in
the property. Each property is considered a separately identifiable component
of the Company and is reported in discontinued operations when the operations
and cash flows of the property have been (or will be) eliminated from the
ongoing operations of the Company as a result of a disposal transaction.
Interest expense associated with a mortgage loan is classified as a component
of discontinued operations if that loan is directly secured by a property
classified as a discontinued operation.

For the year ended December 31, 2004, the gain on the
sale of The Essex at Lake Merritt was $12,909, of which $5,000 is deferred and
will be recognized on the cost recovery method. The $5,000 was deferred because
of our continuing involvement with the property.

At December 31, 2004, we had two non-core assets
that were acquired in conjunction with the merger with John M. Sachs, Inc. in
2002, classified as held for sale under the provisions of
SFAS No. 144. The two non-core assets were: The Riviera Recreational
Vehicle Park and The Riviera Manufactured Home Park, both located in Las Vegas,
Nevada, for which the Company has previously entered into master lease and
option agreements with an unrelated entity. 
These properties were sold in January 2005. Accordingly, we have
classified the lease income from The Riviera Recreational Vehicle Park and The
Riviera Manufactured Home Park within discontinued operations for the years
ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002. Assets held for sale as of
December 31, 2004, represented gross real estate of $14,941.

During 2002 we sold Tara
Village, a 168-unit apartment community located in Tarzana, California. T

he
operating results and the related gain on sale of $8,061 were included in
discontinued operations for the twelve months ended December 31, 2002.

In 2002 the Company sold Moanalua Hillside Apartments,
a 700-unit apartment community located in Honolulu, Hawaii for a contract price
of $44.1 million.  The Company recognized
a net gain of $145 on the sale of this property.  This property was held for sale at December
31, 2001, and therefore has been included as a component of continuing
operations in 2002.

(c) Investments

The Company has investments in a number of affiliates,
which are accounted for under the equity method. The affiliates own and operate
multifamily rental properties.

Essex Apartment Value Fund, L.P. (“Fund I”), is an
investment fund organized by the Company in 2001 to add value through rental
growth and asset appreciation, utilizing the Company’s acquisition,
development, redevelopment and asset management capabilities. Fund I was
considered fully invested in 2003. An affiliate of the Company, Essex VFGP,
L.P. (“VFGP”), is a 1% general partner and is a 20.4% limited partner. The
Operating Partnership owns a 99% limited partnership interest in VFGP.

F-16

Since its formation, Fund I acquired or developed
ownership interests in 19 multifamily residential properties, representing
5,406 apartment units with an aggregate cost of approximately $618.0
million.  Fund I also owns the Kelvin
Ave. land parcel in Irvine, California, which is planned for development into a
132-unit apartment community.

Prior to 2004, Fund I disposed of two multifamily
residential properties, consisting of 530 apartments units for a aggregate
contract sales price of approximately $73.2 million.

On August 26, 2004, Fund I sold Palermo Apartments, a
230-unit multifamily community located in San Diego, California for a net sales
price of $58.2 million.  Fund I completed
the development of this property at an approximate cost of  $44.9 million in 2004.

In the third quarter of 2004, Fund I entered into a
purchase and sale agreement with United Dominion Realty, L.P. (“UDR”) for a
sale of sixteen apartment communities, totaling 4,646 units owned by Fund I
and, with respect to Coronado at Newport North and South, both Fund I’s and the
Company’s separate ownership interests, for a contract price of $756.0
million.  In connection with the
transaction, UDR remitted a $10 million earnest money deposit directly to Fund
I, which is refundable only in limited circumstances.  On September 30, 2004, pursuant to the UDR
purchase and sale agreement, Fund I sold seven of the multifamily communities,
aggregating 1,777 apartment units at a contract price of approximately $264.0
million. On October 27, 2004, an additional seven of the remaining nine
properties, including the Company’s approximate 49.9% ownership interest in
Coronado at Newport — North, were sold to UDR for a contract price of $322.0
million, of which $267.6 million represents Fund I’s allocated portion of the
contract price based on its ownership interest. 
The remaining two multifamily properties under the UDR agreement that
are anticipated to close in 2005 are Coronado at Newport - South, a 715-unit
apartment community in Newport Beach, California currently undergoing redevelopment
and River Terrace, a newly developed 250-unit apartment community in Santa
Clara which is currently in lease up.

The Fund I dispositions in 2004, combined with the
sale of its 49.9% direct ownership interest in Coronado at Newport North, resulted
in the Company recognizing equity income from investments of $38.8 million. The
Company’s share of the gain on the sale of real estate of $39.3 million was
reduced by a $505 non-cash loss on the early extinguishment of debt related to
the write-off of unamortized loan fees. 
The Company’s general partnership interest provides for “promote
distributions” upon attainment of certain financial return benchmarks.  During 2004, the Company recognized $18.3
million of additional equity income associated with its promote interest.  The Company accrued $4.0 million of employee
incentive compensation expense related to the Fund I sale, which is included in
general and administrative expense.

On September 27, 2004 the Company announced the final
closing of the Essex Apartment Value Fund II (“Fund II”). Fund II has eight
institutional investors including Essex with combined equity commitments of
$265.9 million. Essex has committed $75.0 million to Fund II, which represents
a 28.2% interest as general partner and limited partner. Fund II expects to
utilize leverage of approximately 65% of the estimated value of the underlying
real estate. Fund II will invest in multifamily properties in the Company’s
targeted West Coast markets with an emphasis on investment opportunities in the
Seattle metropolitan area and the San Francisco Bay Area. Subject to certain
exceptions, Fund II will be Essex’s exclusive investment vehicle until October
31, 2006, or when Fund II’s committed capital has been invested, whichever
occurs first. Consistent with Fund I, Essex will be compensated for its asset
management, property management, development and redevelopment services and may
receive promote distributions if Fund II exceeds certain financial return
benchmarks.

In October 1999, the Company entered into two separate
joint venture arrangements and through two separate private REITs, Newport
Beach North, Inc. and Newport Beach South, Inc., received an approximate 49.9%
equity interest in each. Generally, profit and loss are allocated to the
partners in accordance with their ownership interests. In addition to its
equity earnings, the Company is entitled to management and redevelopment fees
from the joint ventures.  On July 11,
2003 Fund I acquired a 49.9% ownership interest in these joint ventures from an
unrelated co-investment partner. In connection with the sale of the Fund I
assets, Fund I distributed its 49.9% direct ownership interest in Newport Beach
North, Inc. to the Company during the quarter ended December 31, 2004 and now
consolidates Newport Beach North, Inc. Immediately following the distribution
of Fund I’s ownership interest to the Company, the Newport Beach North property
was sold to UDR as part of the transaction described above. The share of the
proceeds from this sale that otherwise would have been distributable to the
non-Essex limited partners in Fund I was distributed to the Company, and the
Company accepted a reduced distribution from the sale of other assets that were
part of the same transaction.

In December 1999, the Company entered into a joint
venture arrangement (AEW joint venture) and received an approximate 20% equity
interest in the joint venture. The Company contributed its investment in
Riverfront Apartments, Casa Mango Apartments, and The Pointe at Cupertino
(formerly Westwood Apartments)

F-17

into the joint venture.
The Company also contributed land and development rights for a development
community, Tierra Vista, located in Oxnard, California. The AEW joint venture
completed construction and reached stabilized operations of Tierra Vista in
2001. On April 17, 2002, Riverfront Apartments and Casa Mango Apartments were
sold to an unrelated third party.  The
combined sales price was approximately $52,000. 
The buyer of these two properties assumed two non-recourse mortgages in
the cumulative amount of approximately $26,500, with a 6.5% fixed interest
rate, and maturing in February 2009.  The
Company’s equity in income from the gain on the sale of real estate was $2,000
and is presented as equity income from co-investments in the accompanying
consolidated statement of operations. 
The Company contributed the assets to the joint venture in December 1999
at costs of approximately $41,000.  In
addition, the Company earned a fee in conjunction with the sale of these assets
in the amount of $1,110 and this fee is presented as equity income from
co-investments in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations. In the
third quarter of 2002, the Company recognized an incentive fee it earned
related specifically to these two asset sales in the amount of $475. Generally,
profit and loss are allocated to the partners in accordance with their
ownership interests. In addition to its equity earnings, the Company is entitled
to management, redevelopment and development fees from the joint venture and
incentive payments based on the financial success of the joint venture. During
the second quarter of 2004, the Company acquired its partner’s 80% interests in
Tierra Vista and The Pointe at Cupertino. The combined contract price for the
interests was approximately $74.6 million. 
In conjunction with the transaction, the Company assumed a $37.3 million
loan with an interest rate of 5.93% that matures on July 1, 2007 for Tierra
Vista, and a $14.1 million loan with an interest rate of 4.86%, which matures
on November 1, 2012 for The Pointe at Cupertino.  As a result of these transactions, the
Company now consolidates these properties.

In November 2001, the Company received a loan for
approximately $6,800 from Mountain Vista, LLC (“Mountain Vista”), which is due
on December 1, 2011. The Company recorded the loan as a reduction to the
balance of the Company’s investment in Mountain Vista since the substance of
the transaction was a distribution from an equity method investee.

(6) Related Party
Transactions

The Company’s Chairman,
George Marcus, is also the Chairman of the Marcus & Millichap Company
(MM), which is a real estate brokerage firm. During the years ended December 31,
2004, 2003, and 2002, the Company paid brokerage commissions totaling $350,
$854, and $0 to MM on the purchase and sales of real estate. The commissions
are either capitalized as a cost of acquisition or are reflected as a reduction
of the gain on sales of real estate in the accompanying consolidated statements
of operations.

Interest and other income
includes management fee income from the Company’s investees of $3,554, $3,849,
and $5,177 for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003, and 2002,

(7) Mortgage Notes
Payable

Mortgage notes payable
consist of the following as of December 31, 2004 and 2003:

F-21

The
aggregate scheduled maturities and principal payments of mortgage notes payable
are as follows:

Repayment of debt before
the scheduled maturity date could result in prepayment penalties.

The Company has
historically used interest rate swap and cap agreements to reduce the impact of
interest rate fluctuations and to comply with contractual obligations of its
lenders.  The Company has not entered
into any interest rate hedge agreements for trading or other speculative
purposes.  As of December 31, 2004 and
2003, the Company was a party to interest cap agreements (“Interest Cap
Agreements”) that limited approximately $152.7 million and $69.6 million,
respectively, of the Company’s tax-exempt debt to weighted average bond
interest rates ranging from approximately 5.49% to 6.34%.  For such dates, the actual weighted average
effective interest rates on such $152.7 million and $69.6 million of
indebtedness were 2.6% and 2.9%, respectively. 
These Interest Cap Agreements have maturity dates through 2010.  The Interest Cap Agreements did not meet the
criteria for hedge accounting.  The
estimated fair value of these Interest Cap Agreements as of December 31, 2004
and 2003 was zero based on management’s estimate of fair value.  Therefore, for the periods presented,
interest rate cap agreements have been charged to earnings in accordance with
SFAS No. 133, as amended.

(8) Lines of Credit

The Company has two
outstanding lines of credit in the aggregate committed amount of $285,000. The
first line, in the committed amount of $185,000, matures in April 2007,
with an option to extend it for one year thereafter.  Outstanding balances under this line of
credit bear interest at a rate, determined using a tiered rate structure tied
to the Company’s corporate ratings, if any, and leverage rating, which has been
priced at LIBOR plus 1.00% and LIBOR plus 1.10% during 2004 and 2003,
respectively. As of December 31, 2004 and 2003, the interest rate was
approximately 3.40% and 2.10%, respectively. At December 31, 2004 the
Company had $155,800 outstanding on this line of credit. In December 2003,
the Company obtained a 5-year, $90,000 credit facility from Freddie Mac. The
aggregate maximum principal amount of the facility increased to $100,000 in July 2004
and is secured by six of Essex’s multifamily communities.  The Company borrowed $93,735 under this
facility, comprised of three tranches as follows: $33,235 locked for 360 days
at an all-in rate of 2.966% (59 basis points over Freddie Mac’s Reference
Rate), $30,000 locked for 360 days at an all-in rate of 2.834% (59 basis points
over Freddie Mac’s Reference Rate), and $30,500 locked for 360 days at an
all-in rate of 3.376% (59 basis points over Freddie Mac’s Reference Rate). The
credit agreements contain debt covenants related to limitations on indebtedness
and liabilities, maintenance of minimum levels of consolidated earnings before
depreciation, interest and amortization and maintenance of minimum tangible net
worth.

The Company was in
compliance with the line of credit covenants as of December 31, 2004

F-22

(9) Lease Agreements

During the fourth quarter
of 2003, the Company entered into lease and purchase option agreements with
unrelated third parties related to its five recreational vehicle parks that are
comprised of 1,717 spaces, and two manufactured housing communities that
contain 607 sites.  Based on the
agreements, the unrelated third parties have an option to purchase the assets
in approximately four years for approximately $41,700 – a 5% premium to the
gross book value of the assets. The Company received $474 as consideration for
entering into the option agreement and a non-refundable upfront payment of
$4,030, which has been recorded as deferred revenue and has been classified
with accounts payable and accrued liabilities in the accompanying consolidated
balance sheets. Under the lease agreements Essex is to receive a fixed monthly
lease payment in addition to the non-refundable upfront payment that will be
amortized using the straight-line method over approximately five years (the
life of the lease).  These operating
leases also provide for the Company to pass through all executory costs such as
property taxes.

The Company is a lessor
under a land lease associated with a property located in Southern California.
The land lease entitles the Company to receive fixed annual land lease payments
totaling a minimum of $477 over a thirty-four year term ended 2034. The Company
has the option to purchase the property in 2006 or can be required to sell the
land in 2006 as specified in the buyout provisions of the agreement.

The Company is a lessor
of an office building located in Southern California. The tenants lease terms
expire at various times through 2009 with average annual lease payments of
approximately $737.

The future minimum non-cancelable
base rent to be received under these operating leases for each of the years
ending after December 31, 2004 are summarized as follows:

The
carrying value of the rental properties as of December 31, 2004 is
$33,970.

(10) Equity Transactions

As of December 31,
2004, the Company, either directly or through the Operating Partnership, has
the following cumulative redeemable preferred securities outstanding.

Dividends on the
securities are payable quarterly. The holders of the securities have limited
voting rights if the required dividends are in arrears. The Series B and D
preferred units represent preferred interests issued by the Operating
Partnership and are therefore included in minority interests in the
accompanying consolidated balance sheet. 
The preferred units can be exchanged for Series Band D preferred
stock of the Company under limited conditions.

On July 30, 2003, in
connection with the Company’s acquisition, by merger, of John M. Sachs, Inc.

F-23

(“Sachs”) that was completed on December 17,
2002, and under the terms of the merger agreement, a final analysis was
prepared, which indicated that the actual net liabilities of Sachs were less
than the net liabilities of Sachs estimated to be outstanding as of the merger
date.  Based on the final analysis and as a post-closing adjustment
payment pursuant to the merger agreement, the Company made a final payment
of approximately $1,766 in cash and issued an additional 35,860 shares of
common stock valued at $2,170 to certain of the pre-merger shareholders of Sachs.

On September 23,
2003, the Company issued 1,000,000 shares of its Series F Cumulative
Redeemable Preferred Stock (“Series F Preferred Stock”) at a fixed price
of $24.664 per share, a discount from the $25.00 per share liquidation value of
the shares.  The shares pay quarterly distributions at an annualized rate
of 7.8125% per year of the liquidation value and will be redeemable by the
Company on or after September 23, 2008.  The Company amortized the
original discount in connection with the issuance of these shares in the fourth
quarter of 2003, resulting in a charge of approximately $336.  The shares
were issued pursuant to the Company’s existing shelf registration
statement.  The Company used the net proceeds from this sale of Series F
Preferred Stock to redeem all of the 9.125% Series C Cumulative Redeemable
Preferred Units (the “Series C Preferred Units”) of Essex Portfolio, L.P.,
of which the Company is the general partner.

On October 6, 2003,
the Company sold 1.6 million newly issued shares of common stock and received
offering proceeds (before expenses) of $60.67 per share, representing a 3.25%
discount to the common stock’s closing price on September 30, 2003, the
date of the underwriting agreement between the Company and the underwriter,
pursuant to which the shares were sold.  The shares were issued pursuant
to the Company’s existing shelf registration statement.  The proceeds of
the offering of approximately $97,072 were used for the acquisition of
multifamily communities located in the Company’s targeted West Coast markets
and general corporate purposes, including the repayment of debt and the funding
of development activities.

On October 14, 2003,
the Company issued a notice of redemption to the holders of its 9.125% Series C
Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Units. 
Pursuant to the provisions of the Amended and Restated Agreement of
Limited Partnership of Essex Portfolio, L.P., the Company redeemed all
outstanding Series C Preferred Units on November 24, 2003.  In connection with this redemption the
Company incurred a non-cash charge of $625 related to the write-off of the
issuance costs.

In January 2004, the
Company restructured its previously issued $50,000, 9.30% Series D
Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Units (“Series D Units”), and its previously
issued $80,000, 7.875% Series B Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Units (“Series B
Units”).  The existing distribution rate
of 9.30% of the Series D Units continued until July 27, 2004 – the
end of the non-call period.  Effective July 28,
2004, the distribution rate on the Series D Units was reduced to
7.875%.  The date that the Series D
Units can first be redeemed at the Company’s option was extended by six years
to July 28, 2010.  The date that the
Series B Units can first be redeemed at the Company’s option was extended
from February 6, 2003 to December 31, 2009.

On June 14, 2000 the
Company purchased Waterford Place, a 238-unit apartment community located in
San Jose, California for a contract price of $35,000 and an additional
contingent payment.  The amount of the
contingent payment was disputed and submitted to binding arbitration.  As a result of the arbitration, the Company
was directed to issue an additional 109,874 units of limited partnership
interest (“Units”) in the Operating Partnership to the sellers of Waterford
Place.  On March 31, 2004, the
Company completed the issuance of these Units to the sellers.  In connection with this issuance, on March 31,
2004, the Company also redeemed for cash 55,564 Units from these sellers.

On September 3,
2004, the Company redeemed all of its outstanding, $55,000, 9.25% Series E
Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Units of the Operating Partnership.  In connection with this redemption the
Company incurred a non-cash charge of $1,575 related to the write-off of the
issuance costs, which is classified as a component of minority interest in the
accompanying statement of operations.

On August 6, 2004,
the Company acquired Vista Belvedere, a 76-unit apartment community located in
the Marin County town of Tiburon, California. 
Essex acquired the multifamily community in a UPREIT structured
transaction for an agreed upon value of approximately $17.1 million.  The Company issued 73,088 limited operating
partnership units to the prior owner.

(12) Stock Based Compensation
Plans

The Essex Property Trust, Inc.
2004 Stock Incentive Plan provides incentives to attract and retain officers,
directors and key employees. The Stock Incentive Plan provides for the grants
of options to purchase a specified number of shares of common stock or grants
of restricted shares of common stock. Under the Stock Incentive Plan, the total
number of shares available for grant is approximately 1,200,000. The Board of
Directors (the Board) may adjust the aggregate number and type of shares
reserved for issuance. Participants in the Stock Incentive Plans are selected
by the Stock Incentive Plan Committee of the Board, which is comprised of
independent directors. The Stock Incentive Plan Committee is authorized to
establish the exercise price; however, the exercise price cannot be less than
100% of the fair market value of the common stock on the grant date. The
Company’s options have a life of ten years. Option grants fully vest between
one year and five years after the grant date.

In connection with the
Company’s 1994 initial public offering, the Company provided a one-time grant
of options to Marcus & Millichap (“MM”) to purchase 220,000 shares of
common stock at the initial public offering price of $19.50 per share pursuant
to an agreement whereby Marcus & Millichap Real Estate Investment
Brokerage Company, a subsidiary of MM, will provide real estate transaction,
trend and other information to the Operating Partnership for a period of ten
years. The Company has not used such research information provided by M&M
in any material way since 1998. In February 2002, MM exercised and sold
the shares underlying this one-time grant. This option was exercised in a “cashless”
transaction pursuant to FAS 123, whereby MM was issued 129,302 shares of
Company common stock based on the current market price of the Company’s common
stock of $47.30 at the time of exercise.

A summary of the status
of the Company’s stock option plans as of December 31, 2004, 2003, and
2002 and changes during the years ended on those dates is presented below:

The following table
summarizes information about stock options outstanding as of December 31,
2004:

On June 28, 2001,
the Operating Partnership issued 200,000 Series Z Incentive Units of
limited partner interest (the “Series Z Incentive Units”) to eleven senior
executives of the Company in exchange for a capital commitment of $1.00 per Series Z
Incentive Unit, for an aggregate offering price of $200. Upon certain
triggering events, the Series Z Incentive Units will automatically convert
into common Operating Partnership units based on a conversion ratio that may
increase over time upon satisfaction of specific conditions. The conversion
ratio, initially set at zero, will increase by 10% (20% in 2002) on January 1
of each year for each participating executive who remains employed by the
Company if the Company has met the criteria established by the agreement. The
conversion ratio as of January 1, 2002 was 20%, which resulted in 40,000 Series Z
Incentive Units being convertible into up to an equal amount of common
Operating Partnership Units. On January 1, 2003 and 2004, the conversion
ratio increased by 8% and 7.5%, respectively, to 35.5% based on the approval of
the Board of Directors. In certain change of control situations, the participating
executives will also be given the option to convert their units at the
then-effective conversion ratio. In addition, the Operating Partnership has the
option to redeem Series Z Incentive Units held by any executive whose
employment has been terminated for any reason and the obligation to redeem any
such units following the death of the holder. In such event, the Operating
Partnership will redeem the units for, at its option, either common Operating
Partnership units or shares of the Company’s common stock based on the
then-effective conversion ratio. The Company obtained a qualified independent
third-party valuation of the Series Z Incentive Units. As compensation
expense for such units, the Company records each year an amount, per unit,
equal to the percentage increase in the conversion ratio for that year as
multiplied by the third party valuation of the unit less its $1.00 purchase
price.

On June 28, 2004,
the Operating Partnership issued 95,953 Series Z-1 Incentive Units of
limited partner interest (the “Series Z-1 Incentive Units”) to fourteen
senior executives of the Company in exchange for cash or a capital commitment
of $1.00 per Series Z-1 Incentive Unit, for an aggregate offering price of
$96.0. Any capital commitment will be payable upon demand or to be offset by
any distributions paid with respect to such Series Z-1

F-26

unit, until the capital
commitment has been reduced to zero. In the event a Series Z-1 partner
becomes a director or executive officer of the general partner, such capital
commitment will become immediately due and payable to the Operating Partnership
prior to such event. Upon certain triggering events, the Series Z-1
Incentive Units will automatically convert into common Operating Partnership
units based on a conversion ratio that may increase over time upon satisfaction
of specific conditions. The conversion ratio was set at 20% upon issuance and
will increase an additional 10% on January 1 of each year for each participating
executive who remains employed by the Company if the Company has met the
criteria established by the agreement. The conversion ratio as of June 28,
2004, was 20%, which resulted in 19,191 Series Z-1 Incentive Units being
convertible into up to an equal amount of common Operating Partnership Units.
In certain change of control situations, the participating executives will also
be given the option to convert their units at the then-effective conversion
ratio. In addition, the Operating Partnership has the option to redeem Series Z-1
Incentive Units held by any executive whose employment has been terminated for
any reason and the obligation to redeem any such units following the death of
the holder. In such event, the Operating Partnership will redeem the units for,
at its option, either common Operating Partnership units or shares of the
Company’s common stock based on the then-effective conversion ratio. The
Company obtained a qualified independent third-party valuation of the Series Z-1
Incentive Units. As compensation expense for such units, the Company records
each year an amount, per unit, equal to the percentage increase in the
conversion ratio for that year as multiplied by the third party valuation of
the unit less its $1.00 purchase price.

Through February 2000,
the Company has granted 42,586 stock units under the Company’s Phantom Stock
Unit Agreement to two of the Company’s executives. The units vest in
installments in accordance with the vesting schedule set forth in the
Phantom Stock Unit Agreement such that the units will be fully vested five
years from the date of issuance. At that time, the Company expects to issue to
the executives the number of shares of common stock equal to the number of
units vested, or at the Company’s option, an equivalent amount in cash. The
Company has issued common stock each year since inception of the agreement.
Dividends are paid by the Company on the vested and unvested portion of shares
and are recorded as a component of general and administrative expense. For
accounting purposes, the Company estimates that the fair value of a phantom
stock unit at the date of grant is equal to the market value of one share of
the Company’s common stock at that time, and the accounting for phantom stock
units is identical to the accounting for restricted stock under SFAS 123.

(13) Shareholder Rights Plan

On November 12,
1998, the Company’s Board of Directors adopted a Stockholder Rights Plan. A
dividend of one right (a Right) per share of common stock was distributed to
stockholders of record on November 21, 1998. Each Right, expiring November 11,
2008, represents a right to buy from the Company 1/100th of a share of Series A
junior participating preferred stock at a price of $99.13 per Right.

Generally the Rights will
not be exercisable unless a person or group acquires 15% or more, or announces
an offer that could result in acquiring 15% or more, of the Company’s common
stock unless such person is or becomes the beneficial owner of 15% or more of
the Company’s outstanding common stock and had a contractual right or the
approval of the Company’s Board of Directors, provided that such percentage
shall not be greater than 19.9%. Following an acquisition of 15% or more of the
Company’s common stock, each Right holder, except the 15% or more shareholder,
has the right to receive, upon exercise, shares of common stock valued at twice
the then applicable exercise price of the Right, unless the 15% or more
shareholder has offered to acquire all of the outstanding shares of the Company
under terms that a majority of the independent directors of the Company have
determined to be fair and in the best interest of the Company and its
shareholders.

Similarly, unless certain
conditions are met, if the Company engages in a merger or other business
combination following a stock acquisition where it does not survive or survives
with a change or exchange of its common stock or if 50% or more of its assets,
earning power or cash flow is sold or transferred, the Rights will become
exercisable for shares of the acquiror’s stock having a value of twice the
exercise price.

Generally, Rights may be
redeemed for $0.01 each (in cash, common stock or other consideration the
Company deems appropriate) until the tenth day following a public announcement
that a 15% or greater position has been acquired of the Company’s stock.

(14) Segment Information

In accordance with FASB No. 131,

Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise
and Related Information,

the Company defines its reportable
operating segments as the three geographical regions in which its multifamily
residential properties are located: Northern California, Southern California,
and the Pacific Northwest.

Nonsegment revenues and
net operating income included in the following schedule consist of revenue
generated from the commercial properties, recreational vehicle parks, and
manufactured housing communities. Also excluded from segment revenues are
interest and other corporate income. Other nonsegment assets include
investments, real estate under development, cash, notes receivables, other
assets and deferred charges.

The accounting policies
of the segments are the same as those described in note 2. The Company
evaluates performance based upon net operating income from the combined
properties in each segment.

F-28

The revenues, net
operating income, and assets for each of the reportable operating segments are
summarized as follows for the years ended and as of December 31, 2004,
2003, and 2002:

F-29

(15) 401(k) Plan

The Company has a
401(k) benefit plan (the Plan) for all full-time employees who have completed
six months of service. Employees may contribute up to 23% of their
compensation, limited by the maximum allowed under Section 401(k) of the
Internal Revenue Code. The Company matches the employee contributions for
nonhighly compensated personnel, up to 50% of their contribution up to a
specified maximum. Company contributions to the Plan were approximately $98,
$93, and $107 for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003, and 2002.

(16) Fair Value of Financial
Instruments

Management believes
that the carrying amounts of its variable rate mortgage notes payable, lines of
credit, notes receivable from investees and other related parties and notes and
other receivables approximate fair value as of December 31, 2004 and 2003,
because interest rates, yields and other terms for these instruments are
consistent with yields and other terms currently available to the Company for
similar instruments. Management has estimated that the fair value of the
Company’s $878,617 of fixed rate mortgage notes payable at December 31,
2004 is approximately $945,607 based on the terms of existing mortgage notes
payable compared to those available in the marketplace. At December 31,
2003, the Company’s fixed rate mortgage notes payable of $801,819 had an
approximate market value of $838,743. Management believes that the carrying
amounts of cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, accounts payable and
accrued liabilities, other liabilities and dividends payable approximate fair
value as of December 31, 2004 and 2003 due to the short-term maturity of
these instruments.

(17) Commitments and
Contingencies

At December 31, 2004
we had four non-cancelable ground leases for certain apartment communities and
buildings that expire between 2027 and 2080. Land lease payments are typically the
greater of a stated minimum or a percentage of gross rents generated by these
apartment communities. We also lease office space under non-cancelable
operating leases. Total lease commitments, under land leases and operating
leases, are approximately $1,600 per year.

At December 31, 2004
the Company has a $1,212 letter of credit outstanding and a payment guarantee
of $4,750 relating to financing and development transactions.

To the extent that an
environmental matter arises or is identified in the future that has other than
a remote risk, as defined in SFAS 5, of having a material impact on the
financial statements, the Company will disclose the estimated range of possible
outcomes, and, if an outcome is probable, accrue appropriate liability for
remediation and other potential liability. In addition, it will consider
whether such occurrence results in an impairment of value on the affected
property and, if so, accrue an appropriate reserve for impairment.

Except with respect to
three Properties, the Company has no indemnification agreements from third
parties for potential environmental clean-up costs at its Properties. The
Company has no way of determining at this time the magnitude of any potential
liability to which it may be subject arising out of unknown environmental
conditions or violations with respect to the properties formerly owned by the
Company. No assurance can be given that existing environmental studies with
respect to any of the Properties reveal all environmental liabilities, that any
prior owner or operator of a Property did not create any material environmental
condition not known to the Company, or that a material environmental condition
does not otherwise exist as to any one or more of the Properties. The Company
has limited insurance coverage for the types of environmental liabilities
described above.

The
Company may enter into transactions that could require us to pay the tax
liabilities of the partners in the Down REIT entities, which are within our
control. Although the Company plans to hold the contributed assets or defer
recognition of gain on their sale pursuant to like-kind exchange rules under
Section 1031 of the Internal Revenue Code we can provide no assurance that
we will be able to do so and if such tax liabilities were incurred they can
expect to have a material impact on our financial position.

In April 2004, a
lawsuit entitled Chace Nelson and Douglas Korte, et al. v. Essex Property Trust
was filed against the Company in the California Superior Court in the County of
Alameda. In this lawsuit, two former Company maintenance employees seek unpaid
wages, associated penalties and attorneys’ fees on behalf of a putative class
of the Company’s current and former maintenance employees who were required to
wear a pager

F-30

while they were on call
during evening and weekend hours. The Company intends to vigorously defend
against the claims alleged in this litigation. At December 31, 2004, no
accrual for settlement cost has been recorded. However, litigation is subject
to inherent uncertainties, and no assurance can be given that the Company will
prevail in this lawsuit.

The Company is subject to
various other lawsuits in the normal course of its business operations.
Accordingly, such lawsuits, as well as the class action lawsuit described
above, could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and could
have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition, results of
operation or cash flows.

(18) Quarterly Results of
Operations

The following is a
summary of quarterly results of operations for 2004 and 2003:

(1)

Net
earnings from discontinued operations have been reclassified for all periods
presented.

(2)

Beginning in 2003, the
Company implemented an upgrade to its subsidiary ledger for accounting for
fixed assets. The Company completed this system upgrade in the first quarter of
2004. In conjunction with this system upgrade, the Company has determined that
cumulative depreciation expense generated by consolidated or equity method
rental properties was understated by approximately $2.1 million through December 31,
2003 and this amount was recorded during the quarter ended March 31, 2004.
Had the correction been made in 2003, depreciation expense would have increased
by approximately $640, $1.3 million, and $1.0 million in the first, second and
third quarters of 2003, respectively. In the fourth quarter 2003, depreciation
expense would have decreased by approximately $1.4 million. The Company does
not believe that the correction is material to any previously reported financial
statements and is not material to any consolidated earnings trends.

(3)

Includes
the following non-recurring items:

(a)

Gains
of $25.2 million resulting from the sale of seven Fund I multifamily
properties.

(b)

Promote
income of $3.8 million from incentive income allocations from Fund I.

(19) Subsequent Events

In January 2005, the
Company sold four non-core assets that were acquired in conjunction with the
John M. Sachs’s Merger in 2002. The four non-core assets were: The Riviera
Recreational Vehicle Park and a Manufactured Home Park, located in Las Vegas,
Nevada, for which the Company had previously entered into master lease and
option agreements with an unrelated entity; and two small office buildings,
located in San Diego California, aggregating 7,200 square feet. The sale proceeds
were in excess of the carrying value of each of these assets.

On February 1, 2005,
the Company obtained a non-recourse mortgage on a previously unencumbered
property in the amount of $21.8 million with a 4.94% fixed interest rate for a
9-year term, maturing in March 2014, with an option to extend the maturity
for one year thereafter at a floating rate of 2.4% over one month LIBOR. During
the extension period, the loan may be paid in full with no prepayment penalty.

On February 2, 2005,
the Company acquired Cedar Terrace Apartments, a 180-unit apartment community,
located in Bellevue, Washington, for approximately $22.3 million. The property
is unencumbered.

On February 16,
2005, the Company entered into a $50 million notional forward-starting swap
with PNC Bank at a fixed rate of 4.927% and a settlement date on or around October 1,
2007. This derivative will be used to hedge the cash flows associated with the
forecasted issuance of debt expected to occur in 2007. At inception, the
transaction is considered highly effective at offsetting changes in future cash
flows for forecasted transactions and qualifies for hedge accounting. Changes
to the derivative’s fair value prior to settlement will be reflected in Other
Comprehensive Income on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.
