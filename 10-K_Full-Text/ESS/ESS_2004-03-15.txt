Item 1. Business

Description of Business

Essex Property Trust, Inc. ("the Company" or
"Essex") is a self-administered and self-managed equity real estate
investment trust ("REIT") engaged in the ownership, acquisition,
development and management of multifamily apartment communities. The Company's
multifamily portfolio as of December 31, 2003 consists of ownership interests in
121 properties (comprising 26,012 apartment units), of which 14,943 units are
located in Southern California (Los Angeles, Ventura, Orange and San Diego
counties), 4,605 units are located in Northern California (the San Francisco Bay
Area), 5,886 of which are located in the Pacific Northwest (4,515 units in the
Seattle metropolitan area and 1,371 units in the Portland, Oregon metropolitan
area), and 578 are located in other areas (302 units in Houston, Texas and 276
units in Hemet, California). In addition, the Company has an ownership interest
in other real estate assets consisting of five recreational vehicle parks
(comprising 1,717 spaces), four office buildings (totaling approximately 63,540
square feet) and two manufactured housing communities (containing 607 sites),
(collectively, together with the Company's multifamily residential properties,
the "Properties").  One of the office buildings located in Northern
California (Palo Alto) has approximately 17,400 square feet and houses the
Company's headquarters and another office building located in Southern
California (Woodland Hills) has approximately 38,940 square feet, of which the
Company currently occupies approximately 8,600 square feet. The Woodland Hills
office building has nine third-party tenants occupying approximately 27,300
feet. The Company along with its affiliated entities and joint ventures also
have entered into commitments for the development of 1,056 units in five
multifamily communities; two of which are in Northern California and three are
in Southern California.


The Company was incorporated in the state of Maryland in March 1994. On June
13, 1994, the Company commenced operations with the completion of an initial
public offering ("the Offering") in which it issued 6,275,000 shares
of common stock at $19.50 per share.

The Company conducts substantially all of its activities through Essex
Portfolio, L.P. (the "Operating Partnership"). The Company currently
owns an approximate 90.8% general partnership interest and members of the
Company's Board of Directors, senior management and certain third-party investors
own limited partnership interests of approximately 9.2% in the Operating
Partnership. As the sole general partner of the Operating Partnership, the
Company has control over the management of the Operating Partnership. The
Operating Partnership either controls or has significant influence over the
Properties.

The Company's website address is http://www.essexpropertytrust.com.  The

Business Objectives

The Company's primary business objective is to maximize funds from
operations and total returns to stockholders through active property and
portfolio management, including the redevelopment of existing properties. The
Company's strategies include:

Active Property Marketing and Management. Maximize, on a per share basis,
cash available for distribution and the capital appreciation of its property
portfolio through active property marketing and management and, if applicable,
redevelopment.

Selected Expansion of Property Portfolio. Increase, on a per share basis,
cash available for distribution through the acquisition and development of
multifamily residential properties in selected major metropolitan areas located
primarily in the west coast region of the United States.

Optimal Portfolio Asset Allocations. Produce predictable financial
performance through a portfolio asset allocation program that seeks to increase
or decrease the investments in each market based on changes in regional economic
and local market conditions.

Management of Capital and Financial Risk. Optimize the Company's capital and
financial risk positions by maintaining a conservative leverage ratio and
minimizing the Company's cost of capital.

Business Principles

The Company was founded on, has followed, and intends to continue to
follow the business principles set forth below:

Property Management

.  Through its long-standing philosophy of active
property management and a customer satisfaction approach, coupled with a
discipline of internal cost control, the Company seeks to retain tenants,
maximize cash flow, enhance property values and compete effectively for new
tenants in the marketplace. The Company's Senior Vice President of Operations,
regional portfolio managers, and their staff are accountable for overall
property operations and performance. They supervise on-site managers, provide
training for the on-site staff, monitor fiscal performance against budgeted
expectations, monitor property performance against competing properties in the
area, prepare operating and capital budgets for executive approval, and
implement new strategies focused on enhancing tenant satisfaction, increasing
revenue, controlling expenses, and creating a more efficient operating
environment.


Business Planning and Control.

Real estate investment decisions are
accompanied by a multiple year plan, to which executives and other managers
responsible for obtaining future financial performance must agree. Performance
versus plan serves as a significant factor in determining compensation.

Property Type Focus.

The Company focuses on acquisition and
development of multifamily residential communities, containing between 75 and
750 units. These types of properties offer attractive opportunities because such
properties provide opportunities for value enhancement since many of these
properties have been owned by parties that are either inadequately capitalized
or lack the professional property management and redevelopment expertise of the
Company.

Geographic Focus.

The Company focuses its property investments in
markets that meet the following criteria:

Major Metropolitan Areas.

The Company focuses on metropolitan areas
having a regional population in excess of one million people. Real estate
markets in these areas are typically characterized by a greater number of buyers
and sellers and are, therefore, more liquid. Liquidity is an important element
for implementing the Company's strategy of varying its portfolio in response to
changing market conditions.

Supply Constraints.

The Company believes that properties located in
real estate markets with limited development opportunities are well suited to
produce increased rental income. When evaluating supply constraints, the Company
reviews: (i) availability of developable land sites on which competing
properties could be readily constructed; (ii) political barriers to growth
resulting from a restrictive local political environment regarding development
(such an environment, in addition to the restrictions on development itself, is
often associated with a lengthy development process and expensive development
fees); and (iii) physical barriers to growth, resulting from natural limitations
to development, such as mountains or waterways.

Rental Demand Created by High Cost of Housing

.  The Company
concentrates on markets in which the cost of renting compares favorably to the
cost of owning a home. In such markets, rent levels tend to be higher and
operating expenses and capital expenditures, as a percentage of rent, are lower
in comparison with markets that have a lower cost of owning a home.

Job Proximity

.  The Company believes that most renters select housing
based on its proximity to their jobs and related commuting factors. The Company
obtains local area information relating to its residential properties and uses
this information when making multifamily property acquisition decisions. The
Company also reviews the location of major employers relative to its portfolio
and potential acquisition properties.

Following the above criteria, the Company is currently pursuing investment
opportunities in selected markets of Northern and Southern California and the
Pacific Northwest.

Active Portfolio Management Through Regional Economic Research and Local
Market Knowledge.

The Company was founded on the belief that the key
elements of successful real estate investment and portfolio growth include
extensive regional economic research and local market knowledge. The Company
utilizes its economic research and local market knowledge to make appropriate
portfolio allocation decisions that it believes will result in better overall
operating performance and lower portfolio risk. The Company maintains and
evaluates:

Regional Economic Data.

The Company evaluates and reviews regional
economic factors for the markets in which it owns properties and where it
considers expanding its operations. The Company's research focuses on regional
and sub-market supply and demand, economic diversity, job growth, market depth
and the comparison of rents to down payments and occupancy costs associated with
for-sale housing.

Local Market Conditions.

Local market knowledge includes (i) local
factors that influence whether a sub-market is desirable to tenants; (ii) the
extent to which the area surrounding a property is improving or deteriorating;
and (iii) local investment market dynamics, including the relationship between
the value of a property and its yield, the prospects for capital appreciation
and market depth.


Recognizing that all real estate markets are cyclical, the Company regularly
evaluates the results of regional economic and local market research and
proceeds to adjust its portfolio allocations accordingly. The Company actively
manages the allocation of assets within its portfolio. The Company seeks to
increase its portfolio allocation in markets projected to have economic growth
and to decrease such allocations in markets projected to have declining economic
conditions. Likewise, the Company also seeks to increase its portfolio
allocation in markets that have attractive property valuations and to decrease
such allocations in markets that have inflated valuations and low relative
yields. Although the Company is generally a long-term investor, it does not
establish defined or preferred holding periods for its Properties.

Current Business Activities

The Company conducts substantially all of its activities through the
Operating Partnership, of which it owns an approximate 90.8% general partnership
interest. The approximate 9.2% limited partnership interests in the Operating
Partnership are owned by directors, officers and employees of the Company and
certain third-party investors. As the sole general partner of the Operating
Partnership, the Company has operating control over the management of the
Operating Partnership. The Operating Partnership either controls or has
significant influence over the Properties. From time to time, the Company may
invest in properties through the acquisition of an interest in another entity,
based upon the criteria described above. The Company does not plan to invest in
the securities of other entities not engaged in real estate related activities.

The Company has elected to be treated as a real estate investment trust
("REIT") for federal income tax purposes, commencing with the year
ended December 31, 1994. The Company provides some of its fee-based asset
management and disposition services as well as third-party property management
and leasing services through Essex Management Corporation ("EMC"), a
taxable REIT subsidiary, in order to maintain compliance with REIT tax rules.
The Company owns 100% of EMC's 19,000 shares of nonvoting preferred stock.
Executives of the Company own 100% of EMC's 1,000 shares of common stock. The
Company accounts for EMC on the equity method of accounting.

Acquisitions

On October 9, 2003, the Company acquired two multifamily communities
comprising 442 apartment homes in the Seattle, Washington metropolitan area for
an aggregate purchase price of $41.7 million.  The properties acquired were:
Canyon Pointe, a 250-unit multifamily property located in Bothell, Washington;
and Forest View, a 192-unit multifamily property located in Renton, Washington.
These newly acquired assets are not encumbered by any mortgage.

On October 23, 2003, the Company acquired Walnut Heights Apartments, a 163-
unit multifamily community located in the City of Walnut, California, for a
contract price of approximately $24.3 million.  This newly acquired asset was
not encumbered by any mortgage.

Subsequent Event - Acquisitions

On January 21, 2004, the Company acquired the improvements of Marina City Club,
located in Marina del Rey, California, which include a 101-unit promenade apartment community,
an adjacent marina with approximately 340 boat slips and assorted retail space.  The total
contract price was approximately $27.7 million.  The improvements are subject to a
non-cancellable long-term ground lease with the County of Los Angeles that expires in 2067.
This newly acquired asset was not encumbered by any mortgage.

On January 28, 2004, the Company acquired Mountain View Apartments, a 106-unit multifamily
community located in Camarillo, California, for a contract price of approximately $14.3 million.
This newly acquired asset was not encumbered by any mortgage.

On February 27, 2004 the Company acquired Fountain Park Apartments, a 705-unit multifamily
community located in Playa vista, California, for a contract price of approximately $124.5
million.  In connection with this transaction the Company assumed  tax-exempt variable rate
bond obligations totaling $83.2 million that mature in 2033.  Financing and other agreements
require 53% of the apartment homes in Fountain Park to be subject to various rent restrictions
based on resident income criteria.


Development

Development communities are defined by the Company as new apartment
properties that are being constructed or are newly constructed and in a phase of
lease-up and have not yet reached stabilized operations (defined as 95% physical
occupancy). As of December 31, 2003, the Company  had direct
ownership interests in two development communities, with an
aggregate of 444 multifamily units. During 2003, the Company achieved stabilized
operations at two development communities. The Essex on Lake Merritt, a 270-unit
high-rise luxury apartment community located in Oakland, California achieved
stabilized operations during the first quarter of 2003 and The San Marcos (phase
I), a 312-unit apartment community located in Richmond, California achieved
stabilized operations during the fourth quarter of 2003.

Construction began at Phase II of The San Marcos project, which is located
directly adjacent to the first phase. It is anticipated that construction of
these additional units will be completed in the second quarter of 2004 and is
expected to reach stabilized operations in the fourth quarter of 2004.

During 2003 the Company began leasing activities at Hidden Valley, a 324-unit
apartment community located in Simi Valley, California. The Company expects to
reach stabilized operations at Hidden Valley in the fourth quarter of 2004.  The
Company consolidates this property since its 75% ownership interest in this
development project gives the Company control.

In connection with the properties currently under development, the Company
has directly, or in some cases through affiliated joint venture entities,
entered into contractual construction-related commitments with unrelated third
parties. As of December 31, 2003, the Company and its partners are committed to
fund approximately $17.9 million in estimated development expenditures to
complete theses projects.

The following table sets forth information regarding the Company's
development communities at December 31, 2003.

(1) Estimated project cost as of December 31, 2003 includes incurred
costs and estimated costs to complete the development projects.

(2) The Company has a 75% controlling interest in this development
project.

(3) The Company is the sole owner of this development project.

The Company is entitled to receive development fee income on the joint
venture development communities. The portion of the fees associated with our
ownership percentage is eliminated in consolidation.

Although the Company will continue to evaluate the development of multifamily
properties as deemed appropriate given market conditions, it does not expect to
start any new development projects in 2004.


Redevelopment

Redevelopment communities are defined by the Company as existing
properties owned or recently acquired which have been targeted for additional
investment by the Company with the expectation of increased financial returns.
Redevelopment communities typically have apartment units that are under
construction and, as a result, may have less than stabilized operations. As of
December 31, 2003, the Company
has direct ownership interests in one redevelopment community which contain 608 units.
The estimated cost specifically related to the redevelopment of this community
is $3.4 million of which approximately $1.9 million remains to be expended.

Debt Transactions

On January 15, 2003, the Company repaid a non-recourse mortgage with an
interest rate of 7.6% that matured in the amount of $18.8 million.

During the third quarter of 2003 the Company expanded its existing $165.0
million unsecured revolving credit facility to $185.0 million.  No other
material terms of this facility were revised.

On October 15, 2003, the Company obtained four mortgage loans aggregating
$42.4 million with a variable interest rate priced at Freddie Mac's Reference Rate plus 1.3%.
On January 31, 2004, the interest rates on these loans was converted from a variable rate
to a 5.65% fixed rate through February 2012.  The loans mature in February 2013.

On December 18, 2003, the Company obtained a 5-year, $90.0 million credit
facility from Freddie Mac, secured by four of Essex's multifamily communities.
The aggregate maximum principal amount of the facility is $90.0 million,
increasing to $100.0 million on July 1, 2004.  The Company borrowed $80.6
million under this facility, comprised of two tranches as follows: $41 million,
locked for 60 days at a base rate of 1.586% (55 basis points over Freddie Mac's
Reference Rate) and $39.6 million locked for 180 days at a base rate of 1.695%
(59 basis points over Freddie Mac's Reference Rate).  This credit facility has a
lower cost of borrowing as compared to the Company's unsecured credit facility.

Equity Transactions

On June 14, 2000 the Company purchased Waterford Place, a 238-unit
apartment community located in San Jose, California for a contract price of
$35.0 million, which excluded a contingent payment to be paid by the Company
pursuant to the terms of the agreement.  The amount of the contingent payment
was disputed, and submitted to binding arbitration.  On March 19, 2003, in
connection with that arbitration, the Company was directed to issue an
additional 109,875 Operating Partnership units to the seller.  As a result, the
Company has increased its capitalized acquisition cost of this asset by
approximately $7.2 million with an offset to minority interest.
The arbitration award is finalized, however no Operating Partnership units have been issued as
of December 31, 2003. The Company expects to issue the units during the first
quarter of 2004 .

On July 30, 2003, in connection with the Company's acquisition, by merger, of
John M. Sachs, Inc. ("Sachs") on December 17, 2002, and under terms of
the merger agreement, a final analysis was prepared, which indicated that the
actual net liabilities of Sachs were less than the net liabilities of Sachs
estimated to be outstanding as of the merger date.  Based on this final analysis
and as a post-closing adjustment payment pursuant to the merger agreement, the
Company made a final payment of $1.8 million in cash and issued an additional
35,860 shares of common stock to certain of the pre-merger shareholders of
Sachs.

On September 23, 2003, the Company issued 1,000,000 shares of its Series F
Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock at a fixed price of $24.664 per share, a
discount from the $25.00 per share liquidation value of the shares.  The shares
did not begin to accrue a dividend until November 25, 2003 and following that
date, pay quarterly distributions at an annualized rate of 7.8125% per year
of the liquidation value and will be redeemable at the Company's option on or
after September 23, 2008. The Company amortized the original discount in
connection with the issuance of these shares in the fourth quarter of 2003,
resulting in a charge of approximately $336,000.


On October 6, 2003, the Company sold 1.6 million newly issued shares of
common stock at a price of $60.67 per share, representing a 3.25% discount to
the closing price on September 30, 2003, the date of the agreement between the
Company and the underwriter. Subsequent to the offering, the net proceeds
generated from the offering were used to acquire multifamily communities located
in the Company's targeted West Coast markets.

Using the proceeds of its September 2003 sale of its 7.8125% Series F
Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock, the Company on November 24, 2003,
redeemed all of the outstanding 9.125% Series C Cumulative Redeemable Preferred
Units of the Operating Partnership. In connection with this redemption the
Company incurred a non-cash charge of $625,000 related to the write-off of the
issuance costs.

Subsequent Event - Equity

In January 2004, the Company restructured its previously issued $50
million, 9.30% Series D Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Units ("Series D
Units"), and its previously issued $80 million, 7.875% Series B Cumulative
Redeemable Preferred Units ("Series B Units").  The existing
distribution rate of 9.30% of the Series D Units will continue until July 27,
2004 - the end of the current non-call period.  On July 28, 2004, the
distribution rate on the Series D Units will be reduced to 7.875%.  The date
that the Series D Units can first be redeemed at the Company's option will be
extended by six years to July 28, 2010.  The dates that the Series B Units can
first be redeemed at the Company's option will be extended from February 6, 2003
to December 31, 2009.

Notes and Other Receivables

In July 2000 the Company acquired a development land parcel in Irvine, California.
As a condition to the acquisition, an affiliate of the Company acquired a vacant 110,000
square foot office building located adjacent to the development site for $14.6 million.
In August 2000 the affiliate sold the office building to a third party for
$15.0 million. The Company loaned the buyer $15.0 million as a secured first
mortgage on the property. In addition, after the buyer expended $500,000 for
such items as tenant improvements, leasing commissions, and carrying costs, the
Company agreed to lend an additional $4.5 million to the buyer for these related
items, under a mezzanine loan, which is secured by a second deed of trust on the
property (the "Mezzanine Loan"). The recorded balance of the Mezzanine
Loan is approximately $4.5 million, of which the principal shareholder of the
buyer personally guarantees $1.7 million. The Company has evaluated the realization
potential of the first and mezzanine loans and, effective June 2002, ceased
accruing interest income on these notes until the timing of the borrower's cash
flow from the office building is more predictable. The loan matured in March
2003 and is in default. As of December 31, 2003, the owner leased 62.7% of the rentable
square footage for amounts acceptable by the Company. The Company has determined that the
current recorded balances due under these loans are properly valued.

Other

During the fourth quarter of 2003, the Company entered into lease and
purchase option agreements with unrelated third parties related to its five
recreational vehicle parks that are comprised of 1,717 spaces, and two
manufactured housing communities that contain 607 sites.  Based on the
agreements, the unrelated third parties have an option to purchase the assets in
approximately four years for approximately $41.7 million - a 5% premium to the
gross book value of the assets.  The Company received $474,000 as consideration for entering
into the option agreement.  The option premium of approximately $4.0 million has been
recorded as deferred revenue and has been classified with accounts payable and accrued
liabilities in the Company's consolidated balance sheets.  Under the lease agreements Essex
is to receive a fixed monthly lease payment in addition to a non-refundable upfront payment
that will be amortized over approximately five years (the life of the lease).  These
operating leases also provide for the Company to pass through all executory costs such as
property taxes.


Essex Apartment Value Fund I ("Fund I")

Essex Apartment Value Fund, L.P. ("Fund I"), is an
investment fund organized by the Company in 2001 to add value through rental
growth and asset appreciation, utilizing the Company's acquisition, development,
redevelopment and asset management capabilities. Currently Fund I is considered
fully invested based on its acquisitions to date and anticipated development and
redevelopment expenditures. An affiliate of the Company, Essex VFGP, L.P.
("VFGP"), is a 1% general partner and is a 20.4% limited partner. The
Operating Partnership owns a 99% limited partnership interest in VFGP. Fund I
now expects to utilize leverage of approximately 61% of the value of the
underlying real estate portfolio.  The Company is committed to invest 21.4% of
the aggregate capital committed to Fund I.  As of December 31, 2003, the
Company's share of such capital commitment which may be called by Fund I is $9.6
million. In addition, Essex will be compensated by Fund I for its asset
management, property management, development and redevelopment services and may
receive incentive payments if the Fund exceeds certain financial return
benchmarks.

The Company is in the process of forming a second Essex Apartment Value Fund
("Fund II"), which is expected to be similar to Fund I in size and
structure.  Essex anticipates an initial closing of Fund II during the second
quarter of 2004, which would result in a final $50 million capital commitment by a
subsidiary of the Company.

Since its formation, Fund I has acquired ownership interests in 17
multifamily residential properties, representing 4,926 apartment units with an
aggregate purchase price of approximately $500 million, excluding redevelopment
expenses, and disposed of two multifamily residential property, consisting of
530 apartment units at a gross sales price of approximately $73.2 million
resulting in a net realized gain of approximately $5.7 million. In addition, two
development land parcels, where approximately 480 apartment units are planned
for construction, have been purchased by Fund I with total estimated costs
related to the development of such projects of approximately $101.7 million. As
of December 31, 2003, the estimated remaining commitments to complete these
development projects is approximately $37.4 million of which approximately $8.0
million is the Company's commitment.

Disposition Activities

On July 24, 2003, Fund I sold a 30 unit apartment community, which was
acquired on May 1, 2003 in conjunction with the purchase of three multifamily
properties comprised of 288 apartment homes all located in San Dimas,
California, for $4.2 million in cash to an unrelated third party. This property
was not encumbered by a mortgage.

Debt Transactions

On January 30, 2003, Fund I obtained a non-recourse mortgage on a
previously unencumbered property in the amount of $23.2 million, with a 5.16%
fixed interest rate, which matures in February 2010.

On April 11, 2003, Fund I obtained a non-recourse mortgage on a previously
unencumbered property in the amount of $10.0 million, with a 5.42% fixed
interest rate for a 9-year term, which matures in May 2013, with an option to
extend the maturity for one year thereafter at a floating rate of 2.5% over
Freddie Mac's Reference Bill. During the extension period, the loan may be paid
in full with no prepayment penalty.

On April 29, 2003, Fund I obtained a non-recourse mortgage on a previously
unencumbered property in the amount of $38.5 million, with a 4.64% fixed
interest rate, which matures in May 2010.

On May 29, 2003, Fund I obtained a non-recourse mortgage on a previously
unencumbered property in the amount of $54.0 million, with a 4.58% fixed
interest rate for a 9-year term, which matures in June 2013, with an option to
extend the maturity for one year thereafter at a floating rate of 2.5% over
Freddie Mac's Reference Bill. During the extension period, the loan may be paid
in full with no prepayment penalty.


On July 28, 2003, Fund I obtained a non-recourse mortgage on a previously
unencumbered property in the amount of $9.6 million, with a 5.03% fixed interest
rate for an 8-year term, which matures in August 2011, with an option to extend
the maturity for one year thereafter at a floating rate of 2.5% over Freddie
Mac's Reference Bill. During the extension period, the loan may be paid in full
with no prepayment penalty.

During 2003, Fund I reduced its existing credit facility
from $125.0 million to $30.0 million.  All other material terms remain the same
for this facility. As of December 31, 2003, outstanding balance on this credit
facility was zero.

On December 15, 2003, Fund I obtained construction loans for the development
of two of its communities in the committed principal amount of $66.0 million,
with a variable interest rate of LIBOR plus 2%.  These loans mature in January
2007, with options to extend the maturity for up to two years thereafter. The
principal balance of these construction loans was $28.1 million on December 31,
2003.

Development Communities

At December 31, 2003 Fund I owned two development communities with an
aggregate of 480 multifamily units and an estimated total cost of $101.7
million, of which $37.4 million remains to be expended and approximately $8.0
million is expected to be funded by the Company through its capital commitments.

Redevelopment Communities

At December 31, 2003 Fund I had one redevelopment community, a 174 unit
apartment community with an estimated cost specifically related to the
redevelopment project of  $3.5 million, of which $1.6 million remains to be
expended and approximately $340,000 is the Company's commitment.

Offices and Employees

The Company is headquartered in Palo Alto, California, and has
regional offices in Woodland Hills, California; Newport Beach, California;
Tustin, California; San Diego, California; Seattle, Washington; and Portland,
Oregon. As of December 31, 2003, the Company had approximately 800 employees.


Environmental Matters

Under various federal, state and local laws, ordinances and
regulations, an owner or operator of real estate is liable for the costs of
removal or remediation of certain hazardous or toxic substances on, in or
migrating from such property. Such laws often impose liability without regard as
to whether the owner or operator knew of, or was responsible for, the presence
of such hazardous or toxic substances. The presence of such substances, or the
failure to properly remediate such substances, may adversely affect the owner's
or operator's ability to sell or rent such property or to borrow using such
property as collateral. Persons who arrange for the disposal or treatment of
hazardous or toxic substances or wastes also may be liable for the costs of
removal or remediation of such substances at the disposal or treatment facility
to which such substances or wastes were sent, whether or not such facility is
owned or operated by such person. In addition, certain environmental laws impose
liability for release of asbestos-containing materials ("ACMs") into
the air, and third parties may seek recovery from owners or operators of real
properties for personal injury associated with ACMs. In connection with the
ownership (direct or indirect), operation, management and development of real
properties, the Company could be considered an owner or operator of such
properties or as having arranged for the disposal or treatment of hazardous or
toxic substances and, therefore, may be potentially liable for removal or
remediation costs, as well as certain other costs, including governmental fines
and costs related to injuries of persons and property.

California has enacted legislation commonly referred to as "Proposition
65" requiring that "clear and reasonable" warnings be given to
consumers who are exposed to chemicals known to the State of California to cause
cancer or reproductive toxicity, including tobacco smoke. Although we have
sought to comply with Proposition 65 requirements, we cannot assure you that we
will not be adversely affected by litigation relating to Proposition 65.

Methane gas is a naturally-occurring gas that is commonly found below the
surface in several areas of California, particularly in the Southern California
coastal areas.  Methane is a non-toxic gas, but can be ignitable in
confined spaces when exposed to air.  Although naturally-occurring methane
gas is not regulated at the state or federal level, some local governments, such
as the County of Los Angeles, have imposed requirements that new buildings
install detection systems in areas where methane gas is known to be
located.  Methane gas is also associated with certain industrial
activities, such as former municipal waste landfills.

Recently there has been an increasing number of lawsuits against owners and
managers of multifamily properties other than Essex alleging personal injury and
property damage caused by the presence of mold in residential real estate. Some
of these lawsuits have resulted in substantial monetary judgments or
settlements. Essex has been sued for mold related matters and has settled or is
in the process of settling such matters. Insurance carriers have reacted to mold
related liability awards by excluding mold related claims from standard policies
and pricing mold endorsements at prohibitively high rates. We have adopted
programs designed to manage the existence of mold in our properties as well as
guidelines for promptly addressing and resolving reports of mold to minimize any
impact mold might have on residents or the property.

All of the Properties have been subjected to preliminary environmental
assessments, including a review of historical and public data ("Phase I
assessments"), by independent environmental consultants. Phase I
assessments generally consist of an investigation of environmental conditions at
the Property, including a preliminary investigation of the site, an
identification of publicly known conditions occurring at properties in the
vicinity of the site, an investigation as to the presence of polychlorinated
biphenyl's ("PCBs"), ACMs and above-ground and underground storage
tanks presently or formerly at the sites, and preparation and issuance of
written reports. As a result of information collected in the Phase I
assessments, certain of the Properties were subjected to additional
environmental investigations, including, in a some cases, soil sampling or
ground water analysis to further evaluate the environmental conditions of those
Properties.

The environmental studies revealed the presence of soil and groundwater
contamination and the presence of methane and associated gases at certain of the
Properties.  Based on its current knowledge, the Company does not believe the future
liabilities associated with the contamination or with the methane gas is material and is
not in receipt of any cleanup order from a regulatory agency.  Environmental studies also
indicate that one of the Properties is located on a former municipal landfill, which has been
closed for approximately eighty years.  To the Company's knowledge, the
property has not been subject to any regulatory requirements since it was
initially closed; however, state regulatory agencies have discretion to impose
various requirements on closed landfills, including monitoring for methane
gas.  Limited sampling has indicated there is no methane gas above
explosive limits at the property.  Based on its current knowledge, the
Company does not believe that any regulatory requirements or other liabilities
associated with this property are material.  The environmental studies have
also indicated that several properties contain ACM, a common building material
prior to the 1980s.  The ACM is found primarily in the ceiling textures,
floor tiles, and adhesives.  To the Company's knowledge, the ACM is in good
condition.  The Company has implemented an operations and maintenance plan
to inspect and monitor the ACM to ensure that the ACM remains in good condition
and is properly managed.  Based on the information contained in the
environmental studies, the Company believes that the costs, if any, it might
bear as a result of environmental contamination or other conditions at these
Properties would not have a material adverse affect on the Company's financial
condition, result of operations, or liquidity.  Certain Properties that have been
sold by the Company were identified as having potential groundwater
contamination. While the Company does not anticipate any losses or costs related
to groundwater contamination on Properties that have been sold, it is possible
that such losses or costs may materialize in the future.


Except with respect to three Properties, the Company has no indemnification
agreements from third parties for potential environmental clean-up costs at its
Properties. The Company has no way of determining at this time the magnitude of
any potential liability to which it may be subject arising out of unknown
environmental conditions or violations with respect to the properties formerly
owned by the Company. No assurance can be given that existing environmental
studies with respect to any of the Properties reveal all environmental
liabilities, that any prior owner or operator of a Property did not create any
material environmental condition not known to the Company, or that a material
environmental condition does not otherwise exist as to any one or more of the
Properties. The Company has limited insurance coverage for the types of
environmental liabilities described above.

Insurance

The Company carries comprehensive liability, fire, extended coverage
and rental loss insurance for each of the Properties. There are, however,
certain types of extraordinary losses for which the Company does not have
insurance. Substantially all of the Properties are located in areas that are
subject to earthquake activity. The Company has obtained earthquake insurance
for most the Properties. Most of the Properties are included in an earthquake
insurance program that is subject to an aggregate limit of $40.0 million payable
upon a covered loss in excess of a $7.5 million self-insured retention amount
and a 5% deductible. In the future, the Company may selectively exclude
properties from being covered by earthquake insurance based on management's
evaluation of the following factors: (i) the availability of coverage on terms
acceptable to the Company, (ii) the location of the property and the amount of
seismic activity affecting that region, and, (iii) the age of the property and
building codes in effect at the time of construction. Despite earthquake
coverage on most of the Company's Properties, should a property sustain damage
as a result of an earthquake, the Company may incur losses due to deductibles,
co-payments and losses in excess of applicable insurance, if any.

Although the Company carries certain insurance for non-earthquake damages to
its properties and liability insurance, the Company may still incur losses due
to uninsured risks, deductibles, co-payments or losses in excess of applicable
insurance coverage.

Competition

The Company's Properties compete for tenants with similar properties
primarily on the basis of location, rent charged, services provided, and the
design and condition of the improvements. Competition for tenants from competing
properties affects the amount of rent charged as well as rental growth rates,
vacancy rates, deposit amounts, and the services and features provided at each
property. While economic conditions are generally stable in the Company's target
markets, a prolonged economic downturn could have a material adverse effect on
the Company's financial position, results of operations or liquidity.

The Company also experiences competition when attempting to acquire
properties that meet its investment criteria. Such competing buyers include
domestic and foreign financial institutions, other REITs, life insurance
companies, pension funds, trust funds, partnerships and individual investors.

Working Capital

The Company expects to meet its short-term liquidity requirements by
using its working capital, cash generated from operations, and its amounts
available on lines of credit. The Company believes that its future net cash
flows and borrowing capacity will be adequate to meet operating requirements and
to provide for payment of dividends by the Company in accordance with REIT
qualification requirements. The Company has line of credit facilities in the
committed amount of approximately $275.0 million. At December 31, 2003 the
Company had an outstanding balance of $93.1 million under these line of credit
facilities.


Risk Factors

Our operations involve various risks that could have adverse consequences
to us. These risks include, among others, the following:

Debt Financing

At December 31, 2003, we had approximately $832.2 million of
indebtedness (including $168.4 million of variable rate indebtedness, of which
$75.3 million is subject to interest rate protection agreements).

We are subject to the risks normally associated with debt financing,
including the following:

cash flow may not be sufficient to meet required payments of principal and
interest;

inability to refinance existing indebtedness on encumbered properties;

the terms of any refinancing may not be as favorable as the terms of
existing indebtedness;

inability to comply with debt covenants which could cause an acceleration of
the maturity date; and

repaying debt before the scheduled maturity date could result in prepayment
penalties.

Uncertainty of Ability to Refinance Balloon Payments

At December 31, 2003, we had an aggregate of approximately $832.2
million of mortgage debt and line of credit borrowings, some of which are
subject to balloon payments of principal. We do not expect to have sufficient
cash flows from operations to make all of such balloon payments when due under
these mortgages and the line of credit borrowings.

At December 31, 2003, these mortgages and lines of credit borrowings had the
following scheduled maturity dates:

2004--$20.7 million (includes lines of credit balance of $12.5 million as of
December 31, 2003);

2005--$41.3 million

2006--$20.7 million;

2007--$63.5 million;

2008--$108.9 million;

2009 and thereafter--$577.1 million (includes lines of credit balance of
$80.6 million as of December 31, 2003).

We may not be able to refinance such mortgage indebtedness or lines of
credit. The properties subject to these mortgages could be foreclosed upon or
otherwise transferred to the mortgagee. This could cause us to lose income and
asset value. Alternatively, we may be required to refinance the debt at higher
interest rates. If we are unable to make such payments when due, a mortgage
lender could foreclose on the property securing the mortgage, which could have a
material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.


Economic Environment and Impact on Operating Results

Both the national economy and the economies of the western states in
which we own, manage and develop properties, some of which are concentrated in
high-tech sectors, have been and may continue to be in an economic downturn. The
impact of such downturn on our operating results can include, and are not
limited to, reduction in rental rates, occupancy levels, property valuations and
increases in operating costs such as advertising, turnover and repair and
maintenance expense.

Our property type and diverse geographic locations provide some degree of
risk moderation but we are not immune to a prolonged down cycle in the real
estate markets in which we operate. Although we believe we are well positioned
to meet the challenges ahead, it is possible that reductions in occupancy and
market rental rates will result in reduction of rental revenues, operating
income, cash flows, and the market value of our shares. Prolonged downturn
could also affect our ability to obtain financing at acceptable rates of
interest and to access funds from the disposition of properties at acceptable
prices.

Risk of Rising Interest Rates

At December 31, 2003, we had approximately $75.3 million of long-term
variable rate indebtedness bearing interest at a floating rate tied to the rate
of short-term tax-exempt revenue bonds (which matures at various dates from 2020
through 2032), and $93.1 million of variable rate indebtedness under our lines
of credit of which $12.5 million bearing interest at 1.10% over LIBOR and $80.6
million bearing interest at the Freddie Mac's Reference Rate plus 0.55% to
0.60%. The long-term variable rate indebtedness of approximately $75.3 million
is subject to an interest rate protection agreement, which may reduce the risks
associated with fluctuations in interest rates. The remaining $93.1 million of
long-term variable rate indebtedness is not subject to any interest rate
protection agreement, and consequently, an increase in interest rates may have
an adverse effect on our net income and results of operations.

Current interest rates are at historic lows and potentially could increase
rapidly to levels more in line with recent historic levels. The immediate effect
of significant and rapid interest rate increases would result in higher interest
expense on our variable rate indebtedness. The effect of prolonged interest rate
increases could negatively impact our ability to make acquisitions and develop
properties at economic returns on investment and our ability to refinance
existing borrowings at acceptable rates.

Risk of Inflation /Deflation

Substantial inflationary or deflationary pressures could have a negative
effect on rental rates and property operating expenses. The Company believes it
effectively manages its property and other expenses but understands that
substantial annual rates of inflation or deflation could adversely impact
operating results.

Risk of Losses on Interest Rate Hedging Arrangements

We have, from time to time, entered into agreements to reduce the
risks associated with increases in interest rates, and may continue to do so.
Although these agreements may partially protect against rising interest rates,
these agreements also may reduce the benefits to us when interest rates decline.
We cannot assure you that we can refinance any such hedging arrangements or that
we will be able to enter into other hedging arrangements to replace existing
ones if interest rates decline. Furthermore, interest rate movements during the
term of interest rate hedging arrangements may result in a gain or loss on our
investment in the hedging arrangement. In addition, if a hedging arrangement is
not indexed to the same rate as the indebtedness that is hedged, we may be
exposed to losses to the extent that the rate governing the indebtedness and the
rate governing the hedging arrangement change independently of each other.
Finally, nonperformance by the other party to the hedging arrangement may
subject us to increased credit risks. In order to minimize counterparty credit
risk, our policy is to enter into hedging arrangements only with large financial
institutions.


Acquisition Activities: Risks that Acquisitions Will Fail to Meet Expectations

We intend to continue to acquire multifamily residential properties.
There are risks that acquired properties will fail to perform as expected.
Estimates of future income, expenses and the costs of improvements necessary to
allow us to market an acquired property as originally intended may prove to be
inaccurate. In addition, we expect to finance future acquisitions, in whole or
in part, under various forms of secured or unsecured financing or through the
issuance of partnership units by the Operating Partnership or related
partnerships or additional equity by Essex. The use of equity financing, rather
than debt, for future developments or acquisitions could dilute the interest of
Essex's existing stockholders. If we finance new acquisitions under existing
lines of credit, there is a risk that, unless we obtain substitute financing,
Essex may not be able to secure further lines of credit for new development or
such lines of credit may be available only on disadvantageous terms.

Also, we may not be able to refinance our existing lines of credit upon
maturity, or the terms of such refinancing may not be as favorable as the terms
of the existing indebtedness. Further, acquisitions of properties are subject to
the general risks associated with real estate investments. For further
information regarding these risks, please see "Adverse Effect to Property
Income and Value Due to General Real Estate Investment Risks."

On December 17, 2002, we completed the acquisition of John M. Sachs, Inc., a
real estate company pursuant to which we acquired a real estate portfolio,
consisting primarily of apartment communities located in San Diego County,
California. The assets in this transaction were valued at approximately $301
million. This is our largest real estate portfolio acquisition to date. The
integration of these properties into Essex has placed a burden on our management
team and infrastructure. To date these properties have performed as expected. In
addition, as this transaction was structured as a merger, there is the risk that
we assumed unknown liabilities, which might adversely affect our results of
operations.

Risks that Development Activities Will Be Delayed, not Completed,
and/or Fail to Achieve Expected Results

We pursue multifamily residential property development projects from
time to time. Development projects generally require various governmental and
other approvals, which we cannot assure you that we will receive. Our
development activities generally entail certain risks, including the following:

funds may be expended and management's time devoted to projects that may not
be completed;

construction costs of a project may exceed original estimates possibly
making the project economically unfeasible;

development projects may be delayed due to, among other things, adverse
weather conditions;

occupancy rates and rents at a completed project may be less than
anticipated; and

expenses at a completed development may be higher than anticipated.

These risks may reduce the funds available for distribution to Essex's
stockholders. Further, the development of properties is also subject to the
general risks associated with real estate investments. For further information
regarding these risks, please see "Adverse Effect to Property Income and
Value Due to General Real Estate Investment Risks."

The Geographic Concentration of the Properties and Fluctuations in Local
Markets May Adversely Impact Our Financial Conditions and Results of
Operations

We derived significant amounts of rental revenues for the year ended
December 31, 2003 from properties concentrated in Southern California (Los
Angeles, Ventura, Orange and San Diego counties), Northern California (the San
Francisco Bay Area), and the Pacific Northwest (the Seattle, Washington and
Portland, Oregon metropolitan areas). As of December 31, 2003, of our 121
ownership interests in multifamily residential properties, 90 are located in
California. As a result of this geographic concentration, if a local property
market performs poorly, the income from the properties in that market could
decrease. As a result of such a decrease in income, we may be unable to pay
expected dividends to our stockholders. The performance of the economy in each
of these areas affects occupancy, market rental rates and expenses and,
consequently impacts the income generated from the properties and their
underlying values. The financial results of major local employers also may
impact the cash flow and value of certain of the properties. Economic downturns
in the local markets in which we own properties could have a negative impact on
our financial condition and results of operations.


Competition in the Multifamily Residential Market May Adversely Affect
Operations and the Rental Demand For Our Properties

There are numerous housing alternatives that compete with the
multifamily properties in attracting residents. These include other multifamily
rental apartments and single-family homes that are available for rent in the
markets in which the properties are located. The properties also compete for
residents with new and existing homes and condominiums that are for sale. If the
demand for our properties is reduced or if competitors develop and/or acquire
competing properties on a more cost-effective basis, rental rates may drop,
which may have a material adverse affect on our financial condition and results
of operations.

We also face competition from other real estate investment trusts, businesses
and other entities in the acquisition, development and operation of properties.
Some of the competitors are larger and have greater financial resources than we
do. This competition may result in increased costs of properties we acquire
and/or develop.

Debt Financing on Properties May Result in Insufficient Cash Flow

Where possible, we intend to continue to use leverage to increase the
rate of return on our investments and to provide for additional investments that
we could not otherwise make. There is a risk that the cash flow from the
properties will be insufficient to meet both debt payment obligations and the
distribution requirements of the real estate investment trust provisions of the
Internal Revenue Code. We may obtain additional debt financing in the future,
through mortgages on some or all of the properties. These mortgages may be
recourse, non-recourse, or cross-collateralized. As of December 31, 2003, Essex
had 55 of its 91 consolidated properties encumbered by debt. Of the 55
properties, 35 are secured by deeds of trust relating solely to those
properties, and with respect to the remaining 20 properties, 5 cross-
collateralized mortgages are secured by 8 properties, 4 properties, 3
properties, 3 properties and 2 properties, respectively. The holders of this
indebtedness will have a claim against these properties and to the extent
indebtedness is cross-collateralized, lenders may seek to foreclose upon
properties, which are not the primary collateral for their loan. This, in turn,
may accelerate other indebtedness secured by properties. Foreclosure of
properties would reduce our income and asset value.

Dividend Requirements as a Result Of Preferred Stock May Lead to a Possible
Inability to Sustain Dividends

In 1998 and 1999, the Operating Partnership issued $210 million in
aggregate of Series B Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Units (the "Series B
Preferred Units"), Series C Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Units, (the
"Series C Preferred Units"), Series D Cumulative Redeemable Preferred
Units (the "Series D Preferred Units") and Series E Cumulative
Redeemable Preferred Units (the "Series E Preferred Units"). In 2003
the Company redeemed the Series C Preferred Units and issued approximately $25
million of Series F Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock ("Series F
Preferred Stock"). The Series B Preferred Units, the Series D Preferred
Units, the Series E Preferred Units and the Series F Preferred Stock are
collectively referred to as the "Preferred Equity".

The terms of the Series F Preferred Stock and of the preferred stock into
which each series of Preferred Units are exchangeable provide for certain
cumulative preferential cash distributions per each share of preferred stock.
These terms also provide that while such preferred stock is outstanding, Essex
cannot authorize, declare, or pay any distributions on the Common Stock, unless
all distributions accumulated on all shares of such preferred stock have been
paid in full. The distributions payable on such preferred stock may impair
Essex's ability to pay dividends on its Common Stock.

If Essex wishes to issue any Common Stock in the future (including, upon
exercise of stock options), the funds required to continue to pay cash dividends
at current levels will be increased. Essex's ability to pay dividends will
depend largely upon the performance of the properties and other properties that
may be acquired in the future.


Essex's ability to pay dividends on its stock is further limited by the
Maryland General Corporation Law. Under the Maryland General Corporation Law,
Essex may not make a distribution on stock if, after giving effect to such
distribution, either:

we would not be able to pay its indebtedness as it becomes due in the usual
course of business; or

our total assets would be less than its total liabilities.

If Essex cannot pay dividends on its stock, Essex's status as a real estate
investment trust may be jeopardized.

Resale of Shares Pursuant to our Effective Registration Statement
May Have an Adverse Effect on the Market Price of the Shares

Pursuant to the acquisition of John M. Sachs, Inc., a real estate
company, in December 2002, we issued 2,719,875 shares of common stock, as
partial consideration for the acquisition, to the trusts that were the
shareholders of that company.  In connection with the acquisition, Essex entered
into a registration rights agreement with these trusts, pursuant to which in
January 2003 we filed a registration statement on Form S-3 in order to enable
the resale of these shares of common stock. In an amendment to this registration
statement filed in April 2003, we also registered, pursuant to certain
registration rights, 50,000 shares of common stock which are issuable to the
trusts in connection with certain contractual obligations and 2,270,490 shares
of common stock which are issuable upon exchange of limited partnership
interests in the Operating Partnership. These limited partnership interests are
held by senior members of our management, certain members of our Board of
Directors and certain outside investors, or the Operating Partnership holders,
and comprise approximately 9.2% of the limited partnership interests of the
Operating Partnership as of December 31, 2003. In addition, the Operating
Partnership has invested in certain real estate partnerships. In the 2003
registration statement, we also registered, pursuant to certain registration
rights, 1,473,125 shares of common stock, which are issuable upon redemption of
all of the limited partnership interests in such real estate partnerships. In
sum, this 2003 registration statement covers in aggregate 6,513,490 shares of
our common stock. The resale of the shares of common stock
pursuant to the registration statement may have an adverse effect on the market
price of our shares.

Our Chairman is Involved in Other Real Estate Activities and Investments,
Which May Lead to Conflicts of Interest

Our Chairman, George M. Marcus is not an employee of Essex. Mr.
Marcus owns interests in various other real estate-related businesses and
investments. He is the Chairman of The Marcus & Millichap Company, or MM,
which is the holding company for real estate brokerage and services companies.
MM has an interest in Pacific Property Company, a company that invests in West
Coast multifamily residential properties. In 1999 we sold an office building to
MM, which Essex previously occupied.

Mr. Marcus has agreed not to divulge any information that may be received by
him in his capacity as Chairman of Essex to any of his affiliated companies and
that he will absent himself from any and all discussions by the Essex Board of
Directors regarding any proposed acquisition and/or development of a multifamily
property where it appears that there may be a conflict of interest with any of
his affiliated companies.  Notwithstanding this agreement, Mr. Marcus and
his affiliated entities may potentially compete with us in acquiring and/or
developing multifamily properties, which competition may be detrimental to us.
In addition, due to such potential competition for real estate investments, Mr.
Marcus and his affiliated entities may have a conflict of interest with us,
which may be detrimental to the interests of Essex's stockholders.

The Influence of Executive Officers, Directors and Significant Stockholders
May Be Detrimental to Holders of Common Stock

As of December 31, 2003, George M. Marcus, the Chairman of our Board
of Directors, wholly or partially owned 1,746,282 shares of common stock
(including shares issuable upon exchange of limited partnership interests in the
Operating Partnership and certain other partnerships and assuming exercise of
all vested options). This represents approximately 7.7% of the outstanding
shares of common stock. Mr. Marcus currently does not have majority control over
us. However, he currently has, and likely will continue to have, significant
influence with respect to the election of directors and approval or disapproval
of significant corporate actions. Consequently, his influence could result in
decisions that do not reflect the interests of all our stockholders.


Under the partnership agreement of the Operating Partnership, the consent of
the holders of limited partnership interests is generally required for any
amendment of the agreement and for certain extraordinary actions. Through their
ownership of limited partnership interests and their positions with us, our
directors and executive officers, including Mr. Marcus and Mr. William A.
Millichap, a director of Essex, have substantial influence on us. Consequently,
their influence could result in decisions that do not reflect the interests of
all stockholders.

Further pursuant to our acquisition of John M. Sachs, Inc. in December 2002,
we issued, as partial consideration for the acquisition, 2,719,875 shares of our
common stock and an additional 35,860 shares of common stock in July 2003 to the
trusts that were the shareholders of that company. As a result of this issuance,
these trusts own, as of December 31, 2003, in aggregate, approximately 8% of our
outstanding common stock. Pursuant to their ownership interest in Essex, these
trusts may have significant influence over us. Such influence could result in
decisions that do not reflect the interest of all our stockholders.

The Voting Rights of Preferred Stock May Allow Holders of Preferred Stock to
Impede Actions that Otherwise Benefit Holders of Common Stock

In general, the holders of Series F Preferred stock and of the
preferred stock into which our preferred units are exchangeable do not have any
voting rights. However, if full distributions are not made on any outstanding
preferred stock for six quarterly distributions periods, the holders of
preferred stock who have not received distributions, voting together as a single
class, will have the right to elect two additional directors to serve on Essex's
Board of Directors. These voting rights continue until all distributions in
arrears and distributions for the current quarterly period on the preferred
stock have been paid in full. At that time, the holders of the preferred stock
are divested of these voting rights, and the term and office of the directors so
elected immediately terminates.

In addition, while any shares of Series F Preferred Stock or shares of preferred stock
into which the preferred units are exchangeable are outstanding, Essex may not
without the consent of the holders of two-thirds of the outstanding shares of
each series of preferred stock, each voting separately as a single class:

authorize or create any class of series of stock that ranks senior
to such preferred stock with respect to the payment of dividends, rights upon
liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of our business;

amend, alter or repeal the provisions of Essex's Charter or Bylaws, that
would materially and adversely affect the rights of such preferred stock; or

in the case of the preferred stock into which our preferred units are
exchangeable, merge or consolidate with another entity or transfer substantially
all of its assets to another entity, except if such preferred stock remains
outstanding with the surviving entity and has the same terms and except in
certain other circumstances.

These voting rights of the preferred stock may allow holders of preferred
stock to impede or veto actions that would otherwise benefit the holders of
Essex's Common Stock.

The Redemption Rights of the Series B Preferred Units, Series D Preferred
Units and Series F Preferred Stock may be Detrimental to Holders of Common
Stock

Upon the occurrence of one of the following events, the terms of the
Operating Partnership's Series B and D Preferred Units require it to redeem all
of such units and the terms of the Company's Series F Preferred Stock provide
the holders of the majority of the outstanding Series F Preferred Stock the
right to require the Company to redeem all of such stock:

the Company completes a "going private" transaction
and its common stock is no longer registered under the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934, as amended:


the Company completes a consolidation or merger or sale of substantially all
of its assets and the surviving entity's debt securities do not possess an
investment grade rating; or

the Company fails to qualify as a REIT

The aggregate redemption price of the Series B Preferred Units would be $80
million, the aggregate redemption price of the Series D Preferred Units would be
$50 million and the aggregate redemption price of the Series F Preferred Stock
would be $25 million, plus, in each case, any accumulated distributions.

These redemption rights may discourage or impede transactions that might
otherwise be in the interest of holders of common stock. Further, these
redemption rights might trigger in situations where the Company needs to
conserve its cash reserves, in which event such redemption might adversely
affect the Company and its common holders.

Maryland Business Combination Law May Not Allow Certain Transactions
Between us and Affiliates to Proceed Without Compliance with Such Law

The Maryland General Corporation Law establishes special requirements
for "business combinations" between a Maryland corporation and
"interested stockholders" unless exemptions are applicable. An
interested stockholder is any person who beneficially owns ten percent or more
of the voting power of the then-outstanding voting stock.

The law also requires a supermajority stockholder vote for such transactions.
This means that the transaction must be approved by at least:

80% of the votes entitled to be cast by holders of outstanding voting
shares; and

66% of the votes entitled to be cast by holders of outstanding voting shares
other than shares held by the interested stockholder with whom the business
combination is to be effected.

However, as permitted by the statute, the Board of Directors of Essex
irrevocably has elected to exempt any business combination by us, George M.
Marcus, William A. Millichap, who are the chairman and a director of Essex,
respectively, and MM or any entity owned or controlled by Messrs. Marcus and
Millichap and MM. Consequently, the super-majority vote requirement described
above will not apply to any business combination between us and Mr. Marcus, Mr.
Millichap, or MM. As a result, we may in the future enter into business
combinations with Messrs. Marcus and Millichap and MM, without compliance with
the super-majority vote requirements and other provisions of the Maryland
General Corporation Law.

Anti-Takeover Provisions Contained in the Operating Partnership Agreement,
Charter, Bylaws, and Certain Provisions of Maryland Law Could Delay, Defer or
Prevent a Change in Control

While Essex is the sole general partner of the Operating Partnership,
and generally has full and exclusive responsibility and discretion in the
management and control of the Operating Partnership, certain provisions of the
Operating Partnership's partnership agreement place limitations on Essex's
ability to act with respect to the Operating Partnership. Such limitations could
delay, defer or prevent a transaction or a change in control that might involve
a premium price for our stock or otherwise be in the best interest of the
stockholders or that could otherwise adversely affect the interest of Essex's
stockholders. The partnership agreement provides that if the limited partners
own at least 5% of the outstanding units of limited partnership interest in the
Operating Partnership, Essex cannot, without first obtaining the consent of a
majority-in-interest of the limited partners in the Operating Partnership,
transfer all or any portion of our general partner interest in the Operating
Partnership to another entity. Such limitations on Essex's ability to act may
result in our being precluded from taking action that the Board of Directors
believes is in the best interests of Essex's stockholders. In addition, as of
December 31, 2003, one individual, George M. Marcus, held or controlled more than 50% of the
outstanding units of limited partnership interest in the Operating Partnership,
allowing such actions to be blocked by a small number of limited partners.


Essex's Charter authorizes the issuance of additional shares of common stock
or preferred stock and the setting of the preferences, rights and other terms of
such preferred stock without the approval of the holders of the common stock. We
may establish one or more series of preferred stock that could delay, defer or
prevent a transaction or a change in control. Such a transaction might involve a
premium price for our stock or otherwise be in the best interests of the holders
of common stock. Also, such a class of preferred stock could have dividend,
voting or other rights that could adversely affect the interest of holders of
common stock.

Essex's Charter, as well as Essex's stockholder rights plan, also contains
other provisions that may delay, defer or prevent a transaction or a change in
control that might be in the best interest of Essex's stockholders. Essex's
stockholder rights plan is designed, among other things, to prevent a person or
group from gaining control of us without offering a fair price to all of Essex's
stockholders. Also, the Bylaws may be amended by the Board of Directors to
include provisions that would have a similar effect, although Essex presently
has no such intention. The Charter contains ownership provisions limiting the
transferability and ownership of shares of capital stock, which may have the
effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a transaction or a change in
control. For example, subject to receiving an exemption from the Board of
Directors, potential acquirers may not purchase more than 6% in value of the
stock (other than qualified pension trusts which can acquire 9.9%). This may
discourage tender offers that may be attractive to the holders of common stock
and limit the opportunity for stockholders to receive a premium for their shares
of common stock.

In addition, the Maryland General Corporations Law restricts the voting
rights of shares deemed to be "control shares." Under the Maryland
General Corporations Law, "control shares" are those which, when
aggregated with any other shares held by the acquirer, entitle the acquirer to
exercise voting power within specified ranges. Although the Bylaws exempt Essex
from the control share provisions of the Maryland General Corporations Law, the
Board of Directors may amend or eliminate the provisions of the Bylaws at any
time in the future. Moreover, any such amendment or elimination of such
provision of the Bylaws may result in the application of the control share
provisions of the Maryland General Corporations Law not only to control shares
which may be acquired in the future, but also to control shares previously
acquired. If the provisions of the Bylaws are amended or eliminated, the control
share provisions of the Maryland General Corporations Law could delay, defer or
prevent a transaction or change in control that might involve a premium price
for the stock or otherwise be in the best interests of Essex's stockholders.

Bond Compliance Requirements May Limit Income From Certain Properties

At December 31, 2003, we had approximately $75.3 million of variable
rate tax-exempt financing relating to the Inglenook Court Apartments, Wandering
Creek Apartments, Treetops Apartments, Huntington Breakers Apartments, Camarillo
Oaks Apartments and Parker Ranch Apartments and $15.9 million of fixed rate tax-
exempt financing related to Meadowood Apartments. This tax-exempt financing
subjects these properties to certain deed restrictions and restrictive
covenants. We expect to engage in tax-exempt financings in the future. In
addition, the Internal Revenue Code and rules and regulations thereunder impose
various restrictions, conditions and requirements excluding interest on
qualified bond obligations from gross income for federal income tax purposes.
The Internal Revenue Code also requires that at least 20% of apartment units be
made available to residents with gross incomes that do not exceed 50% of the
median income for the applicable family size as determined by the Housing and
Urban Development Department of the federal government. In addition to federal
requirements, certain state and local authorities may impose additional rental
restrictions. These restrictions may limit income from the tax-exempt financed
properties if we are required to lower rental rates to attract residents who
satisfy the median income test. If Essex does not reserve the required number of
apartment homes for residents satisfying these income requirements, the tax-
exempt status of the bonds may be terminated, the obligations under the bond
documents may be accelerated and we may be subject to additional contractual
liability.

Adverse Effect To Property Income And Value Due To General Real Estate
Investment Risks

Real property investments are subject to a variety of risks. The
yields available from equity investments in real estate depend on the amount of
income generated and expenses incurred. If the properties do not generate
sufficient income to meet operating expenses, including debt service and capital
expenditures, cash flow and the ability to make distributions to stockholders will
be adversely affected. The performance of the economy in each of the areas in
which the properties are located affects occupancy, market rental rates and
expenses.


Consequently, the income from the properties and their underlying values may
be impacted. The financial results of major local employers may have an impact
on the cash flow and value of certain of the properties as well.

Income from the properties may be further adversely affected by, among other
things, the following factors:

the general economic climate;

local economic conditions in which the properties are located, such as
oversupply of housing or a reduction in demand for rental housing;

the attractiveness of the properties to tenants;

competition from other available space;

Essex's ability to provide for adequate maintenance and insurance; and

increased operating expenses.

Also, as leases on the properties expire, tenants may enter into new leases
on terms that are less favorable to us. Income and real estate values also may
be adversely affected by such factors as applicable laws (e.g., the Americans
With Disabilities Act of 1990 and tax laws), interest rate levels and the
availability and terms of financing. In addition, real estate investments are
relatively illiquid and, therefore, our ability to vary our portfolio promptly
in response to changes in economic or other conditions may be quite limited.

Essex's Joint Ventures and Joint Ownership of Properties and Partial
Interests in Corporations and Limited Partnerships Could Limit Essex's Ability
to Control Such Properties and Partial Interests

Instead of purchasing properties directly, we have invested and may
continue to invest as a co-venturer. Joint venturers often have shared control
over the operation of the joint venture assets. Therefore, it is possible that
the co-venturer in an investment might become bankrupt, or have economic or
business interests or goals that are inconsistent with our business interests or
goals, or be in a position to take action contrary to our instructions or
requests, or our policies or objectives. Consequently, a co-venturer's actions
might subject property owned by the joint venture to additional risk. Although
we seek to maintain sufficient influence of any joint venture to achieve its
objectives, we may be unable to take action without our joint venture partners'
approval, or joint venture partners could take actions binding on the joint
venture without consent. Additionally, should a joint venture partner become
bankrupt, we could become liable for such partner's share of joint venture
liabilities.

From time to time, we, through the Operating Partnership, invest in
corporations, limited partnerships, limited liability companies or other
entities that have been formed for the purpose of acquiring, developing or
managing real property. In certain circumstances, the Operating Partnership's
interest in a particular entity may be less than a majority of the outstanding
voting interests of that entity. Therefore, the Operating Partnership's ability
to control the daily operations of such an entity may be limited. Furthermore,
the Operating Partnership may not have the power to remove a majority of the
board of directors (in the case of a corporation) or the general partner or
partners (in the case of a limited partnership) of such an entity in the event
that its operations conflict with the Operating Partnership's objectives. In
addition, the Operating Partnership may not be able to dispose of its interests
in such an entity. In the event that such an entity becomes insolvent, the
Operating Partnership may lose up to its entire investment in and any advances
to the entity. In addition, we have and in the future may enter into
transactions that could require us to pay the tax liabilities of partners, which
contribute assets into joint ventures or the Operating Partnership, in the event
that certain taxable events, which are within our control, occur. Although we
plan to hold the contributed assets or defer recognition of gain on their sale
pursuant to the like-kind exchange rules under Section 1031 of the Internal
Revenue Code we can provide no assurance that we will be able to do so and if
such tax liabilities were incurred they can expect to have a material impact on
our financial position.

Dedicated Investment Activities and Other Factors Specifically Related to
Essex Apartment Value Fund, L.P.

In 2001, we organized an investment fund, Essex Apartment Value Fund,
L.P., or Fund I, which will be, subject to specific exceptions, our exclusive
investment vehicle for new investment until at least 90% of Fund I's committed
capital has been invested or committed for investments, or if earlier, December
31, 2003. Currently Fund I is considered fully invested based on its
acquisitions to date and anticipated development and redevelopment expenditures.
We are committed to invest 21.4% of the aggregate capital committed to Fund I.
The Company is in the process of forming a second Essex Apartment Value Fund
("Fund II"), which is expected to be similar to Fund I in size and
structure.  Essex anticipates an initial closing of Fund II during the second
quarter of 2004, which would result in a final $50 million capital commitment by a
subsidiary of the Company. These Funds involves risks to us such as the following: our
partners in the Funds might become bankrupt (in which event we might become
generally liable for the liabilities of Fund I and/or Fund II), have economic or
business interests or goals that are inconsistent with our business interests or
goals, fail to fund capital commitments as contractually required, or fail to
approve decisions regarding the Funds that are in our best interest. We will,
however, generally seek to maintain sufficient influence over the Funds to
permit it to achieve its business objectives.


Investments In Mortgages And Other Real Estate Securities

We may invest in securities related to real estate, which could
adversely affect our ability to make distributions to stockholders. We may
purchase securities issued by entities, which own real estate and may also
invest in mortgages or unsecured debt obligations. These mortgages may be first,
second or third mortgages that may or may not be insured or otherwise
guaranteed. In general, investments in mortgages include the following risks:

that the value of mortgaged property may be less than the amounts owed,
causing realized or unrealized losses;

the borrower may not pay indebtedness under the mortgage when due, requiring
us to foreclose, and the amount recovered in connection with the foreclosure may
be less than the amount owed;

that interest rates payable on the mortgages may be lower than our cost of
funds; and

in the case of junior mortgages, that foreclosure of a senior mortgage would
eliminate the junior mortgage.

If any of the above were to occur, cash flows from operations and our ability
to make expected dividends to stockholders could be adversely affected.

Possible Environmental Liabilities

Investments in real property create a potential for environmental
liabilities on the part of the owner of such real property. We carry certain
limited insurance coverage for this type of environmental risk. We have
conducted environmental studies which revealed the presence of groundwater
contamination at certain properties. Such contamination at certain of these
properties was reported to have migrated on-site from adjacent industrial
manufacturing operations. The former industrial users of the properties were
identified as the source of contamination. The environmental studies noted that
certain properties are located adjacent to any possible down gradient from sites
with known groundwater contamination, the lateral limits of which may extend
onto such properties. The environmental studies also noted that at certain of
these properties, contamination existed because of the presence of underground
fuel storage tanks, which have been removed. In general, in connection with the
ownership, operation, financing, management and development of real properties,
we may be potentially liable for removal or clean-up costs, as well as certain
other costs and environmental liabilities. We may also be subject to
governmental fines and costs related to injuries to persons and property.

Recently there has been an increasing number of lawsuits against owners and
managers of multifamily properties other than Essex alleging personal injury and
property damage caused by the presence of mold in residential real estate. Some
of these lawsuits have resulted in substantial monetary judgments or
settlements. Essex has been sued for mold related matters and has settled or is
in the process of settling such matters. Insurance carriers have reacted to mold
related liability awards by excluding mold related claims from standard policies
and pricing mold endorsements at prohibitively high rates. We have adopted
programs designed to manage the existence of mold in our properties as well as
guidelines for promptly addressing and resolving reports of mold to minimize any
impact mold might have on residents or the property.

California has enacted legislation commonly referred to as "Proposition
65" requiring that "clear and reasonable" warnings be given to
consumers who are exposed to chemicals known to the State of California to cause
cancer or reproductive toxicity, including tobacco smoke. Although we have
sought to comply with Proposition 65 requirements, we cannot assure you that we
will not be adversely affected by litigation relating to Proposition 65.

Except with respect to three Properties, the Company has no indemnification
agreements from third parties for potential environmental clean-up costs at its
Properties. The Company has no way of determining at this time the magnitude of
any potential liability to which it may be subject arising out of unknown
environmental conditions or violations with respect to the properties formerly
owned by the Company. No assurance can be given that existing environmental
studies with respect to any of the Properties reveal all environmental
liabilities, that any prior owner or operator of a Property did not create any
material environmental condition not known to the Company, or that a material
environmental condition does not otherwise exist as to any one or more of the
Properties. The Company has limited insurance coverage for the types of
environmental liabilities described above.


General Uninsured Losses

We carry comprehensive liability, fire, extended coverage and rental
loss insurance for each of the properties. There are, however, certain types of
extraordinary losses for which we may not have sufficient insurance. Certain of
the properties are located in areas that are subject to earthquake activity. We
have obtained certain limited earthquake insurance coverage. We may sustain
losses due to insurance deductibles, co-payments on insured losses or uninsured
losses, or losses in excess of applicable coverage.

Changes In Real Estate Tax And Other Laws

Generally we do not directly pass through costs resulting from
changes in real estate tax laws to residential property tenants. We also do not
generally pass through increases in income, service or other taxes, to tenants
under leases. These costs may adversely affect funds from operations and the
ability to make distributions to stockholders. Similarly, compliance with
changes in (i) laws increasing the potential liability for environmental
conditions existing on properties or the restrictions on discharges or other
conditions or (ii) rent control or rent stabilization laws or other laws
regulating housing may result in significant unanticipated expenditures, which
would adversely affect funds from operations and the ability to make
distributions to stockholders. In addition, recent changes to the U.S. federal
income tax law may adversely affect us and other REITs by reducing the demand
for REIT stocks generally.

Changes In Financing Policy; No Limitation On Debt

We have adopted a policy of maintaining a debt-to-total-market-
capitalization ratio of less than 50%. The calculation of debt-to-total-market-
capitalization is as follows: total property indebtedness divided by the sum of
total property indebtedness plus total equity market capitalization.

As used in the above formula, total equity market capitalization is equal to
the aggregate market value of the outstanding shares of common stock (based on
the greater of current market price or the gross proceeds per share from public
offerings of the outstanding shares plus any undistributed net cash flow),
assuming the conversion of all limited partnership interests in the Operating
Partnership into shares of common stock and the gross proceeds of the preferred
units of the Operating Partnership. Based on this calculation (including the
current market price and excluding undistributed net cash flow), our debt-to-
total-market-capitalization ratio was approximately 31.2% as of December 31, 2003.

Our organizational documents do not limit the amount or percentage of
indebtedness that may be incurred. Accordingly, the Board of Directors of Essex
could change current policies and the policies of the Operating Partnership
regarding indebtedness. If we changed these policies, we could incur more debt,
resulting in an increased risk of default on our obligations and the obligations
of the Operating Partnership, and an increase in debt service requirements that
could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. Such
increased debt could exceed the underlying value of the properties.


Failure To Qualify As A REIT

We have elected to be taxed as a REIT under the Internal Revenue
Code. However, we cannot assure you that we have qualified as a REIT or that we
will continue to so qualify in the future. To qualify as a REIT, we must satisfy
numerous requirements (some on an annual and quarterly basis) established under
highly technical and complex Internal Revenue Code provisions. Only limited
judicial or administrative interpretation exists for these provisions and
involves the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not
entirely within our control. In addition, future legislation, new regulations,
administrative interpretations or court decisions may apply to us, potentially
with retroactive effect, and adversely affect our ability to qualify as a REIT.
We may receive significant non-qualifying income or acquire non-qualifying
assets, which as a result, may cause us to approach the income and assets test
limits imposed by the Internal Revenue Code. There is a risk that we may not
satisfy these tests. If we fail to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, we
would be subject to federal income tax on our taxable income at corporate rates.
We also may be disqualified from treatment as a REIT for the four taxable years
following the year in which we failed to qualify. This would reduce our net
earnings available for investment or distribution to stockholders because of the
additional tax liability. Even if we continue to qualify as a REIT, we will
continue to be subject to certain federal, state and local taxes on our income
and property.

Other Matters

Certain Policies of the Company

The Company intends to continue to operate in a manner that will not
subject it to regulation under the Investment Company Act of 1940. The Company
has in the past five years and may in the future (i) issue securities senior to
its Common Stock, (ii) fund acquisition activities with borrowings under its
line of credit and (iii) offer shares of Common Stock and/or units of limited
partnership interest in the Operating Partnership or affiliated partnerships as
partial consideration for property acquisitions. The Company from time to time
acquires partnership interests in partnerships and joint ventures, either
directly or indirectly through subsidiaries of the Company, when such entities'
underlying assets are real estate. In general, the Company does not (i)
underwrite securities of other issuers or (ii) actively trade in loans or other
investments.

The Company primarily invests in multifamily properties in Southern
California (Los Angeles, Ventura, Orange and San Diego counties), Northern
California (the San Francisco Bay Area), and the Pacific Northwest (the Seattle,
Washington and Portland, Oregon metropolitan areas). The Company currently
intends to continue to invest in multifamily properties in such regions, but may
change such policy without a vote of the stockholders. In connection with the
Sachs' portfolio acquisition in December 2002, the Company has acquired two
properties in Nevada and one property in Texas.

The policies discussed above may be reviewed and modified from time to time
by the Board of Directors without the vote of the stockholders.

Item 2. Properties

The Company's property portfolio as of December 31, 2003 (including
partial ownership interests) consists of ownership interests in 121 multifamily
properties (comprising 26,012 apartment units), of which 14,943 units are
located in Southern California (Los Angeles, Ventura, Orange and San Diego
counties), 4,605 units are located in Northern California (the San Francisco Bay
Area), 5,886 of which are located in the Pacific Northwest (4,515 units in the
Seattle metropolitan area and 1,371 units in the Portland, Oregon metropolitan
area), and 578 are located in other areas (302 units in Houston, Texas and 276
units in Hemet, California). In addition, the Company owns other real estate
assets consisting of five recreational vehicle parks (comprising 1,717 spaces),
four office buildings (totaling approximately 63,540 square feet) and two
manufactured housing communities (containing 607 sites).  One office building,
which is located in Northern California (Palo Alto), has approximately 17,400
square feet and houses the Company's headquarters. Another office building,
located in Southern California (Woodland Hills), has approximately 38,940 square
feet, of which the Company currently occupies approximately 8,600 square feet.
The Woodland Hills office building has nine third party tenants occupying
approximately 27,300 feet. The Company along with its affiliated entities and
joint ventures also have entered into commitments for the development of 1,056
units in five multifamily communities; two of which are in Northern California
and three in Southern California.  See "Development" in Item 1 of this
Annual Report on Form 10-K for a list of our properties under development.

The Company's multifamily properties accounted for 95% of the Company's
property revenues for the year ended December 31, 2003.


Occupancy Rates

The 121 multifamily residential properties had an average
occupancy, based on "financial occupancy," during the year ended
December 31, 2003, of approximately 96%. With respect to stabilized multifamily
properties with sufficient operating history, occupancy figures are based on
financial occupancy, which is defined as the percentage resulting from dividing
actual rental revenue by total possible rental revenue. Actual rental revenue
represents contractual revenue pursuant to leases without considering
delinquency and concessions. Total possible rental revenue represents the value
of all apartment units, with occupied units valued at contractual rental rates
pursuant to leases and vacant units valued at estimated market rents. We believe
that financial occupancy is a meaningful measure of occupancy because it
considers the value of each vacant unit at its estimated market rate. Financial
occupancy may not completely reflect short-term trends in physical occupancy and
financial occupancy rates as disclosed by other REITs may not be comparable to
our calculation of financial occupancy.

As of December 31, 2003, the headquarters building was 100% occupied by the
Company and the Southern California office building was 92% occupied, based on
physical occupancy. With respect to office buildings, occupancy figures are
based on "physical occupancy" which refers to the percentage resulting
from dividing leased and occupied square footage by rentable square footage.
With respect to recreational vehicle parks, manufactured housing communities, or
multifamily properties which have not yet stabilized or have insufficient
operating history, occupancy figures are based on "physical occupancy"
which refers to the percentage resulting from dividing leased and occupied units
by rentable units.

For the year ended December 31, 2003, none of the Company's Properties had
book values equal to 10% or more of total assets of the Company or gross
revenues equal to 10% or more of aggregate gross revenues of the Company.

Multifamily Residential Properties

The Company's multifamily Properties are generally suburban garden
apartments and townhomes comprising multiple clusters of two and three story
buildings situated on three to fifteen acres of land. The multifamily properties
have on average 215 units, with a mix of studio, one, two and some three-bedroom
units. A wide variety of amenities are available at each apartment community,
including covered parking, fireplaces, swimming pools, clubhouses with complete
fitness facilities, volleyball and playground areas and tennis courts.

The Company selects, trains and supervises a full team of on-site service and
maintenance personnel. The Company believes that its customer service approach
enhances its ability to retain tenants and that its multifamily Properties were
built well and have been maintained well since acquisition.

Office Buildings

The Company's corporate headquarters is located in a two-story office
building with approximately 17,400 square feet located at 925 East Meadow Drive,
Palo Alto, California. The Company acquired this property in 1997. The Company
also owns an office building in Southern California (Woodland Hills), comprised
of approximately 38,940 square feet building, of which the Company currently
occupies approximately 8,600 square feet. The building has nine third party
tenants occupying approximately 28,700 feet. The largest single tenant occupies
approximately 10,900 square feet. The Company acquired this property in 2001.
The Company also has two small office buildings comprising approximately 7,200
square feet that are located in San Diego, California.

Recreational Vehicle Parks

The Company owns five recreational vehicle parks, acquired in the
Company's December 2002 acquisition of the Sachs Corporation, (comprising of
1,717 spaces) located in El Cajon, California; Hemet, California; and Las Vegas
Nevada.


Manufactured Housing Communities

The Company owns manufactured housing communities, acquired in the
Company's December 2002 acquisition of the Sachs Corporation,  (containing 607
sites) located in Vista, California and Las Vegas, Nevada.

During the fourth quarter of 2003, the Company entered into lease and
purchase option agreements with unrelated third parties related to its five
recreational vehicle parks that are comprised of 1,717 spaces, and two
manufactured housing communities that contain 607 sites.  Based on the
agreements, the unrelated third parties have an option to purchase the assets in
approximately four years for approximately $41.7 million - a 5% premium to the
gross book value of the assets.  Under the lease agreements Essex is to receive a
fixed monthly lease payment in addition to a non-refundable upfront payment that
will be amortized over approximately five years (the life of the lease).  The
following tables describe the Company's Properties as of December 31, 2003. The
first table describes the Company's multifamily residential properties and the
second table describes the Company's other real estate assets.

(1)	Unless otherwise specified, the Company has a 100% ownership
interest in each Property.

(2)	For multifamily residential properties, occupancy rates
are based on financial occupancy for the year ended December 31, 2003; for the
office buildings, recreational vehicle parks, manufactured housing communities
or properties which have not yet stabilized or have insufficient operating
history, occupancy rates are based on physical occupancy as of December 31,
2003. For an explanation of how financial occupancy and physical occupancy are
calculated, see "Properties-Occupancy Rates" in this Item 2.

(3)	The Company has a 30% special limited partnership interest in this
property, which owns this multifamily property. This investment was made under
arrangements whereby EMC became the general partner and the existing partners
were granted the right to require the applicable partnership to redeem their
interest for cash. Subject to certain conditions, the Company may, however,
elect to deliver an equivalent number of shares of the Company's Common Stock in
satisfaction of the applicable partnership's cash redemption obligation. The
Company accounts for this property under the equity method of accounting.

(4)	The property is subject to a ground lease, which, unless extended,
will expire in 2082.

(5)	The Company owns the land and has entered into a leasehold interest.
The leasehold interest entitles the Company to receive a monthly payment for the
34-year term of the land lease. The Company may be required to sell its interest
in the property anytime following the seventh anniversary of the leasehold date
which was created in 2002.

(6)	This property is owned by Fund I. The Company has a 21.4% interest in Fund I and
is accounted for using the equity method of accounting.

Return of Capital

Under provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended,
the portion of the cash dividend, if any, that exceeds earnings and profits is
considered a return of capital. The return of capital is generated due to a
variety of factors, including the deduction of non-cash expenses, primarily
depreciation, in the determination of earnings and profits.

The status of the cash dividends distributed for the years ended December 31,
2003, 2002 and 2001 for tax purposes is as follows:

2003      2002      2001

Future distributions by the Company will be at the discretion of the Board of
Directors and will depend on the actual funds from operations of the Company,
its financial condition, capital requirements, the annual distribution
requirements under the REIT provisions of the Internal Revenue Code, applicable
legal restrictions and such other factors as the Board of Directors deems
relevant. There are currently no contractual restrictions on the Company's
present or future ability to pay dividends.

Dividend Reinvestment and Share Purchase Plan

The Company has adopted a dividend reinvestment and share purchase
plan designed to provide holders of Common Stock with a convenient and
economical means to reinvest all or a portion of their cash dividends in shares
of Common Stock and to acquire additional shares of Common Stock through
voluntary purchases. Computershare, LLC, which serves as the Company's transfer
agent, administers the dividend reinvestment and share purchase plan. For a copy
of the plan, contact Computershare, LLC at (312) 360-5354.

Stockholder Rights Plan

In 1998, the Company adopted a stockholder rights plan that is
designed to enhance the ability of all of the Company's stockholders to realize
the long-term value of their investment. The rights plan is designed, in part,
to prevent a person or group from gaining control of the Company without
offering a fair price to all of the Company's stockholders.

On October 13, 1998, the Board declared a one for one preferred share
purchase right (a "Right") for each outstanding share of Common Stock.
Each Right entitles the registered holder to purchase from the Company one one-
hundredth of a share of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock, par value
$.0001 per share, of the Company, at a price of $99.13 per one-hundredth of a
share, subject to adjustment. The description and terms of the Rights are set
forth in a Rights Agreement dated as of November 11, 1998, as amended between
the Company and Computershare, LLC as Rights Agent.

(1) 	Interest coverage ratio represents earnings before minority interest,
gain on sales of real estate, interest expense, taxes, depreciation and
amortization ("EBITDA") divided by interest expense. The Company believes that
in addition to net income, Funds from Operations and cash flows, the interest coverage
ratio is a useful financial performance measurement of an equity REIT because, together with
net income, Funds from Operations and cash flows, the interest coverage ratio provides investors
with an additional measure to evaluate a REIT's ability to incur and service debt and to fund
acquisitions and other capital expenditures. To evaluate EBITDA and the trends it depicts, the
components of EBITDA, such as rental revenues, rental expenses, real estate taxes and general
and administrative expenses, should be considered. Excluded form EBITDA are financing costs
such as interest as well as depreciation and amortization, each of which can significantly
affect a REIT's results of operations and liquidity and should be considered in evaluating
a REIT's operating performance.  Further, EBITDA does not represent net income or cash flows
from operating, financing and investing activities as defined by generally accepted
accounting principles and does not necessarily indicate that cash flows will be sufficient
to fund all of our cash needs. It should not be considered as an alternative to net income as
an indicator of our operating performance or as an alternative to cash flows as a measure
of liquidity. Further, EBITDA as disclosed by other REITs may not be comparable to our
calculation of EBITDA.

The following table reconciles net income from continuing operations before gain on sale
of real estate, minority interest, and discontinued operations to EBITDA for the periods
presented:

Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations

The following discussion is based on the consolidated financial
statements of Essex Property Trust, Inc. ("Essex" or the
"Company") as of and for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and
2001. This information should be read in conjunction with the accompanying
consolidated financial statements and notes thereto.

Overview

The Company believes that its operating results have largely been a result of
its business strategy of investing in submarkets that provide the greatest potential for rental
growth at the lowest relative risk.  Essex believes that its market research process, which
includes an analysis of both metropolitan statistical areas (MSA's) and submarkets, provides
it with a distinct competitive advantage.  Essex researches market data by reviewing data from
private and government sources as well as information developed or verified by its field personnel.
Essex then utilizes its proprietary research model to project market rent trends, allowing
the Company to allocate capital to the markets with the best risk-adjusted return potential.

Essex's research process begins with a macro-economic analysis of various
MSA's, followed by an evaluation of the submarkets within that MSA.  The objective of
the economic research department is to estimate the amount of new demand for housing,
comparing it to the number of single family and multifamily homes being constructed
within a submarket.  Historically, markets with demand for multifamily housing that is
greater than supply generate increasing occupancy levels and growth in rents.

Key components of Essex's analysis are as follows:

Job Growth:  The Company believes that quality job growth will lead to
demand for multifamily and for-sale housing.  Based on a variety of considerations, the
Company estimates how the total demand for housing will be allocated between rental
and for-sale housing.

Housing Supply:  Limited housing supply, both rental and for-sale, is a very
important factor in maintaining high occupancy levels, particularly in periods of
recession or slow economic growth.  The Company seeks to identify markets in which
there is a low level of housing construction, measured as a percentage of existing
housing stock.

Cost of for-sale housing:  The Company prefers areas with relatively expensive
for-sale housing, which is usually caused by an insufficient amount of single-family
housing construction.  The Company seeks to identify areas where the cost of rent is low
relative to both median income levels and the cost of homeownership.

Demographic trends:  The Company evaluates areas with long-term positive
immigration and demographic trends, and areas that provide an attractive quality of life.

Based on its evaluation of multifamily housing supply and demand factors, the
Company forecasts the occupancy and rent trends for its targeted submarkets, and actively
seeks to expand its multifamily portfolio in the submarket with the greatest risk-adjusted
return.


By region, the Company's operating and investment strategy are as follow:

Southern California Region:  At the time of the Company's 1994 initial public offering (IPO),
the Company had ownership interests representing 17% of its multifamily units in this region.
Following the IPO, the Company, using its research process, determined that various markets
in the Southern California region were attractive for multifamily property investment and,
the Company, accordingly increased ownership in such markets.
As of December 31, 2003, we have ownership interests representing 58% of
our multifamily units in this region.  During 2003, the region continued to perform well,
with same store property revenues increasing 4.8% versus 2002.  The Company expects
this region to continue generating positive operating results in the near term.

Northern California Region:  As of December 31, 2003, the Company has
ownership interests representing 18% of its multifamily units in this region.  Several
years of job losses have resulted in declining rents.  In 2003, same store property
revenues decreased 9.4% versus 2002.  The Company expects market rents to remain flat
in 2004, which would result in same store property revenues to decline
The Company expects positive multifamily fundamentals in this region after 2004.
As a result, the Company will begin to increase its investment focus in this region.

Pacific Northwest Region: As of December 31, 2003, the Company has
ownership interests representing 23% of its multifamily units in the region.  This region
also lost jobs in 2003, but at a lower rate as compared to the Company's Northern
California region.  In 2003, same store property revenues decreased 3.0% versus 2002.
The Company expects job growth in this region in 2004, and believes this region will
generate a slight increase in same store property revenue versus 2003.
The Company expects positive multifamily fundamentals in this region after 2004, and
the Company will begin to increase its investment focus in this region.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

The preparation of consolidated financial statements, in accordance
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America,
requires the Company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported
amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosures of
contingent assets and liabilities. Our critical accounting policies relate principally
to the following key areas: assessing the carrying values of its real estate properties,
its investments in and advances to joint ventures and affiliates,
its notes receivables, and qualification as a REIT. The
Company bases its estimates on historical experience, current market conditions,
and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the
circumstances. Actual results may differ from those estimates made by
management.

Rental properties are recorded at cost less accumulated depreciation.
Depreciation on rental properties has been provided over estimated useful lives
ranging from 3 to 30 years using the straight-line method. Development costs
include acquisition, direct and indirect construction costs, interest and real
estate taxes incurred during the construction and property stabilizations
periods. Maintenance and repair expenses that do not add to the value or prolong
the useful life of the property are expensed as incurred. Asset replacements and
improvements are capitalized and depreciated over their estimated useful lives.

The Company assesses the carrying value of its real estate investments by
monitoring investment market conditions and performance compared to budget for operating
properties and joint ventures, and by monitoring estimated costs for properties under
development. Local market knowledge and data is used to assess carrying values
of properties and the market value of acquisition opportunities. Whenever events
or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a property held
for investment may not be fully recoverable, the carrying amount is evaluated.
If the sum of the property's expected future cash flows (undiscounted and
without interest charges) is less than the carrying amount of the property, then
the Company will recognize an impairment loss equal to the excess of the
carrying amount over the fair value of the property. Adverse changes in market
conditions or poor operating results of real estate investments could result in
impairment charges. When the Company determines that a property is held for
sale, it discontinues the periodic depreciation of that property. The criteria
for determining when a property is held for sale requires judgment and has
potential financial statement impact as depreciation would cease and an
impairment loss could occur upon determination of held for sale status. Assets
held for sale are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or estimated fair
value less costs to sell.

With respect to investments in and advances to joint ventures and affiliates,
the Company looks to the underlying properties to assess performance and the
recoverability of carrying amounts for those investments in a manner similar to
direct investments in real estate properties. An impairment charge or investment
valuation charge is recorded if the carrying value of the investment exceeds its
fair value.

The Company assesses the carrying value of its notes receivables pursuant to FASB's SFAS
No.114,

Accounting by Creditors for Impairment of a Loan.

Pursuant to SFAS No. 114, a note is impaired if it is probable that
the Company will not collect all principal and interest contractually due. The impairment is
measured based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the note's
effective interest rate. The Company does not accrue interest when a note is considered
impaired. When ultimate collectibility of the principal balance of the impaired note is in doubt,
all cash receipts on impaired notes are applied to reduce the principal amount of such notes
until the principal has been recovered and are recognized as interest income, thereafter.

The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other
assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual
results may vary from those estimates and those estimates could be different
under different assumptions or conditions.


General Background

The Company's property revenues are generated primarily from
multifamily property operations, which accounted for greater than 95% of its
property revenues for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002, and 2001. The
Company's properties ("the Properties") are located in Southern
California (Los Angeles, Ventura, Orange and San Diego counties), Northern
California (the San Francisco Bay Area), the Pacific Northwest (The Seattle,
Washington and Portland, Oregon metropolitan areas), and other areas (Hemet,
California, Las Vegas, Nevada, and Houston, Texas). The average occupancy level
of the Company's portfolio has equaled or exceeded 95% for the last five years.

Essex Apartment Value Fund, L.P. ("Fund I"), is an investment fund
organized by the Company in 2001 to add value through rental growth and asset
appreciation, utilizing the Company's development, redevelopment and asset
management capabilities. Currently Fund I is considered fully invested based on
its acquisitions to date and anticipated development and redevelopment
expenditures. An affiliate of the Company, Essex VFGP, L.P. ("VFGP"),
is a 1% general partner and is a 20.4% limited partner. The Operating
Partnership owns a 99% limited partnership interest in VFGP. Fund I now expects
to utilize leverage of approximately 61% of the value of the underlying real
estate portfolio.  The Company is committed to invest 21.4% of the aggregate
capital committed to the Fund.  In addition, Essex will be compensated by Fund I
for its asset management, property management, development and redevelopment
services and may receive incentive payments if Fund I exceeds certain financial
return benchmarks.

The Company is in the process of forming a second Essex Apartment Value Fund
("Fund II"), which is expected to be similar to Fund I in size and
structure.  Essex anticipates an initial closing of Fund II during the second
quarter of 2004, which would result in a final $50 million capital commitment by a
subsidiary of the Company.

Since its formation, Fund I has acquired ownership interest in 17 multifamily
residential properties, representing 4,926 apartment units with an aggregate
purchase price of approximately $500 million, excluding redevelopment expenses,
and disposed of two multifamily residential properties, consisting of 530
apartment units at a gross sales price of approximately $73.2 million resulting
in a net realized gain of approximately $5.7 million. In addition, two
development land parcels, where approximately 480 apartment units are planned
for construction, have been purchased by Fund I with a total estimated cost for
the projects of approximately $101.7 million. As of December 31, 2003, the
remaining commitments to fund these development projects is approximately $37.4
million of which approximately $8.0 million is the Company's commitment.

The Company has elected to be treated as a real estate investment trust
("REIT") for federal income tax purposes, commencing with the year
ended December 31, 1994. The Company provides some of its fee based asset
management and disposition services as well as third-party property management
and leasing services through Essex Management Corporation ("EMC"), in
order to maintain compliance with REIT tax rules. The Company owns 100% of EMC's
19,000 shares of nonvoting preferred stock. Executives of the Company own 100%
of EMC's 1,000 shares of Common Stock.

The Company (excluding Fund I's development communities) has ownership
interests in and is developing two multifamily residential communities, with an
aggregate of 444 multifamily units. In connection with these development
projects, the Company has directly, or in some cases through its joint venture
partners, entered into contractual construction related commitments with
unrelated third parties and the total projected estimated cost for these
projects is approximately $70.3 million. As of December 31, 2003, the remaining
commitment to fund these projects is approximately $17.9 million.

Results of Operations

Comparison of Year Ended December 31, 2003 to Year Ended December 31, 2002

Average financial occupancy rates of the Company's multifamily "Same
Store Properties" (properties consolidated by the Company for each of the
years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002) increased to 95.8% for the year ended
December 31, 2003 from 94.7% for the year ended December 31, 2002. Financial
occupancy is defined as the percentage resulting from dividing actual rental
revenue by total possible rental revenue. Actual rental revenue represents
contractual rental revenue pursuant to leases without considering delinquency
and concessions. Total possible rental revenue represents the value of all
apartment units, with occupied units valued at contractual rental rates pursuant
to leases and vacant units valued at estimated market rents. We believe that
financial occupancy is a meaningful measure of occupancy because it considers
the value of each vacant unit at its estimated market rate. Financial occupancy
may not completely reflect short-term trends in physical occupancy and financial
occupancy rates as disclosed by other REITs may not be comparable to our
calculation of financial occupancy.


The regional breakdown of financial occupancy for the Same Store Properties
for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002 are as follows:

(1) 	Also includes four office buildings, five
recreational vehicle parks, two manufactured housing communities, redevelopment
communities and development communities.

As set forth in the above table, the $34,328,000 net
increase in total revenues was mainly attributable to an increase of $48,790,000
attributable to multifamily properties acquired subsequent to January 1, 2002,
four office buildings, five recreational vehicle parks, two manufactured housing
communities, redevelopment communities and development communities, which was
offset in part by a decrease in interest and other income of $11,275,000 and a
decrease in revenue from the Same Store Properties of $3,187,000. Subsequent to
January 1, 2002, the Company acquired 25 multifamily properties, two office
buildings, five recreational vehicle parks, two manufactured housing
communities, had three communities in redevelopment and achieved stabilized
operations at two development communities (the "Acquisitions
Properties").

Interest and other income decreased by $11,275,000 or 49.3% to $11,582,000 in
2003 from $22,857,000 in 2002. The decrease primarily relates to the sale of
certain co-investment assets resulting in the decrease in income earned on the
Company's co-investments and the repayment or conversion to non-accrual of notes
receivable which resulted in a decrease in interest income on notes receivables.


Property revenues from the Same Store Properties decreased by $3,187,000 or
1.9% to $162,264,000 in 2003 from $165,451,000 in 2002. The majority of this
decrease was attributable to the 16 Same Store Properties located in Northern
California and the 23 Same Store Properties located in the Pacific Northwest.
The property revenues of the Same Store Properties in Northern California
decreased by $5,211,000 or 9.4% to $50,346,000 in 2003 from $55,557,000 in 2002.
The decrease in Northern California is primarily attributable to rental rate
decreases and a slight decrease in financial occupancy to 95.8% in 2003 from
95.9% in 2002. The property revenues of the Same Store Properties in the Pacific
Northwest decreased by $1,263,000 or 3.0% to $40,726,000 in 2003 from
$41,989,000 in 2002. The $1,263,000 decrease in the Pacific Northwest is
primarily attributable to rental rate decreases offset by an increase in
financial occupancy to 95.1% in 2003 from 93.1% in 2002. The 22 multifamily
residential properties located in Southern California offset the net decrease in
total property revenues from the other Same Store Properties. The property
revenues for these properties increased by $3,287,000 or 4.8% to $71,192,000 in
2003 from $67,905,000 in 2002. The $3,287,000 increase is primarily attributable
to rental rate increases and an increase in financial occupancy to 96.3% in 2003
from 94.7% in 2002.

Total Expenses

increased by $42,907,000 or approximately 32.7% to
$174,311,000 in 2003 from $131,404,000 in 2002. This increase was mainly due to
an increase in property operating expenses of $33,950,000 or 37.9% to
$123,446,000 in 2003 from $89,496,000 in 2002. Of such operating expense
increase $32,154,000 was attributable to the Acquisition Properties. Interest
expense increased by $7,739,000 or 22.1% to $42,751,000 in 2003 from $35,012,000
in 2002. The increase in interest expense is mainly due to increases in the
mortgage notes payable balance.

Minority interests

decreased by $1,938,000 or 8.0% to $22,192,000 in
2003 from $24,130,000 in 2002. This is primarily due to the decrease in net
income of the Operating Partnership.

Discontinued operations

decreased by $8,286,000 to $0 in 2003 from
$8,286,000 in 2002. This decrease is due to the reduction of gain on sale of
real estate and operating income from Tara Village, a 168-unit apartment
community located in Tarzana, California, which was sold on June 18, 2002.

Net income

decreased by $14,927,000 or 28.2% to $37,947,000 in 2003
from $52,874,000 in 2002. The decrease in net income is mainly attributable to
the factors noted above.

Net income available to common stockholders

decreased by $16,083,000 or
30.4% to $36,791,000 in 2003 from $52,874,000 in 2002. The decrease in net
income available to common stockholders in mainly attributable to the factors
noted above in addition to the write-off of Series C preferred units offering
costs of $625,000, the amortization of discount on Series F preferred stock of
$336,000 and dividends to preferred stockholders -Series F of $195,000, all of
which occurred in 2003.

Comparison of Year Ended December 31, 2002 to Year Ended December 31, 2001

Average financial occupancy rates of the Company's multifamily
"2002/2001 Same Store Properties" (properties consolidated by the
Company for each of the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001) decreased to
94.5% for the year ended December 31, 2002 from 94.7% for the year ended
December 31, 2001. Financial occupancy is defined as the percentage resulting
from dividing actual rental revenue by total possible rental revenue. Actual
rental revenue represents contractual rental revenue pursuant to leases without
considering delinquency and concessions. Total possible rental revenue
represents the value of all apartment units, with occupied units valued at
contractual rental rates pursuant to leases and vacant units valued at estimated
market rents. We believe that financial occupancy is a meaningful measure of
occupancy because it considers the value of each vacant unit at its estimated
market rate. Financial occupancy may not completely reflect short-term trends in
physical occupancy and financial occupancy rates as disclosed by other REITs may
not be comparable to our calculation of financial occupancy.

The regional breakdown of financial occupancy for the 2002/2001 Same Store
Properties for the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001 are as follows:

(1) 	Also includes four office buildings, five recreational
vehicle parks, two manufactured housing communities, redevelopment communities
and development communities.

As set forth in the above table, the $3,417,000 net
decrease in total revenues was the result of a decrease in property revenues
from 2002/2001 Same Store Properties, which was offset in part by $4,173,000
attributable to properties acquired subsequent to January 1, 2001 and disposed
of in 2001, four office buildings, five recreational vehicle parks, two
manufactured housing communities, redevelopment communities and development
communities. Subsequent to January 1, 2001, the Company acquired 22 multifamily
properties, two office buildings, five recreational vehicle parks, two
manufactured housing communities, had six communities in redevelopment and two
development communities in the lease up stage (the "Acquisitions
Properties").

Of the net decrease in total revenues, $8,295,000 was mainly attributable to
a decrease in property revenues from the 2002/2001 Same Store Properties.
Property revenues from the 2002/2001 Same Store Properties decreased by 5.3% to
$148,062,000 in 2002 from $156,357,000 in 2001. The majority of this decrease
was attributable to the 14 2002/2001 Same Store Properties located in Northern
California and the 23 2002/2001 Same Store Properties located in the Pacific
Northwest. The property revenues of the 2002/2001 Same Store Properties in
Northern California decreased by $7,114,000 or 12.5% to $49,829,000 in 2002 from
$56,943,000 in 2001. The decrease in Northern California is primarily
attributable to rental rate decreases offset by an increase in average financial
occupancy to 95.6% in 2002 from 95.4% in 2001. The property revenues of the
2002/2001 Same Store Properties in the Pacific Northwest decreased by $3,120,000
or 6.9% to $41,989,000 in 2002 from $45,109,000 in 2001. The $3,120,000 decrease
in the Pacific Northwest is primarily attributable to rental rate decreases and
a decrease in average financial occupancy to 93.1% in 2002 from 93.9% in 2001.
The 19 multifamily residential properties located in Southern California
partially offset the net decrease in total revenues. The property revenues of
these properties increased by $1,939,000 or 3.6% to $56,244,000 in 2002 from
$54,305,000 in 2001. The $1,939,000 increase is primarily attributable to rental
rate increases, which were partially offset by a slight decrease in average
financial occupancy to 94.7% in 2002 from 94.8% in 2001.

Interest and other income increased by $705,000 or 3.2% to $22,857,000 in
2002 from $22,152,000 in 2001. The increase of $705,000 primarily relates to the
equity in income from the gain on sale of co-investment assets and additional
fee income earned in connection with the sale of co-investment assets.


Total Expenses

decreased by $3,689,000 or approximately 2.7% to
$131,404,000 in 2002 from $135,093,000 in 2001. This decrease was attributable
to a decrease in interest expense, which decreased by $3,734,000 or 9.6% to
$35,012,000 in 2002 from $38,746,000 in 2001 The interest expense decrease was
primarily due to declining interest rates. General and administrative expenses
represent the costs of the Company's various acquisition and administrative
departments as well as partnership administration and non-operating expenses.
Such expenses decreased by $1,207,000 or 16.1% to $6,291,000 in 2002 from
$7,498,000 in 2001. This decrease is largely due to a reduction in incentive
compensation expense as compared to 2001.

Discontinued Operations

increased by $7,653,000 to $8,286,000 in 2002
from $633,000 in 2001. This is due to the gain on sale of Tara Village in 2002
of $8,061,000, partially offset by a reduction in operating income from such
property due to its sale in 2002.

Minority interests

decreased by $192,000 or 0.8% to $24,130,000 in
2002 from $24,322,000 in 2001. This is primarily due to the decrease in net
income of the Operating Partnership.

Net income

increased by $4,329,000 or 8.9% to $52,874,000 in 2002 from
$48,545,000 in 2001. The increase in net income is mainly attributable to the
factors noted above and the gain on sale of real estate of $8,061,000 recognized
in 2002 as compared to the gain on sale of real estate of $3,788,000 recognized
in 2001.

Liquidity and Capital Resources Including Non-consolidated Investments

At December 31, 2003, the Company had $9,146,000 of unrestricted cash
and cash equivalents. The Company expects to meet its short-term liquidity
requirements by using its working capital, cash generated from operations, and
amounts available under lines of credit or other financings. The Company
believes that its current net cash flows will be adequate to meet operating
requirements and to provide for payment of dividends by the Company in
accordance with REIT qualification requirements. The Company expects to meet its
long-term liquidity requirements relating to property acquisitions and
development (beyond the next 12 months) and balloon debt maturities by using a
combination of some or all of the following sources: working capital, amounts
available on lines of credit, net proceeds from public and private debt and
equity issuances, and proceeds from the disposition of properties that may be
sold from time to time. There can, however, be no assurance that the Company
will have access to the debt and equity markets in a timely fashion to meet such
future funding requirements or that future working capital and borrowings under
the lines of credit will be available, or if available, will be sufficient to
meet the Company's requirements or that the Company will be able to dispose of
properties in a timely manner and under terms and conditions that the Company
deems acceptable.

Non-revenue generating capital expenditures are improvements and upgrades
that extend the useful life of the property. For the year ended December 31,
2003, non-revenue generating capital expenditures totaled approximately $385 per
weighted average occupancy unit. The Company expects to incur approximately $390
per weighted average occupancy unit in non-revenue generating capital
expenditures for the year ended December 31, 2004. These expenditures do not
include the improvements required in connection with the origination of mortgage
loans, expenditures for unidentified deferred maintenance renovations on
acquisition properties, expenditures for property renovations and improvements
which are expected to reposition a property and generate additional revenue, and
renovation expenditures required pursuant to tax-exempt bond financings. The
Company expects that cash from operations and/or its lines of credit will fund
such expenditures. However, there can be no assurance that the actual
expenditures incurred during 2004 and/or the funding thereof will not be
significantly different than the Company's current expectations.

The Company is currently developing two multifamily residential projects,
with an aggregate of 444 units. Such projects involve certain risks
inherent in real estate development. See "Risk Factors--Risks that
Development Activities Will be Delayed or Not Completed and/or Fail to Achieve
Expected Results" in Item 1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year
ended December 31, 2003. In connection with these development projects, the
Company has directly, or in some cases through its joint venture partners
entered into contractual construction related commitments with unrelated third
parties and the total projected estimated cost for these projects is
approximately $70,300,000. As of December 31, 2003, the remaining commitment to
fund these development projects is approximately $17,900,000. The Company
expects to fund such commitments by using a combination of some or all of the
following sources: its working capital, amounts available on its lines of
credit, net proceeds from public and private equity and debt issuances, and
proceeds from the disposition of properties, if any.


Essex Apartment Value Fund, L.P. (the "Fund I"), is an investment
fund organized by the Company in 2001 to add value through rental growth and
asset appreciation, utilizing the Company's development, redevelopment and asset
management capabilities. Currently Fund I is considered fully invested based on
its acquisitions to date and anticipated development and redevelopment
expenditures.  Fund I now expects to utilize leverage of approximately 61% of
the value of the underlying real estate portfolio. The Company is committed to
invest 21.4% of the aggregate capital committed to the Fund. In addition, the
Company will be compensated by Fund I for its asset management, property
management, development and redevelopment services and may receive incentive
payments if Fund I exceeds certain financial return benchmarks.  The Company's
remaining unfunded capital commitment as of December 31, 2003 is approximately
$9.6 million.

The Company is in the process of forming a second Essex Apartment Value Fund
("Fund II"), which is expected to be similar to Fund I in size and
structure.  Essex anticipates an initial closing of Fund II during the second
quarter of 2004, which would result in a final $50 million capital commitment
by a subsidiary of the Company.

The Company has two outstanding lines of credit for an aggregate amount of
$275,000,000. The first line, in the amount of $185,000,000, matures in May
2004, with an option to extend it for one year thereafter. The Company is
currently negotiating to renew this line. During the third quarter of 2003 the
Company expanded this unsecured revolving credit facility to $185,000,000 from
$165,000,000.  No other material terms of this facility were revised.
Outstanding balances under this line of credit bear interest at a rate, which
uses a tiered rate structure tied to the Company's corporate ratings, if any,
and leverage rating, which currently has been priced at LIBOR plus 1.10% during
2003 and 2002. As of December 31, 2003 and 2002, the interest rate was approximately
2.1% and 2.6%, respectively.
At December 31, 2003 the Company had $12,500,000 outstanding on this line of
credit. On December 18, 2003, the Company obtained a 5-year, $90,000,000 credit
facility from Freddie Mac, secured by four of Essex's multifamily communities.
The aggregate maximum principal amount of the facility is $90,000,000,
increasing to $100,000,000 on July 1, 2004.  The Company borrowed $80,600,000
under this facility, comprised of two tranches as follows: $41,000,000, locked
for 60 days at a base rate of 1.586% (55 basis points over Freddie Mac's
Reference Rate) and $39,600,000 locked for 180 days at a base rate of 1.695% (59
basis points over Freddie Mac's Reference Rate). This credit facility has a
lower cost of borrowing as compared to the Company's unsecured credit facility.
The credit agreements contain debt covenants related to limitations on
indebtedness and liabilities, maintenance of minimum levels of consolidated
earnings before depreciation, interest and amortization and maintenance of
minimum tangible net worth.

In addition, Fund I, the investment fund managed by the Company, has a credit
facility for an aggregate amount of $30,000,000. During 2003 the
Fund reduced this credit facility from $125,000,000 to $30,000,000, and
matures in June 2004. The line bears interest at LIBOR plus 0.875%. As of
December 31 2003, the line had no balance outstanding on this line. The line
provides for debt covenants relating to limitations on mortgage
indebtedness.

In addition to the Company's lines of credit, the Company had $739,129,000 of
secured indebtedness at December 31, 2003. Such indebtedness consisted of
$663,833,000 in fixed rate debt with interest rates varying from 5.5% to 8.2%
and maturity dates ranging from 2005 to 2026. The secured indebtedness also
includes $75,296,000 of tax-exempt variable rate demand bonds with interest
rates paid during 2003 ranging from approximately 2.9% to 3.2% and maturity
dates ranging from 2020 to 2032. The tax-exempt variable rate demand bonds
are subject to interest rates caps.

Pursuant to existing shelf registration statements, the Company has the
capacity to issue up to $219,455,250 of equity securities and the Operating
Partnership has the capacity to issue up to $250,000,000 of debt securities.

The Company pays quarterly dividends from cash available for distribution.
Until it is distributed, cash available for distribution is invested by the
Company primarily in short-term investment grade securities or is used by the
Company to reduce balances outstanding under its line of credit.

Financing and equity issuances.

During 2003, the Company
undertook the following financing activities and equity issuances.

On July 30, 2003, in connection with the Company's acquisition, by merger, of
John M. Sachs, Inc. ("Sachs") that was completed on December 17, 2002,
and under the terms of the merger agreement, a final analysis was prepared,
which indicated that the actual net liabilities of Sachs were less than the net
liabilities of Sachs estimated to be outstanding as of the merger date. 
Based on the final analysis and as a post-closing adjustment payment pursuant to
the merger agreement, the Company made a final payment of approximately
$1,766,000 in cash and issued an additional 35,860 shares of common stock to
certain of the pre-merger shareholders of Sachs.


On September 23, 2003, the Company issued 1,000,000 shares of its Series F
Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock ("Series F Preferred Stock") at
a fixed price of $24.664 per share, a discount from the $25.00 per share
liquidation value of the shares.  The shares did not begin to accrue a
dividend until November 25, 2003, and, following that date, will pay quarterly
distributions at an annualized rate of 7.8125% per year of the liquidation value
and will be redeemable by the Company on or after September 23, 2008.  The
Company amortized the original discount in connection with the issuance of
these shares in the fourth quarter of 2003, resulting in a charge of
approximately $336,000.  The shares were issued pursuant to the Company's
existing shelf registration statement.  The Company used the net proceeds
from this sale of Series F Preferred Stock to redeem all of the 9.125% Series C
Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Units (the "Series C Preferred Units")
of Essex Portfolio, L.P., of which the Company is the general
partner.

On October 6, 2003, the Company sold 1.6 million newly issued shares of
common stock and received offering proceeds (before expenses) of $60.67 per
share, representing a 3.25% discount to the common stock's closing price on
September 30, 2003, the date of the underwriting agreement between the Company
and the underwriter, pursuant to which the shares were sold.  The shares
were issued pursuant to the Company's existing shelf registration
statement.  The proceeds of the offering were approximately
$97,072,000. Subsequent to the offerings, the net proceeds generated from the
offering were used to acquire multifamily communities located in the Company's
targeted West Coast markets and for general corporate purposes, including the
repayment of debt and the funding of development activities.

Using the proceeds of its September 2003 sale of its 7.8125% Series F
Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock, the Company on November 24, 2003,
redeemed all of the outstanding 9.125% Series C Cumulative Redeemable Preferred
Units of the Operating Partnership. In connection with this redemption the
Company incurred a non-cash charge of $625,000 related to the write-off of the
issuance costs.

In January 2004, the Company restructured its previously issued $50 million,
9.30% Series D Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Units ("Series D
Units"), and its previously issued $80 million, 7.875% Series B Cumulative
Redeemable Preferred Units ("Series B Units").  The existing
distribution rate of 9.30% of the Series D Units will continue until July 27,
2004 - the end of the current non-call period.  On July 28, 2004, the
distribution rate on the Series D Units will be reduced to 7.875%.  The date
that the Series D Units can first be redeemed at the Company's option will be
extended by six years to July 28, 2010.  The dates that the Series B Units can
first be redeemed at the Company's option will be extended from February 6, 2003
to December 31, 2009.

Company Investments; Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

The Company invests in joint ventures, which generally involve single
multifamily property acquisitions. The Company accounts for these investments
under the equity or consolidation methods of accounting based on the voting
control it exercises through its ownership interests in these affiliates. Under
the equity method of accounting, the investment is carried at the cost of assets
contributed or distributed, plus the Company's equity in undistributed earnings
or losses since its initial investment. The individual assets, liabilities,
revenues and expenses of the joint venture are not recorded in the Company's
consolidated financial statements.

At December 31, 2003 and 2002, the Company did not have any other
relationship with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as
entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities,
which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance
sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. As such,
the Company is not materially exposed to any financing, liquidity, market or
credit risk that could arise if the Company had engaged in such relationships.

Included in the Company's investments accounted for under the equity method
investments are limited partnership interests in 17 partnerships (Down REIT
entities), which collectively own ten multifamily properties, comprised of 1,831
units. These investments were made under arrangements whereby Essex Management
Corporation (EMC) became the general partner, the Operating Partnership became a
special limited partner, and the other limited partners were granted rights of
redemption for their interests. Such partners can request to be redeemed and the
Company can elect, with certain limitations, to redeem their rights for cash or
by issuing shares of its common stock on a one share per unit basis. Conversion
values will be based on the market value of the Company's common stock at the
time of redemption multiplied by the number of units stipulated under the above
arrangements. The other limited partners receive distributions based on the
Company's current dividend rate times the number of redemption shares. At
December 31, 2003, the maximum number of shares that could be required to meet
redemption of these Down REIT entities is 1,449,138. The equity in income or
loss reported by the Company under the equity method of accounting for these
down REIT entities is the residual net income of these down REIT entities
after income has been allocated to the other limited partners equal to the
distributions they received.

New Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted

In January 2003, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued FASB
Interpretation No. 46 (FIN 46), "Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, an
Interpretation of ARB No. 51." FIN 46 clarifies the application of Accounting Research
Bulletin (ARB) No. 51, "Consolidated Financial Statements" to variable interest entities
(VIEs) in which equity investors lack an essential characteristic of a controlling financial
interest or do not have sufficient equity investment at risk to permit the entity to finance
its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties. In
December 2003, the FASB completed deliberations of proposed modifications to FIN 46
(FIN 46 Revised) resulting in multiple effective dates based on the nature as well as the
creation of the VIE. VIEs created after January 31, 2003, but prior to January 1, 2004
may be accounted for either based on FIN 46 or FIN 46 Revised. However, FIN 46
Revised must be applied no later than the Company's first quarter of 2004.
VIEs created after January 1, 2004 must be accounted for under FIN 46 Revised. Special
Purpose Entities (SPEs) created prior to February 1, 2003 may be accounted for under
FIN 46 or FIN 46 Revised but no later than the Company's quarter ended
December 31, 2003. Non-SPEs created prior to February 1, 2003 are to be accounted for
under FIN 46 Revised no later than the first quarter of 2004. The Operating Partnership
has not formed nor is a party to any SPEs. Under FIN 46 Revised, the disclosure
requirements are effective for all financial statements initially issued after December 31,
2003. Certain of the entities through which and with which we conduct business, have
been deemed to be VIEs under the provisions of FIN 46 Revised. Based on our analysis
of FIN 46 Revised, we expect to consolidate Essex Management Corporation (EMC) and
Essex Fidelity I Corporation (EFC), effective March 31, 2004, as we are the primary
beneficiary of these VIEs. The total assets and liabilities of EMC and EFC, net of
intercompany eliminations, were approximately $23,300,000 and $9,000,000,
respectively, at December 31, 2003.

It is reasonably possible that certain other entities through which and with which the
Company conducts business, including those described in Notes 3(c), 4, 5
and 9 of the consolidated financial statements will be deemed to be VIEs under the
provisions of FIN 46 Revised and that we may be the primary beneficiary. The Company
is continuing its evaluation of these other various entities, which currently it
is uncertain if such entities would result in consolidation. If such other entities are
required to be consolidated pursuant to FIN 46 Revised, the total assets and liabilities, net
of intercompany balances would be $214,300,000 and $198,400,000 and an estimated
maximum exposure to loss would be equal to the Company's investments
and commitments to invest in these entities of $15,600,000, as of December 31, 2003. The
disclosures provided reflect management's understanding and analysis of FIN 46 Revised
based upon information currently available. The Company continues to
evaluate and analyze the complex terms of this FIN 46 Revised and the evaluation of the
impact of FIN 46 Revised on the Company's consolidated financial
statements is ongoing and is subject to change in the event additional interpretive
guidance is provided by the FASB or others.


In May 2003, the FASB issued SFAS No. 150, "Accounting for Certain
Financial Instruments with Characteristics of both Liabilities and Equity."
This statement establishes standards for the classification and measurement of
certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and
equity. SFAS No. 150 requires that an issuer classify a financial instrument
that is within its scope as a liability (or an asset in some circumstances).
Many of those instruments were previously classified as equity. This statement
is effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after May 31,
2003 and, otherwise, is effective at the beginning of the first interim period
beginning after June 15, 2003. Certain provisions have been deferred
indefinitely by the FASB under FSP 150-3.  This standard did not have a material
impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations.

Potential Factors Affecting Future Operating Results

Many factors affect the Company's actual financial performance and
may cause the Company's future results to be different from past performance or
trends. These factors include those set forth under the caption "Risk
Factors" in Item I of this Annual Report on Form 10-K and the following:

Economic Environment

Both the national economy and the economies of the western states in
which the Company owns, manages and develops properties have been and continue
to be in an economic downturn. This has resulted in increased concessions and
reductions in market rental rates.

The Company's property type and diverse geographic locations provide some
degree of risk moderation but are not immune to a prolonged downturn in the real
estate markets in which the Company operates. Although the Company believes it
is well positioned to meet the challenges ahead, it is possible that further
reductions in market rental rates will result in reduction of rental revenues,
operating income, cash flows, and the market value of the Company's shares. A
prolonged recession could also affect the Company's ability to obtain financing
at acceptable rates of interest and to access funds from the disposition of
properties at acceptable disposition prices.

Interest Rate Fluctuations

The Company monitors changes in interest rates and believes that it
is well positioned from both a liquidity and interest rate risk perspective.
However, current interest rates are at historic lows and potentially could
increase rapidly to levels more in line with historic levels. The immediate
effect of significant and rapid interest rate increases would result in higher
interest expense on the Company's variable interest rate debt (see Item 7A and
Notes 7 and 8 to consolidated financial statements). The effect of prolonged
interest rate increases could negatively impact the Company's ability to make
acquisitions and develop properties at economic returns on investment and the
Company's ability to refinance existing borrowings at acceptable rates.

Inflation

Inflationary increases would likely have a negative effect on
property operating expenses and such increases may be at a greater rate than
growth in property rental rates. The Company believes it effectively manages its
property and other expenses, but realizes that higher annual rates of inflation
could result in increases to operating expense.


Failure to Qualify as A REIT

We have elected to be taxed as a REIT under the Internal Revenue
Code. However, we cannot assure you that we have qualified as a REIT or that we
will continue to so qualify in the future. If we fail to qualify as a REIT in
any taxable year, we would be subject to federal income tax on our taxable
income at corporate rates. We may also be disqualified from treatment as a REIT
for the four taxable years following the year in which we failed to qualify.
This would reduce our net earnings available for investment or distribution to
stockholders because of the additional tax liability. Even if we continue to
qualify as a REIT, we will continue to be subject to certain federal, state and
local taxes on our income and property.

Funds from Operations

Funds from Operations, as defined by the National Association of Real
Estate Investment Trusts ("NAREIT") is generally considered by
industry analysts as an appropriate measure of performance of an equity REIT.
Generally, Funds from Operations adjusts the net income of equity REITS for non-
cash charges such as depreciation and amortization of rental properties, gains/
losses on sales of real estate and extraordinary items. Management considers
Funds from Operations to be a useful financial performance measurement of an
equity REIT because, together with net income, cash flows, and the interest coverage ratio,
Funds from Operations provides investors with an additional basis to evaluate the
performance of a REIT to incur and service debt and to fund acquisitions and
other capital expenditures. Funds from Operations does not represent net income
or cash flows from operations as defined by generally accepted accounting
principles (GAAP) and is not intended to indicate whether cash flows will be
sufficient to fund cash needs. It should not be considered as an alternative to
net income as an indicator of the REIT's operating performance or to cash flows
as a measure of liquidity. Funds from Operations does not measure whether cash
flow is sufficient to fund all cash needs including principal amortization,
capital improvements and distributions to shareholders. Funds from Operations
also does not represent cash flows generated from operating, investing or
financing activities as defined under GAAP. Further, Funds from Operations as
disclosed by other REITs may not be comparable to the Company's calculation of
Funds from Operations.

Operations for 2003, 2002 and 2001.

Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

The Company is exposed to interest rate changes primarily as a result of
its line of credit and long-term debt used to maintain liquidity and fund
capital expenditures and expansion of the Company's real estate investment
portfolio and operations. The Company's interest rate risk management objective
is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and
to lower its overall borrowing costs. To achieve its objectives the Company
borrows primarily at fixed rates and may enter into derivative financial
instruments such as interest rate swaps, caps and treasury locks in order to
mitigate its interest rate risk on a related financial instrument. The Company
does not enter into derivative or interest rate transactions for speculative
purposes.

The Company's interest rate risk is monitored using a variety of techniques.
The table below presents the principal amounts and weighted average interest
rates by year of expected maturity to evaluate the expected cash flows.
Management believes that the carrying amounts of
its LIBOR debt approximates fair value as of December 31, 2003 because interest
rates, yields and other terms for these instruments are consistent with yields and
other terms currently available to the Company for similar instruments. Management
has estimated that the fair value of the Company's $663,833,000 of fixed rate mortgage
notes payable at December 31, 2003 is approximately $632,111,000 based on terms of
existing mortgage notes payable compared to those available in the marketplace.

The table incorporates only those exposures that exist as of December 31,
2003; it does not consider those exposures or positions that could arise after
that date. As a result, our ultimate realized gain or loss, with respect to
interest rate fluctuations, would depend on the exposures that arise during the
period, our hedging strategies at the time, and interest rates.

Independent Auditors' Report

The Board of Directors and Shareholders of

Essex Property Trust, Inc.:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Essex
Property Trust, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2003 and 2002, and the
related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders' equity, and cash
flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2003. In
connection with our audits of the consolidated financial statements, we have
also audited the related financial statement schedule of Real Estate and
Accumulated Depreciation. These consolidated financial statements and the
financial statement schedule are the responsibility of the management of Essex
Property Trust, Inc. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
consolidated financial statements and the financial statement schedule based on
our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally
accepted in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above
present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Essex
Property Trust, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2003 and 2002, and the
results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the
three-year period ended December 31, 2003, in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also, in our
opinion, the related financial statement schedule when considered in relation to
the consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly, in all
material respects, the information set forth therein.

ESSEX PROPERTY TRUST, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001

(Dollars in thousands, except for per share and per unit amounts)

(1) Organization and Basis of Presentation

The accompanying consolidated financial statements present the accounts
of Essex Property Trust, Inc. (the Company), which include the accounts of the
Company and Essex Portfolio, L.P. (the Operating Partnership, which holds the
operating assets of the Company). The Company was incorporated in the state of
Maryland in March 1994. On June 13, 1994, the Company commenced operations with
the completion of an initial public offering (the Offering) in which it issued
6,275,000 shares of common stock at $19.50 per share. The net proceeds of the
Offering of $112,070 were used to acquire a 77.2% general partnership interest
in the Operating Partnership.

The Company has a 90.8% general partner interest and the limited partners own
a 9.2% interest in the Operating Partnership as of December 31, 2003. The
limited partners may convert their 2,265,990 Operating Partnership units into an
equivalent number of shares of common stock. The Company has reserved shares of
common stock for such conversions. These conversion rights may be exercised by
the limited partners at any time through 2024.

On December 17, 2002, the Company acquired, by merger, John M. Sachs, Inc.
("Sachs Portfolio") resulting in the acquisition of its real estate
portfolio, which consists of 20 multifamily properties, five recreational
vehicle parks, two manufactured housing communities and two small office
buildings. The cost of the transaction was $306,700 and was structured as
a tax-free reorganization whereby the Company: (i) issued 2,719,875 shares of
its common stock valued at $136,800, (ii) assumed mortgages on four of the
newly acquired properties for approximately $64,600 with a fixed interest
rate of 5.51%, maturing in January 2013, (iii) assumed and repaid unsecured
liabilities in the amount of approximately $33,000, and (iv) paid the
balance in cash of $72,200. The cash portion was funded through four new
non-recourse mortgages on four previously unencumbered properties, with a
weighted average interest rate of 5.64%, maturing in January 2013 and draws upon
new and existing lines of credit. The Company accounted for this transaction
using the purchase method of accounting; which resulted in the allocation of the
purchase price to the assets and liabilities acquired based on their fair
values.  The fair value of assets and liabilities were based on management's
estimates.  No goodwill was recognized in connection with this purchase.  The
Company's results of operations for the period December 17, 2002 through
December 31, 2002 include the Sachs Portfolio. On July 30, 2003, and under terms
of the merger agreement, a final analysis was prepared, which indicated that the
actual net liabilities of Sachs were less than the net liabilities of Sachs
estimated to be outstanding as of the merger date.  Based on this final analysis
and as a post-closing adjustment payment pursuant to the merger agreement, the
Company made a final payment of $1,800 in cash and issued an additional
35,860 shares of common stock valued at $2,170 to certain of the pre-merger
shareholders of Sachs.

Unaudited pro forma information reflecting the acquisition of the Sachs Portfolio is presented
in the following table. The amounts included therein assume that the acquisition had taken
place at the beginning of the year.

As of December 31, 2003, the Company operates and has ownership interests in
121 multifamily properties (containing 26,012 units), five recreational vehicle
parks (containing 1,717 spaces), four office buildings (totaling approximately
63,540 square feet), and two manufactured housing communities (containing 607
sites) (collectively, the Properties). The Properties are located in Southern
California (Los Angeles, Ventura, Orange, and San Diego counties), Northern
California (the San Francisco Bay Area), the Pacific Northwest (Seattle,
Washington, and Portland, Oregon metropolitan areas) and other areas (Hemet,
California, Las Vegas, Nevada and Houston, Texas).

All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated
in the consolidated financial statements.

(2) Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

(a) Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

The preparation of consolidated financial statements, in accordance
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America,
requires the Company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported
amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosures of
contingent assets and liabilities. On an on-going basis, the Company evaluates
its estimates, including those related to acquiring, developing and assessing
the carrying values of its real estate properties, its investments in and
advances to joint ventures and affiliates, its notes receivables, and its qualification
as a Real Estate Investment Trust ("REIT"). The Company bases its estimates on
historical experience, current market conditions, and on various other
assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual
results may vary from those estimates and those estimates could be different
under different assumptions or conditions.

(b) Real Estate Rental Properties and Discontinued Operations

Rental properties are recorded at cost less accumulated depreciation.
Depreciation on rental properties has been provided over estimated useful lives
ranging from 3 to 30 years using the straight-line method. Development costs
include acquisition, direct and indirect construction costs, interest and real
estate taxes incurred during the construction and property stabilization
periods.

Maintenance and repair expenses that do not add to the value or prolong the
useful life of the property are expensed as incurred. Asset replacements and
improvements are capitalized and depreciated over their estimated useful lives.

Certain rental properties are pledged as collateral for the related mortgage
notes payable and secured line of credit.

In accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board's (FASB) Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 141, "Business
Combinations," the Company allocates the purchase price of real estate to
land and building, and identifiable intangible assets, such as the value of
above, below and at-market in-place leases. The values of the above and below
market leases are amortized and recorded as either a decrease (in the case of
above market leases) or an increase (in the case of below market leases) to
rental revenue over the remaining term of the associated leases acquired.
Acquired at-market leases are amortized to amortization expense over the term
the Company expects to retain the acquired tenant, which is generally 20 months.

In accordance with SFAS 141 and its applicability to acquired in-place leases, we
perform the following procedures for properties we acquire:

F-8

estimate the value of the real estate "as if vacant" as of the
acquisition date;

allocate that value among land and building and determine the
associated asset life for each;

compute the value of the difference between the "as if
vacant" value and the purchase price, which will represent the total
intangible assets;

allocate the value of the above and below market leases to the
intangible assets and determine the associated life of the above market/ below
market leases;

allocate the remaining intangible value to the at-market in-place leases
or customer relationships, if any, and the associated life of these assets.

As of December 31, 2003 the carrying value of acquired at-market in-place leases,
net of accumulated amortization of $1,413 was $1,687. Amortization expense of acquired
at-market in-place leases was $1,413 for the year ended December 31, 2003. The majority
of the remaining unamortized at-market in-place leases as of December 31, 2003 will be
amortized to expense in 2004.

Whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying
amount of a property held for investment or held for sale may not be fully recoverable, the
carrying amount will be evaluated. If the sum of the property's expected future
cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) is less than the carrying
amount (including intangible assets) of the property, then the Company will
recognize an impairment loss equal to the excess of the carrying amount over the
fair value of the property.

The Company presents income and gains/losses on properties sold as
discontinued operations net of minority interests. Real estate investments
accounted for under the equity method of accounting remain classified in
continuing operations upon disposition.

(c) Investments and Joint Ventures

The Company owns investments in joint ventures and affiliates and has
significant influence but does not have voting control. Therefore, we account
for our interest using the equity method of accounting. Under the equity method
of accounting, the investment is carried at the cost of assets contributed or
distributed, plus the Company's equity in undistributed earnings or losses since
its initial investment. The Company's share of equity in income and gains on
sales of real estate are included in other income in the accompanying
consolidated statement of operations.

(d) Revenues and Gains on Sale of Real Estate

Rental revenue is reported on the accrual basis of accounting.

Revenue from tenants renting or leasing apartment units is recorded when due
from tenants and is recognized monthly as it is earned, which is not materially
different than on a straight-line basis. Apartment units are rented under short-
term leases (generally, lease terms of 6 to 12 months) and may provide for no
rent for the first month, depending on the market conditions and leasing
practices of our competitors in each sub-market at the time the leases are executed.

The Company recognizes gains on sales of real estate when a contract is in
place, a closing has taken place, the buyer's initial and continuing investment
is adequate to demonstrate a commitment to pay for the property and the Company
does not have a substantial continuing involvement in the property.

(e) Income Taxes

Generally in any year in which the Company qualifies as a real estate
investment trust (REIT) under the Internal Revenue Code (the Code), it is not
subject to federal income tax on that portion of its income that it distributes
to stockholders. No provision for federal income taxes has been made in the
accompanying consolidated financial statements for each of the three years in
the period ended December 31, 2003, as the Company believes it qualifies under
the Code as a REIT and has made distributions during the periods in excess of
its taxable income.

Cash dividends distributed for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002, and
2001 are classified for tax purposes as follows:

2003      2002      2001
                           --------- --------- ---------
      Taxable portion.....   100.00%   100.00%   100.00%
      Return of capital...       --        --        --
                           --------- --------- ---------
                             100.00%   100.00%   100.00%
                           ========= ========= =========

F-9

(f) Notes Receivable and Interest Income

Notes receivable relate to real estate financing arrangements that
exceed one year. They bear interest at a market rate based on the borrower's
credit quality and are recorded at face value. Interest is recognized over the
life of the note. The Company requires collateral for the notes.

A note is considered impaired pursuant to FASB's SFAS No. 114,
Accounting by Creditors for Impairment of a Loan. Pursuant to SFAS No. 114,
a note is impaired if it is probable that the Company will not collect all
principal and interest contractually due. The impairment is measured based on
the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the note's
effective interest rate. The Company does not accrue interest when a note is
considered impaired. When ultimate collectibility of the principal balance of
the impaired note is in doubt, all cash receipts on impaired notes are applied
to reduce the principal amount of such notes until the principal has been
recovered and are recognized as interest income, thereafter.
See note 5 for note receivable in which the Company has ceased accrual of
interest income.

(g) Interest Rate Protection, Swap, and Forward Contracts

The Company has from time to time used interest rate protection, swap
and forward contracts to manage its interest rate exposure on current or
identified future debt transactions. The Company accounts for such derivative
contracts using SFAS No. 133. Under SFAS No. 133 derivative instruments are
required to be included in the balance sheet at fair value. The changes in the
fair value of the derivatives are accounted for depending on the use of the
derivative and whether it has been designated and qualifies as a part of a
hedging relationship. If the hedged exposure is a cash flow exposure, changes in
fair value of the effective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative
instrument are reported initially as a component of other comprehensive income
and subsequently reclassified into earnings when the forecasted transaction
affects earnings. Changes in the ineffective portion of the gain or loss are
reported in earnings immediately.

(h) Deferred Charges

Deferred charges are principally comprised of loan fees and related
costs which are amortized over the terms of the related borrowing in a manner
which approximates the effective interest method.

(i) Interest

The Company capitalized $4,084, $6,139, and $3,917 of interest
related to the development of real estate during 2003, 2002, and 2001,
respectively.

(j) Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash

Highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or
less when purchased are classified as cash equivalents. Restricted cash relates
to reserve requirements in connection with the Company's tax-exempt variable
rate bond financings.

(k) Minority Interest

Minority interests includes the 9.2% and 10.0% limited partner
interests in the Operating Partnership not held by the Company at December 31,
2003 and 2002, respectively. The Company periodically adjusts the carrying value
of minority interest in the Operating Partnership to reflect its share of the
book value of the Operating Partnership. Such adjustments are recorded to
stockholders' equity as a reallocation of minority interest in the Operating
Partnership in the accompanying consolidated statements of stockholders' equity.
The minority interest balance also includes the Operating Partnership's
cumulative redeemable preferred units (note 10).

F-10

(l) Stock-based Compensation

The Company applies APB Opinion No. 25 (APB 25) and related
interpretations in accounting for its stock-based compensation plans granted to
employees and directors. Under APB 25, no compensation cost has been recognized
for stock options granted to employees and directors since all such stock
options were granted with an exercise price equal to the fair market value of
the underlying common stock. For the Company's Series Z Incentive Plan and Phantom Stock Plan
(See note 12), compensation expense
recognized during the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002, and 2001 was $407,
$911, and $327, respectively. Had compensation cost for these stock options and
the Company's other plans been determined based on the fair value at the grant
dates consistent with the fair value method pursuant to SFAS 123, the Company's
net income applicable to common stockholders for the years ended December 31,
2003, 2002, and 2001 would have been reduced to the pro forma amounts indicated below:

2003         2002        2001
                                           ------------  ----------  ----------

Fair value of junior stock
  (Series Z units) granted............... $         --  $       --  $    16.16

The fair value of stock options granted each period was estimated on the date
of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following
weighted average assumptions used for grants:

2003         2002        2001
                                         ------------  ----------  ----------

Volatility.............................  17.89%-19.18%   18.92%      18.93%
Dividend yield.........................  5.66%-6.12%     6.30%       5.70%

(m) New Accounting Pronouncements Adopted

In December 2002, the FASB issued SFAS 148, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation -
Transition and Disclosure - an amendment of SFAS 123."  SFAS 148 amends SFAS 123,
"Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation," to provide alternative methods of transition
for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock-based employee
compensation.  In addition, SFAS 148 amends the disclosure requirements of SFAS 123
to require prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements about
the method of accounting for stock-based employee compensation and the effect of the method
used on reported results.  The disclosure requirements are effective for interim and annual
financial statements ending after December 15, 2002.  The other provisions of SFAS 148 are
effective for the Company with the beginning of fiscal year 2003.  Beginning January 1, 2004,
the Company will adopt the fair value based method of accounting to account for its stock-based
compensation plans granted to employees and directors using the retroactive restatement method
as provided by SFAS 123. The adoption of the fair value method will increase compensation
expense in the amount of $517, $505 and $521 for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002
and 2001 on the Company's consolidated income statements.

F-11

In January 2003, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued FASB
Interpretation No. 46 (FIN 46), "Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, an
Interpretation of ARB No. 51." FIN 46 clarifies the application of Accounting Research
Bulletin (ARB) No. 51, "Consolidated Financial Statements" to variable interest entities
(VIEs) in which equity investors lack an essential characteristic of a controlling financial
interest or do not have sufficient equity investment at risk to permit the entity to finance
its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties. In
December 2003, the FASB completed deliberations of proposed modifications to FIN 46
(FIN 46 Revised) resulting in multiple effective dates based on the nature as well as the
creation of the VIE. VIEs created after January 31, 2003, but prior to January 1, 2004
may be accounted for either based on FIN 46 or FIN 46 Revised. However, FIN 46
Revised must be applied no later than the Company's first quarter of 2004.
VIEs created after January 1, 2004 must be accounted for under FIN 46 Revised. Special
Purpose Entities (SPEs) created prior to February 1, 2003 may be accounted for under
FIN 46 or FIN 46 Revised but no later than the Company's quarter ended
December 31, 2003. Non-SPEs created prior to February 1, 2003 are to be accounted for
under FIN 46 Revised no later than the first quarter of 2004. The Operating Partnership
has not formed nor is a party to any SPEs. Under FIN 46 Revised, the disclosure
requirements are effective for all financial statements initially issued after December 31,
2003. Certain of the entities through which and with which we conduct business, have
been deemed to be VIEs under the provisions of FIN 46 Revised. Based on our analysis
of FIN 46 Revised, we expect to consolidate Essex Management Corporation (EMC) and
Essex Fidelity I Corporation (EFC), effective March 31, 2004, as we are the primary
beneficiary of these VIEs. The total assets and liabilities of EMC and EFC, net of
intercompany eliminations, were approximately $23,300 and $9,000,
respectively, at December 31, 2003.

It is reasonably possible that certain other entities through which and with which the
Company conducts business, including those described in Notes 3(c), 4, 5
and 9 of the consolidated financial statements will be deemed to be VIEs under the
provisions of FIN 46 Revised and that we may be the primary beneficiary. The Company's
is continuing its evaluation of these other various entities, which currently it
is uncertain if such entities would result in consolidation. If such other entities are
required to be consolidated pursuant to FIN 46 Revised, the total assets and liabilities, net
of intercompany balances would be $214,300 and $198,400 and an estimated
maximum exposure to loss would be equal to the Company's investments
and commitments to invest in these entities of $15,600, as of December 31, 2003.The
disclosures provided reflect management's understanding and analysis of FIN 46 Revised
based upon information currently available. The Company continues to
evaluate and analyze the complex terms of this FIN 46 Revised and the evaluation of the
impact of FIN 46 Revised on the Company's consolidated financial
statements is ongoing and is subject to change in the event additional interpretive
guidance is provided by the FASB or others.

In May 2003, the FASB issued SFAS No. 150, "Accounting for Certain
Financial Instruments with Characteristics of both Liabilities and Equity."
This statement establishes standards for the classification and measurement of
certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and
equity. SFAS No. 150 requires that an issuer classify a financial instrument
that is within its scope as a liability (or an asset in some circumstances).
Many of those instruments were previously classified as equity. This statement
is effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after May 31,
2003 and, otherwise, is effective at the beginning of the first interim period
beginning after June 15, 2003. Certain provisions have been deferred
indefinitely by the FASB under FSP 150-3.  This standard did not have a material
impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations.

(n) Reclassifications

Certain prior year balances have been reclassified to conform to the
current year presentation.

F-12

(3) Real Estate

(a) Rental Properties

Rental properties consist of multifamily properties with a net book
value of $1,445,008 and other rental properties (office buildings, recreational
vehicle parks, and manufactured housing communities) with a net book value of $46,677.

The properties are located in California, Washington, Oregon, Nevada and
Texas. The operations of the properties could be adversely affected by a
recession, general economic downturn or a natural disaster in the areas where
the properties are located.

For the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002, and 2001, gain on the sales of
real estate was $0, $8,061(net of minority interests), and $3,788, respectively.
The Company utilized Internal Revenue Code section 1031 to defer the majority of
the taxable gains resulting from these sales.

For the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002, and 2001, depreciation expense
on real estate within continuing operations was $49,409, $37,042, and $35,915,
respectively.  For the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002, and 2001,
depreciation expense on real estate within discontinued operations was $0, $191,
and $380, respectively.

(b) Sales of Real Estate

The Company recognizes sale of real estate when a contract has been executed,
a closing has occurred, the buyer's initial and continuing investment is adequate to demonstrate
a commitment to pay for the property and the Company does not have a substantial continuing
involvement in the property. Each property is considered a separately identifiable component
of the Company and is reported in discontinued operations when the operations and cash flows
of the property have been (or will be) eliminated from the ongoing operations of the Company

(1) 	Fund I acquired a 49.9% equity investment in this property and accounts for
its investment under the equity method of accounting.

On December 15, 2003, Fund I obtained construction loans
for the development of two of its communities in the committed principal amount
of $66,000, with a variable interest rate of LIBOR plus 2%.  These loans mature
in January 2007, with options to extend the maturity for up to two years
thereafter. The principal balance of these construction loans was $28,100 on
December 31, 2003.

During 2003, Fund I reduced its credit facility to $30,000 from $125,000.
The line bears interest at LIBOR plue 0.875% and matures in June 2004.
As of December 31 2003, the outstanding balance on this line was zero. The line
provides for debt covenants relating to limitations on mortgage indebtedness.
The facility agreement contains debt covenants related to limitations on
mortgage indebtedness.

In addition to distributions with respect to its pro-rata share
of Fund I's limited partnership interest, VFGP (1) is to receive special
priority distributions from Fund I in the annual amount of 1% of Fund I's
unreturned third party capital, payable quarterly for managing Fund I's
operations, and (2) may receive over the life of Fund I incentive
distributions up to 20% of the cumulative net profits on Fund I's investments,
if Fund I exceeds certain financial return benchmarks, including a minimum 10%
compounded annual return on the Limited Partner's total capital contributions.
VFGP is to also be paid fees consistent with industry standards for its property
management, development and redevelopment services with respect to Fund I's
investments. VFGP will not receive transaction fees, such as acquisition,
disposition, and financing or similar fees, in connection with the operation of
the Fund.

In October 1999, the Company entered into two separate joint
venture arrangements and through two separate private REITs, Newport Beach
North, Inc. and Newport Beach South, Inc., received an approximate 49.9% equity
interest in each. Generally, profit and loss are allocated to the partners in
accordance with their ownership interests. In addition to its equity earnings,
the Company is entitled to management and redevelopment fees from the joint
ventures.  On July 11, 2003 Fund I acquired a 49.9% ownership interest in these
joint ventures from an unrelated co-investment partner.

F-14

In December 1999, the Company entered into a joint venture arrangement (AEW
joint venture) and received an approximate 20% equity interest in the joint
venture. The Company contributed its investment in Riverfront Apartments, Casa
Mango Apartments, and Westwood Apartments into the joint venture. The Company
also contributed land and development rights for a development community, Tierra
Vista, located in Oxnard, California. The AEW joint venture completed
construction and reached stabilized operations of Tierra Vista in 2001. On April
17, 2002, Riverfront Apartments and Casa Mango Apartments were sold to an
unrelated third party.  The combined sales price was approximately $52,000.  The
buyer of these two properties assumed two non-recourse mortgages in the
cumulative amount of approximately $26,500, with a 6.5% fixed interest rate,
which matures in February 2009.  The Company's equity in income from the gain on
the sale of real estate was $2,000 and is presented as interest and other income
in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations.  The Company
contributed the assets to the joint venture in December 1999 at costs of
approximately $41,000.  In addition, the Company earned a fee in conjunction
with the sale of these assets in the amount of $1,110 and this fee is presented
as interest and other income in the accompanying consolidated statement of
operations. In the third quarter of 2002, the Company recognized an incentive
fee it earned related specifically to these two asset sales in the amount of
$475. Generally, profit and loss are allocated to the partners in accordance
with their ownership interests. In addition to its equity earnings, the Company
is entitled to management, redevelopment and development fees from the joint
venture and incentive payments based on the financial success of the joint venture.

The Company holds limited partnership interests in 17 partnerships which
collectively own ten multifamily properties, comprised of 1,831 units (Down REIT
entities). These investments were made under arrangements whereby Essex
Management Corporation (EMC) became the general partner, the Operating
Partnership became a special limited partner, and the other limited partners
were granted rights of redemption for their interests. Such partners can request
to be redeemed and the Company can elect to redeem their rights for cash or by
issuing shares of its common stock on a one unit per share basis. Redemption
values will be based on the market value of the Company's common stock at the
time of redemption multiplied by the number of units stipulated under the above
arrangements. The other limited partners receive distributions based on the
Company's current dividend rate times the number of redemption shares. The
equity in income or loss reported by the Company under the equity method of
accounting by these down REIT entities is the residual net income of these down
REIT entities after income has been allocated to the other limited partners
equal to the distributions they received.

In November 2001, the Company received a loan for approximately $6,800 from
Mountain Vista, LLC ("Mountain Vista"), which is due on December 1, 2011. The
Company recorded the loan as a reduction to the balance of the Company's
investment in Mountain Vista since the substance of the transaction was a
distribution from an equity method investee.

F-15

The Company has investments in two taxable REIT subsidiaries, EMC and Essex
Fidelity I Corporation (EFC). The Company has a 99% economic interest in these
entities through its ownership 100% of the nonvoting preferred stock. Executives
of the Company have a 1% economic interest through ownership of 100% of the
common stock and for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001 have not
received any form of compensation from this ownership interest. These entities
were formed for the purpose of acquiring, developing and managing real property
and are accounted for on the equity method of accounting. As of December 31,
2003, the majority of the assets owned by EFC are a 67-unit townhome community
and a 9.8 acre land parcel and the majority of the assets owned by EMC are 0.5%
to 1% general partnership interests in Down REIT entities and other single asset
entities in which the Company is the limited partner. EFC and EMC made these
investments by using proceeds from loans from the Company.

square foot office building located adjacent to the development site for $14,600.
In August 2000 the affiliate sold the office building to a third party for
$15,000. The Company loaned Derian Ave., LLC $15,000 as a secured first
mortgage on the property as noted above. In addition, after the buyer expended $500 for
such items as tenant improvements, leasing commissions, and carrying costs, the
Company agreed to lend an additional $4,500 to the buyer for these related
items, under a mezzanine loan, which is secured by a second deed of trust on the
property (the "Mezzanine Loan"). The recorded balance of the Mezzanine
Loan is approximately $4,459, of which the principal shareholder of the
buyer personally guarantees $1,700. The Company has evaluated the realization
potential of the first and mezzanine loans and, effective June 2002, ceased
accruing interest income on these notes until the timing of the borrower's cash
flow from the office building is more predictable. The loan matured in March
2003 and is in default. As of December 31, 2003, the owner leased 62.7% of the rentable
square footage for amounts acceptable to the Company. The Company has determined that the
current recorded balances due under these loans are properly valued.

Repayment of debt before the scheduled maturity date could result in prepayment penalties.

The Company has interest rate cap contracts in order to reduce
the risks associated with increases in interest rates on its tax exempt variable
rate demand bonds. The Company has the right to receive cash if interest rates
increase above a specified level. The purpose of the caps is to hedge the
exposure to variability in expected future interest cash flows above a fixed
interest rate, and, accordingly, they are accounted for as cash flow hedges
under SFAS 133. The Company determines the fair value of the caps and assesses
the ineffectiveness of the hedge based on changes in the time value of the caps.
As of December 31, 2003 and 2002, the Company's tax-exempt debt subject to cap agreements totaled
$75,296 and $59,420 at a weighted average interest rate of 2.9% and 2.6%, respectively. These
cap agreements have maturity dates ranging from 2004 to 2009. The cap agreements are accounted
for in accordance with SFAS No. 133, which as amended, was adopted by the Company on
January 1, 2001.  At December 31, 2003 and 2002, the Company was not a party to any other
interest rate protection agreements.

(8) Lines of Credit

The Company has two outstanding lines of credit for an aggregate amount
of $275,000. The first line, in the amount of $185,000, matures in May 2004,
with an option to extend it for one year thereafter. During the third quarter of
2003 the Company expanded this unsecured revolving credit facility to $185,000
from $165,000.  No other material terms of this facility were revised.
Outstanding balances under this line of credit bear interest at a rate, which
uses a tiered rate structure tied to the Company's corporate ratings, if any,
and leverage rating, which has been priced at LIBOR plus 1.10% during 2003 and 2002.
As of December 31, 2003 and 2002, the interest rate was approximately 2.1% and 2.6%,
respectively. At December 31, 2003 the Company had $12,500 outstanding on this line of credit.
On December 18, 2003, the Company obtained a 5-year, $90,000 credit facility from Freddie Mac,
secured by four of Essex's multifamily communities.  The aggregate maximum
principal amount of the facility is $90,000, increasing to $100,000 on July 1,
2004.  The Company borrowed $80,600 under this facility, comprised of two
tranches as follows: $41,000 locked for 60 days at a base rate of 1.586% (55
basis points over Freddie Mac's Reference Rate) and $39,600 locked for 180 days
at a base rate of 1.695% (59 basis points over Freddie Mac's Reference Rate).
This credit facility has a lower cost of borrowing as compared to the Company's
unsecured credit facility. The credit agreements contain debt covenants related
to limitations on indebtedness and liabilities, maintenance of minimum levels of
consolidated earnings before depreciation, interest and amortization and
maintenance of minimum tangible net worth.

(9) Lease Agreements

During the fourth quarter of 2003, the Company entered into
lease and purchase option agreements with unrelated third parties related to its
five recreational vehicle parks that are comprised of 1,717 spaces, and two
manufactured housing communities that contain 607 sites.  Based on the
agreements, the unrelated third parties have an option to purchase the assets in
approximately four years for approximately $41,700 - a 5% premium to the gross
book value of the assets. The Company received $474 as consideration for
entering into the option agreement. The option premium of $4,030 has been recorded
as deferred revenue and has been classified with accounts payable and
accrued liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Under the
lease agreements Essex is to receive a fixed monthly lease payment in addition to
a non-refundable upfront payment that will be amortized using the straight-line
method over approximately five years (the life of the lease).  These operating
leases also provide for the Company to pass through all executory costs such as
property tax.

The Company is a lessor under a land lease associated with two properties located in
Southern California. The land leases entitle the Company to receive fixed annual land
lease payments totaling a minimum of $1,569 over a thirty-four year term ended 2034.
The Company has the option to purchase the properties in 2006 or can be required to sell
the land in 2006 as specified in the buyout provisions of the agreement.

The future minimum non-cancelable base rent to be received under
these operating leases for each of the years ending after December 31, 2003 are
summarized as follows:

                                   ===========

The carrying value of the rental properties as of December 31, 2003 is $50,298.

(10) Equity Transactions

As of December 31, 2003, the Company, either directly or through the
Operating Partnership, has the following cumulative redeemable preferred
securities outstanding.

  7.8125% Series F      September 2003  1,000,000 share    $   25,000

Dividends on the securities are payable quarterly. The holders
of the securities do not have any voting rights. The Company has the right to
redeem the units on the fifth anniversary after the issue date. The Series B, D,
and E preferred units represent preferred interests issued by the Operating
Partnership and are therefore included in minority interests in the accompanying
consolidated balance sheet.

On July 30, 2003, in connection with the Company's acquisition, by
merger, of John M. Sachs, Inc. ("Sachs") that was completed on
December 17, 2002, and under the terms of the merger agreement, a final analysis
was prepared, which indicated that the actual net liabilities of Sachs were less
than the net liabilities of Sachs estimated to be outstanding as of the merger
date.  Based on the final analysis and as a post-closing adjustment payment
pursuant to the merger agreement, the Company made a final payment
of approximately $1,766 in cash and issued an additional 35,860 shares of
common stock valued at $2,170 to certain of the pre-merger shareholders of Sachs.

On September 23, 2003, the Company issued 1,000,000 shares of its Series F
Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock ("Series F Preferred Stock") at
a fixed price of $24.664 per share, a discount from the $25.00 per share
liquidation value of the shares.  The shares do not begin to accrue a
dividend until November 25, 2003, and, following that date, will pay quarterly
distributions at an annualized rate of 7.8125% per year of the liquidation value
and will be redeemable by the Company on or after September 23, 2008.  The
Company amortized the original discount in connection with the issuance of these
shares in the fourth quarter of 2003, resulting in a charge of approximately
$336.  The shares were issued pursuant to the Company's existing shelf
registration statement.  The Company used the net proceeds from this sale
of Series F Preferred Stock to redeem all of the 9.125% Series C Cumulative
Redeemable Preferred Units (the "Series C Preferred Units") of Essex
Portfolio, L.P., of which the Company is the general partner.

On October 6, 2003, the Company sold 1.6 million newly issued shares of
common stock and received offering proceeds (before expenses) of $60.67 per
share, representing a 3.25% discount to the common stock's closing price on
September 30, 2003, the date of the underwriting agreement between the Company
and the underwriter, pursuant to which the shares were sold.  The shares
were issued pursuant to the Company's existing shelf registration
statement.  The proceeds of the offering of approximately $97,072 is
expected to be used for the acquisition of multifamily communities located in
the Company's targeted West Coast markets and may also be used for general
corporate purposes, including the repayment of debt and the funding of
development activities.

On October 14, 2003, the Company issued a notice of redemption to the holders
of its 9.125% Series C Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Units.  Pursuant to the
provisions of the Amended and Restated Agreement of Limited Partnership of Essex
Portfolio, L.P., the Company redeemed all outstanding Series C Preferred Units
on November 24, 2003.  In connection with this redemption the Company incurred a
non-cash charge of $625 related to the write-off of the issuance costs.

In January 2004, the Company restructured its previously issued $50,000,
9.30% Series D Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Units ("Series D
Units"), and its previously issued $80,000, 7.875% Series B Cumulative
Redeemable Preferred Units ("Series B Units").  The existing
distribution rate of 9.30% of the Series D Units will continue until July 27,
2004 - the end of the current non-call period.  On July 28, 2004, the
distribution rate on the Series D Units will be reduced to 7.875%.  The date
that the Series D Units can first be redeemed at the Company's option will be
extended by six years to July 28, 2010.  The dates that the Series B Units can
first be redeemed at the Company's option will be extended from February 6, 2003
to December 31, 2009.

2,269,064, 2,281,848 and 2,236,491 for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002
and 2001, respectively, were not included because they were anti-dilutive.

(2)	The following stock options are not included in the diluted earnings
per share calculation because the exercise price of the option was greater than
the average market price of the common shares for the year and, therefore, the
effect would be anti-dilutive:

(12) Stock Based Compensation Plans

The Essex Property Trust, Inc. 1994 Stock Incentive Plan provides
incentives to attract and retain officers, directors and key employees. The
Stock Incentive Plan provides for the grants of options to purchase a specified
number of shares of common stock or grants of restricted shares of common stock.
Under the Stock Incentive Plan, the total number of shares available for grant
is approximately 1,375,400. The Board of Directors (the Board) may adjust the
aggregate number and type of shares reserved for issuance. Participants in the
Stock Incentive Plans are selected by the Stock Incentive Plan Committee of the
Board, which is comprised of independent directors. The Compensation Committee
is authorized to establish the exercise price; however, the exercise price
cannot be less than 100% of the fair market value of the common stock on the
grant date. The Company's options have a life of ten years. Option grants fully
vest between one year and five years after the grant date.

In connection with the Company's 1994 initial public offering, the Company provided
a one-time grant of options to Marcus & Millichap ("MM") to purchase 220,000 shares of
common stock at the initial public offering price of $19.50 per share pursuant to an agreement
whereby Marcus & Millichap Real Estate Investment Brokerage Company, a subsidiary of MM,
will provide real estate transaction, trend and other information to the Operating
Partnership for a period of ten years. In February 2002, MM exercised and sold the shares
underlying this one-time grant. This option was exercised in a "cashless" transaction
pursuant to FAS 123, whereby MM was issued 129,302 shares of Company common stock based on
the current market price of the Company's common stock of $47.30 at the time of exercise.

The Company has also reserved 406,500 shares of common stock in connection
with the Essex Property Trust, Inc. 1994 Employee Stock Purchase Plan. There was
no activity in this plan during 2003, 2002, and 2001.

On June 28, 2001, the Operating Partnership issued 200,000
Series Z Incentive Units of limited partner interest (the "Series Z
Incentive Units") to eleven senior executives of the Company in exchange
for a capital commitment of $1.00 per Series Z Incentive Unit, for an aggregate
offering price of $200. Upon certain triggering events, the Series Z Incentive
Units will automatically convert into common Operating Partnership units based
on a conversion ratio that may increase over time upon satisfaction of specific
conditions. The conversion ratio, initially set at zero, will increase by 10%
(20% in 2002) on January 1 of each year for each participating executive who
remains employed by the Company if the Company has met a specified "funds
from operations" per share target for the prior year, up to a maximum
conversion ratio of 1.0. The conversion ratio as of January 1, 2002 was 20%,
which resulted in 40,000 Series Z Incentive Units being convertible into up to
an equal amount of common Operating Partnership Units. On January 1, 2003, the
conversion ratio increased by 8%, to 28% based on the approval of the Board of
Directors. In certain change of control situations, the participating executives
will also be given the option to convert their units at the then-effective
conversion ratio. In addition, the Operating Partnership has the option to
redeem Series Z Incentive Units held by any executive whose employment has been
terminated for any reason and the obligation to redeem any such units following
the death of the holder. In such event, the Operating Partnership will redeem
the units for, at its option, either common Operating Partnership units or
shares of the Company's common stock based on the then-effective conversion ratio.

Through December 31, 2003, the Company has granted 42,586 stock units under
the Company's Phantom Stock Unit Agreement to two of the Company's executives.
The units vest in installments in accordance with the vesting schedule set forth
in the Phantom Stock Unit Agreement such that the units will be fully vested
five years from the date of issuance. At that time, the Company expects to issue
to the executives the number of shares of common stock equal to the number of
units vested, or at the Company's option, an equivalent amount in cash. The
Company has historically chosen the cash payment option at the end of each year
since inception of the agreement. Dividends are paid by the Company on the
vested and unvested portion of shares and are recorded as a component of general
and administrative expense.

(13) Shareholder Rights Plan

On November 12, 1998, the Company's Board of Directors adopted a
Stockholder Rights Plan. A dividend of one right (a Right) per share of common
stock was distributed to stockholders of record on November 21, 1998. Each
Right, expiring November 11, 2008, represents a right to buy from the Company
1/100th of a share of Series A junior participating preferred stock at a price
of $99.13 per Right.

Generally the Rights will not be exercisable unless a person or group
acquires 15% or more, or announces an offer that could result in acquiring 15%
or more, of the Company's common stock unless such person is or becomes the
beneficial owner of 15% or more of the Company's outstanding common stock and
had a contractual right or the approval of the Company's Board of Directors,
provided that such percentage shall not be greater than 19.9%. Following an
acquisition of 15% or more of the Company's common stock, each Right holder,
except the 15% or more shareholder, has the right to receive, upon exercise,
shares of common stock valued at twice the then applicable exercise price of the
Right, unless the 15% or more shareholder has offered to acquire all of the
outstanding shares of the Company under terms that a majority of the independent
directors of the Company have determined to be fair and in the best interest of
the Company and its shareholders.

Similarly, unless certain conditions are met, if the Company engages in a
merger or other business combination following a stock acquisition where it does
not survive or survives with a change or exchange of its common stock or if 50%
or more of its assets, earning power or cash flow is sold or transferred, the
Rights will become exercisable for shares of the acquiror's stock having a value
of twice the exercise price.

Generally, Rights may be redeemed for $0.01 each (in cash, common stock or
other consideration the Company deems appropriate) until the tenth day following
a public announcement that a 15% or greater position has been acquired of the
Company's stock.

(14) Segment Information

In accordance with FASB No. 131,

Disclosures about Segments of an
Enterprise and Related Information,

the Company defines its reportable operating
segments as the three geographical regions in which its multifamily residential
properties are located: Northern California, Southern California, and the
Pacific Northwest.

Nonsegment revenues and net operating income included in the following
schedule consist of revenue generated from the commercial properties,
recreational vehicle parks, and manufactured housing communities. Also excluded
from segment revenues are interest and other corporate income. Other nonsegment
assets include investments, real estate under development, cash, notes
receivables, other assets and deferred charges.

The accounting policies of the segments are the same as those described in
note 2. The Company evaluates performance based upon net operating income from
the combined properties in each segment.

(15) 401(k) Plan

The Company has a 401(k) benefit plan (the plan) for all full-time employees who have
completed six months of service. Employees may contribute up to 23% of their compensation,
limited by the maximum allowed under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code. The Company
matches the employee contributions for nonhighly compensated personnel, up to 50% of their
contribution to a maximum of $.5 (per individual) per year. Company
contributions to the Plan were approximately $93, $107, and $116 for the years
ended December 31, 2003, 2002, and 2001.

(16) Fair Value of Financial Instruments

Management believes that the carrying amounts of its variable rate
mortgage notes payable, lines of credit, notes receivable from investees and
other related parties and notes and other receivables approximate fair value as
of December 31, 2003 and 2002, because interest rates, yields and other terms
for these instruments are consistent with yields and other terms currently
available to the Company for similar instruments. Management has estimated that
the fair value of the Company's $663,833 of fixed rate mortgage notes payable at
December 31, 2003 is approximately $632,111 based on the terms of existing
mortgage notes payable compared to those available in the marketplace.  At
December 31, 2002, the Company's fixed rate mortgage notes payable of $618,143
had an approximate market value of $576,894.  Management believes that the
carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, accounts payable
and accrued liabilities, other liabilities and dividends payable approximate
fair value as of December 31, 2003 and 2002 due to the short-term maturity of
these instruments.

(17) Commitments and Contingencies

The Company had no outstanding material letters of credit relating to
financing and development transactions as of December 31, 2003.

The Company was in compliance with its line of credit covenant as of December 31, 2003.

The Company is involved in various lawsuits arising out of the ordinary
course of business and certain other legal matters. In the opinion of
management, the resolution of these matters will not have a material adverse
effect on the Company's financial position, results of operations or liquidity.

Except with respect to three Properties, the Company has no indemnification agreements from
third parties for potential environmental clean-up costs at its Properties. The Company
has no way of determining at this time the magnitude of any potential liability to which it may
be subject arising out of unknown environmental conditions or violations with respect to the
properties formerly owned by the Company. No assurance can be given that existing environmental
studies with respect to any of the Properties reveal all environmental liabilities, that any
prior owner or operator of a Property did not create any material environmental condition not
known to the Company, or that a material environmental condition does not otherwise exist as
to any one or more of the Properties. The Company has limited insurance coverage for the types
of environmental liabilities described above.

The Company may enter into transactions that could require us to pay the tax liabilities
of the partners in the Down REIT entities, which are within our control. Although the Company
plans to hold the contributed assets to defer recognition of gain on their sale pursuant to
like-kind exchange rules under Section 1031 of the Internal Revenue Code we can provide no
assurance that will be able to do so and if such tax liabilities were incurred they can expect
to have a material impact on our financial position.
