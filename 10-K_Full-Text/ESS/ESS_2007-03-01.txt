OVERVIEW

Essex
            Property Trust, Inc. (“Essex” or the “Company”) is a Maryland corporation that
            operates as a self-administered and self-managed real estate investment
            trust
            (“REIT”). Essex owns all of its interest in its real properties directly or
            indirectly through Essex Portfolio, L.P. (the “Operating Partnership”). Essex is
            the sole general partner of the Operating Partnership and as of December
            31,
            2006 owns a 90.4% general partnership interest. In this report, the terms
“we,”
“us” and “our” refer to Essex Property Trust, its Operating Partnership and
            their subsidiaries.

The
            Company has elected to be treated as a REIT for federal income tax purposes,
            commencing with the year ended December 31, 1994 as the Company completed
            an
            initial public offering on June 13, 1994. In order to maintain compliance
            with
            REIT tax rules, the Company utilizes taxable REIT subsidiaries (“TRS”) for
            various revenue generating or investment activities. The TRSs are consolidated
            by the Company.

We
            are
            engaged primarily in the ownership, operation, management, acquisition,
            development and redevelopment of real estate. The majority of our real
            estate
            consists of apartment communities. As of December 31, 2006, we owned
            or held an
            interest in 130 apartment communities, aggregating 27,553 units, located
            predominantly along the West Coast (collectively, the “Properties”, and
            individually, a “Property”). Our other properties included two recreational
            vehicle parks (totaling 338 spaces), three office buildings (totaling
            approximately 166,340 square feet), which the Company primarily occupies
            and
            uses as office space, and one manufactured housing community (containing
            pads). We currently have five development projects, with 908 units in
            various
            stages of development (together with the Properties, the
“Portfolio”).

BUSINESS
            OBJECTIVES AND STRATEGIES

The
            following is a discussion of our business objectives and strategies in
            regards
            to real estate investment and management. One or more of these criteria
            may be
            amended or rescinded from time to time without stockholder vote.

Business
            Objectives

Our
            primary business objectives are to increase shareholders’ value by investing in
            properties located in supply constrained markets, and by improving operating
            results and the value of our Properties, while maintaining a strong balance
            sheet. We intend to achieve these objectives by:

·

Pursuing
                    an occupancy and rent rate growth strategy that capitalizes on
                    the
                    locations of our Properties;

·

Expanding
                    our Portfolio through acquisitions, development and, when appropriate,
                    re-development of apartment communities in selected major metropolitan
                    areas;

·

Optimizing
                    financial performance through a portfolio asset allocation program,
                    and to
                    increase or decrease investments in a market based on projected
                    changes in
                    regional economic and local market conditions;
                    and

·

Maintaining
                    a conservative leverage ratio by identifying and utilizing capital
                    resources that provide a lower cost of
                    capital.

We
            cannot
            assure our shareholders that we will achieve our business
            objectives.


Business
            Strategies

Research
            Driven Approach

-

We
            believe that successful real estate investment decisions and portfolio
            growth
            begin with extensive regional economic research and local market knowledge.
            Utilizing a proprietary research model that we have developed over the
            last two
            decades, we continually assess markets where we currently operate, as
            well as
            markets where we consider future investment opportunities by evaluating:

·

Markets
                    in major metropolitan areas that have regional population primarily
                    in
                    excess of one million, thereby creating liquidity, which is an
                    important
                    element when modifying the geographic concentration of the Company’s
                    portfolio in response to changing market
                    conditions;

·

Demand
                    for housing that is greater than supply driven by: (i) low availability
                    of
                    developable land sites where competing housing could be built;
                    (ii)
                    political growth barriers, such as protected land, urban growth
                    boundaries, and potential lengthy and expensive development permit
                    processes; and (iii) natural limitations to development, such
                    as mountains
                    or waterways;

·

Markets
                    where rental demand is enhanced by expensive for-sale housing;
                    and

·

Housing
                    demand that is based on proximity to jobs, high quality of life
                    and
                    related commuting factors, as well as potential job
                    growth.

Recognizing
            that all real estate markets are cyclical, we regularly evaluate the
            results of
            our regional economic, as well as, our local market research and adjust
            the
            geographic focus of our portfolio accordingly. We seek to increase our
            portfolio
            allocation in markets projected to have the strongest local economies
            and to
            decrease such allocations in markets projected to have declining economic
            conditions. Likewise, the Company also seeks to increase its portfolio
            allocation in markets that have attractive property valuations and to
            decrease
            such allocations in markets that have inflated valuations and low relative
            yields.

Property
            Operations

- We
            manage our Properties by focusing on strategies that will generate above-average
            rental growth, tenant retention/satisfaction and long-term asset appreciation.
            We intend to achieve this by utilizing the strategies set forth
            below:

·

Property
                    Management

-

The
                    Chief Operating Officer, Divisional Managers, Regional Portfolio
                    Managers
                    and Area Managers are accountable for the performance and maintenance
                    of
                    the Properties. They supervise, provide training for the on-site
                    managers,
                    manage budgeted expectations against performance, monitor market
                    trends
                    and prepare operating and capital
                    budgets.

·

Capital
                    Preservation -

The Capital and Maintenance department is responsible for the
                    planning,
                    budgeting, and completion of major deferred maintenance and capital
                    improvement projects at our Properties.

·

Business
                    Planning and Control -

Comprehensive
                    business plans are implemented in conjunction with every investment
                    decision. These plans include benchmarks for future financial
                    performance,
                    based on collaborative discussions between on-site managers and
                    senior
                    management.

·

Development
                    and Redevelopment -

We
                    focus on acquiring and developing apartment communities in supply
                    constrained markets, and redeveloping our existing communities
                    to improve
                    the financial and physical aspects of our
                    communities.

CURRENT
            BUSINESS ACTIVITIES

Acquisitions

Acquisitions
            have been a significant growth component of our business. During 2006,
            we
            completed a series of acquisitions that added to our overall
            Portfolio.

·

In
                    January 2006, the Company acquired two apartment communities
                    - Chimney
                    Sweep and CBC, aggregating 239 units, located in Goleta, California
                    for a
                    combined price of approximately $57.1
                    million.

·

In
                    September 2006, the Company acquired Hillsdale Garden, a 697-unit
                    apartment community located in San Mateo, California for approximately
                    $97.3 million. The property is subject to a ground lease with
                    annual
                    payments of $46,000 that will expire in
                    2047.

·

In
                    October 2006, the Company acquired Belmont Terrace, a 71-unit
                    apartment
                    community located in Belmont, California for approximately $14.7
                    million
                    in a transaction structured as an UpREIT.

In
                December 2006, the Company acquired Camino Ruiz Square, a 160-unit
                apartment
                community located in Camarillo, California for approximately 
                $32.9 million.


Dispositions

As
            part
            of our strategic plan to own quality real estate in supply-constrained markets,
            we continually evaluate our Properties and sell those which no longer
            meet our
            strategic criteria. We may use the capital generated from the dispositions
            to
            invest in higher-return Properties or repay debts. We believe that the
            sale of
            these Properties will not have a material impact on our future results
            of
            operations or cash flows nor will their sale materially affect our ongoing
            operations. Generally, any impact of earnings dilution resulting from
            these
            dispositions will be offset by the positive impact of our acquisitions,
            development and redevelopment activities.

·

In
                    January 2006, the Company sold Vista Capri East and Casa Tierra
                    apartment
                    communities for approximately $7.0 million and in March 2006,
                    the Company
                    sold Diamond Valley Recreational Vehicle Park for approximately
                    $1.3
                    million, for a combined gain of $3.1
                    million.

·

In
                    June 2006, the unconsolidated joint venture property, Vista Pointe,
                    a
                    286-unit apartment community located in Anaheim, California,
                    was sold for
                    approximately $46 million. The Company’s share of the proceeds from the
                    transaction totaled $19.3 million, resulting in an $8.8 million
                    gain on
                    the sale, and $8.2 million for fees and a promote
                    distribution.

·

In
                    December 2006, the Company sold Emerald Palms, a 152-unit apartment
                    community located in San Diego for approximately $20.5 million,
                    for a gain
                    of approximately $6.7 million.

·

                    Point
                    property, a TRS, in Issaquah, Washington. In April 2006, the
                    property was
                    reclassified from a rental property to real estate under development.
                    During the third and fourth quarters of 2006, the Company sold
                    45 of the
                    66 available condominiums, for an aggregate gain of $2.0 million,
                    net of
                    taxes and expenses. The 21 remaining units are expected to be
                    sold in the
                    first four months of 2007.

                    party for a
                    gain in February 2007.

Development
            and Predevelopment Pipeline

The
            Company defines development activities as new properties that are being
            constructed, or are newly constructed and, in the case of development
            communities, are in a phase of lease-up and have not yet reached stabilized
            operations; or, in the case of TRS development projects, have not yet
            been sold.
            As of December 31, 2006, the Company had two development projects comprised
            of
            513 units for an estimated cost of $167.3 million, of which $126.9 million
            remains to be expended (excluding

development
            projects owned by

Essex
            Apartment Value Fund II, L.P.). The Company also incurred $0.7 million
            in costs
            related to a joint venture development with a third-party.

The
            Company defines the predevelopment pipeline as new properties in negotiation
            or
            in the entitlement process with a high likelihood of becoming development
            activities. As of December 31, 2006, the Company had development communities
            aggregating 1,845 units that were classified as predevelopment projects.
            The
            estimated total cost of the predevelopment pipeline at December 31, 2006
            is
            $557.0 million, of which $514.8 million remains to be expended. The Company
            had
            four other development projects owned by TRS entities that are under
            development
            aggregating 120 units. The estimated total cost of the other development
            projects at December 31, 2006 is $42.0 million, of which $21.8 million
            remains
            to be expended. The following table sets forth information regarding
            the
            Company’s development pipeline:

(1)

Includes
                    incurred costs and estimated costs to complete these development
                    projects.


Redevelopment
            Pipeline

The
            Company defines redevelopment communities as existing properties owned
            or
            recently acquired, which have been targeted for additional investment
            by the
            Company with the expectation of increased financial returns through property
            improvement. During redevelopment, apartment units may not be available
            for rent
            and, as a result, may have less than stabilized operations. As of December
            31,
            2006, the Company had ownership interests in twelve major redevelopment
            communities aggregating 3,648 apartment units with estimated redevelopment
            costs
            of $90.2 million, of which approximately $51.2 million remains to be
            expended.
            These amounts exclude redevelopment projects owned by Fund II. The following
            table illustrates these redevelopment projects:

(1)

Includes
                    incurred costs and estimated costs to complete these redevelopment
                    projects.

Debt
            Transactions

In
            January 2006, the Company originated a mortgage loan secured by the Fairwood
            Pond apartment community in the amount of $14.9 million, with a fixed
            interest
            rate of 5.31%, which matures on February 1, 2015.

In
            March
            2006, the Company paid-off a loan secured by the Windsor Ridge apartment
            community in the amount of $11.6 million, with a fixed interest rate
            of 7.09%.

In
            March
            2006, the Company renegotiated its revolving line of credit to increase
            the
            maximum principal amount to $200 million from $185 million. Additionally,
            the
            maturity date was extended from April 2007 to March 2009, with an option
            for a
            one-year extension, and the underlying rate, based on a tiered rate structure
            tied to the Company’s corporate ratings, was reduced to LIBOR plus 0.8% from
            LIBOR plus 1.0%.

Derivative
            Transactions

As
            of
            December 31, 2006 the Company had entered into forward-starting interest
            rate
            swaps totaling a notional amount of $450 million with interest rates
            ranging
            from 4.9% to 5.9% and settlements dates ranging from April 2007 to July
            2011.
            These derivatives qualify for hedge accounting and will economically
            hedge the
            cash flows associated with the refinancing of debt that matures between
            April
            2007 and July 2011. The decrease in the fair value of these derivatives
            during
            the year ended December 31, 2006 was approximately $2.9 million and is
            reflected
            in accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income in the Company’s consolidated
            financial statements. No hedge ineffectiveness on cash flow hedges was
            recognized during the year ended December 31, 2006.

Equity
            Transactions

During
            the third quarter of 2006, the Company sold 5,980,000 shares of 4.875%
            Series G
            Cumulative Convertible Preferred Stock for gross proceeds of $149.5 million.
            Holders may convert Series G Preferred Stock into shares of


the
              Company’s common stock subject to certain conditions. The conversion rate will
              initially be .1830 shares of common stock per the $25 per share liquidation
              preference, which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately
              $136.62 per share of common stock. The conversion rate will be subject
              to
              adjustment upon the occurrence of specified events. On or after July
              31, 2011,
              the Company may, under certain circumstances, cause some or all of
              the Series G
              Preferred Stock to be converted into that number of shares of common
              stock at
              the then prevailing conversion rate.

The
              Company used the net proceeds from the Series G offering to pay down
              outstanding
              borrowings under the Company’s lines of credit, to fund the development pipeline
              and for general corporate purposes.

During
              2006, the Company issued and sold approximately 427,700 shares of common
              stock
              for $48.3 million, net of fees and commissions, under its Controlled
              Equity
              Offering program. Under this program, the Company may from time to
              time sell
              shares of common stock into the existing trading market at current
              market
              prices, and the Company used the net proceeds from such sales to primarily
              fund
              real estate investments.

ESSEX
              APARTMENT VALUE FUNDS

Essex
              Apartment Value Fund, L.P. ("Fund I" and “Fund II”), are investment funds formed
              by the Company to add value through rental growth and asset appreciation,
              utilizing the Company's development, redevelopment and asset management
              capabilities. All of the assets in Fund I were sold during 2004 and
              2005, and
              Fund I is in the process of liquidation.

Fund
              II
              has eight institutional investors, including the Company, with combined
              partner
              equity commitments of $265.9 million. Essex has committed $75.0 million
              to Fund
              II, which represents a 28.2% interest as general partner and limited
              partner.
              Fund II expects to utilize leverage equal to approximately 65% of the
              estimated
              value of the underlying real estate. Fund II invests in apartment communities
              in
              the Company’s targeted West Coast markets with an emphasis on investment
              opportunities in the Seattle metropolitan area and the San Francisco
              Bay Area.
              Subject to certain exceptions, Fund II has been Essex’s primary investment
              vehicle during 2005 and 2006. As of October 2006, Fund II was fully
              invested and
              closed for any future acquisitions or development. As of December 31,
              2006, Fund
              II owned 11 apartment communities and 3 development projects. Consistent
              with
              Fund I, Essex records revenue for its asset management, property management,
              development and redevelopment services when earned, and promote income
              if Fund
              II exceeds certain financial return benchmarks.

Fund
              II - Acquisitions

During
              2006, Fund II acquired the following apartment communities:

·

Davey
                      Glen, in April 2006, a 69-unit apartment community located
                      in Belmont,
                      California for approximately $13.5
                      million.

·

Renaissance,
                      in September 2006, a 168-unit apartment community located in
                      Los Angeles,
                      California for approximately $46.3
                      million.

·

Alderwood
                      Park, in September 2006, a 96-unit apartment community located
                      in Newark,
                      California for approximately $13.4 million.

Fund
              II - Development Pipeline

As
              of
              December 31, 2006, the following table sets forth information regarding
              Fund
              II’s development pipeline:

Includes
                incurred costs and estimated costs to complete these development
                projects.


OFFICES
                AND EMPLOYEES

The
                Company is headquartered in Palo Alto, California, and has regional
                offices in
                Woodland Hills, California; Irvine, California; San Diego, California;
                Bellevue,
                Washington; and Portland, Oregon. As of December 31, 2006, the Company
                had
                approximately 869 employees.

INSURANCE

The
                Company carries comprehensive liability, fire, extended coverage
                and rental loss
                insurance for each of the Properties. There are, however, certain
                types of
                extraordinary losses, such as, for example, losses from terrorism
                or earthquake,
                for which the Company does not have insurance coverage.

Substantially
                all of the Properties are located in areas that are subject to earthquake
                activity. The Company believes it has a proactive approach to its
                potential
                earthquake losses. The Company utilizes third-party seismic consultants
                for its
                acquisitions and performs seismic upgrades to those acquisitions
                that are
                determined to have a higher level of potential loss from an earthquake.
                The
                Company utilizes internal and third-party loss models to help to
                determine its
                exposure. In addition, the majority of the Company’s Properties are lower
                density garden-style apartments which may be less susceptible to
                earthquake
                damage. The Company will continue to monitor third-party earthquake
                insurance
                pricing and conditions and may consider obtaining third-party coverage
                if it
                deems it cost effective in the future.

Although
                the Company may carry insurance for potential losses associated with
                its
                Properties, employees, residents, and compliance with applicable
                laws, it may
                still incur losses due to uninsured risks, deductibles, co-payments
                or losses in
                excess of applicable insurance coverage and those losses may be
                material.

COMPETITION

There
                are
                numerous housing alternatives that compete

with
                our
                apartment communities in attracting residents. These include other
                apartment
                communities and single-family homes that are available for rent in
                the markets
                in which the properties are located. The Properties also compete
                for residents
                with new and existing homes and condominiums that are for sale. If
                the demand
                for our Properties is reduced or if competitors develop and/or acquire
                competing
                properties on a more cost-effective basis, rental rates and occupancy
                may drop,
                which may have a material adverse affect on our financial condition
                and results
                of operations.

We
                face
                competition from other real estate investment trusts, businesses
                and other
                entities in the acquisition, development and operation of properties.
                Some of
                the competitors are larger and have greater financial resources than
                we do. This
                competition may result in increased costs of properties we acquire
                and/or
                develop.

WORKING
                CAPITAL

We
                believe that cash flows generated by our operations, existing cash
                balances,
                availability under existing lines of credit, access to capital markets
                and the
                ability to generate cash gains from the disposition of real estate
                are
                sufficient to meet all of our reasonably anticipated cash needs during
                2007. The
                timing, source and amounts of cash flows provided by financing activities
                and
                used in investing activities are sensitive to changes in interest
                rates and
                other fluctuations in the capital markets environment, which can
                affect our
                plans for acquisitions, dispositions, development and redevelopment
                activities.

ENVIRONMENTAL
                CONSIDERATIONS

See
                the
                discussion under the caption, “Possible environmental liabilities” in Item 1A,
                Risk Factors, for information concerning the potential effect of
                environmental
                regulations on our operations.

OTHER
                MATTERS

Certain
                Policies of the Company

We
                intend
                to continue to operate in a manner that will not subject us to regulation
                under
                the Investment Company Act of 1940. The Company has in the past five
                years and
                may in the future (i) issue securities senior to its common stock,
                (ii) fund
                acquisition activities with borrowings under its line of credit and
                (iii) offer
                shares of common stock and/or units of limited partnership interest
                in the
                Operating Partnership or affiliated partnerships as partial consideration
                for
                property acquisitions. The Company from time to time acquires partnership
                interests in partnerships and joint ventures, either directly or
                indirectly
                through subsidiaries of the Company, when such entities'

underlying
                assets are real estate. In general, the Company does not (i) underwrite
                securities of other issuers or (ii) actively trade in loans or other
                investments.


We
                  invest
                  primarily in apartment communities that are located in predominantly
                  coastal
                  markets within Southern California, the San Francisco Bay Area,
                  and parts of the
                  Pacific Northwest. The Company currently intends to continue to
                  invest in
                  apartment communities in such regions. However, these practices
                  may be reviewed
                  and modified periodically by management.

Item
                  1A. Risk Factors

Our
                  business, operating results, cash flows and financial conditions
                  are subject to
                  various risks and uncertainties, including, without limitation,
                  those set forth
                  below, any one of which could cause our actual results to vary
                  materially from
                  recent results or from our anticipated future results.

We
                  depend on our key personnel

- Our
                  success depends on our ability to attract and retain executive
                  officers, senior
                  officers and company managers. There is substantial competition
                  for qualified
                  personnel in the real estate industry and the loss of several of
                  our key
                  personnel could have an adverse effect on us.

Debt
                  financing

- At
                  December 31, 2006, we had approximately $1.41 billion of indebtedness
                  (including
                  $186.3 million of variable rate indebtedness, of which $182.8 million
                  is subject
                  to interest rate protection agreements). We are subject to the
                  risks normally
                  associated with debt financing, including the following:

·

cash
                          flow may not be sufficient to meet required payments of
                          principal and
                          interest;

·

inability
                          to refinance maturing indebtedness on encumbered properties;

·

the
                          terms of any refinancing may not be as favorable as the
                          terms of existing
                          indebtedness;

·

inability
                          to comply with debt covenants could cause an acceleration
                          of the maturity
                          date; and

·

repaying
                          debt before the scheduled maturity date could result in
                          prepayment
                          penalties.

Uncertainty
                  of our ability to refinance balloon payments

- As of
                  December 31, 2006, we had approximately $1.41 billion of mortgage
                  debt,
                  exchangeable bonds and line of credit borrowings, most of which
                  are subject to
                  balloon payments. We do not expect to have sufficient cash flows
                  from operations
                  to make all of these balloon payments. These mortgages, bonds and
                  lines of
                  credit borrowings have the following scheduled principal and balloon
                  payments:

2007--$69.1
                  million;

2008--$179.5
                  million;

2009--$24.6
                  million;

2010--$156.9
                  million;

2011--$155.5
                  million;

Thereafter--$733.0
                  million.

We
                  may
                  not be able to refinance such mortgage indebtedness, bonds, or
                  lines of credit.
                  The Properties subject to these mortgages could be foreclosed upon
                  or otherwise
                  transferred to the lender. This could cause us to lose income and
                  asset value.
                  We may be required to refinance the debt at higher interest rates
                  or on terms
                  that may not be as favorable as the terms of existing indebtedness.

Debt
                  financing on properties may result in insufficient cash
                  flow

- Where
                  possible, we intend to continue to use leverage to increase the
                  rate of return
                  on our investments and to provide for additional investments that
                  we could not
                  otherwise make. There is a risk that the cash flow from the properties
                  will be
                  insufficient to meet both debt payment obligations and the distribution
                  requirements of the real estate investment trust provisions of
                  the Internal
                  Revenue Code. We may obtain additional debt financing in the future,
                  through
                  mortgages on some or all of the properties. These mortgages may
                  be recourse,
                  non-recourse, or cross-collateralized.

As
                  of
                  December 31, 2006, Essex had 69 of its 118 consolidated apartment
                  communities
                  encumbered by debt. Of the 69 properties, 53 are secured by deeds
                  of trust
                  relating solely to those properties. With respect to the remaining
                  properties, there are 4 cross-collateralized mortgages secured
                  by 8 properties,
                  6 properties, 3 properties and 2 properties, respectively. The
                  holders of this
                  indebtedness will have claims against these properties and, to
                  the extent
                  indebtedness is cross-collateralized, lenders may seek to foreclose
                  upon
                  properties, which are not the primary collateral for their loan.
                  This may
                  accelerate other indebtedness secured by properties. Foreclosure
                  of properties
                  would reduce our income and net asset value.

Risk
                  of rising interest rates

-

Current
                  interest rates could potentially increase rapidly, which could
                  result in higher

interest
                  expense on our variable rate indebtedness. Prolonged interest rate
                  increases
                  could negatively impact our ability to make acquisitions and develop properties
                  at economic returns on investment and our ability to refinance
                  existing
                  borrowings at acceptable rates.


As
                    of
                    December 31, 2006, we had approximately $186.3 million of long-term
                    variable
                    rate indebtedness bearing interest at floating rates tied to
                    the rate of
                    short-term tax-exempt revenue bonds (which mature at various
                    dates from 2020
                    through 2034), and $93.0 million of variable rate indebtedness
                    under our lines
                    of credit, bearing interest at the Freddie Mac Reference Rate
                    plus from 0.55% to
                    0.59%. Approximately $182.8 million of the long-term indebtedness
                    is subject to
                    interest rate cap protection agreements, which may reduce the
                    risks associated
                    with fluctuations in interest rates. The remaining $34.0 million
                    of long-term
                    variable rate indebtedness was not subject to any interest rate
                    cap protection
                    agreements as of December 31, 2006. An increase in interest rates
                    may have an
                    adverse effect on our net income and results of operations.

Risk
                    of losses on interest rate hedging arrangements

-
                    Periodically, we have entered into agreements to reduce the risks
                    associated
                    with increases in interest rates, and may continue to do so.
                    Although these
                    agreements may partially protect against rising interest rates,
                    they also may
                    reduce the benefits to us if interest rates decline. If a hedging
                    arrangement is
                    not indexed to the same rate as the indebtedness that is hedged,
                    we may be
                    exposed to losses to the extent that the rate governing the indebtedness
                    and the
                    rate governing the hedging arrangement change independently of
                    each other.
                    Finally, nonperformance by the other party to the hedging arrangement
                    may
                    subject us to increased credit risks. In order to minimize counterparty
                    credit
                    risk, our policy is to enter into hedging arrangements only with
                    A-rated
                    financial institutions.

Bond
                    compliance requirements may limit income from certain
                    properties

- At
                    December 31, 2006, we had approximately $186.3 million of variable
                    rate
                    tax-exempt financing relating to the Inglenook Court Apartments,
                    Wandering Creek
                    Apartments, Treetops Apartments, Huntington Breakers Apartments,
                    Camarillo Oaks
                    Apartments, Fountain Park, Anchor Village and Parker Ranch Apartments.
                    This
                    tax-exempt financing subjects these properties to certain deed
                    restrictions and
                    restrictive covenants. We expect to engage in tax-exempt financings
                    in the
                    future. In addition, the Internal Revenue Code and rules and
                    regulations
                    thereunder impose various restrictions, conditions and requirements
                    excluding
                    interest on qualified bond obligations from gross income for
                    federal income tax
                    purposes. The Internal Revenue Code also requires that at least
                    20% of apartment
                    units be made available to residents with gross incomes that
                    do not exceed a
                    specified percentage, generally 50%, of the median income for
                    the applicable
                    family size as determined by the Housing and Urban Development
                    Department of the
                    federal government. In addition to federal requirements, certain
                    state and local
                    authorities may impose additional rental restrictions. These
                    restrictions may
                    limit income from the tax-exempt financed properties if we are
                    required to lower
                    rental rates to attract residents who satisfy the median income
                    test. If Essex
                    does not reserve the required number of apartment homes for residents
                    satisfying
                    these income requirements, the tax-exempt status of the bonds
                    may be terminated,
                    the obligations under the bond documents may be accelerated and
                    we may be
                    subject to additional contractual liability.

Adverse
                    effect to property income and value due to general real estate
                    investment risks
                    -

Real
                    property investments are subject to a variety of risks. The yields
                    available
                    from equity investments in real estate depend on the amount of
                    income generated
                    and expenses incurred. If the properties do not generate sufficient
                    income to
                    meet operating expenses, including debt service and capital expenditures,
                    cash
                    flow and the ability to make distributions to stockholders will
                    be adversely
                    affected. The performance of the economy in each of the areas
                    in which the
                    properties are located affects occupancy, market rental rates
                    and expenses.
                    Consequently, the income from the properties and their underlying
                    values may be
                    impacted. The financial results of major local employers may
                    have an impact on
                    the cash flow and value of certain of the properties as well.

Income
                    from the properties may be further adversely affected by, among
                    other things,
                    the following factors:

·

the
                            general economic climate;

·

local
                            economic conditions in which the properties are located,
                            such as
                            oversupply of housing or a reduction in demand for rental
                            housing;

·

the
                            attractiveness of the properties to tenants;

·

competition
                            from other available space; and

·

Essex’s
                            ability to provide for adequate maintenance and
                            insurance.

As
                    leases
                    on the properties expire, tenants may enter into new leases on
                    terms that are
                    less favorable to us. Income and real estate values also may
                    be adversely
                    affected by such factors as applicable laws (e.g., the Americans
                    With
                    Disabilities Act of 1990 and tax laws), interest rate levels
                    and the
                    availability and terms of financing. Real estate investments
                    are relatively
                    illiquid and, therefore, our ability to vary our portfolio promptly
                    in response
                    to changes in economic or other conditions may be quite limited.


Economic
                      environment and impact on operating results

- The
                      national economy and the economies of the western states in
                      markets where we
                      operate can impact our operating results. Some of these markets
                      are concentrated
                      in high-tech sectors, which have experienced economic downturns,
                      and could again
                      in the future. Our property type and diverse geographic locations
                      provide some
                      degree of risk mitigation. However, we are not immune to prolonged
                      economic
                      downturns. Although we believe we are well positioned to meet
                      these challenges,
                      it is possible a reduction in rental rates, occupancy levels,
                      property
                      valuations and increases in operating costs such as advertising,
                      turnover and
                      repair and maintenance expense could occur in the event of
                      economic
                      uncertainty.

Risk
                      of Inflation/Deflation

-
                      Substantial inflationary or deflationary pressures could have
                      a negative effect
                      on rental rates and property operating expenses.

Risks
                      that acquisitions will fail to meet expectations

- We
                      intend to continue to acquire apartment communities. However,
                      there are risks
                      that acquisitions will fail to meet our expectations. Our estimates
                      of future
                      income, expenses and the costs of improvements or redevelopment
                      that are
                      necessary to allow us to market an acquired property as originally
                      intended may
                      prove to be inaccurate. We expect to finance future acquisitions,
                      in whole or in
                      part, under various forms of secured or unsecured financing
                      or through the
                      issuance of partnership units by the Operating Partnership
                      or related
                      partnerships or additional equity by Essex. The use of equity
                      financing, rather
                      than debt, for future developments or acquisitions could dilute
                      the interest of
                      Essex’s existing stockholders. If we finance new acquisitions under
                      existing
                      lines of credit, there is a risk that, unless we obtain substitute
                      financing,
                      Essex may not be able to secure further lines of credit for
                      new development or
                      such lines of credit may be not available on advantageous terms.

Risks
                      that development activities will be delayed, not completed,
                      and/or not achieve
                      expected results

- We
                      pursue apartment community development projects and these projects
                      generally
                      require various governmental and other approvals, which have
                      no assurance of
                      being received. Our development activities generally entail
                      certain risks,
                      including the following:

·

funds
                              may be expended and management's time devoted to projects
                              that may not be
                              completed;

·

construction
                              costs of a project may exceed original estimates, possibly
                              making the
                              project economically unfeasible;

·

development
                              projects may be delayed due to, without limitation,
                              adverse weather
                              conditions, labor shortages, or unforeseen complications;

·

occupancy
                              rates and rents at a completed project may be less
                              than anticipated; and

·

the
                              operating expenses at a completed development may be
                              higher than
                              anticipated.

These
                      risks may reduce the funds available for distribution to Essex’s stockholders.
                      Further, the development of properties is also subject to the
                      general risks
                      associated with real estate investments. For further information
                      regarding these
                      risks, please see “Adverse Effect to Property Income and Value Due to General
                      Real Estate Investment Risks.”

The
                      geographic concentration of our Properties and fluctuations
                      in local markets may
                      adversely impact our financial condition and operating
                      results

- We
                      generated significant amounts of rental revenues for the year
                      ended December 31,
                      2006 from properties concentrated in Southern California (Los
                      Angeles, Ventura,
                      Orange, San Diego and Riverside counties), Northern California
                      (the San
                      Francisco Bay Area), and the Pacific Northwest (the Seattle,
                      Washington and
                      Portland, Oregon metropolitan areas). As of December 31, 2006,
                      more than half
                      (76%) of our Properties were located in California. This geographic
                      concentration could present risks if local property market
                      performance falls
                      below expectations. The economic condition of these markets
                      could affect
                      occupancy, market rental rates, and expenses, as well as impact
                      the income
                      generated from the Properties and their underlying asset values.
                      The financial
                      results of major local employers also may impact the cash flow
                      and value of
                      certain of the Properties. This could have a negative impact
                      on our financial
                      condition and operating results, which could affect our ability
                      to pay expected
                      dividends to our stockholders.

Competition
                      in the apartment community market may adversely affect operations
                      and the rental
                      demand for our Properties

- There
                      are numerous housing alternatives that compete with our apartment
                      communities in
                      attracting residents. These include other apartment communities
                      and
                      single-family homes that are available for rent in the markets
                      in which the
                      Properties are located. The Properties also compete for residents
                      with new and
                      existing homes and condominiums that are for sale. If the demand
                      for our
                      Properties is reduced or if competitors develop and/or acquire
                      competing
                      properties on a more cost-effective basis, rental rates may
                      drop, which may have
                      a material adverse affect on our financial condition and results
                      of operations.

We
                      also
                      face competition from other real estate investment trusts,
                      businesses and other
                      entities in the acquisition, development and operation of properties.
                      Some of
                      the competitors are larger and have greater financial resources
                      than we do. This
                      competition may result in increased costs of properties we
                      acquire and/or
                      develop.


Dividend
                    requirements as a result of preferred stock may lead to a possible
                    inability to
                    sustain dividends

-

We
                    have
                    Series F Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock (“Series F Preferred Stock”) with
                    an aggregate liquidation preference of approximately $25 million
                    outstanding and
                    Series G Cumulative Convertible Preferred Stock (“Series G Preferred Stock”)
                    with an aggregate liquidation preference of approximately $149.5
                    million
                    outstanding. In addition, we are required under limited conditions
                    to issue
                    Series B Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock (“Series B Preferred Stock”) with
                    an aggregate liquidation preference of $80 million and Series
                    D Cumulative
                    Redeemable Preferred Stock (“Series D Preferred Stock”) with an aggregate
                    liquidation preference of $50 million in each case in exchange
                    for outstanding
                    preferred interests in the Operating Partnership. The terms of
                    the Series B, D,
                    F and G Preferred Stock provide for certain cumulative preferential
                    cash
                    distributions per each share of preferred stock.

These
                    terms also provide that while such preferred stock is outstanding,
                    we cannot
                    authorize, declare, or pay any distributions on our common stock,
                    unless all
                    distributions accumulated on all shares of such preferred stock
                    have been paid
                    in full. Our failure to pay distributions on such preferred stock
                    would impair
                    our ability to pay dividends on our common stock. Our credit
                    agreement limits
                    our ability to pay dividends on our preferred stock if we fail
                    to satisfy a
                    fixed charge coverage ratio.

If
                    Essex
                    wishes to issue any common stock in the future (including upon
                    the exercise of
                    stock options), the funds required to continue to pay cash dividends
                    at current
                    levels will be increased. Essex’s ability to pay dividends will depend largely
                    upon the performance of our current properties and other properties
                    that may be
                    acquired or developed in the future.

If
                    Essex
                    cannot pay dividends on its common stock, Essex’s status as a real estate
                    investment trust may be jeopardized. Our ability to pay dividends
                    on our common
                    stock is further limited by the Maryland General Corporation
                    Law. Under the
                    Maryland General Corporation Law, Essex may not make a distribution
                    on stock if,
                    after giving effect to such distribution, either:

·

we
                            would not be able to pay our indebtedness as it becomes
                            due in the usual
                            course of business; or

·

our
                            total assets would be less than our total liabilities,
                            including the
                            liquidation preference on our Series B, Series D, Series
                            F, and Series G
                            preferred stock.

Resale

                    that are issued
                    upon conversion of our convertible preferred stock may have an
                    adverse effect on
                    the market price of the shares

- Essex

                            covers the
                            resale of up to 6,513,490 shares, including (i) up to

                            2,270,490 shares of
                            common stock that are issuable upon exchange of limited

Registration
                            statements, declared effective in 2006, that cover (i)
                            the resale of up to
                            142,076 shares issuable in connection with our Waterford
                            and Vista
                            Belvedere acquisitions and (ii) the resale of shares
                            issuable in
                            connection with the exchange rights of our 3.625% Exchangeable
                            Senior
                            Notes, as to which there is a principal amount of $225
                            million
                            outstanding.

During
                    the third quarter of 2006, we issued, pursuant to a registration
                    statement,
                    5,980,000 million shares of 4.875% Series G Cumulative Preferred
                    Stock for
                    estimated gross proceeds of $149.5 million; such shares are convertible,
                    subject
                    to certain conditions, into common stock, which could be resold
                    into the public
                    market.

The
                    resale of the shares of common stock pursuant to these various
                    registration
                    statements or that are issued upon conversion of our outstanding
                    convertible
                    preferred stock may have an adverse effect on the market price
                    of our

                    Series G
                    Preferred Stock may be detrimental to holders of common stock
                    -

The
                    Operating Partnership has $225 million principal amount of 3.625%
                    Exchangeable
                    Senior Notes (the “Notes”) outstanding which mature on November 1, 2025. The
                    Notes are exchangeable into the Company's common stock on or
                    after November 1,
                    2020 or prior to November 1, 2020 under certain circumstances.
                    The Notes are
                    redeemable at the Company's option for cash at any time on or
                    after November 4,
                    2010 and are subject to repurchase for cash at the option of
                    the holder on
                    November 1

st

in the
                    years 2010, 2015 and 2020, or upon the occurrence of certain
                    events. The Notes
                    are senior unsecured and unsubordinated obligations of the Company.


In
                      2006,
                      the Company sold 5,980,000 million shares of 4.875% Series
                      G Cumulative
                      Convertible Preferred Stock (the “Series G Preferred Stock”) for gross proceeds
                      of $149.5 million. Holders may convert Series G Preferred Stock
                      into shares of
                      the Company’s common stock subject to certain conditions. The conversion
                      rate
                      will initially be .1830 shares of common stock per $25 share
                      liquidation
                      preference, which is equivalent to an initial conversion price
                      of $136.62 per
                      share of common stock (the conversion rate will be subject
                      to adjustment upon
                      the occurrence of specified events). On or after July 31, 2011,
                      the Company may,
                      under certain circumstances cause some or all of the Series
                      G Preferred Stock to
                      be converted into shares of common stock at the then prevailing
                      conversion rate.
                      Further, if a fundamental change occurs, as defined in the
                      articles
                      supplementary for the Series G Preferred Stock, then the holders
                      may require
                      Essex to repurchase all or part of their Series G Preferred
                      Stock subject to
                      certain conditions.

The
                      exchange of the Notes and/or Series G Preferred Stock for common
                      stock would
                      dilute stockholder ownership in the Company, and such exchange
                      could adversely
                      affect the market price of our common stock and our ability
                      to raise capital
                      through the sale of additional equity securities. If the Notes
                      and Series G
                      Preferred Stock are not exchanged, the repurchase price of
                      the Notes and Series
                      G Preferred Stock may discourage or impede transactions that
                      might otherwise be
                      in the interest of the holders of common stock. Further, these
                      repurchase rights
                      may be triggered in situations where Essex needs to conserve
                      its cash reserves,
                      in which event such repurchase might adversely affect Essex
                      and its common
                      stockholders.

Our
                      future issuances of common stock, preferred stock or convertible
                      debt securities
                      could adversely affect the market price of our common
                      stock

In
                      order
                      to finance our property acquisition and development activities,
                      we have issued
                      and sold common stock, preferred stock and convertible debt
                      securities. For
                      example, in 2005, the Operating Partnership sold $225 million
                      principal amount
                      of 3.625% Exchangeable Senior Notes, which are exchangeable
                      into the Company’s
                      common stock under certain conditions. In 2006, the Company
                      issued 5,980,000
                      million shares of 4.875% Series G Cumulative Convertible Preferred
                      Stock for
                      gross proceeds of approximately $149.5 million. During 2006,
                      pursuant to a
                      Controlled Equity Offering program that the Company entered
                      into with Cantor
                      Fitzgerald & Co., the Company issued and sold approximately 427,700 shares
                      of common Stock for $48.3 million, net of fees and commissions.
                      The Company may
                      in the future sell further shares of common stock pursuant
                      to a Controlled
                      Equity Offering program with Cantor Fitzgerald & Co.

Future
                      sales of common stock, preferred stock or convertible debt
                      securities may dilute
                      stockholder ownership in the Company and could adversely affect
                      the market price
                      of the common stock.

Our
                      Chairman is involved in other real estate activities and investments,
                      which may
                      lead to conflicts of interest -

Our
                      Chairman, George M. Marcus is not an employee of Essex, and
                      is involved in other
                      real estate activities and investments, which may lead to conflicts
                      of interest.
                      Mr. Marcus owns interests in various other real estate-related
                      businesses and
                      investments. He is the Chairman of The Marcus & Millichap Company, or
“TMMC,” which is a holding company for certain real estate brokerage
                      and
                      services companies. TMMC has an interest in Pacific Property
                      Company, a company
                      that invests in apartment communities.

Mr.
                      Marcus has agreed not to divulge any information that may be
                      received by him in
                      his capacity as Chairman of Essex to any of his affiliated
                      companies and that he
                      will abstain his vote on any and all resolutions by the Essex
                      Board of Directors
                      regarding any proposed acquisition and/or development of a
                      multifamily property
                      where it appears that there may be a conflict of interest with
                      any of his
                      affiliated companies.  Notwithstanding this agreement, Mr. Marcus and his
                      affiliated entities may potentially compete with us in acquiring
                      and/or
                      developing multifamily properties, which competition may be
                      detrimental to us.
                      In addition, due to such potential competition for real estate
                      investments, Mr.
                      Marcus and his affiliated entities may have a conflict of interest
                      with us,
                      which may be detrimental to the interests of Essex’s stockholders.

The
                      influence of executive officers, directors and significant
                      stockholders may be
                      detrimental to holders of common stock

- As of
                      December 31, 2006, George M. Marcus, the Chairman of our Board
                      of Directors,
                      wholly or partially owned 1,759,267 shares of common stock
                      (including shares
                      issuable upon exchange of limited partnership interests in
                      the Operating
                      Partnership and certain other partnerships and assuming exercise
                      of all vested
                      options). This represents approximately 7.5% of the outstanding
                      shares of our
                      common stock. Mr. Marcus currently does not have majority control
                      over us.
                      However, he currently has, and likely will continue to have,
                      significant
                      influence with respect to the election of directors and approval
                      or disapproval
                      of significant corporate actions. Consequently, his influence
                      could result in
                      decisions that do not reflect the interests of all our
                      stockholders.


Under
                        the
                        partnership agreement of the Operating Partnership, the consent
                        of the holders
                        of limited partnership interests is generally required for
                        any amendment of the
                        agreement and for certain extraordinary actions. Through
                        their ownership of
                        limited partnership interests and their positions with us,
                        our directors and
                        executive officers, including Mr. Marcus, have substantial
                        influence on us.
                        Consequently, their influence could result in decisions that
                        do not reflect the
                        interests of all stockholders.

The
                        voting rights of preferred stock may allow holders of preferred
                        stock to impede
                        actions that otherwise benefit holders of common stock

-

In
                        general, the holders of our outstanding shares of preferred
                        stock do not have
                        any voting rights. However, if full distributions are not
                        made on any
                        outstanding preferred stock for six quarterly distributions
                        periods, the holders
                        of preferred stock who have not received distributions, voting
                        together as a
                        single class, will have the right to elect two additional
                        directors to serve on
                        our Board of Directors.

These
                        voting rights continue until all distributions in arrears
                        and distributions for
                        the current quarterly period on the preferred stock have
                        been paid in full. At
                        that time, the holders of the preferred stock are divested
                        of these voting
                        rights, and the term and office of the directors so elected
                        immediately
                        terminates. While any shares of our preferred stock are outstanding,
                        Essex may
                        not, without the consent of the holders of two-thirds of
                        the outstanding shares
                        of each series of preferred stock, each voting separately
                        as a single
                        class:

·

authorize
                                or create any class or series of stock that ranks
                                senior to such preferred
                                stock with respect to the payment of dividends, rights
                                upon liquidation,
                                dissolution or winding-up of our business;

·

amend,
                                alter or repeal the provisions of Essex’s Charter or Bylaws, including by
                                merger or consolidation, that would materially and
                                adversely affect the
                                rights of such series of preferred stock; or

·

in
                                the case of the preferred stock into which our preferred
                                units are
                                exchangeable, merge or consolidate with another entity
                                or transfer
                                substantially all of its assets to another entity,
                                except if such
                                preferred stock remains outstanding with the surviving
                                entity and has the
                                same terms and in certain other circumstances.

These
                        voting rights of the preferred stock may allow holders of
                        preferred stock to
                        impede or veto actions that would otherwise benefit the holders
                        of our common
                        stock.

The
                        redemption rights of the Series B preferred units, Series
                        D preferred units,
                        Series F preferred stock and Series G preferred stock may
                        be detrimental to
                        holders of Essex common stock -

Upon
                        the
                        occurrence of one of the following events, the terms of the
                        Operating
                        Partnership’s Series B and D Preferred Units require it to redeem all
                        of such
                        units and the terms of Essex’s Series F Preferred Stock and the Series G
                        Preferred Stock provide the holders of the majority of the
                        outstanding Series F
                        Preferred Stock and Series G Preferred Stock the right to
                        require Essex to
                        redeem all of such stock:

·

Essex
                                completes a “going private” transaction and its common stock is no longer
                                registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,
                                as amended;

·

Essex
                                completes a consolidation or merger or sale of substantially
                                all of its
                                assets and the surviving entity’s debt securities do not possess an
                                investment grade rating;

·

Essex
                                fails to qualify as a REIT; or

·

in
                                the case of Series G preferred stock, Essex common
                                stock is not traded on
                                a major exchange.

The
                        aggregate redemption price of the Series B Preferred Units
                        would be $80 million,
                        the aggregate redemption price of the Series D Preferred
                        Units would be $50
                        million, the aggregate redemption price of the Series F Preferred
                        Stock would be
                        $25 million and the aggregate redemption price of the Series
                        G Preferred Stock
                        would be $149.5 million, plus, in each case, any accumulated
                        distributions.

These
                        redemption rights may discourage or impede transactions that
                        might otherwise be
                        in the interest of holders of common stock. Further, these
                        redemption rights
                        might trigger situations where Essex needs to conserve its
                        cash reserves, in
                        which event such redemption might adversely affect Essex
                        and its common
                        holders.

Maryland
                        business combination law may not allow certain transactions
                        between Essex and
                        its affiliates to proceed without compliance with such
                        law

-

Under
                        Maryland law, “business combinations” between a Maryland corporation and an
                        interested stockholder or an affiliate of an interested stockholder
                        are
                        prohibited for five years after the most recent date on which
                        the interested
                        stockholder becomes an interested stockholder. These business
                        combinations
                        include a merger, consolidation, share exchange, or, in circumstances
                        specified
                        in the statute, an asset transfer or issuance or reclassification
                        of equity
                        securities. An interested stockholder is defined as any person
                        (and certain
                        affiliates of such person) who beneficially owns ten percent
                        or more of the
                        voting power of the then-outstanding voting stock.

The
                        law
                        also requires a supermajority stockholder vote for such transactions.
                        This means
                        that the transaction must be approved by at least:

·

80%
                                of the votes entitled to be cast by holders of outstanding
                                voting shares;
                                and

·

Two-thirds
                                of the votes entitled to be cast by holders of outstanding
                                voting shares
                                other than shares held by the interested stockholder
                                with whom the
                                business combination is to be effected.


The
                  statute permits various exemptions from its provisions, including
                  business
                  combinations that are exempted by the board of directors prior
                  to the time that
                  the interested stockholder becomes an interested stockholder. These
                  voting
                  provisions do not apply if the stockholders receive a minimum price,
                  as defined
                  under Maryland law. As permitted by the statute, the Board of Directors
                  of Essex
                  irrevocably has elected to exempt any business combination by us,
                  George M.
                  Marcus, William A. Millichap, who are the chairman and a director
                  of Essex,
                  respectively, and TMMC or any entity owned or controlled by Messrs.
                  Marcus and
                  Millichap and TMMC. Consequently, the five-year prohibition and
                  supermajority
                  vote requirement described above will not apply to any business
                  combination
                  between us and Mr. Marcus, Mr. Millichap, or TMMC. As a result,
                  we may in the
                  future enter into business combinations with Messrs. Marcus and
                  Millichap and
                  TMMC, without compliance with the supermajority vote requirements
                  and other
                  provisions of the Maryland General Corporation Law.

Anti-takeover
                  provisions contained in the Operating Partnership agreement, charter,
                  bylaws,
                  and certain provisions of Maryland law could delay, defer or prevent

While
                  Essex is the sole general partner of the Operating Partnership,
                  and generally
                  has full and exclusive responsibility and discretion in the management
                  and
                  control of the Operating Partnership, certain provisions of the
                  Operating
                  Partnership agreement place limitations on Essex’s ability to act with respect
                  to the Operating Partnership. Such limitations could delay, defer
                  or prevent a
                  transaction or a change in control that might involve a premium
                  price for our
                  stock or otherwise be in the best interest of the stockholders
                  or that could
                  otherwise adversely affect the interest of Essex’s stockholders. The partnership
                  agreement provides that if the limited partners own at least 5%
                  of the
                  outstanding units of partnership interest in the Operating Partnership,
                  Essex
                  cannot, without first obtaining the consent of a majority-in-interest
                  of the
                  limited partners in the Operating Partnership, transfer all or
                  any portion of
                  our general partner interest in the Operating Partnership to another
                  entity.
                  Such limitations on Essex’s ability to act may result in our being precluded
                  from taking action that the Board of Directors believes is in the
                  best interests
                  of Essex’s stockholders. As of December 31, 2006, the limited partners held
                  or
                  controlled approximately 9.6% of the outstanding units of partnership
                  interest
                  in the Operating Partnership, allowing such actions to be blocked
                  by the limited
                  partners.

Essex’s
                  Charter authorizes the issuance of additional shares of common
                  stock or
                  preferred stock and the setting of the preferences, rights and
                  other terms of
                  such preferred stock without the approval of the holders of the
                  common stock. We
                  may establish one or more series of preferred stock that could
                  delay, defer or
                  prevent a transaction or a change in control. Such a transaction
                  might involve a
                  premium price for our stock or otherwise be in the best interests
                  of the holders
                  of common stock. Also, such a class of preferred stock could have
                  dividend,
                  voting or other rights that could adversely affect the interest
                  of holders of
                  common stock.

Essex’s
                  Charter, as well as Essex’s stockholder rights plan, contains other provisions
                  that may delay, defer or prevent a transaction or a change in control
                  that might
                  be in the best interest of Essex’s stockholders. Essex’s stockholder rights plan
                  is designed, among other things, to prevent a person or group from
                  gaining
                  control of us without offering a fair price to all of Essex’s stockholders. The
                  Bylaws may be amended by the Board of Directors to include provisions
                  that would
                  have a similar effect, although Essex presently has no such intention.
                  The
                  Charter contains ownership provisions limiting the transferability
                  and ownership
                  of shares of capital stock, which may have the effect of delaying,
                  deferring or
                  preventing a transaction or a change in control. For example, subject
                  to
                  receiving an exemption from the Board of Directors, potential acquirers
                  may not
                  purchase more than 6% in value of the stock (other than qualified
                  pension trusts
                  which can acquire 9.9%). This may discourage tender offers that
                  may be
                  attractive to the holders of common stock and limit the opportunity
                  for
                  stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of common stock.

The
                  Maryland General Corporations Law restricts the voting rights of
                  shares deemed
                  to be “control shares.”

Under
                  the
                  Maryland General Corporations Law, “control shares” are those which, when
                  aggregated with any other shares held by the acquirer, entitle
                  the acquirer to
                  exercise voting power within specified ranges. Although the Bylaws
                  exempt Essex
                  from the control share provisions of the Maryland General Corporations
                  Law, the
                  Board of Directors may amend or eliminate the provisions of the
                  Bylaws at any
                  time in the future. Moreover, any such amendment or elimination
                  of such
                  provision of the Bylaws may result in the application of the control
                  share
                  provisions of the Maryland General Corporations Law not only to
                  control shares
                  which may be acquired in the future, but also to control shares
                  previously
                  acquired. If the provisions of the Bylaws are amended or eliminated,
                  the control
                  share provisions of the Maryland General Corporations Law could
                  delay, defer or
                  prevent a transaction or change in control that might involve a
                  premium price
                  for the stock or otherwise be in the best interests of Essex’s
                  stockholders.


Essex’s
            joint ventures and joint ownership of Properties and partial interests
            in
            corporations and limited partnerships could limit Essex’s ability to control
            such Properties and partial interests

-

Instead
            of purchasing properties directly, we have invested and may continue
            to invest
            as a co-venturer. Joint venturers often have shared control over the
            operation
            of the joint venture assets. Therefore, it is possible that the co-venturer
            in
            an investment might become bankrupt, or have economic or business interests
            or
            goals that are inconsistent with our business interests or goals, or
            be in a
            position to take action contrary to our instructions or requests, or
            our
            policies or objectives. Consequently, a co-venturer’s actions might subject
            property owned by the joint venture to additional risk. Although we seek
            to
            maintain sufficient influence over any joint venture to achieve its objectives,
            we may be unable to take action without our joint venture partners’ approval, or
            joint venture partners could take actions binding on the joint venture
            without
            our consent. Should a joint venture partner become bankrupt, we could
            become
            liable for such partner’s share of joint venture liabilities.

From
            time
            to time, we, through the Operating Partnership, invest in corporations,
            limited
            partnerships, limited liability companies or other entities that have
            been
            formed for the purpose of acquiring, developing or managing real property.
            In
            certain circumstances, the Operating Partnership’s interest in a particular
            entity may be less than a majority of the outstanding voting interests
            of that
            entity. Therefore, the Operating Partnership’s ability to control the daily
            operations of such an entity may be limited. Furthermore, the Operating
            Partnership may not have the power to remove a majority of the board
            of
            directors (in the case of a corporation) or the general partner or partners
            (in
            the case of a limited partnership) of such an entity in the event that
            its
            operations conflict with the Operating Partnership’s objectives. The Operating
            Partnership may not be able to dispose of its interests in such an entity.
            In
            the event that such an entity becomes insolvent, the Operating Partnership
            may
            lose up to its entire investment in and any advances to the entity. We
            have, and
            in the future may, enter into transactions that could require us to pay
            the tax
            liabilities of partners, which contribute assets into joint ventures
            or the
            Operating Partnership, in the event that certain taxable events, which
            are
            within our control, occur. Although we plan to hold the contributed assets
            or
            defer recognition of gain on their sale pursuant to the like-kind exchange
            rules
            under Section 1031 of the Internal Revenue Code, we can provide no assurance
            that we will be able to do so and if such tax liabilities were incurred
            they can
            expect to have a material impact on our financial position.

Dedicated
            investment activities and other factors specifically related to Fund
            II

- Fund
            II involves risks to us such as the following:

·

our
                    partners in Fund II might remove Essex as the general partner
                    of Fund
                    II;

·

our
                    partners in Fund II might become bankrupt (in which event we
                    might become
                    generally liable for the liabilities of Fund
                    II);

·

our
                    partners in Fund II might have economic or business interests
                    or goals
                    that are inconsistent with our business interests or
                    goals;

·

our
                    partners in Fund II might fail to fund capital commitments as
                    contractually required; or

·

our
                    partners in Fund II might fail to approve decisions regarding
                    Fund II that
                    are in our best interest.

We
            will,
            however, generally seek to maintain sufficient influence over Fund II
            to permit
            it to achieve its business objectives.

Investments
            in mortgages and other real estate securities

- We may
            invest in securities related to real estate, which could adversely affect
            our
            ability to make distributions to stockholders. We may purchase securities
            issued
            by entities which own real estate and invest in mortgages or unsecured
            debt
            obligations. These mortgages may be first, second or third mortgages
            that may or
            may not be insured or otherwise guaranteed. In general, investments in
            mortgages
            include the following risks:

·

that
                    the value of mortgaged property may be less than the amounts
                    owed, causing
                    realized or unrealized losses;

·

the
                    borrower may not pay indebtedness under the mortgage when due,
                    requiring
                    us to foreclose, and the amount recovered in connection with
                    the
                    foreclosure may be less than the amount
                    owed;

·

that
                    interest rates payable on the mortgages may be lower than our
                    cost of
                    funds; and

·

in
                    the case of junior mortgages, that foreclosure of a senior mortgage
                    would
                    eliminate the junior mortgage.

If
            any of
            the above were to occur, cash flows from operations and our ability to
            make
            expected dividends to stockholders could be adversely affected.


Possible
              environmental liabilities

- Under
              various federal, state and local laws, ordinances and regulations,
              an owner or
              operator of real estate is liable for the costs of removal or remediation
              of
              certain hazardous or toxic substances on, in, to or migrating from
              such
              property. Such laws often impose liability without regard as to whether
              the
              owner or operator knew of, or was responsible for, the presence of
              such
              hazardous or toxic substances. The presence of such substances, or
              the failure
              to properly remediate such substances, may adversely affect the owner’s or
              operator’s ability to sell or rent such property or to borrow using such
              property as collateral. Persons exposed to such substances, either
              through soil
              vapor or ingestion of the substances may claim personal injury damages.
              Persons
              who arrange for the disposal or treatment of hazardous or toxic substances
              or
              wastes also may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of
              such
              substances at the disposal or treatment facility to which such substances
              or
              wastes were sent, whether or not such facility is owned or operated
              by such
              person. Certain environmental laws impose liability for release of
              asbestos-containing materials (“ACMs”) into the air, and third parties may seek
              recovery from owners or operators of real properties for personal injury
              associated with ACMs. In connection with the ownership (direct or indirect),
              operation, management and development of real properties, the Company
              could be
              considered an owner or operator of such properties or as having arranged
              for the
              disposal or treatment of hazardous or toxic substances and, therefore,
              may be
              potentially liable for removal or remediation costs, as well as certain
              other
              costs, including governmental fines and costs related to injuries of
              persons and
              property.

Investments
              in real property create a potential for environmental liabilities on
              the part of
              the owner of such real property. We carry certain limited insurance
              coverage for
              this type of environmental risk. We have conducted environmental studies
              which
              revealed the presence of groundwater contamination at certain Properties.
              Such
              contamination at certain of these properties was reported to have migrated
              on-site from adjacent industrial manufacturing operations. The former
              industrial
              users of the Properties were identified as the source of contamination.
              The
              environmental studies noted that certain Properties are located adjacent
              to any
              possible down gradient from sites with known groundwater contamination,
              the
              lateral limits of which may extend onto such properties. The environmental
              studies also noted that at certain of these properties, contamination
              existed
              because of the presence of underground fuel storage tanks, which have
              been
              removed. In general, in connection with the ownership, operation, financing,
              management and development of real properties, we may be potentially
              liable for
              removal or clean-up costs, as well as certain other costs and environmental
              liabilities. We may also be subject to governmental fines and costs
              related to
              injuries to persons and property.

Recently
              there has been an increasing number of lawsuits against owners and
              managers of
              apartment communities alleging personal injury and property damage
              caused by the
              presence of mold in residential real estate. Some of these lawsuits
              have
              resulted in substantial monetary judgments or settlements. Essex has
              been sued
              for mold related matters and has settled some, but not all, such matters,
              which
              matters remain unresolved and pending. Insurance carriers have reacted
              to mold
              related liability awards by excluding mold related claims from standard
              policies
              and pricing mold endorsements at prohibitively high rates. Essex has,
              however,
              purchased pollution liability insurance, which includes limited coverage
              for
              mold, although the insurance may not cover all pending or future mold
              claims.
              Essex has adopted programs designed to manage the existence of mold
              in its
              properties as well as guidelines for promptly addressing and resolving
              reports
              of mold to minimize any impact mold might have on residents or the
              property.
              Essex cannot assure you that it will not be sued in the future for
              mold related
              matters and cannot assure you that the liabilities resulting from such
              current
              or future mold related matters will not be substantial. The costs of
              carrying
              insurance to address potential mold related claims may also be
              substantial.

California
              has enacted legislation commonly referred to as “Proposition 65” requiring that
“clear and reasonable” warnings be given to consumers who are exposed to
              chemicals known to the State of California to cause cancer or reproductive
              toxicity, including tobacco smoke. Although we have sought to comply
              with
              Proposition 65 requirements, we cannot assure you that we will not
              be adversely
              affected by litigation relating to Proposition 65.

Methane
              gas is a naturally-occurring gas that is commonly found below the surface
              in
              several areas, particularly in the Southern California coastal areas. 
Methane is a non-toxic gas, but can be ignitable in confined spaces. 
Although naturally-occurring, methane gas is not regulated at the state
              or
              federal level, some local governments, such as the County of Los Angeles,
              have
              imposed requirements that new buildings install detection systems in
              areas where
              methane gas is known to be located.

Methane
              gas is also associated with certain industrial activities, such as
              former
              municipal waste landfills. Radon is also a naturally-occurring gas
              that is found
              below the surface. Essex cannot assure you that it will not be adversely
              affected by costs related to its compliance with methane gas related
              requirements or litigation costs related to methane or radon gas.

The
              Company has almost no indemnification agreements from third parties
              for
              potential environmental clean-up costs at its Properties.


The
                Company has no way of determining at this time the magnitude of any
                potential
                liability to which it may be subject arising out of unknown environmental
                conditions or violations with respect to the properties formerly
                owned by the
                Company. No assurance can be given that existing environmental studies
                with
                respect to any of the Properties reveal all environmental liabilities,
                that any
                prior owner or operator of a Property did not create any material
                environmental
                condition not known to the Company, or that a material environmental
                condition
                does not exist as to any one or more of the Properties. The Company
                has limited
                insurance coverage for the types of environmental liabilities described
                above.

General
                uninsured losses

- The
                Company carries comprehensive liability, fire, extended coverage
                and rental loss
                insurance for each of the Properties. There are, however, certain
                types of
                extraordinary losses, such as, for example, losses for terrorism
                or earthquake,
                for which the Company does not have insurance coverage. Substantially
                all of the
                Properties are located in areas that are subject to earthquake activity.
                In
                January 2007, the Company canceled the earthquake policy and established
                a
                wholly owned insurance subsidiary. Through this subsidiary, the Company
                is
                self-insured as it relates to earthquake related losses.

Although
                the Company may carry insurance for potential losses associated with
                its
                Properties, employees, residents, and compliance with applicable
                laws, it may
                still incur losses due to uninsured risks, deductibles, co-payments
                or losses in
                excess of applicable insurance coverage and those losses may be
                material.

Changes
                in real estate tax and other laws

-
                Generally we do not directly pass through costs resulting from changes
                in real
                estate tax laws to residential property tenants. We also do not generally
                pass
                through increases in income, service or other taxes, to tenants under
                leases.
                These costs may adversely affect funds from operations and the ability
                to make
                distributions to stockholders. Similarly, compliance with changes
                in (i) laws
                increasing the potential liability for environmental conditions existing
                on
                properties or the restrictions on discharges or other conditions
                or (ii) rent
                control or rent stabilization laws or other laws regulating housing
                may result
                in significant unanticipated expenditures, which would adversely
                affect funds
                from operations and the ability to make distributions to
                stockholders.

Changes
                in financing policy; no limitation on debt -

We have
                adopted a policy of maintaining for a debt-to-total-market-capitalization
                ratio
                of less than 50%. The calculation of debt-to-total-market-capitalization
                is as
                follows: total indebtedness divided by the sum of total indebtedness
                plus total
                equity market capitalization. As used in this calculation, total
                equity market
                capitalization is equal to the aggregate market value of the outstanding
                shares
                of common stock (based on the greater of current market price or
                the gross
                proceeds per share from public offerings of the outstanding shares
                plus any
                undistributed net cash flow), assuming the conversion of all limited
                partnership
                interests in the Operating Partnership into shares of common stock
                and the gross
                proceeds of the preferred units. Based on this calculation (including
                the
                current market price and excluding undistributed net cash flow),
                our
                debt-to-total-market-capitalization ratio was approximately 28% as
                of December
                31, 2006.

Our
                organizational documents do not limit the amount or percentage of
                indebtedness
                that may be incurred. Accordingly, the Board of Directors of Essex
                could change
                current policies and the policies of the Operating Partnership regarding
                indebtedness. If we changed these policies, we could incur more debt,
                resulting
                in an increased risk of default on our obligations and the obligations
                of the
                Operating Partnership, and an increase in debt service requirements
                that could
                adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.
                Such
                increased debt could exceed the underlying value of the Properties.

We
                are subject to certain tax risks

-

Essex
                has
                elected to be taxed as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code. Essex’s
                qualification as a REIT requires it to satisfy numerous requirements
                (some on an
                annual and quarterly basis) established under highly technical and
                complex
                Internal Revenue Code provisions for which there are only limited
                judicial or
                administrative interpretations, and involves the determination of
                various
                factual matters and circumstances not entirely within Essex’s control. Although
                Essex intends that its current organization and method of operation
                enable it to
                qualify as a REIT, it cannot assure you that it so qualifies or that
                it will be
                able to remain so qualified in the future. Future legislation, new
                regulations,
                administrative interpretations or court decisions (any of which could
                have
                retroactive effect) could adversely affect Essex’s ability to qualify as a REIT
                or adversely affect its stockholders. If it fails to qualify as a
                REIT in any
                taxable year, Essex would be subject to U.S. federal income tax (including
                any
                applicable alternative minimum tax) on its taxable income at corporate
                rates,
                and would not be allowed to deduct dividends paid to its shareholders
                in
                computing its taxable income. Essex may also be disqualified from
                treatment as a
                REIT for the four taxable years following the year in which it failed
                to
                qualify. The additional tax liability would reduce its net earnings
                available
                for investment or distribution to stockholders, and it would no longer
                be
                required to make distributions to its stockholders. Even if Essex
                continues to
                qualify as a REIT, it will continue to be subject to certain federal,
                state and
                local taxes on its income and property.


Essex
                  has
                  established

several
                  taxable REIT subsidiaries (“TRSs”). Despite Essex’s qualification as a REIT, its
                  TRSs’ must pay U.S. federal income tax on their taxable income. While
                  Essex will
                  attempt to ensure that their dealing with its TRSs’ does not adversely affect
                  its REIT qualification, it cannot provide assurance that it will
                  successfully
                  achieve that result. Furthermore, Essex may be subject to a 100%
                  penalty tax, or
                  its TRSs’ may be denied deductions, to the extent its dealings with its TRSs’
are not deemed to be arm’s length in nature. No assurances can be given that
                  Essex’s dealings with its TRSs’ will be arm’s length in nature.

From
                  time
                  to time, we may transfer or otherwise dispose of some of our Properties.
                  Under
                  the Internal Revenue Code, any gain resulting from transfers of
                  Properties that
                  we hold as inventory or primarily for sale to customers in the
                  ordinary course
                  of business would be treated as income from a prohibited transaction
                  subject to
                  a 100% penalty tax. Since we acquire properties for investment
                  purposes, we do
                  not believe that our occasional transfers or disposals of property
                  are
                  prohibited transactions. However, whether property is held for
                  investment
                  purposes is a question of fact that depends on all the facts and
                  circumstances
                  surrounding the particular transaction. The Internal Revenue Service
                  may contend
                  that certain transfers or disposals of properties by us are prohibited
                  transactions. If the Internal Revenue Service were to argue successfully
                  that a
                  transfer or disposition of property constituted a prohibited transaction,
                  then
                  Essex would be required to pay a 100% penalty tax on any gain allocable
                  to Essex
                  from the prohibited transaction and Essex’s ability to retain future gains on
                  real property sales may be jeopardized. Income from a prohibited
                  transaction
                  might adversely affect Essex’s ability to satisfy the income tests for
                  qualification as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Therefore,
                  no
                  assurances can be given that Essex will be able to satisfy the
                  income tests for
                  qualification as a REIT.

Our
                  core
                  apartment Portfolio as of December 31, 2006 (including partial
                  ownership
                  interests) was comprised of 130 apartment communities (comprising
                  27,553
                  apartment units), of which 13,285 units are located in Southern
                  California,
                  7,490 units are located in the San Francisco Bay Area, 5,441 units
                  are located
                  in the Seattle Metropolitan Area, and 1,337 units are located in
                  the other areas
                  including Portland, Oregon and Houston, Texas. The Company’s apartment
                  communities accounted for 99% of the Company’s property revenues for the year
                  ended December 31, 2006.

Occupancy
                  Rates

The
                  apartment communities had an average Same-Properties occupancy
                  (as defined in
                  Item 7), based on “financial occupancy,” during the year ended December 31,
                  2006, of approximately 96.4 %. With respect to stabilized apartment
                  communities
                  with sufficient operating history, occupancy figures are based
                  on financial
                  occupancy (the percentage resulting from dividing actual rental
                  revenue by total
                  possible rental revenue). Actual rental revenue represents contractual
                  revenue
                  pursuant to leases without considering delinquency and concessions.
                  Total
                  possible rental revenue represents the value of all apartment units,
                  with
                  occupied units valued at contractual rental rates pursuant to leases
                  and vacant
                  units valued at estimated market rents. We believe that financial
                  occupancy is a
                  meaningful measure of occupancy because it considers the value
                  of each vacant
                  unit at its estimated market rate. Financial occupancy may not
                  completely
                  reflect short-term trends in physical occupancy and financial occupancy
                  rates as
                  disclosed by other REITs may not be comparable to our calculation
                  of financial
                  occupancy.

As
                  of
                  December 31, 2006, the headquarters building was 100% occupied
                  by the Company
                  and the Southern California office building was 95% occupied, based
                  on physical
                  occupancy. With respect to office buildings, occupancy figures
                  are based on
“physical occupancy” which refers to the percentage resulting from dividing
                  leased and occupied square footage by rentable square footage.
                  With respect to
                  recreational vehicle parks, manufactured housing communities, or
                  apartment
                  communities which have not yet stabilized or have insufficient
                  operating
                  history, occupancy figures are based on “physical occupancy” which refers to the
                  percentage resulting from dividing leased and occupied units by
                  rentable units.

For
                  the
                  year ended December 31, 2006, none of the Company’s Properties had book values
                  equal to 10% or more of total assets of the Company or gross revenues
                  equal to
                  10% or more of aggregate gross revenues of the Company.


Apartment
                    Communities

Our
                    apartment communities are generally suburban garden apartments
                    and town homes
                    comprising multiple clusters of two and three story buildings
                    situated on three
                    to fifteen acres of land. The apartment communities have on average
                    of 212
                    units, with a mix of studio, one, two and some three-bedroom
                    units. A wide
                    variety of amenities are available at each apartment community,
                    including
                    covered parking, fireplaces, swimming pools, clubhouses with
                    complete fitness
                    facilities, volleyball and playground areas and tennis courts.

We
                    select, train and supervise a full team of on-site service and
                    maintenance
                    personnel. We believe that the following primary factors enhance
                    our ability to
                    retain tenants:

·

well
                            built communities that have been well maintained since
                            acquisition;

                          which own these apartment communities. These investments
                          were made under
                          arrangements whereby EMC became the 1% sole general partner
                          and the other

Item
                3. Legal
                Proceedings

In

                2004, an employee lawsuit was filed against the Company in the California
                Superior Court in the County of Alameda. In this lawsuit, two former
                Company
                maintenance employees sought unpaid wages, associated penalties and
                attorneys’
fees on behalf of a putative class of the Company’s current and former
                maintenance employees who were required to wear a pager while they
                were on call
                during evening and weekend hours. In June 2005, the Company settled
                the lawsuit
                for $1.5 million.

                presence of mold in residential real estate. Some of these lawsuits
                have
                resulted in substantial monetary judgments or settlements. The Company
                has been
                sued for mold related matters and has settled some, but not all,
                of such
                matters. Insurance carriers have reacted to mold related liability
                awards by
                excluding mold related claims from standard policies and pricing
                mold
                endorsements at prohibitively high rates. The Company has, however,
                purchased
                pollution liability insurance, which includes some coverage for mold.
                The
                Company has adopted programs designed to manage the existence of
                mold in its
                properties as well as guidelines for promptly addressing and resolving
                reports
                of mold to minimize any impact mold might have on residents or property.
                Liabilities resulting from such mold related matters and the costs
                of carrying
                insurance to address potential mold related claims may also be substantial.
                The
                Company is subject to various other lawsuits in the normal course
                of its
                business operations. Accordingly, such lawsuits, as well as the class
                action
                lawsuit described above, could result in substantial costs and diversion
                of
                resources and could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial
                condition, results of operations or cash flows.

Return
                  of Capital

Under
                  provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, the
                  portion of the
                  cash dividend, if any, that exceeds earnings and profits is considered
                  a return
                  of capital. The return of capital is generated due to a variety
                  of factors,
                  including the deduction of non-cash expenses, primarily depreciation,
                  in the
                  determination of earnings and profits.

Dividends
                      and Distributions

Since
                      its
                      initial public offering on June 13, 1994, the Company has paid
                      regular quarterly
                      dividends to its stockholders. The Company has paid the following
                      dividends per
                      share of common stock:

Future
                        distributions by the Company will be at the discretion of
                        the Board of Directors
                        and will depend on the actual cash flows from operations
                        of the Company, its
                        financial condition, capital requirements, the annual distribution
                        requirements
                        under the REIT provisions of the Internal Revenue Code, applicable
                        legal
                        restrictions and such other factors as the Board of Directors
                        deems relevant.
                        There are currently no contractual restrictions on the Company’s present or
                        future ability to pay dividends.

                      per share increase to the quarterly cash dividend, which represents
                      a $0.36
                      increase on an annualized basis. Accordingly, the first quarter

Dividend
                      Reinvestment and Share Purchase Plan

The
                      Company has adopted a dividend reinvestment and share purchase
                      plan designed to
                      provide holders of Common Stock with a convenient and economical
                      means to
                      reinvest all or a portion of their cash dividends in shares
                      of Common Stock and
                      to acquire additional shares of Common Stock through voluntary

Stockholder
                      Rights Plan

In
                      1998,
                      the Company adopted a stockholder rights plan that is designed
                      to enhance the
                      ability of all of the Company’s stockholders to realize the long-term value of
                      their investment. The rights plan is designed, in part, to
                      prevent a person or
                      group from gaining control of the Company without offering
                      a fair price to all
                      of the Company’s stockholders.

On
                      October 13, 1998, the Board declared a one-for-one preferred
                      share purchase
                      right (a “Right”) for each outstanding share of Common Stock. Each Right
                      entitles the registered holder to purchase from the Company
                      one one-hundredth of
                      a share of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock, par
                      value $.0001 per
                      share, of the Company, at a price of $99.13 per one-hundredth
                      of a share,
                      subject to adjustment. The description and terms of the Rights
                      are set forth in
                      a Rights Agreement dated as of November 11, 1998, as amended
                      between the Company
                      and Computershare, LLC as Rights Agent.

During
                      2006, pursuant to a registration statement and its Controlled
                      Equity Offering
                      program, the Company issued and sold approximately 427,700
                      shares of common
                      stock for $48.3 million, net of fees and commissions. The Company
                      used the net
                      proceeds from the offerings to pay down outstanding borrowings
                      under the

                      corporate purposes.


Unregistered
                        Sale of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds

During
                        October 2006, the Operating Partnership acquired Belmont
                        Terrace, a 71-unit
                        apartment community located in Belmont, California. As part
                        of the consideration
                        for this acquisition, the Operating Partnership issued approximately
                        72,685
                        partnership units, representing limited partnership interests
                        in the Operating
                        Partnership, to the sellers of this property. Such units
                        were valued in
                        aggregate at approximately $7.7 million. Such units were
                        issued in a private
                        placement and pursuant to the exemption from registration
                        set forth in Section
                        4(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. After one
                        year after issuance,
                        the units are exchangeable on a one-for-one basis into shares
                        of Essex common
                        stock. Were all of such units to be exchanged for common
                        stock, then Essex would
                        issue 72,685 shares of common stock, which is less than 1%
                        of the number of its
                        shares of common stock currently outstanding.

Interest
                                        coverage ratio represents earnings before
                                        minority interests, gain on
                                        sales of real estate, interest expense, taxes,
                                        depreciation and
                                        amortization (“adjusted EBITDA”) divided by interest expense. The Company
                                        believes that the interest coverage ratio
                                        is useful to readers because it
                                        is frequently used by investors, lenders,
                                        security analysts and other
                                        interested parties in the evaluation of companies
                                        in our industry. In
                                        addition, the Company believes that this
                                        ratio is useful in evaluating our
                                        performance compared to that of other companies
                                        in our industry because
                                        the calculation of the adjusted EBITDA component
                                        of the interest coverage
                                        ratio generally eliminates the effects of
                                        financing costs, income taxes,
                                        and depreciation and amortization, which
                                        items may vary for different
                                        companies for reasons unrelated to operating
                                        performance.


The
                                adjusted EBITDA component of the interest coverage
                                ratio, however, is not a
                                recognized measurement under U.S. generally accepted
                                accounting principles, or
                                GAAP. When analyzing our operating performance, readers
                                should use the interest
                                coverage ratio and its adjusted EBITDA component
                                in addition to, and not as an
                                alternative for, net income, as determined in accordance
                                with GAAP. Because not
                                all companies use identical calculations, our presentation
                                of the interest
                                coverage ratio and its adjusted EBITDA component
                                may not be comparable to
                                similarly titled measures of other companies. Furthermore,
                                the interest coverage
                                ratio is not intended to be a measure of free cash
                                flow for our management’s
                                discretionary use, as it does not consider certain
                                cash requirements such as
                                income tax payments, debt service requirements, capital
                                expenditures and other
                                fixed charges. The amounts shown for the interest
                                coverage ratio and adjusted
                                EBITDA may also differ from the amounts calculated
                                under similarly titled
                                definitions in our debt instruments, which can be
                                further adjusted to reflect
                                certain other cash and non-cash charges and are used
                                to determine compliance
                                with financial covenants and our ability to engage
                                in certain activities such as
                                incurring additional debt and making certain restricted
                                payments.

OVERVIEW

The
                              Company is a self-administered and self-managed REIT
                              that acquires, develops,
                              redevelops and manages apartment communities in selected
                              residential areas
                              located primarily in the west coast of the United States.
                              The Company owns all
                              of its interests in its real properties, directly or
                              indirectly, through the
                              Operating Partnership. The Company is the sole general
                              partner of the Operating
                              Partnership and, as of December 31, 2006, had an approximately
                              90.4% general
                              partner interest in the Operating Partnership.

Our
                              investment strategy has two components: constant monitoring
                              of existing markets,
                              and evaluation of new markets to identify areas with
                              the characteristics that
                              underlie rental growth. Our strong financial condition
                              supports our investment
                              strategy by enhancing our ability to quickly shift
                              our acquisition, development,
                              and disposition activities to markets that will optimize
                              the performance of the
                              portfolio.

                              of two development
                              projects, seven predevelopment projects, four TRS projects,
                              and one joint
                              venture development, aggregating 2,478 units, with
                              total incurred costs of
                              $103.5 million, and estimated remaining project costs

                              December 31, 2006, this region represented 48% of our
                              apartment units. During
                              the year ended December 31, 2006, Same-Property (as

                              increased 5.8% as compared to 2005. The Company expects
                              in 2007 new residential
                              supply of 24,200 single family homes and 18,300 apartment
                              units which represents

                              expects this region to
                              add 99,000 new jobs and generate market rent growth
                              of approximately 4.5% in

                              apartment units.
                              Same-Property revenues increase 9.2% in 2006 as compared
                              to 2005. The Company

                              As of
                              December 31, 2006, the Portland region represented
                              3% of our apartment units,
                              and the remaining 2% of our units relate to a property
                              located in Houston, Texas
                              and a property owned by a TRS. For the Portland metropolitan
                              area Same-Property
                              revenues increased 7.0% in 2006 as compared to 2005.
                              The Company expects in 2007
                              for the Portland metropolitan area new residential
                              supply of 11,000 single
                              family homes and 3,400 apartment units which represents
                              a total new supply of
                              1.8% of existing stock. The company expects the Portland
                              metropolitan area to
                              add 27,000 new jobs and generate market rent growth
                              of approximately 5.0% in
                              2007.

RESULTS

Comparison
                                of Year Ended December 31, 2006 to Year Ended December

Average
                                financial occupancy rates of the Company’s stabilized apartment communities or
“Same-Properties” (properties consolidated by the Company for each
                                of the years
                                ended December 31, 2006 and 2005) decreased to 96.4%
                                for the year ended December
                                31, 2006 from 96.6% for the year ended December 31,
                                2005. Financial occupancy is
                                defined as the percentage resulting from dividing
                                actual rental revenue by total
                                possible rental revenue. Actual rental revenue represents
                                contractual rental
                                revenue pursuant to leases without considering delinquency
                                and concessions.
                                Total possible rental revenue represents the value
                                of all apartment units, with
                                occupied units valued at contractual rental rates
                                pursuant to leases and vacant
                                units valued at estimated market rents. We believe
                                that financial occupancy is a
                                meaningful measure of occupancy because it considers
                                the value of each vacant
                                unit at its estimated market rate. Financial occupancy
                                may not completely
                                reflect short-term trends in physical occupancy and
                                financial occupancy rates as
                                disclosed by other REITs may not be comparable to
                                our calculation of financial
                                occupancy.

                                amounts, including the
                                revenues attributable to Same-Properties.

(1)
                                  Includes properties acquired after January 1, 2005,
                                  ten redevelopment
                                  communities, three office buildings, two recreational
                                  vehicle parks, and one
                                  manufactured housing community.

Same-Property
                                Revenues

increased by $18.7 million or 6.9% to $288.0 million
                                for the year ended 2006
                                compared to $269.3 million for the year ended 2005.
                                The increase was primarily
                                attributable to an increase in rental rates of


$17.4
                                  million or 6.5%, an increase of $0.7 million in
                                  revenue from the ratio utility
                                  billing system (“RUBS”), an increase of $0.7 million in ancillary property
                                  income, and a decrease in rent concessions of $0.9
                                  million compared to the year
                                  ended December 31, 2005. Delinquency was consistent
                                  for the two years, and
                                  occupancy was stable for the first three quarters
                                  of 2006 compared to 2005, but
                                  in the fourth quarter of 2006 occupancy decreased
                                  by $0.9 million compared to
                                  fourth quarter of 2005.

Non-Same
                                  Property Revenues

increased by $13.4 million or 32.2% to $55.1 million
                                  for the year ended 2006
                                  compared to $41.7 million for the year ended 2005.
                                  The increase in non-same
                                  property revenues was primarily due to eight properties
                                  acquired since January
                                  1, 2005.

Management
                                  and other fees from affiliates

decreased
                                  by approximately $5.9 million or 54% for 2006 due
                                  primarily to $7.1 million in
                                  promote income recorded during 2005 related to
                                  the sale of Fund I assets, as
                                  compared to $1.2 million in promote income from
                                  Fund I during 2006.

Total
                                  Expenses

increased $15.3 million or 5% to $297.6 million
                                  for 2006 from $282.3 million for
                                  2005. The increase was primarily due to increases
                                  in utility expense, real
                                  estate taxes, insurance expense, and salaries.
                                  Utility expense increased by $3.1
                                  million over the prior year due mainly to higher
                                  natural gas and electrical
                                  prices in the first two quarters of 2006. Real
                                  estate taxes increased $2.8
                                  million over the prior year due mainly to increases
                                  in assessment of properties
                                  in the Pacific Northwest and new acquisitions.
                                  Insurance expense increased $0.9
                                  million over prior year due to increases in earthquake
                                  and property liability
                                  premiums. Salaries increased mainly due to an increase
                                  in payroll salaries over
                                  the prior year, an increase in equity based compensation
                                  expense, and higher
                                  operating expenses due to the acquisition of eight
                                  properties in the past year.

Interest
                                  expense

increased
                                  by $2.1 million or 3% for 2006 to $72.9 million,
                                  net of $3.9 million in
                                  capitalized interest, compared to $70.8 million,
                                  net of $ 1.1 in capitalized
                                  interest for 2005. The increase was mainly due
                                  to an increase in total
                                  outstanding debt of $57 million between 2006 and
                                  2005, and higher short-term
                                  borrowing rates.

Other
                                  expenses

decreased
                                  $4.1 million or 70% to $1.8 million for 2006 compared
                                  to $5.8 million for 2005.
                                  During 2006, the Company incurred $970 in net pursuit
                                  costs related to the
                                  Company’s attempt to acquire the Town & Country REIT in the first quarter of
                                  2006 and the Company recorded a $0.8 million impairment
                                  charge on a property in
                                  Houston, Texas during the third quarter of 2006.
                                  During 2005, the Company
                                  recorded the following other expenses: (i) a $1.5
                                  million charge related to a

                                  compensation costs related to
                                  $6.1 million in interest income realized on The
                                  Essex on Lake Merritt
                                  participating loan in the third quarter of 2005,
                                  (iii) an impairment loss of

                                  of various mortgage

                                  for 2006 compared to a gain of $6.4 million recorded
                                  for 2005 resulting from the

                                  deposits from a potential
                                  disposition and approximately $1.9 million in interest
                                  income on cash balances,
                                  as compared to $6.1 million in interest income
                                  from the Essex on Lake Merritt

                                        these revenue amounts, including the

                                          Includes properties acquired subsequent
                                          to January 1, 2004, seven redevelopment
                                          communities, two development communities,
                                          three office buildings, three
                                          recreational vehicle parks, and one manufactured
                                          housing community.

2005/2004
                                        Same-Property revenues

increased by $9.3 million or 4.4% to $222.3
                                        million for the year ended 2005 from
                                        $213.0 million for the year ended 2004. The
                                        majority of this increase was due to
                                        rental rate growth of 4.0% or $5.0 million
                                        attributable to the 2005/2004
                                        Same-Properties located in Southern California
                                        and rental rate growth of 1.1% or
                                        approximately $0.5 million attributable to
                                        the 2005/2004 Same-Properties located
                                        in the Seattle Metro area. The apartment
                                        communities properties located in
                                        Northern California achieved rental rate
                                        growth of 0.7% or approximately $0.4
                                        million. Property revenues for 2005/2004
                                        Same-Properties also increased due to
                                        an increase in occupancy from 95.4% in 2004
                                        to 96.6% for 2005, for an increase
                                        in revenues of $1.9 million. Rent concessions
                                        also decreased in the second half
                                        of 2005, which increased 2005 revenues by
                                        $0.4 million for the 2005/2004
                                        Same-Property portfolio.

2005/2004
                                        Non-Same Property Revenues

increased
                                        by $27.5 or 45.0% to $88.7 million for 2005
                                        from $61.2 million for 2004. The
                                        increase was primarily generated from communities
                                        acquired and or developed and
                                        increased rents from redeveloped properties.
                                        Subsequent to January 1, 2004, the
                                        Company acquired 16 apartment communities
                                        or 3,262 units and completed the
                                        construction of 756 units.

Management
                                        and other fees from affiliates

decreased
                                        by approximately $12.2 million in 2005 due primarily to the promote income
                                        from Fund I being reduced from $18.3 million
                                        in 2004 to $7.0 million in 2005 as
                                        Fund I finished the liquidation of its assets.
                                        Development and redevelopment
                                        fees from Fund I decreased by $1.1 million
                                        during 2005 from $1.3 million in 2004
                                        to $0.2 million in 2005 as the expenditures
                                        for Fund I’s development assets
                                        decreased as the assets were sold in the
                                        second half of 2004 and early
                                        2005.

Total
                                        Expenses

increased 15% to $282.2 million for 2005
                                        from $245.6 million for 2004. The
                                        increase was due primarily to depreciation
                                        and amortization, real estate taxes,
                                        property operating expenses, and other expenses.
                                        For 2005 as compared to 2004,
                                        depreciation and amortization increased 12%
                                        or $8.2 million, real estate taxes
                                        increased 12% or $2.9 million, and property
                                        operating expenses increased 11% or
                                        $8.1 million due to the purchase of 16 apartment
                                        communities since January 1,
                                        2004.


Interest
                                          expense

increased
                                          17% to $70.8 million, net of $1.1 of capitalized
                                          interest for 2005, as compared
                                          to $60.7 million, net of $2.0 million of
                                          capitalized interest, for 2004. The
                                          increase was primarily due to an increase
                                          in LIBOR during 2005, and during the
                                          fourth quarter of 2005 the Company issued
                                          $225 million in exchangeable bonds.
                                          The proceeds from the bond issuance were
                                          used to pay the lines of credit and
                                          certain mortgage notes payable, and repurchase
                                          $25 million in common
                                          stock.

                                          $5.8
                                          million for 2005. During 2005, the Company

                                          to a legal settlement, (ii) $1.4
                                          million in incentive compensation costs
                                          related to $6.1 million in interest
                                          income realized on The Essex on Lake Merritt
                                          participating loan in the third

                                          of 2005, and (iv) pre-payment penalties
                                          and write-off of deferred charges in the
                                          amount of $1.6 million related to the
                                          early termination of various mortgage notes
                                          payable during the fourth quarter of
                                          2005.

Gain
                                          on sale of real estate

decreased by $1.5 million for 2005 to $6.4
                                          million compared to $7.9 million
                                          recorded in 2004. During 2005, Essex recognized
                                          $5.0 million in gains previously
                                          deferred in 2004 on the sale of Essex on
                                          Lake Merritt and $1.4 million in gains
                                          from our TRS activity. The gain of $7.9
                                          million recorded in the third quarter of
                                          2004 related to the sale of The Essex on
                                          Lake Merritt.

Interest
                                          and other income

increased
                                          by $5.4 million to $8.5 million for 2005
                                          compared to $3.1 million for 2004. The
                                          increase is primarily attributable to the
                                          receipt of $6.1 million in interest
                                          income related to The Essex on Lake Merritt
                                          participating loan in

                                          $18.1 million on sales of Fund I properties.

                                          by $2.3 million during 2005 due to taxable

                                          due primarily from the sale of the Eastridge

Essex
                                          has
                                          a $200 million unsecured line of credit
                                          and, as of December 31, 2006, there was
                                          no outstanding balance on the line. This
                                          facility matures in March 2009, with an
                                          option for a one-year extension. The underlying
                                          interest rate on this line is
                                          based on a tiered rate structure tied to
                                          our corporate ratings and is currently
                                          LIBOR plus 0.8%. We also have a $100 million
                                          credit facility from Freddie Mac,
                                          which is secured by eight of Essex's apartment
                                          communities. As of December 31,
                                          2006, we had $93.0 million outstanding
                                          under this line of credit, which bears
                                          an
                                          average interest rate of 6.2% and matures
                                          in January 2009. The underlying
                                          interest rate on this line is between 55
                                          and 59 basis points over the Freddie
                                          Mac Reference Rate. Fund II has a credit
                                          facility aggregating $56 million. This
                                          line bears interest at LIBOR plus 0.875%,
                                          and matures on June 30, 2007. The
                                          Company has the capacity to issue up to
                                          approximately $20 million in equity
                                          securities, and the Operating Partnership
                                          has the capacity to issue up to $250
                                          million of debt securities under our existing

                                            liquidation preference, which is equivalent
                                            to an initial conversion price of
                                            approximately $136.62 per share of common
                                            stock (the conversion rate will be

                                            of specified events). On or after July

Derivative
                                            Activity

As
                                            of
                                            December 31, 2006 the Company had entered
                                            into forward-starting interest rate
                                            swaps totaling a notional amount of $450
                                            million with interest rates ranging
                                            from 4.9% to 5.9% and settlements dates
                                            ranging from April 2007 to July 2011.
                                            These derivatives qualify for hedge accounting
                                            and will economically hedge the
                                            cash flows associated with the refinancing
                                            of debt that matures between April
                                            2007 and July 2011. The decrease in the
                                            fair value of these derivatives during
                                            the year ended December 31, 2006 was
                                            approximately $2.9 million and is reflected
                                            in accumulated other comprehensive (loss)
                                            income in the Company’s consolidated
                                            financial statements. No hedge ineffectiveness
                                            on cash flow hedges was
                                            recognized during the year ended December
                                            31, 2006.

Issuance
                                            of Common Stock

During
                                            2006, the Company issued and sold approximately
                                            427,700 shares of common stock
                                            for $48.3 million, net of fees and commissions,
                                            under its Controlled Equity
                                            Offering program; the average price per
                                            share was $115.16. Under this program,
                                            the Company may from time to time sell
                                            shares of common stock into the existing
                                            trading market at current market prices,
                                            and the Company anticipates using the
                                            net proceeds from such sales to fund
                                            development and redevelopment pipelines.
                                            The Company used the net proceeds from
                                            the common stock sales to pay down
                                            outstanding borrowings under the Company’s lines of credit, to fund real estate
                                            investments and for general corporate
                                            purposes.

Capital
                                            Expenditures

Non-revenue
                                            generating capital expenditures are improvements
                                            and upgrades that extend the
                                            useful life of the property. For the
                                            year ended December 31, 2006, non-revenue
                                            generating capital expenditures totaled
                                            approximately $814 per unit. The Company
                                            expects to incur approximately $850 per
                                            unit in non-revenue generating capital
                                            expenditures for the year ended December
                                            31, 2007. These expenditures do not
                                            include the improvements required in
                                            connection with the origination of mortgage
                                            loans, expenditures for deferred maintenance
                                            on acquisition properties,
                                            expenditures for property renovations
                                            and improvements which are expected to
                                            generate additional revenue, and renovation
                                            expenditures required pursuant to
                                            tax-exempt bond financings. The Company
                                            expects that cash from operations and/or
                                            its lines of credit will fund such expenditures.
                                            However, there can be no
                                            assurance that the actual expenditures
                                            incurred during 2007 and/or the funding
                                            thereof will not be significantly different
                                            than the Company’s current
                                            expectations.


Development
                                              and Predevelopment Pipeline

The
                                              Company defines development activities
                                              as new properties that are being
                                              constructed, or are newly constructed
                                              and, in the case of development
                                              communities, are in a phase of lease-up
                                              and have not yet reached stabilized
                                              operations; or, in the case of TRS
                                              development projects, have not yet
                                              been sold.
                                              As of December 31, 2006, excluding
                                              development projects owned by Fund
                                              II, the
                                              Company had two development projects
                                              comprised of 513 units for an estimated
                                              cost of $167.3 million, of which $126.9
                                              million remains to be expended. See
                                              discussion in the section, “Risks that development activities will
                                              be delayed or
                                              not completed and/or fail to achieve
                                              expected results” in Item 1A, Risk Factors,
                                              of this Form 10-K.

The
                                              Company defines the predevelopment
                                              pipeline as new properties in negotiation
                                              or
                                              in the entitlement process with a high
                                              likelihood of becoming development
                                              activities. As of December 31, 2006,
                                              the Company had development communities
                                              aggregating 1,845 units that were classified
                                              as predevelopment projects. The
                                              estimated total cost of the predevelopment
                                              pipeline at December 31, 2006 is
                                              $557.0 million, of which $514.8 million
                                              remains to be expended.

The
                                              Company had four other development
                                              projects owned by TRS entities that
                                              are under
                                              development aggregating 120 units.
                                              The estimated total cost of the other
                                              development projects at December 31,
                                              2006 is $42.0 million, of which $21.8
                                              million remains to be expended. The
                                              Company has also incurred $0.7 million
                                              in
                                              costs related to a joint venture development
                                              with a third party.

The
                                              Company expects to fund the development
                                              pipeline by using a combination of
                                              some
                                              or all of the following sources: its
                                              working capital, amounts available
                                              on its
                                              lines of credit, net proceeds from
                                              public and private equity and debt
                                              issuances,
                                              and proceeds from the disposition of
                                              properties, if any.

Redevelopment
                                              Pipeline

The
                                              Company defines redevelopment activities
                                              as existing properties owned or
                                              recently acquired, which have been
                                              targeted for additional investment
                                              by the
                                              Company with the expectation of increased
                                              financial returns through property
                                              improvement. The Company’s redevelopment strategy strives to
                                              improve the
                                              financial and physical aspects of the
                                              Company’s redevelopment apartment
                                              communities and to target at least
                                              a 10 percent return on the incremental
                                              renovation investment. Many of the
                                              Company’s properties are older and in
                                              excellent neighborhoods, providing
                                              lower density with large floor plans
                                              that
                                              represent attractive redevelopment
                                              opportunities.

During

Critical
                                                Accounting Policies and Estimates

The
                                                preparation of consolidated financial
                                                statements, in accordance with U.S.
                                                generally accepted accounting principles
                                                requires the Company to make estimates
                                                and judgments that affect the reported
                                                amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues
                                                and expenses and related disclosures
                                                of contingent assets and liabilities.
                                                We
                                                define critical accounting policies
                                                as those accounting policies that
                                                require
                                                our management to exercise their
                                                most difficult, subjective and complex
                                                judgments. Our critical accounting
                                                policies relate principally to the
                                                following
                                                key areas: (i) consolidation under
                                                applicable accounting standards of
                                                various
                                                entities; (ii) assessing the carrying
                                                values of our real estate properties
                                                and

                                                cost capitalization. The Company
                                                bases its estimates on historical
                                                experience,
                                                current market conditions, and on

                                                believed to
                                                be reasonable under the circumstances.
                                                Actual results may differ from those
                                                estimates made by management.

The
                                                Company assesses each entity in which
                                                it has an investment or contractual
                                                relationship to determine if it may
                                                be deemed to be a VIE. If such an
                                                entity is
                                                a VIE, then the Company analyzes
                                                the expected losses and expected
                                                residual
                                                returns to determine who is the primary
                                                beneficiary. If the Company is the
                                                primary beneficiary, then the entity
                                                is consolidated. The analysis required
                                                to
                                                identify VIEs and primary beneficiaries
                                                is complex and judgmental, and the
                                                analysis must be applied to various
                                                types of entities and legal
                                                structures.

                                                  Interest is capitalized on real
                                                  estate assets that require a period

                                                  is
                                                  based upon the average amount of
                                                  accumulated development expenditures
                                                  during the

                                                  activities. Indirect project costs
                                                  consist primarily of personnel
                                                  costs associated with construction

The
                                                  Company bases its estimates on

                                                    and the following:

Development
                                                    and Redevelopment Activities

The
                                                    Company pursues multifamily residential
                                                    properties and development and
                                                    redevelopment projects from time
                                                    to time. These projects generally
                                                    require
                                                    various government and other
                                                    approvals, the receipt of which
                                                    cannot be assured.
                                                    The Company's development and
                                                    redevelopment activities generally
                                                    entail certain
                                                    risks, including the following:

These
                                                    risks may reduce the funds available
                                                    for distribution to the Company's
                                                    stockholders. Further, the development
                                                    and redevelopment of properties
                                                    is also
                                                    subject to the general risks
                                                    associated with real estate
                                                    investments.

Interest
                                                    Rate Fluctuations

The
                                                    Company monitors changes in interest
                                                    rates and believes that it is
                                                    well
                                                    positioned from both a liquidity
                                                    and interest rate risk perspective.
                                                    However,
                                                    current interest rates are at
                                                    historic lows and potentially
                                                    could increase
                                                    rapidly to levels more in line
                                                    with higher historical levels.
                                                    The immediate
                                                    effect of significant and rapid
                                                    interest rate increases would
                                                    result in higher
                                                    interest expense on the Company's
                                                    variable interest rate debt.
                                                    The effect of
                                                    prolonged interest rate increases
                                                    could negatively impact the Company's
                                                    ability
                                                    to make acquisitions and develop
                                                    properties at economic returns
                                                    on investment
                                                    and the Company's ability to
                                                    refinance existing borrowings
                                                    at acceptable
                                                    rates.

Funds
                                                    From Operations (FFO)

FFO
                                                    is a
                                                    financial measure that is commonly
                                                    used in the REIT industry. Essex
                                                    presents
                                                    funds from operations as a supplemental
                                                    performance measure. FFO is not
                                                    used by
                                                    Essex, nor should it be considered
                                                    to be, as an alternative to net
                                                    earnings
                                                    computed under GAAP as an indicator
                                                    of Essex’s operating performance or as
                                                    an
                                                    alternative to cash from operating
                                                    activities computed under GAAP
                                                    as an
                                                    indicator of Essex’s ability to fund its cash needs.

FFO
                                                    is
                                                    not meant to represent a comprehensive
                                                    system of financial reporting
                                                    and does
                                                    not present, nor does Essex intend
                                                    it to present, a complete picture
                                                    of its
                                                    financial condition and operating
                                                    performance. Essex believes that
                                                    net earnings
                                                    computed under GAAP remains the
                                                    primary measure of performance
                                                    and that FFO is
                                                    only meaningful when it is used
                                                    in conjunction with net earnings.
                                                    Further, Essex
                                                    believes that its consolidated
                                                    financial statements, prepared
                                                    in accordance with
                                                    GAAP, provide the most meaningful
                                                    picture of its financial condition
                                                    and its
                                                    operating performance.


In
                                                      calculating FFO, Essex follows
                                                      the definition for this measure
                                                      published by the
                                                      National Association of REITs
                                                      (“NAREIT”), which is a REIT trade association.
                                                      Essex believes that, under
                                                      the NAREIT FFO definition,
                                                      the two most significant
                                                      adjustments made to net income
                                                      are (i) the exclusion of historical
                                                      cost
                                                      depreciation and (ii) the exclusion
                                                      of gains and losses from the
                                                      sale of
                                                      previously depreciated properties.
                                                      Essex agrees that these two

Management
                                                      has consistently applied the
                                                      NAREIT definition of FFO to

                                                      However, other REITs in calculating
                                                      FFO may vary from the NAREIT

                                                      disclosure of FFO may not be
                                                      comparable to Essex’s

The
                                        Company’s objective in using derivatives is to add
                                        stability to interest expense
                                        and to manage its exposure to interest rate
                                        movements or other identified
                                        risks.  To accomplish this objective, the Company
                                        primarily uses interest
                                        rate swaps as part of its cash flow hedging
                                        strategy. Interest rate swaps
                                        designated as cash flow hedges involve the
                                        receipt of variable-rate amounts in
                                        exchange for fixed-rate payments over the
                                        life of the agreements without
                                        exchange of the underlying principal amount.
                                        As of December 31, 2006, we have
                                        entered into nine forward-starting swap contracts
                                        to mitigate the risk of
                                        changes in the interest-related cash outflows
                                        on forecasted issuance of
                                        long-term debt. The forward-starting swaps
                                        are cash flow hedges of the
                                        variability in ten years of forecasted interest
                                        payments associated with the
                                        refinancing of the Company’s long-term debt between 2007 and 2011. As
                                        of
                                        December 31, 2006, the Company also had $186.3
                                        million of variable rate
                                        indebtedness, of which $182.8 million is
                                        subject to interest rate cap
                                        protection. All of our derivative instruments
                                        are designated as cash flow
                                        hedges, and the Company does not have any
                                        fair value hedges as of December 31,
                                        2006. The following table summarizes the
                                        notional amount, carrying value, and
                                        estimated fair value of our derivative instruments
                                        used to hedge interest rates
                                        as of December 31, 2006. The notional amount
                                        represents the aggregate amount of
                                        a particular security that is currently hedged
                                        at one time, but does not
                                        represent exposure to credit, interest rates
                                        or market risks. The table also
                                        includes a sensitivity analysis to demonstrate
                                        the impact on our derivative
                                        instruments from an increase or decrease
                                        in LIBOR by 50 basis points, as of

                                          Rate Sensitive Liabilities

The
                                        Company is exposed to interest rate changes
                                        primarily as a result of its line of
                                        credit and long-term debt used to maintain
                                        liquidity and fund capital
                                        expenditures and expansion of the Company’s real estate investment portfolio and
                                        operations. The Company’s interest rate risk management objective
                                        is to limit
                                        the impact of interest rate changes on earnings
                                        and cash flows and to lower its
                                        overall borrowing costs. To achieve its objectives
                                        the Company borrows primarily
                                        at fixed rates and may enter into derivative
                                        financial instruments such as
                                        interest rate swaps, caps and treasury locks
                                        in order to mitigate its interest
                                        rate risk on a related financial instrument.
                                        The Company does not enter into
                                        derivative or interest rate transactions
                                        for speculative purposes.

The
                                        Company’s interest rate risk is monitored using a
                                        variety of techniques. The
                                        table below presents the principal amounts
                                        and weighted average interest rates
                                        by year of expected maturity to evaluate
                                        the expected cash flows. Management
                                        believes that the carrying amounts of its
                                        LIBOR debt approximates fair value as
                                        of December 31, 2006 because interest rates,
                                        yields and other terms for these
                                        instruments are consistent with yields and
                                        other terms currently available to
                                        the Company for similar instruments. Management
                                        has estimated that the fair
                                        value of the


Company’s
                                          $1.13 billion of fixed rate mortgage notes
                                          payable and exchangeable bonds at
                                          December 31, 2006 is approximately $1.22
                                          billion based on the terms of existing
                                          mortgage notes payable compared to those
                                          available in the marketplace.

The

                                          incorporates only those exposures that
                                          exist as of December 31, 2006; it does
                                          not consider those exposures or positions
                                          that could arise after that date. As a

                                          fluctuations, would depend on the exposures
                                          that arise during the period, our
                                          hedging strategies at the time, and interest

As

                                          December 31, 2006, we carried out an evaluation,
                                          under the supervision and with
                                          the participation of management, including
                                          our Chief Executive Officer and Chief
                                          Financial Officer, of the effectiveness
                                          of the design and operation of our
                                          disclosure controls and procedures pursuant
                                          to Rules 13a-15 of the Securities
                                          Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Based
                                          upon that evaluation, the Chief

                                          concluded that our disclosure

                                          timely alerting management to material
                                          information relating to the Company that
                                          is required to be included in our
                                          periodic filings with the Securities and
                                          Exchange Commission.

There
                                          were no changes in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting,

                                          occurred during the quarter ended December
                                          31, 2006, that have materially
                                          affected, or are reasonably likely to materially
                                          affect, the Company’s internal
                                          control over financial reporting.

Management’s

                                          Reporting

Our
                                          management is responsible for establishing
                                          and maintaining adequate internal
                                          control over financial reporting (as defined
                                          in Rule 13a-15(f) under the
                                          Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended).
                                          Our management assessed the
                                          effectiveness of our internal control over
                                          financial reporting as of
                                          December 31, 2006. In making this assessment, our
                                          management used the
                                          criteria set forth by the Committee of
                                          Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
                                          Commission (“COSO”) in Internal Control-Integrated Framework.
                                          Our management has
                                          concluded that, as of December 31, 2006, our internal control over
                                          financial reporting was effective based
                                          on these criteria. Our independent
                                          registered public accounting firm, KPMG
                                          LLP, has issued an audit report on our
                                          assessment of our internal control over
                                          financial reporting, which is included
                                          herein.

                                            Property Trust, Inc’s management is
                                            responsible for maintaining effective
                                            internal control over financial reporting
                                            and for its assessment of the effectiveness
                                            of internal control over financial
                                            reporting. Our responsibility is to express
                                            an opinion on management’s
                                            assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness
                                            of the Company’s internal control
                                            over financial reporting based on our
                                            audit.

We
                                            conducted our audit in accordance with
                                            the standards of the Public Company
                                            Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
                                            Those standards require that we plan
                                            and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
                                            assurance about whether effective
                                            internal control over financial reporting
                                            was maintained in all material
                                            respects. Our audit included obtaining
                                            an understanding of internal control
                                            over
                                            financial reporting, evaluating management’s assessment, testing and evaluating
                                            the design and operating effectiveness
                                            of internal control, and performing such
                                            other procedures as we considered necessary
                                            in the circumstances. We believe
                                            that our audit provides a reasonable
                                            basis for our opinion.

A
                                            company’s internal control over financial reporting
                                            is a process designed to
                                            provide reasonable assurance regarding
                                            the reliability of financial reporting
                                            and the preparation of financial statements
                                            for external purposes in accordance
                                            with generally accepted accounting principles.
                                            A company’s internal control over
                                            financial reporting includes those policies
                                            and procedures that (1) pertain to
                                            the maintenance of records that, in reasonable
                                            detail, accurately and fairly
                                            reflect the transactions and dispositions
                                            of the assets of the company; (2)
                                            provide reasonable assurance that transactions
                                            are recorded as necessary to
                                            permit preparation of financial statements
                                            in accordance with generally accepted
                                            accounting principles, and that receipts
                                            and expenditures of the company are
                                            being made only in accordance with authorizations
                                            of management and directors of
                                            the company; and (3) provide reasonable
                                            assurance regarding prevention or timely
                                            detection of unauthorized acquisition,
                                            use, or disposition of the company’s
                                            assets that could have a material effect
                                            on the financial
                                            statements.

Because
                                            of its inherent limitations, internal
                                            control over financial reporting may
                                            not
                                            prevent or detect misstatements. Also,
                                            projections of any evaluation of
                                            effectiveness to future periods are subject
                                            to the risk that controls may become
                                            inadequate because of changes in conditions,
                                            or that the degree of compliance
                                            with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In
                                            our
                                            opinion, management’s assessment that Essex Property Trust,
                                            Inc. maintained
                                            effective internal control over financial
                                            reporting as of December 31,
                                            2006, is fairly stated, in all material
                                            respects, based on criteria established
                                            in Internal Control-Integrated Framework

                                            Property Trust, Inc. maintained, in all
                                            material respects, effective internal

We
                                                have
                                                audited the accompanying consolidated

                                                stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for
                                                each of the years in the three-year
                                                period ended December 31, 2006. In
                                                connection with our audits of the
                                                consolidated financial statements,
                                                we have
                                                also audited the accompanying financial
                                                statement schedule III. These
                                                consolidated financial statements
                                                and the accompanying financial statement
                                                schedule III are the responsibility
                                                of the Company’s management. Our
                                                responsibility is to express an opinion
                                                on these consolidated financial
                                                statements and the accompanying financial
                                                statement schedule III based on our
                                                audits.

We
                                                conducted our audits in accordance
                                                with the standards of the Public
                                                Company
                                                Accounting Oversight Board (United
                                                States). Those standards require
                                                that we plan
                                                and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
                                                assurance about whether the financial
                                                statements are free of material misstatement.
                                                An audit includes examining, on a
                                                test basis, evidence supporting the
                                                amounts and disclosures in the financial
                                                statements. An audit also includes
                                                assessing the accounting principles
                                                used and
                                                significant estimates made by management,
                                                as well as evaluating the overall
                                                financial statement presentation.
                                                We believe that our audits provide
                                                a
                                                reasonable basis for our opinion.

In
                                                our
                                                opinion, the consolidated financial
                                                statements referred to above present

                                              $306.7 million and was structured as
                                              a
                                              tax-free reorganization whereby the
                                              Company: (i) issued 2,719,875 shares

                                              common stock valued at $136.8 million,
                                              (ii) assumed mortgages on four of the

                                              $64.6 million with a fixed interest
                                              rate of 5.51%, maturing in January
                                              2013, (iii) assumed and repaid unsecured
                                              liabilities in the amount of approximately
                                              $33.0 million, and (iv) paid the

                                              using the purchase method of accounting
                                              which resulted in the allocation of
                                              the
                                              purchase price to the assets and liabilities
                                              acquired based on their fair
                                              values. The fair value of assets and
                                              liabilities were based on management’s
                                              estimates. No goodwill was recognized
                                              in connection with this purchase.

                                                  recoverable, the
                                                  carrying amount will be evaluated
                                                  for impairment. If the sum of the

                                                  then the
                                                  Company will recognize an impairment
                                                  loss equal to the excess of the
                                                  carrying
                                                  amount over the fair value of the
                                                  property. Such fair value of a

                                                  cash flow, the property’s unleveraged yield in comparison
                                                  to the unleveraged
                                                  yields and sales prices of similar
                                                  properties that have been recently

During
                                                  the second quarter of 2006, the
                                                  Company recorded an impairment
                                                  loss of $0.8
                                                  million and in fourth quarter of
                                                  2005 the Company recorded an impairment
                                                  loss of
                                                  $1.3 million resulting from write-downs
                                                  of a property’s value in Houston, Texas,
                                                  to reduce the property’s carrying value to its estimated
                                                  fair value. The
                                                  impairment charges are recorded
                                                  in other expenses in the accompanying
                                                  consolidated statements of operations.
                                                  There was an impairment charge
                                                  of $0.7
                                                  million recorded in the second
                                                  quarter of 2004 related to the
                                                  sale of an RV park
                                                  in Hemet, California. That impairment
                                                  charge was recorded in discontinued
                                                  operations in the accompanying
                                                  consolidated statements of operations.

                                                  properties were acquired as part
                                                  of the Sachs Portfolio (see Note

                                                  consummation of the transaction.
                                                  It is not unusual for matters to
                                                  arise that

                                                  of the offer during this process.
