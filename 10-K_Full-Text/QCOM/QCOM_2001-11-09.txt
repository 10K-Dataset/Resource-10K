Overview

Since first proposing CDMA technology to the
wireless industry in 1989, we have been the pioneer of CDMA
technology for commercial wireless applications. Our
intellectual property portfolio is widely recognized as
essential for the development, manufacture and sale of products
implementing the cdmaOne, CDMA2000 1X/1xEV-DO, WCDMA, and
TD-SCDMA wireless air interface standards. We have significant
engineering resources, including engineers with substantial
expertise in CDMA technology. Utilizing these resources, we
expect to develop new CDMA-based technology, participate in the
formation of new wireless telecommunications standards and
assist in deployments of working networks around the world. We
license and receive license fees and royalty payments on our
CDMA technology from major domestic and international
telecommunications equipment suppliers.

We are a leading developer and supplier of
CDMA-based integrated circuits and system software for wireless
voice and data communications and Global Positioning System
(GPS) products. We offer complete system solutions
including software and integrated circuits for wireless handsets
and infrastructure equipment. This complete system solution
approach provides customers with advanced wireless technology,
enhanced component integration and interoperability, and reduced
time to market. We provide integrated circuits and system
software to many of the world’s leading wireless handset
and infrastructure manufacturers. We have broad and unique
expertise in designing and developing CDMA-based integrated
circuits, the associated software, reference designs and tools,
and we have the expertise to provide the technical support
necessary to create a complete CDMA system solution. We plan to
further integrate additional components and functionality into a
single integrated circuit to help our customers reduce product
costs and size and to simplify customers’ design processes.
In addition, we will continue to provide high quality support to
enable our customers to reduce their design cycles and meet
their time to market objectives.

We provide satellite and terrestrial-based
two-way data messaging and position reporting services for
transportation companies and private fleets. We design,
manufacture and distribute products and provide services for our
OmniTRACS and TruckMAIL (satellite-based mobile communications
system), OmniEx-



press (terrestrial CDMA-based system) and LINQ
(terrestrial GSM-based system) worldwide. Transportation
companies and private fleets use our products to communicate
with drivers, monitor vehicle location and provide customer
service. We also integrate the mobile data with operations
software, such as dispatch, payroll and accounting, so end-users
can manage their information and operations.

We provide an open applications platform for
wireless devices to provide solutions for the wireless industry
as it moves toward wireless Internet convergence. The platform,
our Binary Runtime Environment for Wireless (BREW), is a thin
applications environment that provides applications developers
with an open standard platform for wireless devices on which to
develop their products. The BREW platform currently leverages
the capabilities available in QUALCOMM CDMA Technologies’
(QCT) integrated circuits, system software and Wireless
Internet Launchpad software, enabling development of
feature-rich applications and content while reducing memory
overhead and maximizing system performance. The BREW platform
also enables over-the-air downloads of applications by end users
directly to their BREW-enabled handsets. In November 2001, Korea
Telecom FreeTel Co., Ltd. (KTFreeTel), a leading CDMA carrier in
Korea, began commercial service of BREW-enabled applications and
services to subscribers, providing end users the ability to
download wireless applications over the air and customize their
phones with software that meets their individual needs.
KTFreeTel’s wireless multimedia service runs on a CDMA2000
1X high-speed data network and is available to end users on
color display handsets.

In September 2001, The Carmel Group forecast
that 840 million people will subscribe to mobile
telecommunications service by the end of this calendar year and
that the figure will grow to 1.66 billion globally by the end of
2006, exceeding fixed wireline phones subscribers. Wireless
networks based on the current implementation of our CDMA
technology, referred to as cdmaOne, have been commercially
deployed or are under development or trials in 50 countries
around the world, with 44 countries already in commercial
operations. According to the European Mobile Communications
Cellular Database, CDMA carriers had over 104 million
commercial subscribers worldwide in September 2001. In
October 2001, the CDMA Development Group reported that, as
of June 2001, the Asia Pacific region continues to be the
largest CDMA market with nearly 40 million users, representing
annual growth of 19 percent. Latin America demonstrated
significant gains in the last year, increasing 99 percent
to a total of approximately 17 million subscribers. This makes
CDMA the fastest growing wireless technology in the Latin
America region. In North America, CDMA carriers added more than
15 million new subscribers, bringing the total CDMA subscribers
to approximately 38 million, which is significantly more than
other technologies deployed in the North America region.

Our third generation (3G) CDMA2000 1X
technology was commercially deployed in October 2000 in
South Korea where there are approximately two million
CDMA2000 1X subscribers as of November 2001.
Commercial deployment is scheduled by the end of calendar year
2001 in the United States, which will make CDMA2000 1X the
first 3G technology to be commercially deployed in the United
States. In September 2001, the CDMA Development Group
reported that more than 24 models of CDMA2000 enabled handsets
are on the market today.

We continue to invest heavily in research and
development initiatives focused on extending our leadership
position in the market for wireless telecommunications products
using CDMA technology. We are developing and commercializing
CDMA technology and products to support high-speed wireless
Internet access and multimode, multi-band, multi-network
products, including cdmaOne, CDMA2000 1X/1xEV-DO, GSM/GPRS,
WCDMA and position location technologies.

We intend to remain a technology leader in the
high-speed wireless data and Internet access market. We are
devoting significant research and development resources toward
innovations in this area, including efforts relating to the
International Telecommunications Union 3G standards. We believe
that high-speed data transmission offers significant growth
opportunities in the wireless telecommunications industry, which
will enable our customers to integrate new features such as
Internet access and advanced multimedia capabilities into new
products. We believe 1xEV-DO technology will provide a high
speed, cost-effective, fixed and mobile alternative for Internet
access, competing with digital subscriber line, cable and
satellite networks. 1xEV-DO technology is designed to enable
existing wireless carriers and future CDMA2000 service providers
to obtain higher capacities and superior performance by
optimizing voice and data spectrum separately, while serving
both applications from the same base station.



We intend to continue to actively support the
rapid deployment of CDMA-based systems and technologies and the
growing demand for high speed, high capacity, wireless data and
Internet access enabled by CDMA technology to grow our royalty
revenues and integrated circuit and software sales. We plan to
continue to broadly grant royalty-bearing licenses to our
technology and patents for CDMA and other wireless applications.
In December 2000, we announced a new CDMA license program
designed to allow selected early stage companies to issue equity
to us as a means of paying part of the license fees payable
under our CDMA license agreements. We record license fee
revenues based on the fair value of the equity instruments
received, if determinable. This program does not affect the
licensees’ obligations to pay royalties under their CDMA
license agreements. The amount of cash consideration and the
timing of revenue recognition varies depending on the terms of
each agreement.

We make strategic investments to promote the
worldwide adoption of CDMA products and services for wireless
voice and Internet data communications. Our strategy is to
invest in CDMA carriers, licensed device manufacturers and
start-up companies that we believe open new markets for CDMA
technology, support the design and introduction of new
CDMA-based products or possess unique capabilities or
technology. Examples include our investments in Leap Wireless
International, Inc. (Leap Wireless), KTFreeTel and Inquam
Limited (Inquam). In addition, QUALCOMM Ventures, an internal
organization, selects and manages strategic investments in early
stage companies and, from time to time, venture funds or
incubators, or other entities that have the requisite expertise,
resources and networking capabilities to identify and create (or
assist others in creating) products, software or technologies
focused on the CDMA wireless telecommunications market. For
example, we have an interest in QUALCOMM/ Hansol iV CDMA Fund, a
partnership formed to invest in early stage companies engaged in
the development of CDMA products to support the adoption of CDMA
and the wireless Internet. We also provide financing to CDMA
carriers to facilitate the marketing and sale of CDMA equipment
by licensed manufacturers. We have provided equipment financing
to Ericsson on a shared basis with respect to their sale of CDMA
infrastructure in Brazil, Mexico and elsewhere. Most of our
strategic investments entail a high degree of risk and will not
become liquid until more than one year from the date of
investment, if at all. To the extent such investments become
liquid and meet strategic objectives, we attempt to make regular
periodic sales that are recognized in net investment income.

We have entered and expect to continue to enter
into alliances and joint ventures with strategic partners that
are designed to increase wireless usage and dependence on
wireless devices. Examples include, Technicolor Digital Cinema
LCC (Digital Cinema), a joint venture that will market the
QUALCOMM Digital Cinema System, and Wingcast LCC (Wingcast), a
joint venture with Ford Motor Company formed to develop and
deliver wireless mobility services into cars and trucks. We also
have strategic alliances that relate to our QCT business
segment. These partnerships and alliances are designed to ensure
product leadership and competitive advantages in the
marketplace. In October 2001, Wireless Knowledge Inc. (Wireless
Knowledge), a joint venture we established with Microsoft Corp.
(Microsoft) in 1998, acquired all shares held by Microsoft in
exchange for an agreement that Microsoft’s royalty
obligations under a Development, License, and Alliance Agreement
dated July 19, 2000 by and between Wireless Knowledge and
Microsoft would be considered fully paid, and certain other
consideration. As a result, Wireless Knowledge will become our
subsidiary. The new structure will enable Wireless Knowledge to
accelerate the adoption of next generation mobility solutions
running on CDMA2000 and WCDMA wireless data networks.

Wireless Telecommunications Industry
Overview

Wireless telecommunications equipment and
services have enjoyed tremendous growth worldwide in both
numbers of subscribers and subscriber usage. Growth in the
market for wireless telecommunications services has
traditionally been fueled by demand for voice communications.
There have been several factors responsible for this increasing
demand, including:

•

an increasingly mobile workforce with increased
	need for wireless voice communications;

•

lower cost of service, including flat-rate and
	bundled long-distance call pricing plans;

•

wireless networks becoming the primary
	communications infrastructure in developing countries due to the
	higher costs of and longer time required for installing wireline
	networks;



•

regulatory environments worldwide favoring
	increased competition in wireless telecommunications; and

•

increased security, privacy, call clarity and
	security of digital networks based on digital second-generation
	wireless technology standards.

In addition to the tremendous demand for wireless
voice services, wireless service providers are increasingly
focused on providing wireless data services, including wireless
access to the Internet and position location services. In May
2001, the IDC estimated that nearly 1 billion people, about 15%
of the world’s population, will be using the Internet by
2005, which we expect will result in significant demand for
access to the Internet through wireless networks. We believe
wireless technology standards enabling faster data transmission
rates and the introduction of Internet-enabled handsets will
facilitate mobile Internet access and accelerate the
proliferation of Internet use on a global basis. Critical to the
adoption of wireless Internet devices and services is high-speed
data connectivity, which is driving the evolution of wireless
standards. We expect that the spread of high-speed,
cost-effective Internet access will encourage the development of
other remote supervision, position location and telemetry
applications.

The Evolution of Wireless Standards

The significant growth in wireless penetration
worldwide and demand for enhanced network functionality requires
constant innovation to further improve network reliability,
expand capacity and introduce new types of services. To meet
these requirements, progressive generations of wireless
telecommunications technology standards have evolved.

First Generation.

The first generation wireless telecommunications standard,
widely deployed in the late 1980s, was based on analog
technology. While this generation helped fuel the adoption of
wireless telecommunications usage, the technology is
characterized by inherent capacity limitations, minimal data
transfer capabilities, low security, inconsistent service levels
and significant power consumption.

Second Generation.

As the deployment of cellular phone systems grew, the
limitations of analog technology drove the development of second
generation, digital-based technology standards. Second
generation digital technology provides for significantly
enhanced efficiency within a broadcast spectrum as well as
greatly increased capacity compared to analog systems. Second
generation technologies also enabled numerous enhanced services,
including paging, e-mail and facsimile, connections to computer
networks, greater privacy, lower prices, a greater number of
service options and greater fraud protection. The three main
second-generation digital technologies are CDMA, called cdmaOne
or IS-95A/B, a technology we developed and patented, Time
Division Multiple Access (TDMA) and Global System for
Mobile Communications (GSM), a form of TDMA.

Our CDMA technology offers 10 to 20 times
the capacity of analog systems and more than three times the
capacity of TDMA-based systems through more efficient
utilization of wireless carriers’ licensed spectrum. Some
of the advantages of CDMA technology over both analog and
TDMA-based technologies include enhanced voice quality, enhanced
call security, increased network capacity, fewer dropped calls,
compatibility with Internet protocols, lower power and extended
talk time, lower infrastructure costs and easier transition.

Many GSM operators are expected to deploy GPRS, a
packet data technology, as a 2.5G bridge technology while
waiting for 3G WCDMA to become available. GPRS is the only
widely anticipated packet data technology that is not
CDMA-based. We do not believe that GPRS will be competitive with
CDMA-based packet data services, either on a cost or performance
basis, although it will be widely deployed in GSM networks.

Third Generation.

As
demand for wireless networks that carry both data and voice
traffic at faster speeds has increased significantly, several
3G wireless standards have been proposed to the
International Telecommunications Union by a variety of companies
and alliances. These proposals include both CDMA and TDMA-based
technologies. The International Telecommunications Union, based
in Geneva, Switzerland, is an international union that
determines which technology or technologies will be established
as 3G standards.



A technology standard selected for 3G must
efficiently support significantly increased data speeds and
capacity over limited spectrum bandwidth, thereby enabling new
and enhanced services and applications such as mobile
e-commerce, position location and mobile multimedia Web
browsing, including music and video downloads.

CDMA-Based 3G
Technology.

A 3G standard encompassing
three CDMA wireless operating modes has been adopted by the
International Telecommunications Union. These three modes are:

(1)  two versions of CDMA2000, or
Multi-Carrier;

(2)  WCDMA, or Direct Spread; and

(3)  Time Division Duplex.

The two versions of CDMA2000 are CDMA2000 1X (up
to 307 kbps peak rates) and 1xEV-DO (1.25 MHz channel
bandwidth), a standard for high-speed wireless data (up to
2.4 Mbps peak rates) that supports higher data rates than
WCDMA (5 MHz channel bandwidth). CDMA2000 1X/1xEV-DO
utilizes the same standard channel bandwidth as existing cdmaOne
systems and, as a result, is compatible with wireless
telecommunications carriers’ existing network equipment. We
believe CDMA2000 1X provides approximately twice the voice
capacity of cdmaOne and six to eight times that of TDMA-based
networks. Additionally, CDMA2000 1X initially provides peak
data rates of 144 kbps, with growth to 307 kbps planned,
longer battery life and position location functionality in
compliance with FCC mandates for emergency 911 calls. Commercial
deployment of CDMA2000 1X began in October 2000 in South
Korea with approximately two million CDMA2000 1X
subscribers as of November 2001. Commercial deployment is
scheduled by the end of the calendar year 2001 in the United
States, which will make CDMA2000 1X the first
3G technology to be commercially deployed in the United
States. Our 3G licensees include Nokia, Ericsson, Motorola,
Lucent, Samsung, LG Electronics, Hynix (formerly, Hyundai
Electronics), Hitachi, NEC, Nortel, Toshiba, Sanyo, Sharp, Sony,
Fujitsu, Denso, Agilent, and Kyocera, among others. Operators
choosing CDMA2000 1X and 1xEV-DO are expected to have a
significant time-to-market advantage over operators choosing
WCDMA. In all cases, the royalty rate paid to us is not
dependent upon which standard is implemented in the product. The
royalty rate to be paid by a licensee for 3G CDMA products
is no less than the rate that licensee will pay for
second-generation cdmaOne products.

feature- and pin-compatible with the MSM3000, allowing
manufacturers currently producing handsets using the MSM3000 to
rapidly implement 3G CDMA2000 1X technology in their handsets.
QCT’s Cell Site Modem (CSM)5000 base station solution is
the industry’s first to support the CDMA2000 1X standard,
based on IS-2000 for CDMA base stations as specified by the
International Telecommunications Union. The CSM5000 solution
provides carriers with up to twice the overall voice user
capacity of IS-95A and IS-95B systems. The MSM5100 is the
world’s first 3G CDMA2000 1X solution with advanced
position location capabilities. The MSM5105 3G CDMA2000 1X
solution offers improved voice capacity and the introduction of
new 3G services for mainstream subscribers. We conducted the
industry’s first mobile Internet protocol call using the
MSM5105 integrated circuit with Nortel Networks. The CSM5200 and
MSM5200 integrated circuits provide the first end-to-end

that design, manufacture and sell products incorporating our
CDMA technology. License fees are generally nonrefundable and
may be paid in one or more installments. From time to time we
may accept equity interest in a licensee as payment of a portion
of the license fee. Ongoing royalties are nonrefundable,
generally based upon a percentage of the selling price of
licensed products, and are recognized as income when earned
based upon the date of such sale. Revenues generated from
royalties are subject to quarterly and annual fluctuations.
Fluctuations are the result of variations in product pricing and
quantities of sales by our licensees and the impact of currency
fluctuations associated with royalties generated from
international sales.

Wireless Systems Segment (QWS)

QUALCOMM’s Wireless Systems segment is
comprised of two divisions, Wireless Business Solutions and
Wireless Systems.

Wireless Business Solutions.

We provide satellite and
terrestrial-based two-way data messaging and position reporting
services for transportation companies and private fleets. The
satellite-based OmniTRACS system was first introduced in the
United States in 1988 and is currently operating in 32
countries. In 2000, we introduced and launched commercial sales
of our OmniExpress system, a terrestrial CDMA-based system.
Through September 2001, we have sold over 400,000
OmniTRACS, TruckMAIL, OmniExpress and LINQ systems worldwide.
Message transmission and position tracking for the OmniTRACS and
TruckMAIL systems are provided by use of leased Ku-band and
C-band transponders on commercially available geostationary
earth orbit satellites. The OmniExpress and LINQ systems use
wireless digital telecommunications networks for messaging
transmission, and the GPS constellation for position tracking.
These mobile communications systems help transportation
companies and private fleets improve the rate of return on
assets and increase efficiency and safety by improving
communications between drivers and dispatchers. System features
include status updates, load and pick-up reports, position
reports at regular intervals, and vehicle and driving
performance information.

In the United States, we manufacture and sell
OmniTRACS, TruckMAIL and OmniExpress mobile communications
systems and related software packages and provide ongoing
messaging and maintenance services. Customers in the United
States include nearly 1,400 companies, primarily in the trucking
industry. We have sold OmniTRACS system products for use by
private trucking fleets, service vans, ships, trains, federal
emergency vehicles, and for oil and gas pipeline control and
monitoring sites. Message transmissions for operations in the
United States are formatted and processed at our Network
Management Center in San Diego, California, with a
fully-redundant backup Network Management Center located in Las
Vegas, Nevada. We estimate the Network Management Center
currently processes over seven million messages and position
reports per day.

We announced a new wireless solution for the
transportation industry using digital mobile devices that will
provide transportation companies a portable communications tool
for fleet management called OmniOne. The OmniOne application is
designed to run on our BREW platform, a standard execution
environment for wireless devices.



Outside of the United States, we work with
telecommunications companies and carriers to establish the
OmniTRACS system solution concept and products in foreign
markets. The OmniTRACS system is currently operating throughout
Europe and in the Middle East, Argentina, Brazil, Canada, China,
Japan, Mexico, and South Korea. Internationally, we generate
revenues from the OmniTRACS system through license fees, sales
of network products and terminals, messaging and service fees.
Service providers that operate network management centers for a
region under our granted licenses provide OmniTRACS messaging
services. We also run QUALCOMM Wireless Business Solutions
Europe bv, a Netherlands subsidiary, that brings mobile
communications products and messaging services to the European
market.

Wireless Systems.

In
1994, we formed Globalstar L.P. (Globalstar) with Loral Space
and Communications, Ltd. and other companies to design,
construct and operate a worldwide, low-Earth-orbit
satellite-based telecommunications system (the Globalstar
System). Through a constellation of 48 satellites, this system
is designed to connect with existing terrestrial
telecommunications systems to create a seamless global network,
enabling users to call and send data to and from virtually any
place in the world. We currently hold an approximate 6.3%
interest in Globalstar through certain limited partnerships and
other indirect interests.

We have contracts with Globalstar to design,
develop and manufacture subscriber products and ground
telecommunications equipment. On January 16, 2001,
Globalstar announced that, in order to have sufficient funds
available for the continued progress of its marketing and
service activities, it had suspended indefinitely principal and
interest payments on all of its debt, including its vendor
financing obligations. Globalstar also announced the retention
of a financial adviser to assist in developing future
initiatives, including restructuring Globalstar’s debt,
identifying funding opportunities and pursuing other strategic
alternatives. Efforts, by Globalstar, to restructure its debt
are on-going, and work on a final plan is expected to continue.
During fiscal 2001, we recorded $636 million in net charges to
fully reserve Globalstar-related assets. We expect our
Globalstar-related revenues to be negligible for fiscal 2002.

Other Divisions

Other divisions included in the QUALCOMM Wireless
and Internet Group are QUALCOMM Internet Services (QIS) and
QUALCOMM Digital Media (QDM).

QUALCOMM Internet
Services.

The QIS division was formed
in November 2000 to focus on wireless applications and
services development. In January 2001, we announced our
open applications platform for wireless devices to provide
solutions for the wireless industry as it moves toward wireless
Internet convergence. Our BREW product is a thin applications
execution platform that provides applications developers with an
open, standard platform for wireless communications devices on
which to develop their products. The BREW platform currently
leverages the capabilities available in QCT’s integrated
circuits, system software and Wireless Internet Launchpad
software, enabling development of feature-rich applications and
content while reducing memory overhead and maximizing system
performance. When carriers commercially deploy the BREW
platform, it will also enable over-the-air downloads of
applications by end users directly to their BREW-enabled
handsets. The complete BREW solution provided by QIS includes
the BREW platform, the BREW Software Development Kit for
developers, the BREW Porting Kit for device manufacturers and
the BREW Distribution System, which manages application
distribution from developers to carrier networks and includes
all the associated business systems for tracking and managing
end user downloading of BREW applications and payment for
applications.

Our multi-platform Eudora e-mail software
products have millions of users worldwide. We provide the Eudora
e-mail software to users via electronic download and on CD.
Eudora generates revenues from sponsor advertising within the
program, retail sales and site licenses. To support ad serving
into the user interface, we developed proprietary XML-based
content-serving technology that caches ads for the Eudora client
software. We also offer the Eudora Internet Suite, containing
both a browser and e-mail client for the Palm OS, and several
e-mail-server products. We expect revenues from Eudora to be
negligible in fiscal 2002.

QUALCOMM Digital Media.

The QDM division is comprised of the
Digital Cinema and Government Systems businesses.



We are developing an end-to-end Digital Cinema
System for the delivery of motion pictures to theatres
worldwide. The Digital Cinema System combines our expertise in
advanced image compression, electronic security, network
management, integrated circuit design and satellite
telecommunications technologies and will provide a turn-key
solution to the industry for the secure delivery of digitized
motion pictures to theatres worldwide. We are marketing our
system and technology to the motion picture industry and
participating in the industry-wide standards setting process. In
addition, we will promote our image compression and electronic
security technologies for other potential applications within
the entertainment industry including such areas as archiving,
asset management and production and distribution of electronic
media content in various forms. In May 2000, we entered
into a strategic alliance with Technicolor Digital Cinema, Inc.
(Technicolor) and formed a joint venture, Technicolor Digital
Cinema, LLC. The venture will market the QUALCOMM Digital Cinema
System and work with the motion picture industry as a technology
enabler and service provider while supporting open standards for
the digital delivery of motion pictures.

The Government Systems business provides
development, hardware and analytical expertise to United States
government agencies involving wireless communications
technologies. We have developed a CDMA wireless terrestrial
phone for the United States government, the QSec-800, which
operates in enhanced security modes and incorporates end-to-end
encryption. Initial phones were shipped for testing and
verification over a commercial cellular network. In addition,
for United States government applications, we have developed a
micro base station, the QUALCOMM Deployable Personal
Communication System (QDPCS), which provides a scaleable
turn-key mobile communications system supporting both commercial
and secure phone communications. Additionally, OmniTRACS
products and services are being marketed and sold for United
States government worldwide applications. These products along
with products from future development efforts would likely
service a wide range of United States government, as well as
potential commercial applications.

Other Businesses

Consumer Products Segment (QCP)

In February 2000, we sold our
terrestrial-based CDMA wireless consumer phone business,
including our phone inventory, manufacturing equipment and
customer commitments, to Kyocera Wireless (Kyocera). We received
$242 million for the net assets sold. Under the agreement with
Kyocera, Kyocera agreed to purchase a majority of their CDMA
integrated circuits and system software requirements from us for
a period of five years. Kyocera will continue their existing
royalty-bearing CDMA license agreement with us.

As part of the agreement with Kyocera, we formed
a new subsidiary that has a substantial number of employees from
QUALCOMM Consumer Products business to provide services to
Kyocera on a cost-plus basis to support Kyocera’s phone
business for up to three years. In addition, selected employees
of QUALCOMM Personal Electronics (QPE), our 51% owned
consolidated subsidiary and manufacturer of phones for us, were
transferred to Kyocera. As a condition of the purchase, QPE paid
down and cancelled its two revolving credit agreements. We
recorded $83 million in charges during fiscal 2000 to
reflect the estimated difference between the carrying value of
the net assets and the consideration to be received from
Kyocera, less costs to sell, and employee termination costs.

Research and Development

The wireless telecommunications industry is
characterized by rapid technological change, requiring a
continuous effort to enhance existing products and develop new
products and technologies. Our research and development team has
a strong and proven track record of innovation in wireless
communications technologies. Our research and development
expenditures in fiscal years 2001, 2000 and 1999 totaled
approximately $415 million, $340 million and
$381 million, respectively. Research and development
expenditures in fiscal years 2001 and 2000, are primarily
related to integrated circuit product initiatives to support
high-speed wireless Internet access and multimode, multi-band,
multi-network, products including cdmaOne,
CDMA2000 1X/1xEV-DO, GSM/GPRS, WCDMA and position location
technologies. Fiscal 1999 expenditures included the development
of CDMA-based technology phones and infrastructure equipment
prior to the



sale of these businesses. We intend to use our
substantial engineering resources and expertise to develop new
technologies, applications and services and make them available
to licensees to help grow the wireless telecommunications market
and generate new or expanded licensing opportunities. In
addition to internally sponsored research and development, we
perform contract research and development for various government
agencies and commercial contractors.

Sales and Marketing

QCT markets and sells products in the United
States through a sales force based in San Diego, California, and
internationally through a direct sales force based in South
Korea, Japan, China and Germany. QCT’s sales and marketing
strategy is to achieve design wins with technology leaders in
our targeted markets by, among other things, providing superior
field application and engineering support.

The Wireless Business Solutions division markets
and sells products through a sales force, partnerships, and
distributors based in the United States, Europe, the Middle
East, Argentina, Brazil, Canada, China, Japan, South Korea and
Mexico. Wireless Business Solutions’ sales and marketing
strategy is to achieve contract wins in our target markets by
providing high-value wireless fleet management solutions to the
transportation industry and other logistics-based businesses.

QIS develops and sells business-to-business
products through a team based in San Diego, California to
companies worldwide. The QIS sales and marketing strategy is to
achieve contract wins with companies in our target markets by
providing comprehensive technology solutions to help them
provide the next generation of wireless applications and
services that combine data and voice capabilities to suit end
users’ needs in a converged wireless Internet world.

Marketing activities include participation in
technical conferences, business cases, competitive analyses and
other marketing collateral, publication of customer deployments,
new product information and educational articles in industry
journals, maintenance of our World Wide Web site and direct
marketing to prospective customers. In July 2001, we opened
our CDMA Development Center in China, a 43,000 square foot
facility in what is popularly known as ‘China’s
Silicon Valley.’ The center provides training, support and
equipment testing services to manufacturers and mobile carriers
in China, as well as supporting research and development of
3G wireless standards based on CDMA. The center will house
our CDMA University, which will offer classroom and hands-on
training programs and a highly-integrated test program designed
to enable time and cost savings when bringing products to
market. The center and its staff are focused on providing China
with the resources to enable the most timely development of its
mobile communications industry using our technologies and
applications, such as cdmaOne, CDMA2000 1X/1xEV-DO and the
BREW platform. The center will also support the transfer of
hardware and software technologies for product development and
manufacturing, as well as implementation methods to licensed
manufacturers, carriers and government bodies in China.

Competition

Competition in the wireless telecommunications
industry in the United States and throughout the world continues
to increase at a rapid pace, as businesses and foreign
governments realize the market potential of telecommunications
services. There can be no assurance that we will be able to
compete successfully or that new technologies and products that
are more commercially effective than our technologies and
products will not be developed. Many of our current and
prospective competitors have substantially greater financial,
technical, marketing, sales and distribution resources. In
addition, many of these companies are licensees of our
technology, and have established market positions, trade names,
trademarks, patents, copyrights, intellectual property rights
and substantial technological capabilities. We may face
competition throughout the world with new technologies and
services introduced in the future. Although we intend to employ
relatively new technologies, there will be a continuing
competitive threat from even newer technologies that may render
our technologies obsolete. We also expect that the price we
charge for our products and services may continue to decline as
competition intensifies.



CDMA Technologies Segment (QCT)

The markets in which our QCT division operates
are intensely competitive. QCT competes worldwide with a number
of United States and international manufacturers. As a result of
the trend toward global expansion by foreign and domestic
competitors, technological and public policy changes, and
relatively low barriers to entry in the industry, we anticipate
that additional competitors will enter this market. We believe
that the principal competitive factors for CDMA integrated
circuit providers to our addressed markets are product
performance, level of integration, quality, compliance with
industry standards, price, time to market, system cost, design
and engineering capabilities, new product innovation and
customer support. The specific bases on which we compete against
alternative CDMA integrated circuit providers vary by product
platform. We also compete against alternative wireless
communications technologies including but not limited to GSM,
TDMA and analog.

QCT’s current competitors include major
semiconductor companies such as Intel, Texas Instruments,
PrairieComm, LSI Logic and Philips, as well as major
telecommunication equipment companies such as Motorola, Nokia
and Matsushita. In addition, QCT faces competition from the
in-house development efforts of many of our key customers,
including Samsung, as well as QCT also faces competition from
start-up ventures, several of which have begun shipping
commercial products.

Our competitors may devote a significantly
greater amount of their financial, technical, marketing and
other resources to aggressively market competitive
telecommunications systems or develop and adopt competitive
digital cellular technologies, and those efforts may materially
and adversely affect QCT. Moreover, competitors may offer more
attractive product pricing or financing terms than we do as a
means of gaining access to the wireless telecommunications
markets.

We have entered into arrangements with LSI Logic,
Philips, Motorola, Lucent, Texas Instruments and PrairieComm
permitting those companies to manufacture and sell to
QUALCOMM’s subscriber unit licensees certain CDMA
application-specific integrated circuits utilizing certain of
QUALCOMM’s patents. In every case, the right of the
subscriber unit licensees to use such integrated circuits is
subject to the payment of royalties to us on the products into
which the integrated circuits are incorporated. To date, most
subscriber equipment licensees have elected to purchase their
CDMA integrated circuits and system software requirements from
us.

Technology Licensing Segment (QTL)

As part of our strategy to generate new licensing
revenues, significant resources are allocated to develop leading
edge technology for the telecommunications industry. We face
competition in the development of intellectual property for
next-generation digital wireless communications technology and
services. There are no guarantees that our technologies will
continue to be adopted or we will be able to secure patents for
our technology to subsequently license. Furthermore, there are
no guarantees that existing systems and applications cannot be
replaced by competitors’ technologies, thereby jeopardizing
our existing royalty and licensing revenues.

On a worldwide basis, we currently compete
primarily with two digital wireless telecommunications
technologies, TDMA and GSM. TDMA has been deployed primarily in
the United States and Latin America, while GSM has been
extensively utilized in Europe, much of Asia and certain other
markets. To date, GSM has been more widely adopted than CDMA,
and, although CDMA technology has been proposed for all third
generation wireless systems, there can be no assurance that
wireless communications service providers will select CDMA for
their networks or update to third generation technology. In
addition, GSM operators may deploy GPRS as a 2.5G bridge
technology while waiting for third generation WCDMA to become
available and/or cost effective for their system. GPRS is the
only widely anticipated packet data technology that is not
CDMA-based.



Wireless Systems Segment (QWS)

Existing competitors offering alternatives to our
OmniTRACS, TruckMAIL, OmniExpress and LINQ system products are
aggressively pricing their products and services and could
continue to do so in the future. In addition, these competitors
are offering new value-added products and services similar in
many cases to our existing or developing technologies. Emergence
of new competitors, particularly those offering low cost
terrestrial-based products, may impact margins and intensify
competition in new markets.

Patents, Trademarks and Trade
Secrets

We rely on a combination of patents, copyrights,
trade secrets, trademarks and proprietary information to
maintain and enhance our competitive position. We have been
granted more than 650 United States patents and have over 1,200
patent applications pending in the United States. The vast
majority of such patents and patent applications relate to our
CDMA digital wireless communications technology. We also have
and will continue to actively file for patent protection around
the world and have received CDMA patents with broad coverage
throughout most of the world, including China, Japan, South
Korea, Europe, Brazil, North America and elsewhere. There can be
no assurance that the pending patent applications will be
granted, that our patents or copyrights will provide adequate
protection, or that our competitors will not independently
develop or initiate technologies that are substantially
equivalent or superior to our technologies. There can also be no
assurance that the confidentiality agreements upon which we rely
to protect our trade secrets and proprietary information will be
adequate. The cost of defending our intellectual property has
been and may continue to be significant. From time to time,
certain companies may assert exclusive patent, copyright and
other intellectual proprietary rights to technologies that are
claimed to be important to the industry or to us. In addition,
from time to time third parties provide us with copies of their
patents relating to spread spectrum and other digital wireless
communications technologies and offer licenses to such
technologies. We evaluate such patents and the advisability of
such licenses. If any of our products were found to infringe on
protected technology, we could be required to redesign such
products, license such technology, and/or pay damages to the
infringed party. If we are unable to license protected
technology used in our products or to redesign such products, we
could be prohibited from marketing and selling such products.

A number of companies have each advised the
Telecommunication Industry Association (TIA) and other CDMA
standards setting bodies that they hold patent rights in
technology embodied in such standards. If we and other product
manufacturers are required to obtain additional licenses and/or
pay royalties to one or more patent holders, this could have a
material adverse effect on the commercial implementation of our
CDMA technology.

The standards bodies and the International
Telecommunications Union have been informed that we hold
essential intellectual property rights for the 3G standards that
are based on CDMA. We have committed to the International
Telecommunications Union to license our essential patents for
these CDMA standards on a fair and reasonable basis free from
unfair discrimination.

Under our CDMA license agreements, licensees are
generally required to pay us license fees as well as ongoing
royalties based on a percentage of the selling price of CDMA
subscriber, infrastructure, test and integrated circuits
products. License fees are paid in one or more installments,
while royalties generally continue throughout the life of the
licensed patents. Our CDMA license agreements generally provide
cross-licenses to us to use certain of our licensees’
technology to manufacture and sell certain CDMA products. In
most cases, our use of our licensees’ technology is royalty
free. However, under some of the licenses, if we incorporate
certain of the licensed technology into certain of our products,
we are obligated to pay royalties on the sale of such products.
For a limited period of time, Motorola is entitled, subject to
the terms of their license agreement, to share in a percentage
of certain third-party subscriber unit royalties paid by
licensees to us. For a limited period of time, the Korean
Electronics Telecommunications Research Institute (ETRI) is
entitled, subject to the terms of a development agreement with
us, to share in a percentage of subscriber and infrastructure
royalties paid by certain Korean licensees for sales of those
CDMA products sold solely for use in Korea.



As part of our strategy to generate licensing
revenues and support worldwide adoption of our CDMA technology,
we license to third parties the rights to design, manufacture
and sell products utilizing our CDMA technology. The following

RISK FACTORS

You should consider each of the following factors
as well as the other information in this Annual Report in
evaluating our business and our prospects. The risks and
uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face.
Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or
that we currently consider immaterial may also impair our
business operations. If any of the following risks actually
occur, our business and financial results could be harmed. In
that case the trading price of our common stock could decline.
You should also refer to the other information set forth in this
Annual Report, including our financial statements and the
related notes.

Risks Related to Our Businesses

A long lasting downturn in the global economy
that impacts the wireless communications industry could
negatively affect our revenues and operating results.

The global economy is in the midst of a slowdown
that has had wide ranging effects on markets that we serve,
particularly wireless communications equipment manufacturers and
network operators. This downturn has had a negative effect on
our revenues from royalties, license fees and integrated circuit
products. We cannot predict the depth or duration of this
downturn, and if it grows more severe or continues for a long
period of time, our ability to increase or maintain our revenues
and operating results may be impaired. In addition, because we
intend to continue to make significant investments in research
and development during



this downturn, and to maintain extensive ongoing
customer service and support capability, any decline in the rate
of growth of our revenues will have a significant adverse impact
on our operating results.

If CDMA technology is not widely deployed, or
if delays occur in the adoption of 3G CDMA standards, our
revenues may not grow as anticipated or our stock price could
fall.

We focus our business primarily on developing,
patenting and commercializing CDMA technology for wireless
telecommunications applications. Other digital wireless
communications technologies, particularly GSM technology, have
been more widely adopted than CDMA technology. If CDMA
technology does not become the preferred wireless communications
industry standard in the countries where our products and those
of our customers and licensees are sold, or if wireless
communications service providers do not deploy networks that
utilize CDMA technology, our business and financial results
could suffer.

To increase our revenues and market share in
future periods, we are dependent upon the adoption and
commercial deployment of 3G wireless communications equipment,
products and services based on our CDMA technology. Industry and
government participants of the International Telecommunications
Union and regional standards development organizations are
currently considering a variety of standards that may be
utilized in 3G wireless networks. We continue to advocate the
selection of 3G standards based on CDMA technology. We cannot
assure you that any of the standards development organizations
will select the standards that we are advocating. If they select
other standards, our business may suffer, and even if our
standards are selected, we cannot assure you that they will
achieve commercial acceptance in a timely manner, or at all. Our
1xEV-DO was approved by the International Telecommunications
Union for inclusion in the CDMA2000 mode of the 3G standard.
Commercial deployment of CDMA2000 1X began in October 2000
in South Korea. A commercial deployment is scheduled by end of
the calendar year for 2001 in the United States, which will make
CDMA2000 1X the first 3G technology to be commercially deployed
in the United States. WCDMA, a technology designed as an
alternative to CDMA2000, is currently in the standardization
process and has been adopted by several European, Japanese and
United States carriers. We expect that, although limited systems
have been placed in service this year, widespread and
standardized WCDMA networks will not begin operation until 2003
or later, given that the WCDMA standard and interoperability
testing is not yet complete. Many GSM operators are expected to
deploy GPRS, a packet data technology, as a 2.5G bridge
technology while waiting for 3G WCDMA to become available. GPRS
is the only widely anticipated packet data technology that is
not CDMA-based. We believe that our CDMA patent portfolio is
applicable to all CDMA systems that may serve as the basis for
such standards. However, we cannot assure you that the wireless
communications industry will adopt 3G standards based on CDMA
technology, or that our CDMA patents will be determined to be
applicable to any proposed 3G standards. If we are unable to
successfully, widely and timely deploy CDMA2000 as the preferred
3G technology, our business and financial results could suffer.

Because we have made significant investments
in and loans to CDMA carriers, our financial condition may be
harmed if those CDMA carriers are not successful.

We provide significant financing to CDMA carriers
to promote the worldwide adoption of CDMA products and services.
Many domestic and international CDMA carriers to whom we have
provided financing have limited operating histories, are faced
with significant capital requirements, are highly leveraged and
have limited financial resources. Carriers to whom we have
provided financing have defaulted on their obligations to us,
and it is possible that others will default on their obligations
to us in the future. Any such defaults could have a material
adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results.
Due to currency fluctuations and international risks, foreign
borrowers may become unable to pay their debts to us from
revenues generated by their projects that are denominated in
local currencies. Further, we may not be permitted to retain a
security interest in any spectrum licenses held by foreign
carriers that we finance. These spectrum licenses initially may
constitute the primary asset of the carriers. The amount of
financing that we currently are providing and that we expect to
provide in the future is substantial.



We have provided or have committed to provide
significant financing to the following companies:

Pegaso
 Telecomunicaciones, S.A. de C.V.

We provided financing to Pegaso
Telecomunicaciones, S.A. de C.V. (Pegaso) under an equipment
loan and a bridge facility. Pegaso operates a wireless network
in Mexico. At September 30, 2001, $674 million is
outstanding under these facilities, net of deferred interest and
unearned fees. On October 31, 2001, Pegaso failed to make a
scheduled payment of approximately $3 million under the
equipment loan and also failed to meet covenants related to the
completion of a strategic sale or merger with a third party
under both facilities. Pegaso is currently engaged in strategic
discussions with a third party for a potential sale or merger,
and we are actively working with Pegaso and the third party to
complete a transaction or, alternatively, to assist Pegaso in
raising additional funds. As the transaction did not close on
the targeted date of October 31, 2001 and such additional
financing is not certain, we ceased accruing interest on these
loans effective at the beginning of the fourth fiscal quarter of
2001. The bridge facility is collateralized by a second lien on
substantially all of Pegaso’s assets. We also have a
commitment to provide an additional $96 million in long-term
financing under an arrangement with Telefonaktiebolaget LM
Ericsson (Ericsson), subject to Pegaso meeting certain
conditions.

Pegaso is at an early stage of development and,
if it remains independent, may not be able to compete
successfully. Competitors in Mexico have greater financial
resources and more established operations than Pegaso. As is
normal for early stage wireless operators, Pegaso is
experiencing significant losses from operations. Pegaso also has
limited cash available to meet its operating and financing
commitments and is therefore dependent on securing additional
financing or completing a strategic arrangement with an existing
carrier.

Vesper Holding S.A. and Vesper Sao
Paulo S.A.

Vesper Holding S.A. and Vesper Sao Paulo S.A.
(the Vesper Companies) were formed by a consortium of investors
to provide wireless and wireline telephone services in the
northern region and in the Sao Paulo state of Brazil. At
September 30, 2001, our cumulative cash investment,
including long-term financing, in the Vesper Companies and
VeloCom Inc. (VeloCom), an investor in the Vesper Companies,
totaled approximately $418 million.

As a result of the reorganization of the Vesper
Companies initiated during fiscal 2001, we reassessed the
recoverability of our assets related to the Vesper Companies and
VeloCom and recorded $241 million in impairment charges. At
September 30, 2001, we had approximately $124 million
in net assets remaining related to the Vesper Companies and
VeloCom. The Vesper Companies are working to accomplish the
terms of their restructuring with owners, vendors and creditors
which is expected to be completed in the first quarter of our
fiscal 2002. The proposed transaction is contingent on several
factors, and there is a risk it will not close. If the
transaction closes, we expect to acquire an additional interest
in the Vesper Companies for $266 million of equity
commitments. We also expect to convert our Term Loan Agreement
with VeloCom into an additional equity interest in VeloCom.
After the close, we expect to hold a 49.9% interest in VeloCom,
and direct and indirect interests in the Vesper Companies of 74%
and 86%, respectively.

We believe the Vesper Companies represent a
strategic opportunity with their extensive installed CDMA
network in Brazil, including the key cities of Sao Paulo and Rio
de Janeiro. The Vesper Companies’ debt would be reduced in
the proposed restructuring from approximately $1.3 billion
to less than $200 million. Additionally, the term of the
remaining debt would be extended through 2005, providing the
Vesper Companies significant operational flexibility to support
a growing business. If the proposed restructuring transaction
closes, we intend to support the Vesper Companies while they,
together with VeloCom, seek to partner with strategic investors
and internationally recognized operators who have the ability to
successfully enhance the Vesper Companies’ business and
ultimately assume majority control. We would also consider other
strategic alternatives such as spinning off our investment in
the Vesper Companies to our shareholders. We will consolidate
the results of the Vesper Companies if the proposed transaction
closes in fiscal 2002. The Vesper Companies expect to incur
increasing operating losses and negative cash flows from
operations as they



expand operations and enter new markets, even if
and after they achieve positive cash flows from operations in
the initial operating markets. We may incur significant losses
in the future related to our proposed ownership of the Vesper
Companies, and we cannot assure you that the Vesper Companies
will ever operate profitably. Additional risks and uncertainties
specific to the Vesper Companies include risks associated with:

Leap Wireless

Leap Wireless, a company we spun off in
September 1998, is a publicly-traded wireless
telecommunications operating company. Under the terms of the
senior credit facility between us and Leap Wireless, we are
committed to fund up to $125 million until the earlier of
settlement of the FCC’s current auction of Personal
Communication System (PCS) spectrum or Leap Wireless’
withdrawal from the auction. We also hold 308,000 units of Leap
Wireless’ senior discount notes with detachable warrants
and a warrant to purchase 3,375,000 shares of Leap Wireless. At
September 30, 2001, the combined fair values of the senior
discount notes with warrants and the warrant total
$135 million, and unrealized losses of $71 million are
recorded as a component of comprehensive loss in equity. The
fair value is based on the market price of Leap Wireless. We own
a large number of senior discount notes and warrants to acquire
a large number of shares relative to the trading volumes of
these senior discount notes and shares in the public market, and
the market price may be higher than the prices we would realize
if our shares were sold.

Leap Wireless may incur significant operating
losses and generate significant negative cash flow from
operating activities in the future while it continues to build
out its networks and build its customer base. Leap Wireless
requires significant additional capital to buildout and operate
planned networks and for general working capital needs. Leap
Wireless may not be able to raise additional capital on
acceptable terms, or at all. We cannot assure you that Leap
Wireless will generate profits in the short term or at all or
that we will recover our assets.

We derive a significant portion of our revenue
from a limited number of customers and licensees. The loss of
any one of our major customers or licensees could reduce our
revenues and may harm our ability to achieve or sustain
acceptable levels of operating results.

In fiscal 2001, three customers accounted for 37%
of consolidated revenues. The loss of any one of our QCT
segment’s significant customers or other customers or the
delay, even if only temporary, or cancellation of significant
orders from any of these customers would reduce our revenues in
the period of the cancellation or deferral and could harm our
ability to achieve or sustain acceptable levels of
profitability. Accordingly, unless and until our QCT segment
diversifies and expands its customer base, our future success
will significantly depend upon the timing and size of future
purchase orders, if any, from these customers. Factors that may
impact the size and timing of orders from customers of our QCT
segment include, among others, the following:

•

the product requirements of these customers;

•

the financial and operational success of these
	customers; and

•

the success of these customers’ products
	that incorporate our products.



Our QTL segment derives royalty revenues from
shipments by our licensees. We derive a significant portion of
our royalty revenue from a limited number of licensees. Our
future success depends upon the ability of our licensees to
develop and introduce high volume products that achieve and
sustain market acceptance. We cannot assure you that our
licensees will be successful or that the demand for wireless
communications devices and services offered by our licensees
will continue to increase. Any reduction in the demand for
wireless communications devices utilizing our CDMA technology
could have a material adverse effect on our business.

We derive a significant portion of our
revenues from sales outside the United States, and numerous
factors related to international business activities subject us
to risks that could reduce the demand for our licensees’
products or our products, negatively affecting our operating
results.

A significant part of our strategy involves our
continued pursuit of growth opportunities in a number of
international markets. We market, sell and service our products
internationally. We have established sales offices around the
world. We will continue to expand our international sales
operations and enter new international markets. This expansion
will require significant management attention and financial
resources to successfully develop direct and indirect
international sales and support channels, and we cannot assure
you that we will be successful or that our expenditures in this
effort will not exceed the amount of any resulting revenues. If
we are not able to maintain or increase international market
demand for our products, then we may not be able to maintain an
acceptable rate of growth in our business.

Our revenues from international customers as a
percentage of total revenues were 65% in fiscal 2001, 47% in
fiscal 2000 and 38% in fiscal 1999. In many international
markets, barriers to entry are created by long-standing
relationships between our potential customers and their local
providers and protective regulations, including local content
and service requirements. In addition, our pursuit of
international growth opportunities may require significant
investments for an extended period before we realize returns, if
any, on our investments. Our business could be adversely
affected by a variety of uncontrollable and changing factors,
including:

In addition to general risks associated with our
international sales, licensing activities and operations, we are
also subject to risks specific to the individual countries in
which we do business. During fiscal 2001, 35% and 22% of our
revenue was from customers and licensees based in South Korea
and Japan, respectively. A significant downturn in the economies
of Asian countries where many of our customers and licensees are



located, particularly the economies of South
Korea and Japan, would materially harm our business. We also are
subject to risks in certain markets in which our customers and
licensees grant subsidies on handsets to their subscribers. For
example, in the past the South Korean government limited the
ability of handset manufacturers to provide subsidies on
handsets to their subscribers, and this, in turn, reduced our
revenues from those sources. Further limitations on the ability
of handset manufacturers to sell their products in South Korea,
Japan or in other countries may have additional negative impacts
on our revenues.

Foreign currency fluctuations could negatively
affect future product sales or royalty revenue and harm our
ability to collect receivables.

We are exposed to risk from fluctuations in
foreign currencies that could impact our operating results,
liquidity and financial condition. As a global concern, we face
exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates:

We may engage in strategic transactions that
could result in significant charges or management disruption and
fail to enhance stockholder value.

From time to time, we consider strategic
transactions and alternatives with the goal of maximizing
stockholder value. In February 2000, we completed the sale
of our terrestrial wireless consumer products business to
Kyocera Wireless. In May 1999, we completed the sale of our
terrestrial wireless infrastructure business to Ericsson. In
September 1998, we completed the spin-off of Leap Wireless.
Additionally, in the past we have acquired businesses, entered
into joint ventures and made strategic investments in early
stage companies and venture funds or incubators to support the
adoption of CDMA and use of the wireless Internet. Most of our
strategic investments entail a high degree of risk and will not
become liquid until more than one year from the date of
investment, if at all.

We will continue to evaluate potential strategic
transactions and alternatives that we believe may enhance
stockholder value. These potential future transactions may
include a variety of different business arrangements, including
acquisitions, spin-offs, strategic partnerships, joint ventures,
restructurings, divestitures, business combinations and
investments. Although our goal is to maximize stockholder value,
such transactions may impair stockholder value or otherwise
adversely affect our business and the trading price of our
stock. Any such transaction may require us to incur
non-recurring or other charges and may pose significant
integration challenges and/or management and business
disruptions, any of which could harm our operating results and
business prospects.



The fair values of our strategic investments
are subject to substantial quarterly and annual fluctuations and
to market downturns. Downward fluctuations and market trends
could adversely affect our operating results.

We maintain strategic holdings of various issuers
and types. These securities include available-for-sale equity
securities and derivative instruments that are recorded on the
balance sheet at fair value. We strategically invest in
companies in the high-technology industry and typically do not
attempt to reduce or eliminate our market exposure.
Available-for-sale equity securities and derivative instruments
recorded at fair value under FAS 115 and FAS 133,
respectively, subject us to equity price risk. The fair market
values of these equity securities and derivative instruments are
subject to significant price volatility and, in general,
suffered a significant decrease in market value during fiscal
2001. In addition, the realizable value of these securities and
derivative instruments is subject to market and other
conditions. Our investments in specific companies and industry
segments may vary over time, and changes in concentrations may
affect price volatility. We also invest in privately-held
companies, including early stage companies, venture funds or
incubators. These investments are recorded at cost, but the
recorded values may become impaired due to changes in the
companies’ condition or prospects. Our strategic
investments are inherently risky as the market for the
technologies or products the investees have under development
may never materialize. As a result, we could lose all or a
portion of our investments in these companies, which could
negatively affect our financial position and operating results.

In addition to our investments in the Vesper
Companies and Leap Wireless, we have a strategic investment in
KTFreeTel, a wireless carrier in Korea. In fiscal 2000, we
purchased 2,565,000 common shares of KTFreeTel, representing a
1.9% interest, for $110 million and an $86 million zero coupon
bond with warrants to purchase approximately 1,851,000
additional shares. If KTFreeTel meets certain obligations
related to the commercial deployment of 1xEV-DO technology, we
will be required to exercise the warrants. The exercise price of
the warrants is expected to be paid by tendering the bond as
payment in full. The combined fair value of the common shares
and bond with warrants is $95 million at September 30,
2001, and we have recorded $68 million in unrealized losses as a
component of comprehensive loss in equity. The fair value is
based on the market price of KTFreeTel. We own and hold warrants
to acquire a large number of shares relative to the trading
volumes of these shares in the public market, and the market
price may be higher than the price we would realize if our
shares were sold. Although management believes that KTFreeTel
will be successful and that the KTFreeTel stock price will
recover, there is no assurance that KTFreeTel will continue to
operate profitably or that we will recover our remaining assets.

We depend upon a limited number of third-party
manufacturers to produce and test our products. Any disruptions
in the operations of, or the loss of, any of these third parties
could harm our ability to meet our delivery obligations to our
customers and increase our cost of sales.

CDMA Technologies Segment
(QCT)

We subcontract all of our manufacturing and
assembly, and most of the testing, of our integrated circuits.
We depend upon a limited number of third parties to perform
these functions, some of which are only available from single
sources with which we do not have long-term contracts. During
fiscal 2001, IBM, Motorola, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing
Co. and Texas Instruments were the primary manufacturers of our
family of integrated circuits. Our reliance on a sole-source
vendor primarily occurs during the start-up phase of a new
product.

Once a new product reaches a significant volume
level, we then establish alternative suppliers for technologies
that we consider critical. Our reliance on sole or
limited-source vendors involves risks. These risks include
possible shortages of capacity, product performance shortfalls,
and reduced controls over delivery schedules, manufacturing
capability, quality assurance, quantity and costs. We have no
firm long-term commitments from our manufacturers to supply
products to us for any specific period, or in any specific
quantity, except as may be provided in a particular purchase
order. As a result, these manufacturers may allocate, and in the
past have allocated, capacity to the production of other
products while reducing deliveries to us on short notice.



Our operations also may be harmed by lengthy or
recurring disruptions at any of the facilities of our
manufacturers. These disruptions may include labor strikes, work
stoppages, terrorism, war, fire, earthquake, flooding or other
natural disasters. These disruptions could cause significant
delays in shipments until we are able to shift the products from
an affected manufacturer to another manufacturer. The loss of a
significant third-party manufacturer or the inability of a
third-party manufacturer to meet performance and quality
specifications or delivery schedules could harm our ability to
meet our delivery obligations to our customers.

In addition, one or more of our manufacturers may
obtain licenses from us to manufacture CDMA integrated circuits
that compete with our products. In this event, the manufacturer
could elect to allocate scarce components and manufacturing
capacity to their own products and reduce deliveries to us. In
the event of a loss of, or a decision to change, a key
third-party manufacturer, qualifying a new manufacturer and
commencing volume production or testing could involve delay and
expense, resulting in lost revenues, reduced operating margins
and possible loss of customers.

Wireless Systems Segment
(QWS)

Several of the critical products and services
used in our existing and proposed products are currently
available only from third-party single or limited sources. These
include items such as electronic and radio frequency components,
and other sophisticated parts and subassemblies which are used
in the OmniTRACS, TruckMAIL, OmniExpress, LINQ, and Globalstar
Systems. These third parties include companies such as M/ A Com,
Rakon, Mini Circuits, Cambridge, Andrews, ADI, Deutsch, PCI, Key
Tronic, Seavey, Symbol, Talon, Thomson Airpax and Eagle Picher.
Our reliance and the reliance of our licensees on sole or
limited source vendors involve risks. These risks include
possible shortages of certain key components, product
performance shortfalls, and reduced control over delivery
schedules, manufacturing capability, quality and costs. In the
event of a long term supply interruption, alternate sources
could be developed in a majority of the cases. The inability to
obtain adequate quantities of significant compliant materials on
a timely basis could have a material adverse effect on our
business, operating results, liquidity and financial position.

A reduction or interruption in component
supply or a significant increase in component prices could have
a material adverse effect on our business or
profitability.

Our ability to meet customer demands depends, in
part, on our ability to obtain timely and adequate delivery of
parts and components from our suppliers and internal
manufacturing capacity. We have experienced component shortages
in the past, including components for our integrated circuit
products, that have adversely affected our operations. Although
we work closely with our suppliers to avoid these types of
shortages, we may continue to encounter these problems in the
future. A reduction or interruption in component supply or a
significant increase in the price of one or more components
could have a material adverse effect on our business.

Defects or errors in our products could harm
our relations with our customers and expose us to liability.
Similar problems related to the products of our customers or
licensees would harm our business.

Our software and integrated circuit products are
inherently complex and may contain defects and errors that are
detected only when the products are in use. Further, because our
products perform critical functions in our customers’
products and networks, such defects or errors could have a
serious impact on our customers which could damage our
reputation, harm our customer relationships and expose us to
liability. Defects or impurities in our components, materials or
software or those used by our customers or licensees, equipment
failures or other difficulties could adversely affect our
ability and that of our customers and licensees to ship products
on a timely basis as well as our customers’ or
licensees’ demand for our products. Any such shipment
delays or declines in demand could reduce our revenues and harm
our ability to achieve or sustain acceptable levels of
profitability. We and our customers or licensees also may
experience component or software failures or defects which could
require significant product recalls, reworks and/or repairs
which are not covered by warranty reserves and which could
consume a substantial portion of the capacity of our third-party
manufacturers or those of our customers or licensees.



Our operating results are subject to
substantial quarterly and annual fluctuations and to market
downturns.

Our revenues, earnings and other operating
results have fluctuated significantly in the past and may
fluctuate significantly in the future. General economic or other
conditions causing a downturn in the market for our products or
technology, affecting the timing of customer orders or causing
cancellations or rescheduling of orders could also adversely
affect our operating results. Moreover, our customers may change
delivery schedules or cancel or reduce orders without incurring
significant penalties and generally are not subject to minimum
purchase requirements.

Our future operating results will be affected by
many factors, including the following:

The foregoing factors are difficult to forecast
and these, as well as other factors, could harm our quarterly or
annual operating results. If our operating results fail to meet
the expectations of investment analysts or investors in any
period, the market price of our common stock may decline.



Our industry is subject to intense competition
that could result in declining average selling prices for our
licensees’ products and our products, negatively affecting
our revenues and operating results.

We currently face significant competition in our
markets and expect that intense competition will continue.
Competition in the telecommunications market is based on varying
combinations including:

This competition has resulted and is expected to
continue to result in declining average royalties for our
licensed intellectual property and reduced average selling
prices for our products and those of our customers and
licensees. We anticipate that additional competitors will enter
our markets as a result of growth opportunities in wireless
telecommunications, the trend toward global expansion by foreign
and domestic competitors, technological and public policy
changes and relatively low barriers to entry in selected
segments of the industry.

Our competitors include companies that promote
non-CDMA technologies and companies that design competing CDMA
integrated circuits, such as Nokia, Motorola, Philips, Ericsson,
Texas Instruments, Intel, LSI Logic, Nortel, Samsung, Matsushita
and Siemens, all of who are our licensees with the exception of
Intel. With respect to our OmniTRACS, TruckMAIL, OmniExpress,
and LINQ products and services, our existing competitors are
aggressively pricing their products and services and could
continue to do so in the future. In addition, these competitors
are offering new value-added products and services similar in
many cases to those we have developed or are developing.
Emergence of new competitors, particularly those offering low
cost terrestrial-based products and current as well as future
satellite-based systems, may impact margins and intensify
competition in new markets.

Many of these current and potential competitors
have advantages over us, including:

As a result of these factors, these competitors
may be more successful than us. In addition, we anticipate
additional competitors will enter the market for products based
on 3G standards. These competitors may have more established
relationships and distribution channels in markets not currently
deploying wireless communications technology. These competitors
also have established or may establish financial or strategic
relationships among themselves or with our existing or potential
customers, resellers or other third parties. These relationships
may affect customers’ decisions to purchase products or
license technology from us. Accordingly,



new competitors or alliances among competitors
could emerge and rapidly acquire significant market share to our
detriment.

Our stock price is volatile.

The stock market in general, and the stock prices
of technology-based companies in particular, have experienced
extreme volatility that often has been unrelated to the
operating performance of any specific public companies. The
market price of our common stock has fluctuated in the past and
is likely to fluctuate in the future as well. Factors that may
have a significant impact on the market price of our stock
include:

Our future earnings and stock price may be
subject to significant volatility, particularly on a quarterly
basis. Shortfalls in our revenues or earnings in any given
period relative to the levels expected by securities analysts
could immediately, significantly and adversely affect the
trading price of our common stock.

Our industry is subject to rapid technological
change that we must keep pace with to successfully
compete.

New technological innovations generally require a
substantial investment before they are commercially viable. We
may make substantial, non-recoverable investments in new
technologies that do not result in meaningful revenues.

The market for our products and technology is
characterized by many factors, including:

We are currently making significant investments
in developing and introducing new products, such as:

•

integrated circuit product to support high-speed
	wireless Internet access and multimode, multi-band,
	multi-network products including cdmaOne, CDMA2000 1X/1xEV-DO,
	GSM/ GPRS, WCDMA and position location technologies; and

•

Binary Runtime Environment for Wireless (BREW), a
	thin applications execution platform that provides applications
	developers with an open standard platform for wireless devices
	on which to develop their products.



Our future success will depend on our ability to
continue to develop and introduce new products, technology and
enhancements on a timely basis. Our future success will also
depend on our ability to keep pace with technological
developments, protect our intellectual property, satisfy varying
customer requirements, price our products competitively and
achieve market acceptance. The introduction of products
embodying new technologies and the emergence of new industry
standards could render our existing products and technology, and
products and technology currently under development, obsolete
and unmarketable. If we fail to anticipate or respond adequately
to technological developments or customer requirements, or
experience any significant delays in development, introduction
or shipment of our products and technology in commercial
quantities, our competitive position could be damaged.

Consolidations in the wireless communications
industry could adversely affect our business.

The wireless communications industry has
experienced consolidation of participants, and this trend may
continue. If wireless carriers consolidate with companies that
utilize technologies that compete with CDMA, then CDMA may lose
market share unless the surviving entity continues to deploy
CDMA. This consolidation could also result in delays in
purchasing decisions by the merged companies, negatively
affecting our revenues and operating results.

The enforcement and protection of our
intellectual property rights may be expensive and could divert
our valuable resources.

We rely primarily on patent, copyright, trademark
and trade secret laws, as well as nondisclosure and
confidentiality agreements and other methods, to protect our
proprietary information, technologies and processes, including
our patent portfolio. Policing unauthorized use of our products
and technologies is difficult. We cannot be certain that the
steps we have taken will prevent the misappropriation or
unauthorized use of our proprietary information and
technologies, particularly in foreign countries where the laws
may not protect our proprietary rights as fully as United States
laws.

The vast majority of our patents and patent
applications relate to our CDMA digital wireless communications
technology and much of the remainder of our patents and patent
applications relate to our gpsOne, BREW, OmniTRACS, Digital
Cinema, Globalstar and Eudora products. Litigation may be
required to enforce our intellectual property rights, protect
our trade secrets or determine the validity and scope of
proprietary rights of others. As a result of any such
litigation, we could lose our proprietary rights or incur
substantial unexpected operating costs. Any action we take to
protect our intellectual property rights could be costly and
could absorb significant management time and attention, which,
in turn, could negatively impact our operating results. In
addition, failure to protect our trademark rights could impair
our brand identity.

Claims by third parties that we infringe their
intellectual property or that patents on which we rely are
invalid could adversely affect our business.

From time to time, companies may assert patent,
copyright and other intellectual proprietary rights to our
technologies or technologies used in our industry. These claims
may result in our involvement in litigation. We may not prevail
in such litigation given the complex technical issues and
inherent uncertainties in intellectual property litigation. If
any products incorporating our technology were found to infringe
on protected technology, we could be required to redesign or
license such technology and/or pay damages or other compensation
to the infringed party. If we were unable to license protected
technology used in our products, we could be prohibited from
making and selling such products.

In addition, as the number of competitors in our
market increases and the functionality of products incorporating
our technology is enhanced and overlaps with the products of
other companies, we may become subject to claims of infringement
or misappropriation of the intellectual property rights of
others. Any claims, with or without merit, could be time
consuming, result in costly litigation, divert the efforts of
our technical and management personnel or cause product shipment
delays, any of which could have a material adverse effect upon
our operating results. In any potential dispute involving our
patents or other intellectual property, our licensees could also
become the targets of litigation. This could trigger obligations
on us that could result



in substantial expenses. In addition to the time
and expense required for us to comply with our obligations to
our licensees, any such litigation could severely disrupt the
business of our licensees, which in turn could hurt our
relations with our licensees and cause our revenues to decrease.

A number of third parties have claimed to own
patents essential to various proposed 3G CDMA standards. If
we are required to obtain additional licenses and/or pay
royalties to one or more patent holders, this could have a
material adverse effect on the commercial implementation of our
CDMA products and technologies and our profitability.

Third parties also may commence actions seeking
to establish the invalidity of our patents. In the event that a
third-party challenges a patent, a court may invalidate the
patent or determine that the patent is not enforceable, which
would harm our competitive position. If any of our key patents
are invalidated, or if the scope of the claims in any of these
patents is limited by court decision, we could be prevented from
licensing the invalidated or limited portion of our technology
and our licensees may be prevented from manufacturing and
selling the products that incorporate such technology without
obtaining a license to use a third-party’s technology. Even
if a third-party challenge is not successful, it could be
expensive and time consuming, divert management attention from
our business and harm our reputation.

The high amount of capital required to obtain
radio frequencies licenses could slow the growth of the wireless
communications industry and adversely affect our
business.

Our growth is dependent upon the increased use of
wireless communications services that utilize our CDMA
technology. In order to provide wireless communications
services, carriers must obtain rights to use specific radio
frequencies. The allocation of frequencies is regulated in the
United States and other countries throughout the world and
limited spectrum space is allocated to wireless communications
services. Industry growth may be affected by the amount of
capital required to obtain licenses to use new frequencies.
Typically, governments sell these licenses at auctions. Over the
last several years, the amount paid for these licenses has
increased significantly, particularly for frequencies used in
connection with 3G technology. The significant cost of licenses
may slow the growth of the industry if service providers are
unable to obtain or service the additional capital necessary to
implement infrastructure to support 3G technology. Our growth
could be adversely affected if this occurs.

Our business and operating results may be
harmed by inflation and deflation.

Inflation has had and may continue to have
adverse effects on the economies and securities markets of
certain countries and could have adverse effects on our
customers, licensees and the projects of CDMA carriers in those
countries, including their ability to obtain financing and repay
debts. Brazil and Mexico, for example, have periodically
experienced relatively high rates of inflation and currency
devaluation. Significant inflation or deflation could have a
material adverse effect on our business, operating results,
liquidity and financial position.

If we experience product liability claims or
recalls, we may incur significant expenses and experience
decreased demand for our products.

Testing, manufacturing, marketing and use of our
products and those of our licensees and customers entails the
risk of product liability. Although we believe our product
liability insurance will be adequate to protect against product
liability claims, we cannot assure you that we will be able to
continue to maintain such insurance at a reasonable cost or in
sufficient amounts to protect us against losses due to product
liability. Our inability to maintain insurance at an acceptable
cost or to otherwise protect against potential product liability
claims could prevent or inhibit the commercialization of our
products and those of our licensees and customers and harm our
future operating results. In addition, a product liability claim
or recall could harm our reputation and result in decreased
demand for our products.



Our business depends on the availability of
satellite and other networks for our OmniTRACS, TruckMAIL,
OmniExpress, LINQ and OmniOne systems and other communications
products.

Our OmniTRACS and TruckMAIL systems currently
operate in the United States market on leased Ku-band satellite
transponders. Our data satellite transponder and position
reporting satellite transponder lease runs through October 2006.
Based on system capacity analysis, we believe that the United
States OmniTRACS and TruckMAIL operations will not require
additional transponder capacity in 2002. We believe that in the
event additional transponder capacity would be required in
fiscal 2002 or in future years, additional capacity will be
available on acceptable terms. However, we cannot assure you
that we will be able to acquire additional transponder capacity
on acceptable terms in a timely manner. A failure to maintain
adequate satellite capacity would harm our business, operating
results, liquidity and financial position.

Our OmniExpress, LINQ and OmniOne systems are
terrestrial-based products and thus rely on various wireless
terrestrial communications networks operated by third parties.
We believe these terrestrial networks will be available for our
products; however, we cannot assure you that these networks will
continue to be available to us or that they will perform
adequately for our needs. The unavailability or nonperformance
of these network systems could harm our business.

Energy blackouts could cause disruption to a
portion of our operations and could have a material adverse
affect on our operating results.

Our corporate headquarters, research and
development and some manufacturing facilities are located in the
state of California, which has experienced temporary localized
electricity outages, or rolling blackouts, intermittently over
the past nine months which may continue or worsen into blackouts
of longer duration in the future. These blackouts could cause
disruptions to a portion of our operations and to the operations
of our suppliers, distributors and resellers, and customers,
which could have a material adverse effect on our operating
results.

Our business and operations would suffer in
the event of system failures.

Despite the implementation of security measures
and the existence of a Disaster Recovery Plan for our internal
information technology networking systems, our systems are
vulnerable to damages from computer viruses, unauthorized
access, natural disasters, terrorism, war, and telecommunication
failures. Any system failure, accident or security breach that
causes interruptions in our operations could result in a
material disruption to our business. To the extent that any
disruption or security breach results in a loss or damage to our
customers’ data or applications, or inappropriate
disclosure of confidential information, we may incur liability
as a result. In addition, we may incur additional costs to
remedy the damages caused by these disruptions or security
breaches.

Message transmissions for domestic OmniTRACS,
TruckMAIL, OmniExpress, and OmniOne operations are formatted and
processed at the Network Management Center in San Diego,
California, which we operate, with a fully-redundant backup
Network Management Center located in Las Vegas, Nevada. Our
Network Management Center operations are subject to system
failures which could interrupt the services and have a material
adverse effect on our operating results.

We may need additional capital in the future,
and such additional financing may not be available.

The design, development and commercialization of
digital wireless communications technology and products is
highly capital intensive. For example, we must have the ability
to fund significant capital for our internal research and
development efforts. In addition, terrestrial and satellite
wireless system carriers increasingly have required long-term
financing or equity. In particular, we have substantial debt and
equity funding commitments to various CDMA carriers and
strategic investees. In order to meet our financing needs, we
may be required to raise additional funds from a combination of
sources including potential debt or equity issuances. We cannot
assure you that additional financing will be available on
reasonable terms or at all.



Government regulation may adversely affect our
business.

Our products and those of our customers and
licensees are subject to various Federal Communications
Commission regulations in the United States and other
international regulations. These regulations require that these
products meet certain radio frequency emission standards, not
cause unallowable interference to other services, and in some
cases accept interference from other services. We are also
subject to government regulations and requirements of local
standards bodies outside the United States, where we are less
prominent than local competitors and have less opportunity to
participate in the establishment of regulatory and standards
policies. We are also subject to state and federal health,
safety and environmental regulations, as well as regulations
related to the handling of and access to classified information.
Changes in the regulation of our activities, including changes
in the allocation of available spectrum by the United States
government and other governments, or exclusion of our technology
by a standards body, could have a material adverse effect on our
business, operating results, liquidity and financial position.

If wireless handsets pose health and safety
risks, we may be subject to new regulations, and demand for our
products and those of our licensees and customers may
decrease.

Media reports have suggested that radio frequency
emissions from wireless handsets may be linked to various health
concerns, including cancer, and may interfere with various
electronic medical devices, including hearing aids and
pacemakers. Concerns over radio frequency emissions may have the
effect of discouraging the use of wireless handsets, which would
decrease demand for our products and those of our licensees and
customers. In recent years, the FCC and foreign regulatory
agencies have updated the guidelines and methods they use for
evaluating radio frequency emissions from radio equipment,
including wireless handsets. In addition, interest groups have
requested that the FCC investigate claims that wireless
communications technologies pose health concerns and cause
interference with airbags, hearing aids and medical devices.
There also are some safety risks associated with the use of
wireless handsets while driving. Concerns over these safety
risks and the effect of any legislation that may be adopted in
response to these risks could reduce demand for our products and
those of our licensees and customers in the United States as
well as foreign countries.

Our business and operating results will be
harmed if we are unable to manage growth in our
business.

Since 1996, our businesses have experienced
periods of rapid growth that have placed, and are expected to
continue to place, significant demands on our managerial,
operational and financial resources. In order to manage this
growth, we must continue to improve and expand our management,
operational and financial systems and controls, including
quality control and delivery and service capabilities. We also
need to continue to expand, train and manage our employee base.
We must carefully manage research and development capabilities
and production and inventory levels to meet product demand, new
product introductions and product and technology transitions. We
cannot assure you that we will be able to timely and effectively
meet that demand and maintain the quality standards required by
our existing and potential customers and licensees.

In addition, inaccuracies in our demand forecasts
could quickly result in either insufficient or excessive
inventories and disproportionate overhead expenses. If we
ineffectively manage our growth or are unsuccessful in
recruiting and retaining personnel, our business and operating
results will be harmed.

We may not be able to attract and retain
qualified personnel necessary for the design, development and
commercialization of our products and technology.

Our future success depends largely upon the
continued service of our executive officers and other key
management and technical personnel. Our success also depends on
our ability to continue to attract, retain and motivate
qualified personnel. Our key technical personnel represent a
significant asset, as the source of our technological and
product innovations upon which our revenues are highly
dependent. The competition for these personnel is intense in the
wireless communications industry.



We may have particular difficulty attracting and
retaining key personnel in periods of poor operating performance
given the significant use of incentive compensation by our
competitors. We do not have employment agreements with our key
management personnel and do not maintain key person life
insurance on any of our personnel. The loss of one or more of
our key employees or our inability to attract, retain and
motivate qualified personnel could negatively impact our ability
to design, develop and commercialize our products and technology.

Future changes in financial accounting
standards may cause adverse unexpected revenue fluctuations and
affect our reported results of operations.

A change in accounting policies can have a
significant effect on our reported results and may even affect
our reporting of transactions completed before a change is
announced. New pronouncements and varying interpretations of
pronouncements have occurred with frequency and may occur in the
future. Changes to existing rules or the questioning of current
practices may adversely affect our reported financial results or
the way we conduct our business.

Our stockholder rights plan, certificate of
incorporation and Delaware law could adversely affect the
performance of our stock.

Our certificate of incorporation provides for
cumulative voting in the election of directors. In addition, our
certificate of incorporation provides for a classified board of
directors and includes a provision that requires the approval of
holders of at least 66 2/3% of our voting stock as a
condition to a merger or certain other business transactions
with, or proposed by, a holder of 15% or more of our voting
stock. This approval is not required in cases where certain of
our directors approve the transaction or where certain minimum
price criteria and other procedural requirements are met. Our
certificate of incorporation also requires the approval of
holders of at least 66 2/3% of our voting stock to amend or
change the provisions mentioned relating to the classified
board, cumulative voting or the transaction approval. Under our
bylaws, stockholders are not permitted to call special meetings
of our stockholders. Finally, our certificate of incorporation
provides that any action required or permitted to be taken by
our stockholders must be effected at a duly called annual or
special meeting rather than by any consent in writing.

The classified board, transaction approval,
special meeting and other charter provisions may discourage
certain types of transactions involving an actual or potential
change in our control. These provisions may also discourage
certain types of transactions in which our stockholders might
otherwise receive a premium for their shares over then current
market prices and may limit our stockholders’ ability to
approve transactions that they may deem to be in their best
interests.

Further, we have distributed a dividend of one
right for each outstanding share of our common stock pursuant to
the terms of our preferred share purchase rights plan. These
rights will cause substantial dilution to the ownership of a
person or group that attempts to acquire us on terms not
approved by our board of directors and may have the effect of
deterring hostile takeover attempts. In addition, our board of
directors has the authority to fix the rights and preferences of
and issue shares of preferred stock. This right may have the
effect of delaying or preventing a change in our control without
action by our stockholders.

We are at risk of securities class action
litigation that could result in substantial costs and divert
management’s attention and resources.

In the past, securities class action litigation
has often been brought against a company following periods of
volatility in the market price of its securities. Due to the
volatility of our stock price, we may be the target of
securities litigation in the future. Securities litigation could
result in substantial costs and divert management’s
attention and resources.



ITEM 2. PROPERTIES

At September 30, 2001, we occupied the
indicated square footage in the owned or leased facilities
described below (in thousands):

In addition to the facilities above, we also own
or lease an additional 1,383,800 square feet of properties that
are leased or subleased to third parties.

Our leases expire at varying dates through 2008
not including renewals that would be at our option. Between
December 2001 and March 2002, we will begin leasing
four additional buildings in the United States totaling 215,212
square feet. With this additional space, we believe that our
facilities will be suitable and adequate for the present
purposes, and that the productive capacity in such facilities is
substantially being utilized. In the future, we may need to
purchase, build or lease additional facilities to meet the
requirements projected in our long-term business plan.

ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

Schwartz, et al v.
QUALCOMM

: On December 14,
2000, 77 former employees filed a lawsuit against us in the
District Court for Boulder County, Colorado, alleging claims for
intentional misrepresentation, nondisclosure and concealment,
violation of C.R.S. Section 8-2-104 (obtaining workers by
misrepresentation), breach of contract, breach of the implied
covenant of good faith and fair dealing, promissory estoppel,
negligent misrepresentation, unjust enrichment, violation of
California Labor Code Section 970, violation of California
Civil Code Sections 1709-1710, rescission, violation of
California Business & Professions Code Section 17200
and violation of California Civil Code Section 1575. Since
then, four other individuals have joined the suit as plaintiffs.
Although there can be no assurance that an unfavorable outcome
of the dispute would not have a material adverse effect on our
operating results, liquidity or financial position, we believe
the claims are without merit and will vigorously defend the
action.

GTE Wireless Incorporated (GTE) v.
QUALCOMM:

On June 29, 1999,
GTE filed an action in the United States District Court for the
Eastern District of Virginia asserting that wireless telephones
sold by us infringe a single patent allegedly owned by GTE. On
September 15, 1999, the court granted us motion to transfer
the action to the United States District Court for the Southern
District of California. Trial has been set for June 3,
2002. Although there can be no assurance that an unfavorable
outcome of the dispute would not



have a material adverse effect on our operating
results, liquidity or financial position, we believe the action
is without merit and will vigorously defend the action.

Durante, et al v.
QUALCOMM:

On February 2,
2000, four former employees file a putative class action against
us, ostensibly on behalf of themselves and those former
employees of us whose employment was terminated in
April 1999. Virtually all of the purported class of
plaintiffs received severance packages at the time of the
termination of their employment, in exchange for a release of
claims, other than federal age discrimination claims, against
us. The complaint was filed in California Superior Court in and
for the County of Los Angeles and purports to state ten causes
of action including breach of contract, age discrimination,
violation of Labor Code Section 200, violation of Labor
Code Section 970, unfair business practices, intentional
infliction of emotional distress, unjust enrichment, breach of
the covenant of good faith and fair dealing, declaratory relief
and undue influence. The complaint seeks an order accelerating
all unvested stock options for the members of the class. On
June 27, 2000, the case was ordered transferred from Los
Angeles County Superior Court to San Diego County Superior
Court. On July 3, 2000, we removed the case to the United
States District Court for the Southern District of California,
and discovery has commenced. On May 29, 2001, the Court
dismissed all plaintiffs’ claims except for claims arising
under the federal Age Discrimination in Employment Act. On
July 16, 2001, the Court granted conditional class
certification on the remaining claims, to be revisited by the
court at the end of the discovery period. Although there can be
no assurance that an unfavorable outcome of the dispute would
not have a material adverse effect on our operating results,
liquidity or financial position, we believe the claims are
without merit and will vigorously defend the action.

Zoltar Satellite Alarm Systems, Inc. v.
QUALCOMM and SnapTrack:

On
March 30, 2001, Zoltar Satellite Alarm Systems, Inc. filed
suit against us and SnapTrack, our wholly owned subsidiary,
alleging infringement of three patents. On August 27, 2001,
Zoltar filed an amended complaint adding Sprint Corp. as a named
defendant and narrowing certain infringement claims against us
and SnapTrack. Since then, Zoltar has stated its intention to
dismiss Sprint Corp. as a defendant. We and SnapTrack have filed
responsive pleadings and discovery has commenced. Although there
can be no assurance that an unfavorable outcome of this dispute
would not have a material adverse effect on our operating
results, liquidity or financial position, we believe the claims
are without merit and will vigorously defend the action.

We are engaged in other legal actions arising in
the ordinary course of our business and believe that the
ultimate outcome of these actions will not have a material
adverse effect on our operating results, liquidity or financial
position.

ITEM 4. SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A
VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS

No matters were submitted to a vote of security
holders during the quarter ended September 30, 2001.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION
AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF
OPERATION

Except for the historical information contained
herein, the following discussion contains forward-looking
statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual
results may differ substantially from those referred to herein
due to a number of factors, including but not limited to risks
described in the section entitled Risk Factors and elsewhere in
this Annual Report. Our consolidated financial data includes
SnapTrack, Inc. and other consolidated subsidiaries.

Overview

We design, manufacture and market digital
wireless telecommunications products and services based on our
CDMA and other technologies. We license and receive royalty
payments on our CDMA technology from major domestic and
international wireless telecommunications equipment suppliers.

We are a leading developer and supplier of
CDMA-based integrated circuits and system software for wireless
voice and data communications and global positioning system
products. We offer complete system solutions including software
and integrated circuits for wireless handsets and infrastructure
equipment. This complete system solution approach provides
customers with advanced wireless technology, enhanced component
integration and interoperability, and reduced time to market. We
provide integrated circuits and system software to many of the
world’s leading wireless handset and infrastructure
manufacturers.

We provide satellite and terrestrial-based
two-way data messaging and position reporting services for
transportation companies and private fleets. We design,
manufacture and distribute products and provide services for our
OmniTRACS and TruckMAIL (satellite-based mobile communications
system), OmniExpress (terrestrial CDMA-based system) and LINQ
(terrestrial GSM-based system) worldwide. Transportation
companies and private fleets use our products to communicate
with drivers, monitor vehicle location and provide customer
service. We also integrate the mobile data with operations
software, such as dispatch, payroll and accounting, so end-users
can manage their information and operations.

We provide an open applications platform for
CDMA-based wireless devices to provide solutions for the
wireless industry as it moves toward wireless Internet
convergence. Our BREW product is a thin applications environment
that provides applications developers with an open standard
platform for wireless devices on which to develop their
products. The BREW platform leverages the capabilities available
in QCT integrated circuits, system software and Wireless
Internet Launchpad software, enabling development of
feature-rich applications and content while reducing memory
overhead and maximizing system performance. The BREW platform
also enables over-the-air downloads of applications by end users
directly to their BREW-enabled handsets. In November 2001,
KTFreeTel, a leading CDMA carrier in Korea, began commercial
service of BREW-enabled applications and services to
subscribers, providing end users the ability to download
wireless applications over the air and customize their phones
with software that meets their individual needs.
KTFreeTel’s wireless multimedia service runs on a CDMA2000
1X high-speed data network and is available to end users on
color display handsets.

In December 1999, the Securities and
Exchange Commission (SEC) issued Staff Accounting
Bulletin No. 101 (SAB 101), “Revenue Recognition
in Financial Statements.” The SEC staff subsequently
amended SAB 101 to provide registrants with additional time to
implement the standard. We adopted SAB 101 in the fourth
quarter of fiscal 2001, applied retroactively to the first
quarter of fiscal 2001. The effect of the adoption of SAB 101 on
our results of operations for fiscal 2001, when applied
retroactively, was to decrease revenue by $40 million and to
increase the loss before income taxes and accounting change by
$51 million. We recorded a $147 million loss, net of taxes of
$98 million, as the cumulative effect of the accounting change
as of the beginning of fiscal 2001 to reflect the deferral of
revenue and expenses related to future periods. For fiscal 2001,
we recognized $95 million in net income before income taxes and
accounting change related to revenue and expense that was
recognized in prior years.

Prior to the adoption of SAB 101, we generally
recorded revenue from non-refundable license fees on the
effective date of the applicable license agreement. After the
adoption of SAB 101, license fees are recognized



ratably over the estimated period of future
benefit to the licensee. Royalty revenue continues to be
recorded as earned when reasonable estimates of such amounts can
be made.

Prior to the adoption of SAB 101, we
recorded revenue from hardware product sales at the time of
shipment, or when title and risk of loss passes to the customer,
if later. After adoption of SAB 101, revenue and expense
from certain hardware product sales contracted with a continuing
service obligation that is essential to the functionality of the
hardware are recognized ratably over the shorter of the
estimated life of the hardware product or the expected service
period. Revenue from hardware product sales without such a
continuing service obligation is recorded when risk of loss and
title pass to the customer. Messaging revenue continues to be
recorded as earned.

We were required to adopt Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 133 (FAS 133),
“Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging
Activities,” as of the beginning of fiscal 2001.
FAS 133 requires certain derivative instruments to be
recorded at fair value. After adoption of FAS 133,
unrealized gains and losses on these derivative instruments are
recorded in the statement of operations. We recorded a $129
million gain, net of taxes of $87 million, as the cumulative
effect of the change in accounting principle as of the beginning
of fiscal 2001. The cumulative effect of the accounting change
related primarily to the recognition of the unrealized gain on a
warrant to purchase 4,500,000 shares of Leap Wireless common
stock issued to us in connection with our spin-off of Leap
Wireless in September 1998. Additionally, we recorded $243
million in pre-tax unrealized losses on derivative instruments
during fiscal 2001, primarily resulting from a decline in the
market price of Leap Wireless stock which reduced the fair value
of the Leap Wireless warrant. The new requirement to record
unrealized gains and losses on these instruments in the
statement of operations may cause substantial quarterly and
annual fluctuations in operating results due to stock market
volatility.

Strategic Investments and Financing

We make strategic investments to promote the
worldwide adoption of CDMA products and services for wireless
voice and Internet data communications. In general, we enter
into strategic relationships with CDMA carriers and developers
of innovative technologies or products for the wireless
communications industry. QUALCOMM Ventures, an internal
organization, selects and manages strategic investments in early
stage companies and, from time to time, venture funds or
incubators, to support the adoption of CDMA and use of the
wireless Internet. Most of our strategic investments entail a
high degree of risk and will not become liquid until more than
one year from the date of investment, if at all. To the extent
such investments become liquid and meet strategic objectives, we
attempt to make regular periodic sales that are recognized in
investment (expense) income. During fiscal 2002, we may
reduce the planned sale of certain equity investments until
market conditions improve. We regularly monitor and evaluate the
realizable value of our investments in both marketable and
private securities. If events and circumstances indicate that a
decline in the value of these assets has occurred and is other
than temporary, we will record a charge to investment
(expense) income. During fiscal year 2001, we recognized
$287 million in charges related to other-than-temporary losses
on marketable and private securities.

In December 2000, we announced a new CDMA
license program designed to allow selected early stage companies
to issue equity to us as a means of paying part of the license
fees payable under our CDMA license agreements. We record
license fee revenues based on the fair value of the equity
instruments received, if determinable. The measurement date for
determination of fair value is the earlier of the date on which
the parties establish a commitment to perform or the date at
which the performance is complete. The evaluation procedures
used to determine fair value include, but are not limited to,
examining the current market price for the shares if the
licensee is publicly traded, examining recent rounds of
financing and the licensee’s business plan if not publicly
traded, and performing other due diligence procedures. This
program will not affect the licensees’ obligations to pay
royalties under their CDMA license agreements. The amount of
cash consideration and the timing of revenue recognition varies
depending on the terms of each agreement. During fiscal year
2001, we received $11 million in equity consideration for new or
expanded licenses. In addition, we accepted $9 million in equity
in satisfaction of cash license fee receivables during fiscal
year 2001. At September 30, 2001, seven licensees have
participated in this program.



The Vesper Companies

In fiscal 1999, we made commitments to invest
approximately $108 million in the Vesper Companies. The Vesper
Companies were formed by a consortium of investors to provide
wireless and wireline telephone services in the northern region
and in the Sao Paulo state of Brazil. We subsequently
participated in additional financing rounds completed by the
Vesper Companies, thereby increasing our initial equity
investment. In addition, we extended long-term financing to the
Vesper Companies related to our financing arrangement with
Ericsson. At September 30, 2001, our cumulative cash
investment, including long-term financing, in the Vesper
Companies totaled approximately $241 million. In
January 2000, we acquired an approximate 2.5% interest in
VeloCom, an investor in the Vesper Companies, for $15 million.
In December 2000, we executed a Term Loan Agreement with
VeloCom in which we agreed to provide $230 million of
convertible debt financing, including $30 million for
capitalized interest. The debt facility has a three-year term
and bears interest at 18%. We funded approximately $172 million
under this facility through September 30, 2001.

As a result of a reorganization of the Vesper
Companies initiated during fiscal 2001, we reassessed the
recoverability of our assets related to the Vesper Companies and
VeloCom and recorded $32 million in asset impairments and
related charges, $90 million in investment (expense) income
and $120 million in other non-operating charges. At
September 30, 2001, we had approximately $124 million in
remaining net assets, primarily consisting of finance
receivables and notes receivable related to the Vesper Companies
and VeloCom. The Vesper Companies are working to accomplish the
terms of their restructuring with owners, vendors and creditors,
which is expected to be completed in the first quarter of our
fiscal 2002. The proposed transaction is contingent on several
factors, and there is a risk it will not close. If the
transaction closes, we expect to acquire an additional interest
in the Vesper Companies for $266 million in equity commitments.
We also expect to convert our Term Loan Agreement with VeloCom
into an additional equity interest in VeloCom. After the close,
we expect to hold a 49.9% interest in VeloCom, and direct and
indirect interests in the Vesper Companies of 74% and 86%,
respectively.

We believe the Vesper Companies represent a
strategic opportunity with their extensive installed CDMA
network in Brazil, including the key cities of Sao Paulo and Rio
de Janeiro. The Vesper Companies’ debt would be reduced in
the proposed restructuring from approximately $1.3 billion to
less than $200 million. Additionally, the term of the remaining
debt would be extended through 2005, providing the Vesper
Companies significant operational flexibility to support a
growing business. If the proposed restructuring transaction
closes, we intend to support the Vesper Companies while they,
together with VeloCom, seek to partner with strategic investors
and internationally recognized operators who have the ability to
successfully enhance the Vesper Companies’ business and
ultimately assume majority control. We would also consider other
strategic alternatives such as spinning off our investment in
the Vesper Companies to our shareholders. We will consolidate
the results of the Vesper Companies if the proposed transaction
closes in fiscal 2002. The Vesper Companies expect to incur
increasing operating losses and negative cash flows from
operations as they expand operations and enter new markets, even
if and after they achieve positive cash flows from operations in
the initial operating markets. We may incur significant losses
in the future related to our proposed ownership of the Vesper
Companies, and we cannot assure you that the Vesper Companies
will ever operate profitably.

NextWave Telecom Inc.

In November 1995, we purchased 1,666,666
shares of Series B common stock in Next

Wave

Telecom
Inc. (Next

Wave

), a privately-held company, for $5
million. As part of the share purchase, we received warrants to
buy 1,111,111 additional shares of Series B common stock at
$3 per share. During March 1996, we converted a $15 million
note receivable into 5,000,000 shares of Series B common
stock. In June 1998, we recorded a $20 million impairment
charge related to our investment in Next

Wave

.
Subsidiaries of Next

Wave

filed for bankruptcy protection
in June 1998 under Chapter 11 of the United States
Bankruptcy Code. Next

Wave

itself filed for bankruptcy
protection in December 1998 under Chapter 11 of the
United States Bankruptcy Code.

In August 2001, Next

Wave

filed a plan
of reorganization with the United States Bankruptcy Court which
requires total financing of approximately $5 billion to
build-out an advanced 3G wireless network. The plan provides for
payment of all valid claims against Next

Wave

, including
the claim of the FCC for the PCS



licenses it granted to Next

Wave

in 1997,
plus interest as applicable. The plan also provides that
Next

Wave’s

debt for its C-block and F-block PCS
licenses would be reinstated, with the government receiving all
amounts due up to this point, in full, with the remaining
balance to be paid in installments. Under this plan,
Next

Wave

indicated that it expects to construct wireless
networks in 95 markets utilizing CDMA2000 1xEV-DO technology.

During fiscal 2001, we sold 150,000 shares of
Next

Wave

series B common stock and recorded a realized
gain of $1 million. At September 30, 2001, we owned
6,516,666 shares of Series B common stock and held warrants
to purchase 1,111,111 shares of Series B common stock for
$3 per share. We also held a $0.4 million promissory note
convertible into 1,019,444 shares of Series C common stock.

In August 2001, we committed to purchase
2,000,000 shares of Series A preferred stock in the
reorganized Next

Wave

for $300 million. Our investment was
subject to approval by the United States Bankruptcy Court,
successful consummation of Next

Wave

’s
August 2001 plan of reorganization, satisfactory resolution
of all disputes involving Next

Wave

’s PCS licenses
and other conditions. Furthermore, our obligation to make this
investment was subject to approval by the Bankruptcy Court on or
before October 31, 2001 of the terms and conditions of our
investment, as well as a certain Technology Cooperation
Agreement dated as of August 15, 2001, as amended, between
Next

Wave

and us. Next

Wave

also was entitled to
terminate the investment commitment if a certain break-up fee
contained in the subject Subscription Agreement was not approved
by the Bankruptcy Court on or before October 31, 2001. The
approvals required by October 31, 2001 have not been
obtained, and we are entitled to terminate our investment
agreement with Next

Wave

. Furthermore, on November 8,
2001, Next

Wave’s

bankruptcy counsel publicly
announced that a settlement with the FCC had been reached
pursuant to which Next

Wave

would relinquish its C-block
and F-block PCS licenses in return for a cash payment from the
FCC. Next

Wave’s

bankruptcy counsel indicated that if
the settlement receives the necessary approvals, then
Next

Wave

intends to file a new plan of reorganization
which takes into account the terms of the settlement. Our $300
million commitment is dependent on Next

Wave

pursuing the
plan of reorganization filed in August, 2001. Accordingly, if
Next

Wave

does abandon the plan filed in August, 2001 and
proceeds with a new plan, then we will not be obligated to make
the investment. As a result of the uncertainty surrounding
Next

Wave’s

financing plans, the terms of the
settlement announced November 8, 2001 and other factors,
there is significant uncertainty as to whether we will have the
opportunity to make our planned investment in a reorganized
Next

Wave.

Globalstar L.P.

We have contracts with Globalstar to design,
develop and manufacture subscriber products and ground
telecommunications equipment. On January 16, 2001,
Globalstar announced that, in order to have sufficient funds
available for the continued progress of its marketing and
service activities, it had suspended indefinitely principal and
interest payments on all of its debt, including its vendor
financing obligations. As a result, Globalstar did not make an
approximate $22 million payment for principal and interest due
to us on January 15, 2001. Globalstar also announced the
retention of a financial adviser to assist in developing future
initiatives, including restructuring Globalstar’s debt,
identifying funding opportunities and pursuing other strategic
alternatives. Efforts, by Globalstar, to restructure its debt
are on-going, and work on a final plan is expected to continue.
However, Globalstar’s restructuring has not progressed as
we had anticipated. Based on the current status of
Globalstar’s restructuring efforts, we believe that we will
not receive any of the contractual amounts due. As a result, in
the fourth quarter of fiscal 2001, we recorded $44 million in
net charges to establish reserves against remaining
Globalstar-related assets. During fiscal 2001, we recorded total
net charges of $49 million in cost of revenues, $519 million in
asset impairment and related charges, $10 million in investment
expense and $58 million in other non-operating charges related
primarily to the impairment of certain assets. We expect
Globalstar-related revenues to be negligible for fiscal 2002.

Other

In March 2001, our wholly owned subsidiary,
3G Investments (Australia) Pty Limited, was awarded 2x10 MHz
licenses in the Australian 3G wireless spectrum auctions for
approximately $84 million. We entered the auctions to acquire
appropriate spectrum to support a high-capacity CDMA2000
1X/1xEV-DO



system in Australia, a country with significant
CDMA growth prospects. Our successful participation in numerous
spectrum auctions in the past has resulted in nationwide CDMA
networks being deployed in other countries, including Mexico,
Chile and Brazil. We are preparing to deploy CDMA2000 1X/1xEV-DO
networks in Australia with commercial 3G services planned in
2002. The licenses can be used for commercial service starting
in October 2002. The licenses will cover a total of 12
million potential customers in eight major markets, including
Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, Adelaide, Perth, Hobart, Darwin and
Canberra.

In October 2000, we agreed to invest $200
million in the convertible preferred shares of Inquam Limited
(Inquam). Inquam was formed to acquire, own, develop and manage
wireless communications systems, either directly or indirectly,
with the primary intent of deploying CDMA-based technology. In
addition, we advanced $10 million under a promissory note,
bearing interest at 10%, that matures on January 31, 2002.
At September 30, 2001, $144 million of the equity funding
commitment is outstanding. We expect to fund the remaining
commitment through June 2002.

We provided financing to Pegaso under an
equipment loan and a bridge facility. Pegaso operates a wireless
network in Mexico. At September 30, 2001, $260 million and
$414 million are outstanding under the equipment loan and the
bridge facility, respectively, net of deferred interest and
unearned fees. The bridge facility was payable in full on
September 19, 2001 or August 29, 2002 if certain
milestones were met, including the completion of a strategic
sale or merger with a third party. The bridge facility was
amended in October 2001 to, among other things, change the
timing of milestones required for the August 29, 2002
maturity from September 19 to October 31, 2001. A
strategic sale or merger was not completed by October 31,
2001, such that Pegaso failed to meet covenants in both the
amended bridge facility and the equipment loan. On
October 31, 2001, Pegaso also failed to make a scheduled
payment of approximately $3 million on the equipment loan,
Pegaso is currently engaged in strategic discussions with a
third party for a potential sale or merger, and we are actively
working with Pegaso and the third party to complete a
transaction or, alternatively, to assist Pegaso in raising
additional funds. As the transaction did not close on the
targeted date of October 31, 2001 and such additional
financing is not certain, we ceased accruing interest on these
loans effective at the beginning of the fourth fiscal quarter of
2001. The bridge facility is collateralized by a second lien on
substantially all of Pegaso’s assets. We also have a
commitment to provide an additional $96 million in long-term
financing under an arrangement with Ericsson, subject to Pegaso
meeting certain conditions. Pegaso is at an early stage of
development and, if it remains independent, may not be able to
compete successfully. Competitors in Mexico have greater
financial resources and more established operations than Pegaso.
As is normal for early stage wireless operators, Pegaso is
experiencing significant losses from operations. Pegaso also has
limited cash available to meet its operating and financing
commitments and is therefore dependent on securing additional
financing or completing a strategic arrangement with an existing
carrier.

Fiscal 2001 Compared to Fiscal 2000

Total revenues for fiscal 2001 were $2,680
million compared to $3,197 million for fiscal 2000. Total
revenues for fiscal 2000 included $435 million in revenue
related to the terrestrial-based CDMA wireless consumer phone
business which was sold in February 2000. Excluding the
revenue of the business sold from fiscal 2000, total revenues
decreased by $82 million in fiscal 2001. The decrease is
primarily related to the implementation of SAB 101 in
fiscal 2001, lower revenues related to the business with
Globalstar, offset by higher royalties, higher unit shipments
and average selling prices of MSM integrated circuits, higher
CSM infrastructure integrated circuit revenues, and higher
OmniTRACS messaging revenue. Revenue from Samsung Electronics
Company (Samsung), Kyocera Wireless Corp. and LG Electronics,
Inc., customers of both QCT and QTL, comprised an aggregate of
14%, 12% and 10% of total consolidated revenues, respectively,
in fiscal 2001. In fiscal 2000, Samsung accounted for 11% of
total consolidated revenues.

Cost of revenues for fiscal 2001 was $1,035
million compared to $1,507 million for fiscal 2000. Total cost
of revenues for fiscal 2000 included $433 million in cost of
revenues related to the terrestrial-based CDMA wireless consumer
phone business which was sold in February 2000. Excluding
the cost of revenues of the business sold from fiscal 2000,
total cost of revenues decreased by $39 million in fiscal 2001,
consistent with the decrease in revenues. Cost of revenues as a
percentage of revenues was 39% for fiscal 2001 and 2000. Cost



of revenues as a percentage of revenues may
fluctuate in future quarters depending on the mix of products
sold and services provided, royalties and license fees earned,
competitive pricing, new product introduction costs and other
factors.

For fiscal 2001, research and development
expenses were $415 million or 15% of revenues, compared to $340
million or 11% of revenues for fiscal 2000. The dollar and
percentage increases in research and development expenses were
primarily due to increased integrated circuit product
initiatives to support high-speed wireless Internet access and
multimode, multi-band, multi-network products including cdmaOne,
CDMA2000 1X/1xEV-DO, GSM/ GPRS, WCDMA and position location
technologies, offset by a decrease in terrestrial-based CDMA
wireless consumer phone products research and development as a
result of exiting this business in February 2000. In
addition, the percentage increase is attributed to a more
significant reduction in revenue relative to research and
development expenses as a result of the sale of the
terrestrial-based CDMA wireless consumer phone business in
February 2000.

For fiscal 2001, selling, general and
administrative expenses were $367 million or 14% of revenues,
compared to $343 million or 11% of revenues for fiscal 2000. The
dollar and percentage increases in selling, general and
administrative expenses from fiscal 2000 were primarily due to
expansion of international business activities in China, Japan,
South Korea and Europe, trade show expenses related to the
expansion of the integrated circuit customer base and product
portfolio and the introduction of our BREW application
development platform, offset by a decrease in marketing costs
for terrestrial-based CDMA wireless consumer phone products as a
result of the sale of the business in February 2000. In
addition, the percentage increase is attributed to a more
significant reduction in revenue relative to selling, general
and administrative expenses as a result of the sale of the
terrestrial-based CDMA wireless consumer phone business in
February 2000.

Amortization of goodwill and other
acquisition-related intangible assets was $255 million for
fiscal 2001, compared to $146 million in fiscal 2000. For fiscal
2001, no purchased in-process technology was recorded, compared
to $60 million in fiscal 2000. The increase in amortization in
fiscal 2001 and the purchased in-process technology charge in
fiscal 2000 resulted from the acquisition of SnapTrack, Inc.
(SnapTrack) in March 2000.

For fiscal 2001, asset impairment and related
charges were $550 million, compared to $46 million for fiscal
2000. Asset impairment and related charges during fiscal 2001
were comprised primarily of $519 million in charges resulting
from management’s determination that certain assets related
to the Globalstar business were impaired and $32 million in
charges related to reserves recorded against finance receivables
from the Vesper Companies. Asset impairment and related charges
during fiscal 2000 were primarily related to the sale of the
terrestrial-based CDMA wireless consumer phone business in
February 2000.

For fiscal 2001, other operating expenses were
$51 million, compared to $32 million in fiscal 2000. Other
operating expenses for fiscal 2001 were comprised of a $62
million arbitration decision against us, offset by $11 million
in other income related to the irrevocable transfer of a portion
of an FCC Auction Discount Voucher to a third-party. Other
operating expenses during fiscal 2000 were comprised primarily
of employee termination and other costs related to the sale of
the terrestrial-based CDMA wireless consumer phone business.

Interest expense was $10 million for fiscal 2001,
compared to $5 million for fiscal 2000. The increase was
primarily related to interest charges resulting from an
arbitration decision against us, offset by lower interest
expense resulting from decreased bank borrowings.

Net investment expense was $256 million for
fiscal 2001 compared to net investment income of $494 million
for fiscal 2000. The decrease was primarily due to a $200
million reduction in net realized gains on marketable and other
securities, $243 million in unrealized losses on derivative
instruments, $148 million in unrealized losses related to
other-than-temporary losses on marketable securities, $140
million in unrealized other-than-temporary losses on other
investments and a $20 million increase in equity in losses of
investees.

There were no distributions on Trust Convertible
Preferred Securities in fiscal 2001 due to the conversion of all
remaining Trust Convertible Preferred Securities into common
stock during fiscal 2000. We recorded $13 million in
distributions for fiscal 2000.



Other non-operating charges were approximately
$167 million in fiscal 2001 compared to $2 million in fiscal
2000. Other non-operating charges in fiscal 2001 were primarily
comprised of a $120 million write-down of the note receivable
from VeloCom to its fair value and $58 million in write-downs of
recorded values of a note receivable from Globalstar and
warrants to acquire partnership interests in Globalstar to their
estimated fair values.

Income tax expense was $105 million for fiscal
2001 compared to $527 million for fiscal 2000. The annual
effective tax rate was negative 25% for fiscal 2001, compared to
a 44% rate for fiscal 2000. The estimated annual effective tax
rate is negative primarily as a result of foreign taxes paid for
which it is more likely than not we will not receive a tax
benefit. The difference in the tax rate from the prior year is
primarily due to the loss for fiscal 2001 resulting from certain
asset impairment and related charges. We have provided a
valuation allowance on substantially all of our deferred tax
assets because of uncertainty regarding their realizability due
to the expectation that deductions from future employee stock
option exercises will exceed future taxable income. Our net
deferred tax assets increased by $631 million in fiscal 2001,
and the resulting increase in the valuation allowance was
reflected in part as an increase to the tax expense and in part
as a reduction of stockholders’ equity. The total expense
related to the increase in the valuation allowance was $185
million.

We recorded an $18 million loss, net of taxes, in
fiscal 2001 as the net cumulative effect of changes in
accounting principle at September 25, 2000. The cumulative
effect of the adoption of SAB 101 was a $147 million loss, net
of taxes, offset by a $129 million gain, net of taxes, resulting
from the cumulative effect of the adoption of FAS 133. The
gain resulting from the adoption of FAS 133 related
primarily to the unrealized gain on a warrant to purchase
4,500,000 shares of Leap Wireless common stock issued to us in
connection with our spin-off of Leap Wireless in
September 1998.

Fiscal 2000 Compared to Fiscal 1999

Total revenues for fiscal 2000 were $3,197
million compared to $3,937 million for fiscal 1999. The decrease
in revenue for fiscal 2000 was primarily due to a decrease in
revenues from the terrestrial CDMA wireless consumer phone
business which was sold in February 2000, a decrease in the
wireless infrastructure product revenue related to the sale of
this business in May 1999 and a decrease in average selling
prices of integrated circuits, offset by significant increases
in royalty revenues and in CDMA integrated circuits unit volume.
Revenue from one South Korean customer, Samsung Electronics
Company, by the QCT and QTL segments comprised an aggregate of
11% and 9% of total revenues in fiscal 2000 and 1999.

Cost of revenues for fiscal 2000 was $1,507
million compared to $2,485 million for fiscal 1999. The decrease
in cost of revenues was primarily due to a decrease in the
terrestrial CDMA wireless consumer phone product costs as a
result of the sale of the business in February 2000, a
decrease in the wireless infrastructure product costs related to
the sale of this business in May 1999, and a reduction in
the unit cost of integrated circuits, offset by a significant
increase in CDMA integrated circuits unit volume. Cost of
revenues decreased as a percentage of revenues to 47% for fiscal
2000 from 63% for fiscal 1999. This is primarily due to a change
in business strategy resulting in a higher percentage of
revenues from high margin integrated circuits and system
software and royalties and lower revenues from lower gross
margin terrestrial CDMA wireless consumer phones and
infrastructure businesses exited in fiscal 2000 and fiscal 1999,
respectively. Cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues may
fluctuate in future quarters depending on mix of products sold,
competitive pricing, new product introduction costs and other
factors.

For fiscal 2000, research and development
expenses were $340 million or 11% of revenues, compared to $381
million or 10% of revenues for fiscal 1999. The decrease in
research and development expenses was due to a decrease in
terrestrial CDMA wireless consumer phone and infrastructure
product research and development as a result of exiting these
businesses, offset by increased integrated circuit product
initiatives and software development efforts and new 1xEV-DO
products.

For fiscal 2000, selling, general and
administrative expenses were $343 million or 11% of revenues,
compared to $425 million or 11% of revenues for fiscal 1999. The
dollar decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses
from fiscal 1999 was due to a decrease in marketing costs in
terrestrial CDMA wireless consumer phone products as a result of
the sale of the business in February 2000 and a decrease in



selling, general and administrative expenses for
terrestrial CDMA wireless infrastructure products as a result of
the sale of this business in May 1999, partially offset by
continued growth in personnel and associated overhead expenses
necessary to support other growing business operations, employer
payroll tax on employee non-qualified stock option exercises and
investor relations expenses.

Amortization of goodwill and other
acquisition-related intangible assets increased to $146 million
for fiscal 2000 compared to $1 million for fiscal 1999,
primarily due to the acquisition of SnapTrack in March 2000.

Purchased in-process technology of $60 million
for fiscal 2000 resulted from the acquisition of SnapTrack.
Purchased in-process technology was expensed upon acquisition
because technological feasibility had not been established and
no future alternative uses existed.

For fiscal 2000, asset impairment and related
charges were $46 million, compared to $143 million for fiscal
1999. Asset impairment and related charges during fiscal 2000
were comprised primarily of charges to reflect the estimated
difference between the carrying value of the net assets and the
consideration received from Kyocera related to the sale of the
terrestrial CDMA wireless consumer phone business, less costs to
sell. During fiscal 1999, asset impairment and related charges
were comprised primarily of $66 million in charges to reflect
the difference between the carrying value of the net assets to
be sold to Ericsson and the net consideration received and
various license and settlement agreements in connection
therewith and $77 million in charges to reduce the carrying
value of certain other assets related to our terrestrial CDMA
wireless infrastructure business.

For fiscal 2000, other operating expenses were
$32 million, compared to $97 million for fiscal 1999. Other
operating expenses during fiscal 2000 were comprised primarily
of employee termination costs related to the sale of the
terrestrial CDMA wireless consumer phone business to Kyocera.
Other operating expenses for fiscal 1999 were comprised
primarily of payroll and compensation benefits provided to
employees transferred to Ericsson related to the sale of our
terrestrial CDMA wireless infrastructure business.

Interest expense was $5 million for fiscal 2000,
compared to $15 million for fiscal 1999. The decrease was due to
decreased bank borrowings by QPE and the subsequent payoff and
cancellation of the QPE bank lines of credit in
February 2000.

Net investment income was $494 million for fiscal
2000 compared to $25 million for fiscal 1999. The increase was
primarily due to a $270 million realized gain on the sale of
marketable securities and a $195 million increase in income
related to interest earned on higher cash balances and interest
earned on finance receivables.

Distributions on Trust Convertible Preferred
Securities decreased to $13 million for fiscal 2000 compared to
$39 million for fiscal 1999 as a result of conversions of the
5 3/4% Trust Convertible Preferred Securities outstanding
into common stock. During the second quarter of fiscal 2000, all
remaining Trust Convertible Preferred Securities were converted
into common stock.

During fiscal 2000, we recorded $2 million in net
non-operating other charges, including $6 million in charges
relating to amounts advanced to Metrosvyaz, and the release of a
$4 million contingent liability due to a settlement. During
fiscal 1999, we recorded $69 million in non-operating charges,
including $37 million related to the Ericsson transaction and
$15 million related to the write-off of non-operating assets.

Income tax expense was $527 million for fiscal
2000 compared to $106 million for fiscal 1999. The annual
effective tax rate was 44% for fiscal 2000, compared to 35% for
fiscal 1999. The higher tax rate is primarily a result of
nondeductible charges for purchased in-process technology and
amortization of goodwill and higher pre-tax earnings relative to
tax deductions. We have provided a valuation allowance on our
net deferred tax assets because of uncertainty regarding their
realizability due to the expectation that deductions from future
employee stock option exercises and related deductions will
exceed future taxable income.



Our Segment Results for Fiscal 2001 Compared
to Fiscal 2000

CDMA Technologies Segment (QCT)

QCT segment revenues for fiscal 2001 were $1,365
million compared to $1,239 million fiscal 2000. Earnings before
taxes for fiscal 2001 were $306 million compared to $392 million
for fiscal 2000. Revenues increased due to higher unit shipments
and average selling prices of MSM integrated circuits and higher
shipments of CSM infrastructure integrated circuit voice
channels to wireless communications manufacturers. The decrease
in earnings before taxes was primarily due to increased research
and development, as well as increased general, administrative,
selling and marketing expenses. The increased research and
development is primarily associated with new integrated circuit
product and technology initiatives to support high-speed
wireless Internet access and multi-band, multimode,
multi-network, products including cdmaOne, CDMA2000 1X/1xEV-DO,
GSM/ GPRS, WCDMA and position location technologies, as well as
increased advertising expenses for these products. Approximately
58 million MSM integrated circuits were sold during fiscal 2001,
compared to approximately 52 million for fiscal 2000.
Approximately nine million CSM infrastructure integrated
circuits equivalent voice channels were sold during fiscal 2001,
compared to approximately two million for fiscal 2000.

Technology Licensing Segment (QTL)

QTL segment revenues for fiscal 2001 were $782
million compared to $705 million for fiscal 2000. Earnings
before taxes for fiscal 2001 were $717 million compared to $633
million for fiscal 2000. The increase in revenues and earnings
before taxes was primarily due to an increase in royalties
resulting from an increase in worldwide demand for products
based on CDMA technologies, offset by the impact of adopting SAB
101. Earnings before taxes included $11 million in other income
related to the irrevocable transfer of a portion of an FCC
Auction Discount Voucher to a third-party.

Wireless Systems Segment (QWS)

QWS segment revenues for fiscal 2001 were $408
million compared to $721 million for fiscal 2000. Earnings
before taxes for fiscal 2001 of $66 million compared to earnings
before taxes of $272 million for fiscal 2000. Revenues and
earnings decreased primarily due to significantly lower
shipments of Globalstar portable and fixed phones to service
providers and the decision to not recognize revenue on business
with Globalstar before cash is received, offset by an increase
in OmniTRACS messaging services revenue. We shipped
approximately 43,000 OmniTRACS and other related communications
systems during fiscal 2001, compared to approximately 56,000 in
fiscal 2000. The decrease in unit shipments is due to United
States economic conditions affecting the domestic long-haul
trucking industry. We shipped less than 100 Globalstar portable
and fixed phones in fiscal 2001 compared to 96,000 in fiscal
2000. The decrease in unit shipments is primarily due to the
pending restructuring of Globalstar and other uncertainties
related to the Globalstar business. Given the current reduced
level of business related to Globalstar, we have transferred a
number of our QWS staff into other parts of our business to meet
staffing needs.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

We anticipate that our cash and cash equivalents
and marketable securities balances of $2,581 million at
September 30, 2001, including interest to be earned
thereon, will be used to fund our working and other capital
requirements, including investments in other companies and other
assets to support the growth of our business, financing for
customers of CDMA infrastructure products in accordance with the
agreement with Ericsson, financing under agreements with CDMA
telecommunications carriers, and other commitments. In the event
additional needs for cash arise, we may raise additional funds
from a combination of sources including potential debt and
equity issuance. On July 24, 2001, we announced that we no
longer plan to spin-off our integrated circuits and system
software business. Although we are withdrawing the plan to
spin-off this business, we would reconsider if conflicts arise
that adversely affect our ability to operate each business in
the best interests of our stockholders.



In fiscal 2001, $691 million in cash was provided
by operating activities, compared to $791 million in cash
provided by operating activities in fiscal 2000. Cash provided
by operating activities in fiscal 2001 and fiscal 2000 includes
$1,051 million and $1,283 million, respectively, of net cash
flow provided by operations. In fiscal 2001, cash flow provided
by operations were offset by increases in finance receivables
and inventories and a reduction in trade accounts payable,
payroll, benefits and other liabilities, offset by a decrease in
accounts receivable and other assets and an increase in unearned
revenue. In fiscal 2000, cash flow provided by operations were
offset by an increase in finance receivables and decreases in
accounts payable and payroll, benefits and other liabilities,
offset by a decrease in accounts receivables. These changes for
fiscal year 2001 and 2000 totaled $360 million and $492 million,
respectively.

In fiscal 2001, $149 million in cash was used in
investing activities, primarily including $247 million for other
investments and acquisitions, $226 million for the issuance of
notes receivable, $84 million for the purchase of wireless
licenses, $114 million in capital expenditures and $205 million
in net purchases of available-for-sale securities, offset by
$672 million in net maturities of held-to-maturity securities,
$16 million on collection of notes receivables and $27 million
in proceeds from the sale of investments. We intend to continue
our strategic investment activities to promote the worldwide
adoption of CDMA products and the growth of CDMA-based wireless
data and wireless Internet products and solutions. As part of
these investment activities, we may provide financing to
facilitate the marketing and sale of CDMA equipment by
authorized suppliers. In addition to our commitments to the
Vesper Companies and Inquam, equity funding commitments related
to other strategic investments total $48 million at
September 30, 2001, which we intend to fund through fiscal
2009.

In fiscal 2001, our financing activities provided
$134 million, comprised primarily of the issuance of common
stock under our stock option and employee stock purchase plans.
In fiscal 2000, our financing activities provided $28 million,
including $144 million from the issuance of common stock under
our stock option and employee stock purchase plans, offset by
$112 million in net repayments under bank lines of credit.

At September 30, 2001, our remaining
commitments to extend long-term financing to certain CDMA
customers of Ericsson totaled approximately $531 million,
including $96 million for Pegaso. The commitment to fund $400
million of this amount expires on November 6, 2003. The
funding of the remaining $131 million, if it occurs, is not
subject to a fixed expiration date. The financing commitments
are subject to the CDMA customers meeting conditions prescribed
in the financing arrangements and, in certain cases, to Ericsson
also financing a portion of such sales and services. Such
financing is generally collateralized by the related equipment.
Commitments represent the maximum amounts to be financed under
these arrangements; actual financing may be in lesser amounts.

Under the terms of the senior credit facility
between us and Leap Wireless, we are committed to fund up to
$125 million until the earlier of settlement of the FCC’s
current auction of PCS spectrum or Leap Wireless’
withdrawal from the auction. At September 30, 2001, no cash
has been advanced to Leap Wireless, but $1 million in loan fees
and accrued interest are outstanding under the facility.

In addition to the financing commitments to Leap
Wireless and Ericsson, we had $4 million of letters of credit
and $12 million of other financial guarantees and commitments
outstanding as of September 30, 2001, none of which are
collateralized.

Future Accounting Requirements

In July 2001, the Financial Accounting
Standards Board (FASB) issued FASB Statements Nos. 141
and 142 (FAS 141 and FAS 142), “Business
Combinations” and “Goodwill and Other Intangible
Assets.” FAS 141 replaces APB 16 and eliminates
pooling-of-interests accounting prospectively. It also provides
guidance on purchase accounting related to the recognition of
intangible assets and accounting for negative goodwill.
FAS 142 changes the accounting for goodwill from an
amortization method to an impairment-only approach. Under
FAS 142, goodwill will be tested annually and whenever
events or circumstances occur indicating that goodwill might be
impaired. FAS 141 and FAS 142 are effective for all
business combinations completed after June 30, 2001. Upon
adoption of FAS 142, amortization of goodwill recorded for
business combinations consummated prior to July 1, 2001
will cease, and intangible assets acquired prior to July 1,



2001 that do not meet the criteria for
recognition under FAS 141 will be reclassified to goodwill.
Companies are required to adopt FAS 142 for fiscal years
beginning after December 15, 2001, but early adoption is
permitted. We will adopt FAS 142 on September 30,
2002, the beginning of fiscal 2003. In connection with the
adoption of FAS 142, we will be required to perform a
transitional goodwill impairment assessment. We have not yet
determined the impact these standards will have on our operating
results and financial position.

In August 2001, the FASB issued
FAS 144, “Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of
Long-Lived Assets.” FAS 144 replaces FAS 121,
“Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for
Long-Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of.” The FASB issued
FAS 144 to establish a single accounting model, based on
the framework established in FAS 121, as FAS 121 did
not address the accounting for a segment of a business accounted
for as a discontinued operation under APB 30,
“Reporting The Results of Operations — Reporting
The Effects of Disposal of a Segment of a Business, and
Extraordinary Unusual and Infrequently Occuring Events and
Transactions.” FAS 144 also resolves significant
implementation issues related to FAS 121. Companies are
required to adopt FAS 144 for fiscal years beginning after
December 15, 2001, but early adoption is permitted. We will
adopt FAS 144 as of the beginning of fiscal 2003. We have
not yet determined the impact this standard will have on our
operating results and financial position.

ITEM 7a.   QUANTITATIVE
AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURE ABOUT MARKET RISK

Interest Rate Market Risk.

We have fixed income securities
consisting of cash equivalents and investments in marketable
debt securities. Investments in marketable debt securities are
classified as available-for-sale and held-to-maturity. Interest
income earned on our short-term investment portfolio is affected
by changes in the general level of United States interest rates,
while interest income earned on long-term fixed income
investments is not affected in the near term. (See Note 2 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements for information about
investments in marketable debt securities.)

Finance receivables bear interest at both fixed
and variable rates (see Note 3 to the Consolidated
Financial Statements for information about finance receivables).
Interest earned on certain finance receivables is at variable
interest rates and is affected by changes in the general level
of United States interest rates and/or LIBOR. Fair values will
vary as interest rates change.

We have other notes receivable from third parties
included in other assets. These facilities bear interest at
variable rates. Interest earned on credit facilities included in
other assets is affected by changes in LIBOR, and fair value
will vary as interest rates change.



The following table provides information about
our financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in
interest rates. All financial instruments are held for purposes
other than trading. For our fixed income investment portfolio,
finance receivables and credit facilities in other assets, the
table presents principal cash flows and related weighted-average
yield at cost and contractual interest rates for fixed income
securities and finance receivables or other credit facilities,
respectively, by expected maturity dates. Additionally, we have
assumed that our fixed income securities are similar enough to
aggregate those securities for presentation purposes.

Maturity

Average Interest Rate

(Dollars in millions)

Equity Price Risk.

We hold available-for-sale securities
and derivative instruments subject to equity price risk.
Available-for-sale equity securities and derivative instruments
recorded at fair value under FAS 115 and FAS 133, respectively,
subject us to equity price risk. The fair values of
available-for-sale securities total $199 million and $426
million, respectively, at September 30, 2001 and at
September 24, 2000. The fair values of these securities are
based on the market prices of the securities. To the extent we
own a large number of securities relative to the trading volumes
of these securities, the market prices may be higher than the
prices we would realize if our shares were sold. The
available-for-sale securities are held for purposes other than
trading. As of September 30, 2001, two securities
constituted approximately 20% of the fair value of the
available-for-sale securities portfolio.

We received a warrant in connection with the Leap
Wireless spin-off to purchase Leap Wireless common stock at
$6.11 per share. At September 30, 2001, we are entitled to
purchase 3,375,000 shares of Leap Wireless common stock (see
Notes 1 and 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a
description of our accounting policy for this instrument and
further information). The recorded and fair values of the
warrant are $49 million and $250 million, respectively, at
September 30, 2001 and at September 24, 2000. The
estimated fair value of the warrant is directly correlated to
movements in the price of the Leap Wireless stock. The warrant
is held for purposes other than trading. During fiscal 2001, we
recorded $243 million in losses on derivative instruments,
offset by a $129 million accounting change, net of income taxes,
primarily related to this warrant.

We strategically invest in companies in the
high-technology industry, and typically do not attempt to reduce
or eliminate our market exposure on these securities. During
fiscal 2001, many high-technology stocks experienced a
significant decrease in value, negatively affecting the fair
value of our available-for-sale equity securities and derivative
instruments. Investment concentrations in specific companies and
industry segments may vary over time, and changes in
concentrations may affect the overall price volatility.



Our strategic investments in other entities
consist substantially of investments accounted for under the
equity and cost methods that are predominantly closely held and
not publicly traded. These investments are held for purposes
other than trading. Accordingly, we believe that our exposure to
market risk from these investments is not material.
Additionally, we do not anticipate any near-term changes in the
nature of our market risk exposures or in management’s
objectives and strategies with respect to managing such
exposures.

Foreign Exchange Market Risk.

See Note 1 to the Consolidated
Financial Statements for a description of our foreign currency
accounting policies and information about our currency exposure
management practices. We manage our exposure to foreign exchange
market risks, when deemed appropriate, through the use of
derivative financial instruments, consisting primarily of
forward contracts. Derivative financial instruments are viewed
as risk management tools and are not used for speculative or
trading purposes. At September 30, 2001 we had one foreign
currency forward contract outstanding; no such contracts were
outstanding at September 24, 2000. The amount of the
unrealized loss as of September 30, 2001 is not material.

Financial instruments held by consolidated
subsidiaries and equity method investees which are not
denominated in the functional currency of those entities are
subject to the effects of currency fluctuations, which may
affect reported earnings. As a global concern, we face exposure
to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates. At the
present time, we may hedge currency exposures associated with
certain assets and liabilities denominated in nonfunctional
currencies and certain anticipated nonfunctional currency
transactions. As a result, we could suffer unanticipated gains
or losses on anticipated foreign currency cash flows, as well as
economic loss with respect to the recoverability of investments.
While we may hedge certain transactions with non-United States
customers, declines in currency values in certain regions may,
if not reversed, adversely affect future product sales because
our products may become more expensive to purchase in the
countries of the affected currencies.

Finance receivables and notes receivable from
international carriers that do not use the United States dollar
as their functional currencies subject us to credit risk.
Because our financing is dollar denominated, any significant
change in the value of the dollar against the debtors’
functional currencies could result in an increase in the
debtor’s cash flow requirements and could thereby affect
our ability to collect our receivables. At September 30,
2001, finance receivables from international customers totaled
$735 million.

Our analysis methods used to assess and mitigate
risk discussed above should not be considered projections of
future risks.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of
QUALCOMM Incorporated

In our opinion, the consolidated financial
statements listed in the index appearing under
Item 14(a)(1) on page 48 present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position of QUALCOMM
Incorporated and its subsidiaries (the “Company”) at
September 30, 2001 and 2000, and the results of their
operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in
the period ended September 30, 2001 in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America. In addition, in our opinion, the financial statement
schedule listed in the index appearing under Item 14(a)(2)
on page 48 presents fairly, in all material respects, the
information set forth therein when read in conjunction with the
related consolidated financial statements. These financial
statements and financial statement schedule are the
responsibility of the Company’s management; our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
statements and financial statement schedule based on our audits.
We conducted our audits of these statements in accordance with
auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of
America, which require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, and evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable
basis for our opinion.

As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated
financial statements, the Company changed its method of
recognizing revenue and adopted Statement of Financial
Accounting Standard No. 133, “Accounting for
Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities,” during the
year ended September 30, 2001.

Note 1 — The Company and its
Significant Accounting Policies

The Company

QUALCOMM Incorporated (the Company or QUALCOMM),
a Delaware corporation, develops, designs, manufactures and
markets digital wireless telecommunications products and
services based on its Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA)
technology. The Company licenses and receives royalty payments
on its CDMA technology from major domestic and international
wireless telecommunications equipment suppliers.

The Company is also a leading developer and
supplier of CDMA-based integrated circuits and system software
for wireless voice and data communications and global
positioning system products. The Company offers a complete
system solution including software and integrated circuits for
wireless handsets and infrastructure equipment. This complete
system solution approach provides customers with advanced
wireless technology, enhanced component integration and
interoperability, and reduced time to market. The Company
provides integrated circuits and system software to many of the
world’s leading wireless handset and infrastructure
manufacturers.

The Company provides satellite and
terrestrial-based two-way data messaging and position reporting
services for transportation companies and private fleets. The
Company develops, designs, manufactures and distributes products
and provides services for OmniTRACS and TruckMAIL
(satellite-based mobile communications system), OmniExpress
(terrestrial CDMA-based system) and LINQ (terrestrial GSM-based
system) worldwide. Transportation companies and private fleets
use the Company’s products to communicate with drivers,
monitor vehicle location and provide customer service. The
Company also integrates the mobile data with operations
software, such as dispatch, payroll and accounting, so end-users
can manage their information and operations.

Principles of Consolidation

The Company’s consolidated financial
statements include the assets, liabilities and operating results
of majority-owned subsidiaries and other subsidiaries controlled
by the Company. The ownership of the other interest holders of
consolidated subsidiaries is reflected as minority interest. All
significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been
eliminated.

Financial Statement Preparation

The preparation of financial statements in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts and the disclosure
of contingent amounts in the Company’s financial statements
and the accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from
those estimates. Certain prior year amounts have been
reclassified to conform to the current year presentation.

Fiscal Year

The Company operates and reports using a
52–53 week fiscal year ending on the last Sunday in
September. As a result, the fiscal years ended
September 30, 2001, 2000, and 1999 include 53 weeks,
52 weeks, and 52 weeks, respectively. For presentation
purposes, the Company has indicated its fiscal years as ending
on September 30.

Revenues

In December 1999, the Securities and
Exchange Commission (SEC) issued Staff Accounting Bulletin
No. 101 (SAB 101), “Revenue Recognition in
Financial Statements.” The SEC staff subsequently amended

F-7


QUALCOMM INCORPORATED

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS

SAB 101 to provide registrants with
additional time to implement the standard. The Company adopted
SAB 101 in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2001, applied
retroactively to the first quarter of fiscal 2001.

Prior to the adoption of SAB 101, the
Company generally recorded revenue from non-refundable license
fees on the effective date of the applicable license agreement.
After the adoption of SAB 101, license fees are recognized
ratably over the estimated period of future benefit to the
licensee. Royalty revenue continues to be recorded as earned
when reasonable estimates of such amounts can be made.

Prior to the adoption of SAB 101, the
Company recorded revenue from hardware product sales at the time
of shipment, or when title and risk of loss passed to the
customer, if later. After adoption of SAB 101, revenue and
expense from certain hardware product sales contracted with a
continuing service obligation that is essential to the
functionality of the hardware are recognized ratably over the
shorter of the estimated life of the hardware product or the
expected service period. Revenue from hardware product sales
without such a continuing service obligation is recorded when
risk of loss and title pass to the customer. Messaging revenue
continues to be recorded as earned.

The effect of the adoption of SAB 101 on the
Company’s quarterly results of operations for fiscal 2001,
when applied retroactively, and the pro forma effect on the
results of operations for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2000 are
presented in the summarized quarterly data note (Note 18).
The unaudited pro forma effect of the adoption of SAB 101
on the Company’s fiscal 2000 and 1999 results of
operations, assuming SAB 101 had been adopted in those years,
are as follows (in thousands, except per share data):

The Company recorded a $147 million loss,
net of taxes of $98 million, as the cumulative effect of
the accounting change as of the beginning of fiscal 2001 to
reflect the deferral of revenue and expenses related to future
periods. For fiscal 2001, the Company recognized
$95 million in net income before income taxes and
accounting change related to revenue and expense that was
recognized in prior years.

Revenue from providing services is recorded when
earned. Revenue from long-term contracts is generally recognized
using the percentage-of-completion method, based on costs
incurred compared with total estimated costs. Billings on
uncompleted contracts in excess of incurred cost and accrued
profits are classified as unearned revenue. Estimated contract
losses are recognized when determined. If substantive
uncertainty related to customer acceptance exists or the
contract’s duration is less than three months, the Company
uses the completed-contract method.

The Company recognizes software license revenue
when all of the following criteria are met: execution of a
written agreement; delivery of software; the license fee is
fixed and determinable; collectibility of the proceeds is
probable; and vendor-specific objective evidence exists to
allocate the total fee to elements of multiple-element
arrangements, including post contract customer support.
Vendor-specific objective evidence is based on the price charged
when an element is sold separately, or if not yet sold
separately, the price established by authorized management or a
substantive renewal rate for post-contract customer support. If
the Company does not have sufficient evidence of the fair value
of undelivered elements, revenue is recognized ratably over the
support period when the undelivered element is post-contract
customer support.

Unearned revenue consists primarily of fees
related to software products and other intellectual property for
which delivery is not yet complete and to hardware products
sales contracted with a continuing service obligation.

STATEMENTS

Research and Development

Costs incurred in research and development are
expensed as incurred.

Shipping and Handling Costs

Costs incurred for shipping and handling costs
are included in cost of revenues when incurred. Amounts billed
to a customer for shipping and handling are reported as revenue.

Concentrations

A significant portion of the Company’s
revenues are concentrated with a limited number of customers as
the worldwide market for wireless telephone systems and products
is dominated by a small number of large corporations and
government agencies. During fiscal 2001, sales to two South
Korean customers and one Japanese customer by the QCT, QTL and
other nonreportable segments (Note 12) comprised 37% of
consolidated revenues. During fiscal 2000 and 1999, sales to one
South Korean customer by the QCT and QTL segments comprised 11%
and 9% of consolidated revenues, respectively. During fiscal
2001, 2000 and 1999, revenues from Globalstar (Note 4)
accounted for 1%, 7% and 11% of consolidated revenues,
respectively. At September 30, 2001, accounts receivable
from two South Korean customers comprised 25% of net receivables.

Revenues from international customers were
approximately 65%, 47% and 38% of total revenues in fiscal 2001,
2000 and 1999, respectively.

Cash Equivalents

The Company considers all highly liquid
investments with original maturities of three months or less to
be cash equivalents. Cash equivalents are comprised of money
market funds, certificates of deposit, commercial paper, loan
participations, medium-term notes, United States treasuries and
government agencies’ securities. The carrying amounts
approximate fair value due to the short maturities of these
instruments.

The Company’s policy is to place its cash,
cash equivalents and investments with high quality financial
institutions, government agencies and corporate entities to
limit the amount of credit exposure.

Marketable Securities

Management determines the appropriate
classification of marketable securities at the time of purchase
and reevaluates such designation as of each balance sheet date.
Held-to-maturity securities are carried at amortized cost, which
approximates fair value. Available-for-sale securities are
stated at fair value as determined by the most recently traded
price of each security at the balance sheet date. The net
unrealized gains or losses on available-for-sale securities are
reported as a component of comprehensive income (loss), net of
tax, unless the Company provides a valuation allowance against
the tax benefit resulting from the loss. The specific
identification method is used to compute the realized gains and
losses on debt and equity securities.

The Company regularly monitors and evaluates the
realizable value of its marketable securities. If events and
circumstances indicate that a decline in the value of these
assets has occurred and is other than temporary, the Company
records a charge to investment (expense) income.

Inventories

Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or
market using the first-in, first-out method.

Property, Plant and Equipment

Property, plant and equipment are recorded at
cost and depreciated or amortized using the straight-line method
over their estimated useful lives. Buildings and building
improvements are depreciated over thirty years and fifteen
years, respectively. Leasehold improvements are amortized over
the shorter of their estimated useful lives or the remaining
term of the related lease. Direct external and internal costs of
developing software for internal use are capitalized subsequent
to the preliminary stage of development. Other property, plant
and equipment have useful lives ranging from two to five years.
Maintenance, repairs, and minor renewals and betterments are
charged to expense.

Upon the retirement or disposition of property,
plant and equipment, the related cost and accumulated
depreciation or amortization are removed and the gain or loss is
recorded.

Other Investments

Investments in Other
Entities

The Company makes strategic investments in
companies that have developed or are developing innovative
wireless data applications and wireless carriers that promote
the worldwide deployment of CDMA systems. Investments in
corporate entities with less than a 20% voting interest are
generally accounted for under the cost method. The Company uses
the equity method to account for investments in corporate
entities in which it has a voting interest of 20% to 50% and
other than minor to 50% ownership interests in partnerships and
limited liability corporations, or in which it otherwise has the
ability to exercise significant influence. Under the equity
method, the investment is originally recorded at cost and
adjusted to recognize the Company’s share of net earnings
or losses of the investee, limited to the extent of the
Company’s investment in, advances to and financial
guarantees that create additional basis in the investee.

The Company regularly monitors and evaluates the
realizable value of its investments. If events and circumstances
indicate that a decline in the value of these assets has
occurred and is other than temporary, the Company records a
charge to investment income (expense).

Derivatives

The Company adopted Statement of Financial
Accounting Standard No. 133 (FAS 133), “Accounting for
Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities,” as of the
beginning of fiscal 2001. FAS 133 requires certain derivative
instruments to be recorded at fair value. Derivative instruments
held by the Company are comprised of warrants and other rights
to purchase equity interests in certain other companies related
to strategic investment and financing activities. The Company
recorded a $129 million gain, net of taxes of $87 million, as
the cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle as
of the beginning of fiscal 2001. The cumulative effect of the
accounting change related primarily to the recognition of the
unrealized gain on a warrant to purchase 4,500,000 shares of
Leap Wireless International, Inc. (Leap Wireless) common stock
issued to the Company in connection with its spin-off of Leap
Wireless in September 1998 (Note 15).

Warrants

The Company holds warrants to purchase equity
interests in certain other companies related to its strategic
investment activities. The Company’s warrants are not held
for trading purposes.

Prior to the adoption of FAS 133, warrants to
purchase equity interests in publicly-traded companies that
could not be net settled were stated at fair value and
classified as available-for-sale or held-to-maturity,

F-10


QUALCOMM INCORPORATED

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS

consistent with the expected classification of
the underlying equity securities. Changes in fair value were
recorded as a component of comprehensive income (loss). All
other warrants were carried at cost.

After the adoption of FAS 133, the Company’s
warrants to purchase equity interest in certain publicly-traded
companies continue to be recorded at fair value. Changes in fair
value are recorded in investment (expense) income, as a
change in unrealized gain on derivative instruments because the
warrants do not meet the requirements for hedge accounting.
Realized derivative gains and losses are reclassified from the
change in unrealized gains on derivative instruments to net
realized gains (losses) on marketable securities upon the
sale of the underlying equity investment. During fiscal 2001,
$18 million of unrealized derivative gains were reclassified to
realized gains (losses) on the sale of marketable
securities. Warrants in privately-held companies are carried at
cost as those warrants are excluded from the scope of
FAS 133.

At September 30, 2001 and 2000, the
Company’s warrant balances were included in other assets
and none of the Company’s warrants were designated as
hedges.

Forward
 Contracts

The Company enters into foreign currency forward
contracts to hedge certain foreign currency transactions and
probable anticipated foreign currency transactions. Prior to the
adoption of FAS 133, gains and losses arising from foreign
currency forward contracts offset gains and losses resulting
from the underlying hedged transaction.

After the adoption of FAS 133, unrealized gains
and losses arising from foreign currency forward contracts are
reported in investment (expense) income as a change in
unrealized gain on derivative instruments because the forward
contracts are not designated as hedging instruments. Upon
settlement of the foreign currency forward contracts, the
unrealized gains and losses are reclassified to realized gains
on derivative instruments. The Company did not have any foreign
currency forward contracts designated as a hedging instrument
during fiscal 2001.

The Company had one foreign currency forward
contract outstanding as of September 30, 2001; no such
contracts were outstanding as of September 30, 2000. The
amount of the unrealized loss as of September 30, 2001 was
not material.

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

Goodwill represents the excess of purchase price
and related costs over the value assigned to the net tangible
and identifiable intangible assets of businesses acquired.
Goodwill is amortized on a straight-line basis over its useful
life, ranging from three to four years. Other intangible assets
are amortized on a straight-line basis over their useful lives,
ranging from three to twenty years. Software development costs
are capitalized when a product’s technological feasibility
has been established through the date a product is available for
general release to customers.

Long-Lived and Intangible Assets

The Company assesses potential impairments to its
long-lived assets and intangible assets when there is evidence
that events or changes in circumstances indicate that the
carrying amount of an asset may not be recovered. An impairment
loss is recognized when the undiscounted cash flows expected to
be generated by an asset (or group of assets) is less than its
carrying amount. Any required impairment loss is measured as the
amount by which the asset’s carrying value exceeds its fair
value, and is recorded as a reduction in the carrying value of
the related asset and a charge to operating results.

F-11

STATEMENTS

Warranty

Estimated future warranty obligations related to
certain products are provided by charges to operations in the
period in which the related revenue is recognized.

Stock-Based Compensation

The Company measures compensation expense for its
stock-based employee compensation using the intrinsic value
method and provides pro forma disclosures of net income and net
earnings per common share as if the fair value method had been
applied in measuring compensation expense.

Equity instruments issued to non-employees for
goods or services are accounted for at fair value and are marked
to market until service is complete or a performance commitment
date is reached.

Foreign Currency

Foreign subsidiaries operating in a local
currency environment use the local currency as the functional
currency. Assets and liabilities are translated to United States
dollars at year-end exchange rates; revenues, expenses, gains
and losses are translated at rates of exchange that approximate
the rates in effect at the transaction date. Resulting
remeasurement gains or losses are recognized as a component of
other comprehensive income. During fiscal 1999, a significant
devaluation of the Brazilian real resulted in a $25 million
translation loss that was recorded as a component of other
comprehensive income. The functional currency of the
Company’s foreign investees that do not use local
currencies is the United States dollar. Where the United States
dollar is the functional currency, the monetary assets and
liabilities are translated into United States dollars at the
exchange rate in effect at the balance sheet date. Revenues,
expenses, gains and losses associated with the monetary assets
and liabilities are translated at the rates of exchange that
approximate the rates in effect at the transaction date.
Non-monetary assets and liabilities and related elements of
expense, gains and losses are translated at historical rates.
Resulting remeasurement gains or losses of these foreign
investees are recognized in the statement of income.

During fiscal 2001, 2000 and 1999, net foreign
currency transaction gains and losses included in the
Company’s statements of operations were not material.

Income Taxes

Current income tax expense is the amount of
income taxes expected to be payable for the current year, prior
to the recognition of benefits from stock option deductions. The
asset and liability approach is used to recognize deferred tax
assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences
of temporary differences between the carrying amounts and the
tax bases of assets and liabilities. Valuation allowances are
established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the
amount expected to more likely than not be realized in future
tax returns. Tax law and rate changes are reflected in income in
the period such changes are enacted.

Comprehensive Income

Comprehensive income (loss) is defined as
the change in equity of a business enterprise during a period
from transactions and other events and circumstances from
non-owner sources, including foreign currency translation
adjustments and unrealized gains and losses on marketable
securities. The Company presents other comprehensive income
(loss) in its consolidated statements of stockholders’
equity.

The reclassification adjustment for
other-than-temporary losses on marketable securities results
from the recognition of unrealized losses in the statement of
operations resulting from declines in the market prices of those
securities deemed to be other-than-temporary. The
reclassification adjustment for net realized losses
(gains) results from the recognition of the net realized
losses or gains in the statement of operations when the
marketable securities are sold. The reclassification adjustment
for losses included in the accounting change

F-12


QUALCOMM INCORPORATED

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS

results from the recognition of unrealized losses
attributable to derivative instruments as of the beginning of
fiscal 2001 in the statement of operations as a result of the
implementation of FAS 133. Unrealized losses on certain
derivative instruments subject to FAS 133 were previously
recorded as a component of other comprehensive income (loss).

Components of accumulated other comprehensive
loss consisted of the following (in thousands):

Stock Splits

On April 14, 1999, the Company’s Board
of Directors declared a two-for-one stock split of the
Company’s common stock in the form of a stock dividend. The
stock dividend was distributed on May 10, 1999 to
stockholders of record on April 21, 1999. On
November 2, 1999, the Company’s Board of Directors
declared a four-for-one stock split of the Company’s common
stock and an increase in the number of authorized shares of
common stock to three billion shares. The stock was distributed
on December 30, 1999 to stockholders of record on
December 20, 1999. All references to per share amounts have
been restated to reflect these stock splits.

Net Earnings Per Common Share

Basic earnings per common share are calculated by
dividing net income by the weighted average number of common
shares outstanding during the reporting period. Diluted earnings
per common share (diluted EPS) reflect the potential dilutive
effect, calculated using the treasury stock method, of
additional common shares that are issuable upon exercise of
outstanding stock options and warrants and the potential
dilutive effect for the period prior to conversion of shares
issuable upon conversion of Trust Convertible Preferred
Securities, determined on an if-converted basis, as follows (in
thousands):

The diluted share base for fiscal 2001 excluded
the potential dilutive effect of 51,188,000 incremental shares
related to outstanding stock options, calculated using the
treasury stock method, due to their anti-dilutive effect as a
result of the Company’s loss before accounting change.

Options outstanding during the years ended
September 30, 2001, 2000 and 1999 to purchase approximately
14,427,000, 2,625,000, and 13,494,000 shares of common
stock, respectively, were not included in the computation of
diluted EPS because the options’ exercise prices were
greater than the average market prices of the common stock
during the period and, therefore, the effect would be
anti-dilutive. Net income in the computation of diluted EPS for
fiscal 2000 was increased by $7 million, representing the
assumed savings of distributions, net of taxes, on the Trust
Convertible Preferred Securities. The additional common shares
assuming the conversion of the Trust Convertible Preferred
Securities (Note 7) were not included for purposes of
computing diluted EPS for fiscal 1999 because the effect would
have been anti-dilutive.

Future Accounting Requirements

In July 2001, the Financial Accounting
Standards Board (FASB) issued FASB Statements Nos. 141 and
142 (FAS 141 and FAS 142), “Business
Combinations” and “Goodwill and Other Intangible
Assets.” FAS 141 replaces APB 16 and eliminates
pooling-of-interests accounting prospectively. It also provides
guidance on purchase accounting related to the recognition of
intangible assets and accounting for negative goodwill.
FAS 142 changes the accounting for goodwill from an
amortization method to an impairment-only approach. Under
FAS 142, goodwill will be tested annually and whenever
events or circumstances occur indicating that goodwill might be
impaired. FAS 141 and FAS 142 are effective for all
business combinations completed after June 30, 2001. Upon
adoption of FAS 142, amortization of goodwill recorded for
business combinations consummated prior to July 1, 2001
will cease, and intangible assets acquired prior to July 1,
2001 that do not meet the criteria for recognition under
FAS 141 will be reclassified to goodwill. Companies are
required to adopt FAS 142 for fiscal years beginning after
December 15, 2001, but early adoption is permitted. The
Company will adopt FAS 142 as of the beginning of fiscal
2003. In connection with the adoption of FAS 142, the
Company will be required to perform a transitional goodwill
impairment assessment. The Company has not yet determined the
impact these standards will have on its operating results and
financial position.

In August 2001, the FASB issued
FAS 144, “Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of
Long-Lived Assets.” FAS 144 replaces FAS 121,
“Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for
Long-Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of.” The FASB issued
FAS 144 to establish a single accounting model, based on
the framework established in FAS 121, as FAS 121 did
not address the accounting for a segment of a business accounted
for as a discontinued operation under APB 30,
“Reporting The Results of
Operations — Reporting The Effects of Disposal of
a Segment of a Business, and Extraordinary Unusual and
Infrequently Occurring Events and Transactions.”
FAS 144 also resolves significant implementation issues
related to FAS 121. Companies are required to adopt
FAS 144 for fiscal years beginning after December 15,
2001, but early adoption is permitted. The Company will adopt
FAS 144 as of the beginning of fiscal 2003. The Company has
not yet determined the impact this standard will have on its
operating results and financial position.

In April 2000, the Company purchased
approximately 11,500,000 shares of the common stock of NetZero,
Inc. (NetZero), representing a 9.9% interest, for
$144 million in cash. NetZero was a publicly-traded company
that provided Internet access and services to consumers and
on-line direct marketing services to advertisers. Effective
September 26, 2001, NetZero and Juno Online Services, Inc.
completed a merger and became United Online, Inc. (United
Online). The Company received 2,300,000 shares of United Online
for its 11,500,000 shares of NetZero, representing an
approximate 5.7% interest in United Online. During fiscal 2001,
the Company recorded an other-than-temporary impairment charge
of $134 million in investment (expense) income related
to this investment. The fair value of the United Online
investment was $5 million at September 30, 2001.

In February 2000, the Company purchased
308,000 units of Leap Wireless’ senior discount notes with
detachable warrants for $150 million. The notes mature in
April 2010 and bear interest at 14.5%. The warrants entitle
each holder to purchase 2.503 common shares per each senior
discount note unit held. The exercise price is $96.80 per common
share. Upon the adoption of FAS 133, the Company bifurcated
the warrants from the senior discount notes and accounted for
the warrants separately. The resulting adjustment was recorded
as an accounting change, net of tax, and subsequent changes in
fair value of the warrants were recorded in investment
(expense) income. The fair values of the senior discount
notes and the warrants were $77 million and
$10 million, respectively, at September 30, 2001.

In November 1999, the Company purchased
2,565,000 common shares of Korea Telecom Freetel Co., Ltd.
(KTFreeTel), representing a 1.9% interest, for $110 million and
an $86 million zero coupon bond with warrants to purchase
approximately 1,851,000 additional shares. If KTFreeTel meets
certain obligations related to the commercial deployment of
1xEV-DO technology, the Company will be required to exercise the
warrants. The exercise price of the warrants is expected to be
paid by tendering the bond as payment in full. If KTFreeTel does
not meet such obligations, the Company will have the right to
redeem the bond at face value plus a premium equal to 10% per
year. Upon the adoption of FAS 133, the Company bifurcated
the warrants from the zero coupon bond and accounted for the
warrants separately. The resulting adjustment was recorded as an
accounting change, net of tax, and subsequent changes in fair
value of the warrants were recorded in investment
(expense) income. The Company used the cost method to
account for 1,924,000 of the common shares and approximately
1,388,000 shares under warrant through June 1, 2001 as
those shares were restricted. Subsequent to that date, the
Company used the fair value method to account for all of the
common shares and the warrants, recording changes in fair value
as a component of comprehensive loss, net of tax, and investment
(expense) income, respectively. The combined fair value of the
common shares and bond with warrants was $95 million at
September 30, 2001.

Unbilled receivables represent costs and profits
recorded in excess of amounts billable pursuant to contract
provisions and are expected to be realized within one year.

Finance Receivables

Finance receivables result from arrangements in
which the Company has agreed to provide its customers or certain
CDMA customers of Telefonaktiebolaget LM Ericsson
(Ericsson) (Note 14) with long-term interest bearing debt
financing for the purchase of equipment and/or services. Finance
receivables were comprised as follows:

At September 30, 2001 and 2000, the fair
value of finance receivables approximated $744 million and
$826 million, respectively. The fair value of finance
receivables is estimated by discounting the future cash flows
using current interest rates at which similar financing would be
provided to similar customers for the same remaining maturities.

Maturities of finance receivables at
September 30, 2001 were as follows (in thousands):

Maturities after 2006 include finance receivables
which have been fully reserved or which the Company has not or
does not expect to receive payments in accordance with the
scheduled maturities.

At September 30, 2001, remaining commitments
to extend long-term financing by the Company to certain CDMA
customers of Ericsson (Note 14) totaled approximately
$531 million. The commitment to fund $400 million of
this amount expires on November 6, 2003. The funding of the
remaining $131 million, if it occurs, is not subject to a
fixed expiration date. The financing commitments are subject to
the CDMA customers meeting conditions prescribed in the
financing arrangements and, in certain cases, to Ericsson also
financing a portion of such sales and services. Such financing
is generally collateralized by the related equipment.
Commitments represent the maximum amounts to be financed under
these arrangements; actual financing may be in lesser amounts.

Megatel Holdings, S.A., respectively. The Vesper
Companies were formed by a consortium of investors to provide
wireless and wireline telephone services in the northern region
and in the Sao Paulo state of Brazil. The Company
subsequently participated in additional financing rounds
completed by the Vesper Companies, thereby increasing the
Company’s initial equity investment. In addition, the
Company extended long-term financing to the Vesper Companies
related to the Company’s financing arrangement with
Ericsson (Note 3). At September 30, 2001, the
Company’s cumulative cash investment, including long-term
financing, in the Vesper Companies totaled approximately $241
million. In January 2000, the Company acquired an
approximate 2.5% interest in VeloCom, Inc. (VeloCom), an
investor in the Vesper Companies, for $15 million. In
December 2000, the Company executed a Term Loan Agreement
with VeloCom in which the Company agreed to provide $230 million
of convertible debt financing, including $30 million for
capitalized interest. The debt facility has a three-year term
and bears interest at 18%. The Company funded approximately $172
million under this facility through September 30, 2001.

As a result of a reorganization of the Vesper
Companies initiated during fiscal 2001, the Company reassessed
the recoverability of its assets related to the Vesper Companies
and VeloCom and recorded $32 million in asset impairments and
related charges, $90 million in investment (expense) income and
$120 million in other non-operating charges. At
September 30, 2001, the Company had approximately $124
million in remaining net assets, primarily consisting of finance
receivables and notes receivable, net of allowances of $174
million, related to the Vesper Companies and VeloCom. The
Company has not recognized interest income since the impairment
and will evaluate whether to recognize interest income
subsequent to the reorganization. The Vesper Companies are
working to accomplish the terms of their restructuring with
owners, vendors and creditors, which is expected to be completed
in the first quarter of fiscal 2002. The proposed transaction is
contingent on several factors, and there is a risk it will not
close. If the transaction closes, the Company expects to acquire
an additional interest in the Vesper Companies for $266 million
in equity commitments. The Company also expects to convert its
Term Loan Agreement with VeloCom into an additional equity
interest in VeloCom. After the close, the Company expects to
hold a 49.9% interest in VeloCom, and direct and indirect
interests in the Vesper Companies of 74% and 86%, respectively.
The Company will consolidate the results of the Vesper Companies
if the proposed transaction closes in fiscal 2002. The Vesper
Companies expect to incur increasing operating losses and
negative cash flows from operations as they expand operations
and enter new markets, even if and after they achieve positive
cash flows from operations in the initial operating markets. The
Company may incur significant losses in the future related to
its proposed ownership of the Vesper Companies, and the Vesper
Companies may never operate profitably.

Globalstar L.P.

The Company has contracts with Globalstar L.P.
(Globalstar) to design, develop and manufacture subscriber
products and ground communications systems utilizing CDMA
technology and to provide contract development services.
Globalstar was formed to design, construct, and operate a
worldwide, low-Earth-orbit satellite-based telecommunications
system (the Globalstar System).

Through partnership interests held in certain
intermediate limited partnerships and other indirect interests,
the Company owns an approximate 6.3% interest in Globalstar, a
limited partnership formed to develop, own and operate the
Globalstar System. The Company accounts for its investment under
the equity method. As a result of the intermediate limited
partnership agreements, Globalstar profits and losses are
allocated to the Company in accordance with its percentage
ownership interest, provided that no loss shall be allocated to
the Company if such allocation would create negative balances in
the Company’s intermediate partnership adjusted capital
accounts. For financial reporting purposes, the Company’s
investment in the intermediate partnerships had no basis during
each of fiscal 2001, 2000 and 1999, and, as a result, the
Company has not recorded any equity losses during those
respective fiscal years.

QUALCOMM INCORPORATED

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS

On June 30, 2000, Globalstar defaulted on a
$250 million bank facility that QUALCOMM partially guaranteed in
1996. As a result of this default, QUALCOMM’s guaranty was
called, and QUALCOMM paid $22 million to the subject banks in
full satisfaction of this guaranty plus interest. Pursuant to an
agreement entered into in 1996, with respect to the original
provision of this guaranty, QUALCOMM accepted a subordinated
promissory note issued by Globalstar with a principal amount
equal to the amount QUALCOMM paid under its guaranty (the
Globalstar Promissory Note). The Globalstar Promissory Note
bears interest at LIBOR plus 3%, and principal and interest are
due and payable in full on June 30, 2003.

The Company continues to provide services and
sell products under a number of development and production
contracts involving the Globalstar System. Starting in the first
quarter of fiscal 2001, the Company decided to not recognize
revenue on business with Globalstar before cash is received.
Revenues resulting from the agreements with Globalstar for
fiscal 2001, 2000 and 1999 were $35 million, $219 million and
$435 million, respectively.

On January 16, 2001, Globalstar announced
that, in order to have sufficient funds available for the
continued progress of its marketing and service activities, it
had suspended indefinitely principal and interest payments on
all of its debt, including its vendor financing obligations. As
a result, Globalstar did not make an approximate $22 million
payment for principal and interest due to QUALCOMM on
January 15, 2001. Globalstar also announced the retention
of a financial adviser to assist in developing future
initiatives, including restructuring Globalstar’s debt,
identifying funding opportunities and pursuing other strategic
alternatives. Efforts, by Globalstar, to restructure its debt
are on-going, and work on a final plan is expected to continue.
However, Globalstar’s restructuring has not progressed as
the Company had anticipated. Based on the current status of
Globalstar’s restructuring efforts, the Company believes it
will not receive any of the contractual amounts due. As a
result, the Company recorded $44 million in net charges to
establish reserves against remaining Globalstar-related assets
in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2001. During fiscal 2001, the
Company recorded total net charges of $49 million in cost of
revenues, $519 million in asset impairment and related charges,
$10 million in investment expense and $58 million in other
non-operating charges related primarily to the impairment of
certain assets. Valuation allowances have been established
against the entire finance and note receivables balances
totaling $602 million, and the Company does not anticipate
recognition of any interest income in the future.

Inquam Limited

In October 2000, the Company agreed to invest
$200 million in the convertible preferred shares of Inquam
Limited (Inquam). Inquam was formed to acquire, own, develop and
manage wireless communications systems, either directly or
indirectly, with the primary intent of deploying CDMA-based
technology. In addition, QUALCOMM advanced $10 million under a
promissory note, bearing interest at 10%, that matures on
January 31, 2002. At September 30, 2001, $144 million
of the equity funding commitment was outstanding. The Company
expects to fund the remaining commitment through June 2002.

Wingcast, LLC

In July 2000, Ford Motor Company and QUALCOMM
created a new company, Wingcast, LLC (Wingcast), to develop and
deliver wireless mobility services into cars and trucks.
QUALCOMM committed to contribute $125 million to the initial
capital of Wingcast, including up to $75 million in cash and $50
million in non-cash consideration. QUALCOMM may be further
committed to fund an additional $75 million in cash upon vehicle
manufacturers committing to enable certain volumes of vehicles
to use Wingcast’s services. QUALCOMM holds a 15% interest
in Wingcast. At September 30, 2001, $50 million of the
initial $75 million cash commitment was outstanding and remained
subject to certain conditions, and Wingcast had not met the
performance milestones related to the additional $75 million
cash commitment. Performance milestones must be completed by
April 2003 or before Wingcast’s initial public

QUALCOMM Personal Electronics

In fiscal 1994, a subsidiary of the Company and a
subsidiary of Sony Electronics Inc. (Sony Electronics) entered
into a general partnership, QUALCOMM Personal Electronics (QPE),
to manufacture CDMA consumer equipment for cellular, PCS and
other wireless applications. The Company owns 51% of the venture
and consolidates QPE in its financial statements. Sony
Electronics’ 49% general partnership share in QPE is
presented as a minority interest in the Company’s financial
statements. In February 2000, the Company sold its
terrestrial-based CDMA wireless consumer phone business (Note
14). As a result, QPE has no on-going operations.

During fiscal 2001, QPE distributed certain
assets to its owners based on their pro-rata ownership
interests. Sony Electronics’ share of the distribution
reimbursed the Company for cash advanced to and the forgiveness
of receivables from Sony Electronics in February 2000 related to
the sale of the Company’s terrestrial-based CDMA wireless
consumer phone business (Note 14). The distribution by QPE
reduced the minority interest liability to Sony Electronics and
a related receivable included in other current assets by $40
million.

During fiscal 2000 and 1999, QPE sales to Sony
Electronics amounted to $6 million and $249 million,
respectively. Purchases of inventory and capital equipment from
Sony Electronics and other Sony affiliates during fiscal 2000
and 1999 amounted to $3 million and $80 million, respectively.
At September 30, 2001 and 2000, outstanding accounts
receivable from Sony Electronics amounted to none and $2
million, respectively. The $2 million receivable at September
30, 2000 was the result of on-going business unrelated to QPE.
At September 30, 1999, accounts payable to all Sony
Electronics affiliated companies amounted to $14 million.

NextWave Telecom Inc.

In November 1995, the Company purchased
1,666,666 shares of Series B common stock in
Next

Wave

Telecom Inc. (Next

Wave

), a privately-held
company, for $5 million. As part of the share purchase, the
Company received warrants to buy 1,111,111 additional shares of
Series B common stock at $3 per share. During
March 1996, the Company converted a $15 million note
receivable into 5,000,000 shares of Series B common stock.
In June 1998, the Company recorded a $20 million impairment
charge related to the Company’s investment in
Next

Wave

. Subsidiaries of Next

Wave

filed for
bankruptcy protection in June 1998 under Chapter 11 of
the United States Bankruptcy Code. Next

Wave

itself filed
for bankruptcy protection in December 1998 under
Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code.

In August 2001, Next

Wave

filed a plan of
reorganization with the United States Bankruptcy Court which
requires total financing of approximately $5 billion to
build-out an advanced 3G wireless network. The plan provides for
payment of all valid claims against Next

Wave,

including
the claim of the FCC for the PCS licenses it granted to
Next

Wave

in 1997, plus interest as applicable. The plan
also provides that Next

Wave

’s debt for its C-block
and F-block PCS licenses would be reinstated, with the
government receiving all amounts due up to this point, in full,
with the remaining balance to be paid in installments. Under
this plan, Next

Wave

indicated that it expects to
construct wireless networks in 95 markets utilizing CDMA2000
1xEV-DO technology.

During fiscal 2001, the Company sold 150,000
shares of Next

Wave

series B common stock and
recorded a realized gain of $1 million. At September 30,
2001, the Company owned 6,516,666 shares of Series B common
stock and held warrants to purchase 1,111,111 shares of
Series B common stock for $3 per share. The Company also
held a $0.4 million promissory note convertible into 1,019,444
shares of Series C common stock.

In August 2001, the Company committed to
purchase 2,000,000 shares of Series A preferred stock in
the reorganized Next

Wave

for $300 million. The
Company’s investment was subject to approval by the United
States Bankruptcy Court, successful consummation of

satisfactory resolution of all disputes involving
Next

Wave’s

PCS licenses and other conditions.
Furthermore, the Company’s obligation to make this
investment was subject to approval by the Bankruptcy Court on or
before October 31, 2001 of the terms and conditions of the
Company’s investment, as well as a certain Technology
Cooperation Agreement dated as of August 15, 2001, as
amended, between Next

Wave

and QUALCOMM. Next

Wave

also was entitled to terminate the investment commitment if a
certain break-up fee contained in the subject Subscription
Agreement was not approved by the Bankruptcy Court on or before
October 31, 2001. The approvals required by
October 31, 2001 have not been obtained, and the Company is
entitled to terminate its investment agreement with
Next

Wave.

The Company’s $300 million commitment is
dependent on Next

Wave

pursuing the plan of reorganization
filed in August, 2001. Accordingly, if Next

Wave

abandons
the plan filed in August, 2001 and proceeds with a new plan,
then the Company will not be obligated to make the investment.
As a result of the uncertainty surrounding
Next

Wave’s

financing plans, the terms of a
settlement with the FCC and other factors, there is significant
uncertainty as to whether the Company will have the opportunity
to make its planned investment in a reorganized Next

Wave.

Other

Other strategic investments as of
September 30, 2001 and 2000, amounted to $184 million and
$148 million, respectively. At September 30, 2001,
effective ownership interests in the investees ranged from 1% to
50%.

Funding commitments related to these investments
totaled $48 million at September 30, 2001, which the
Company expects to fund through fiscal 2009. Such commitments
are subject to the investees meeting certain conditions; actual
equity funding may be in lesser amounts. It is not practicable
to estimate the fair value of these investments as the
investments are predominantly closely held and not publicly
traded. An investee’s failure to successfully develop and
provide competitive products and services due to lack of
financing, market demand or unfavorable economic environment
could adversely affect the value of the Company’s
investment in the investee. There can be no assurance that the
investees will be successful in their efforts.

Note 5 — Debt and Credit
Facilities

The Company had an unsecured credit facility
under which banks were committed to make up to $400 million in
revolving loans to the Company. The credit facility was
cancelled in January 2001.

Under terms of two identical revolving credit
agreements, cancelled in February 2000 as a condition of
the sale of the Company’s terrestrial-based CDMA wireless
consumer phone business (Note 14), QPE (Note 4) could
borrow a total of $150 million. The interest under the
facilities was at the applicable LIBOR rate plus 0.5%. The
weighted average interest rate on outstanding borrowings was
6.4% and 5.9% during fiscal 2000 and 1999, respectively.

Cash amounts paid for interest were $11 million
in fiscal 2001, $5 million in fiscal 2000 and $11 million in
fiscal 1999. Cash paid for interest in fiscal 2001 included
$8 million related to an arbitration decision against the
Company.

Note 7 — Trust Convertible Preferred
Securities of Subsidiary

In February 1997, QUALCOMM Financial
Trust I (the Trust), the Company’s wholly-owned
subsidiary trust created under the laws of the State of
Delaware, completed a private placement of $660 million of
5 3/4% Trust Convertible Preferred Securities. The sole
assets of the Trust were QUALCOMM Incorporated 5 3/4%
Convertible Subordinated Debentures due February 24, 2012.
The Company fully and unconditionally guaranteed the obligations
of the Trust related to the Trust Convertible Preferred
Securities. The Trust Convertible Preferred Securities were
convertible into Company common stock at the rate of 5.5056
shares of Company common stock for each Trust Convertible
Preferred Security (equivalent to a conversion price of
$9.082054 per share of common stock). Distributions on the Trust
Convertible Preferred Securities were payable quarterly by the
Trust. The Trust Convertible Preferred Securities were subject
to mandatory redemption on February 24, 2012, at a
redemption price of $50 per preferred security. The Company had
the right to convert the Trust Convertible Preferred Securities,
in whole or in part, on or after March 4, 2000. The Company
was required to pay a premium over the initial conversion price
if securities were converted prior to March 4, 2002. As a
result of the Leap Wireless Spin-off, and pursuant to a
resolution of the Board of Directors of QUALCOMM, each QUALCOMM
Trust Convertible Preferred Security was convertible, subject
and pursuant to the terms of the Convertible Subordinated
Debentures, into both QUALCOMM common stock and Leap Wireless
common stock at the rate of 5.5056 and 0.17205 shares,
respectively, for each QUALCOMM Trust Convertible Preferred
Security.

During fiscal 2000, approximately 13,191,000
Trust Convertible Preferred Securities were converted into
approximately 72,623,000 shares of common stock. As of
September 30, 2000, all Trust Convertible Preferred
Securities had been converted into common stock.

QUALCOMM INCORPORATED

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS

At September 30, 2001 and 2000, the Company
had net deferred tax assets as follows (in thousands):

The Company has provided a valuation allowance on
substantially all of its net deferred tax assets because of
uncertainty regarding their realizability due to the expectation
that deductions from future employee stock option exercises and
related deductions will exceed future taxable income. If and
when recognized, the tax benefit of these deferred assets will
primarily be accounted for as a credit to stockholders’
equity rather than as a reduction of the income tax provision.

At September 30, 2001, the Company had
unused net operating losses, manufacturing, research, foreign
tax and alternative minimum tax credits expiring from 2002
through 2021. The unused net operating tax losses were generated
by the exercise of non-qualified employee stock options.

Cash amounts paid for income taxes were
$75 million, $44 million and $68 million for
fiscal 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively.

Note 9 — Capital
Stock

Common Stock Warrants

In March 2000, the Company assumed warrants to
purchase 11,000, 68,000, and 7,000 shares of common stock
at $10.21, $2.91, and $6.56 per share, respectively, as a
result of the acquisition of SnapTrack. In April 2000, the
Company issued 86,000 shares of common stock upon the
exercise of the warrants.

Preferred Stock

The Company has 8,000,000 shares of preferred
stock authorized for issuance in one or more series, at a par
value of $0.0001 per share. In conjunction with the distribution
of Preferred Share Purchase Rights, the Company’s Board of
Directors designated 1,500,000 shares of preferred stock as
Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock and reserved
such shares for issuance upon exercise of the Preferred Share
Purchase Rights. At September 30, 2001 and 2000, no shares
of preferred stock were outstanding.

Preferred Share Purchase Rights Plan

During fiscal 1996, the Board of Directors
implemented a Preferred Share Purchase Rights Plan (Rights Plan)
to protect stockholders’ rights in the event of a proposed
takeover of the Company. Under the Rights

F-25


QUALCOMM INCORPORATED

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS

Plan, the Company declared a dividend of one
preferred share purchase right (a Right) for each share of the
Company’s common stock outstanding. Pursuant to the Rights
Plan, each Right entitles the registered holder to purchase from
the Company a one one-hundredth share of Series A Junior
Participating Preferred Stock, $0.0001 par value per share,
at a purchase price of $250. In November 1999, the Rights Plan
was amended to provide that the purchase price be set at $400.
The Rights are exercisable only if a person or group (an
Acquiring Person) acquires beneficial ownership of 15% or more
of the Company’s outstanding shares of common stock. Upon
exercise, holders, other than an Acquiring Person, will have the
right, subject to termination, to receive the Company’s
common stock or other securities, cash or other assets having a
market value, as defined, equal to twice such purchase price.
The Rights, which expire on September 25, 2005, are
redeemable in whole, but not in part, at the Company’s
option at any time for a price of $0.005 per Right.

Note 10 — Employee Benefit
Plans

Employee Savings and Retirement Plan

The Company has a 401(k) plan that allows
eligible employees to contribute up to 15% of their salary,
subject to annual limits. The Company matches a portion of the
employee contributions and may, at its discretion, make
additional contributions based upon earnings. The Company’s
contribution expense for fiscal 2001, 2000 and 1999 was
$19 million, $17 million and $17 million,
respectively.

Stock Option Plans

The Board of Directors may grant options to
selected employees, directors and consultants to the Company to
purchase shares of the Company’s common stock at a price
not less than the fair market value of the stock at the date of
grant. The 2001 Stock Option Plan (the 2001 Plan) was adopted
and replaced the 1991 Stock Option Plan (the 1991 Plan) which
expired in August 2001. The shares reserved under the 2001 Plan
are equal to the number of shares available for future grant
under the 1991 Plan on the date the 2001 Plan was approved by
the Company’s stockholders. At that date, 50,541,570 shares
were available for future grants under the 2001 Plan. This share
amount is automatically increased by the amount equal to the
number of shares subject to any outstanding option under the
1991 Plan that expires or is terminated or cancelled following
the date that the 2001 Plan was approved by stockholders. The
Board of Directors of the Company may terminate the 2001 Plan at
any time. The 2001 Plan provides for the grant of both incentive
stock options and non-qualified stock options. Generally,
options outstanding vest over periods not exceeding six years
and are exercisable for up to ten years from the grant date. At
September 30, 2001, options for 57,787,000 shares were
exercisable at prices ranging from $1.09 to $172.38 for an
aggregate exercise price of $682 million.

The Company has adopted the 2001 Non-Employee
Directors’ Stock Option Plan (the 2001 Directors’
Plan) which replaces the 1998 Non-Employee Directors’ Stock
Option Plan. The shares reserved under the 2001 Directors’
Plan are equal to the number of shares available for future
grant under the 1998 Directors’ Plan on the date the 2001
Directors’ Plan was approved by the Company’s
stockholders. At that date, 2,050,000 shares were available for
future grants under the 2001 Directors’ Plan. This share
amount is automatically increased by the amount equal to the
number of shares subject to any outstanding option under the
1998 Directors’ Plan that expires or is terminated or
cancelled following the date that the 2001 Directors’ Plan
was approved by stockholders. The Board of Directors of the
Company may terminate the 2001 Directors’ Plan at any time.
This plan provides for non-qualified stock options to be granted
to non-employee directors at fair market value, vesting over
periods not exceeding five years and are exercisable for up to
ten years from the grant date. At September 30, 2001,
options for 2,678,000 shares were exercisable at prices ranging
from $2.78 to $133.00 per share for an aggregate exercise price
of $18 million.

In March 2000, the Company assumed 1,560,000
outstanding stock options under the SnapTrack, Inc. 1995 Stock
Option Plan (the SnapTrack Plan), as amended with respect to the
acquisition. The SnapTrack Plan expired on the date of
acquisition, and no additional shares may be granted under that
plan. The

SnapTrack Plan provided for the grant of both
incentive stock options and non-qualified stock options.
Generally, options outstanding vest over periods not exceeding
four years and are exercisable for up to ten years from the
grant date. At September 30, 2001, options for 283,000
shares were exercisable at prices ranging from $0.02 to $5.26
for an aggregate exercise price of $0.4 million.

The following table summarizes information about
fixed stock options outstanding at September 30, 2001
(number of shares in thousands):

Employee Stock Purchase Plans

The Company has employee stock purchase plans for
all eligible employees to purchase shares of common stock at 85%
of the lower of the fair market value on the first or the last
day of each six-month offering period. Employees may authorize
the Company to withhold up to 15% of their compensation during
any offering period, subject to certain limitations. The 2001
Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the 2001 Purchase Plan) was
adopted and replaces the 1991 Employee Stock Purchase Plan which
expired in August 2001. The 2001 Purchase Plan authorizes up to
12,154,733 shares to be granted until the Board of Directors of
the Company terminates the 2001 Purchase Plan. The 1996
Non-Qualified Employee Stock Purchase Plan authorizes up to
200,000 shares to be granted at anytime. During fiscal 2001,
2000 and 1999, shares totaling 758,000, 749,000 and 4,774,000
were issued under the plans at an average price of $50.16,
$37.75 and $5.44 per share, respectively. At September 30,
2001, 12,240,049 shares were reserved for future issuance.

Executive Retirement Plans

The Company has voluntary retirement plans that
allow eligible executives to defer up to 100% of their income on
a pre-tax basis. On a quarterly basis, the Company matches up to
10% of the participants’ deferral in Company common stock
based on the then-current market price, to be distributed to the
participant upon eligible retirement. The income deferred and
the Company match held in trust are unsecured and subject to the
claims of general creditors of the Company. Company
contributions begin vesting based on certain minimum
participation or service requirements, and are fully vested at
age 65. Participants who terminate employment forfeit their
unvested shares. All shares forfeited are used to reduce the
Company’s future matching contributions. The plans
authorize up to 800,000 shares to be allocated to participants
at anytime. During fiscal 2001 and 2000, no shares were issued
under the plans. During fiscal 1999, there were 220,000 shares,
net of forfeitures, issued under the plans. The Company’s
matching contribution net of amounts forfeited during fiscal
2001, 2000 and 1999 amounted to $3 million, $2 million and $1
million, respectively. At September 30, 2001, 307,753
shares, including 129,137 issued and unallocated forfeited
shares, were reserved for future allocation.

Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation

Pro forma information regarding net income and
net earnings per common share has been estimated at the date of
grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model based on the
following assumptions:

The Black-Scholes option-pricing model was
developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options
that have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable and
negotiable in a free trading market. In addition, option
valuation models require the input of highly subjective
assumptions, including the expected stock price volatility.
Because the Company’s options have characteristics
significantly different from those of traded options, and
because changes in the subjective input assumptions can
materially affect the fair value estimate, in the opinion of
management, the existing models do not necessarily provide a
reliable single measure of the fair value of its options. The
weighted average estimated fair values of stock options granted
during fiscal years 2001, 2000 and 1999 were $44.25, $48.62 and
$7.14 per share, respectively. The weighted average estimated
fair values of shares granted under the Employee Stock Purchase
Plans during fiscal years 2001, 2000 and 1999 were $24.20,
$31.95 and $2.80, respectively.

For purposes of pro forma disclosures, the
estimated fair value of the options is assumed to be amortized
to expense over the options’ vesting periods. The pro forma
effects of recognizing compensation expense under the fair value
method on net income and net earnings per common share for the
years ended September 30 were as follows (in thousands,
except for net earnings per share):

The effects on pro forma disclosures of applying
the fair value method are not likely to be representative of the
effects on pro forma disclosures of future years because the
fair value method is applicable only to options granted
subsequent to September 30, 1995.

Schwartz, et al v.QUALCOMM:

On December 14, 2000, 77 former
QUALCOMM employees filed a lawsuit against the Company in the
District Court for Boulder County, Colorado, alleging claims for
intentional misrepresentation, nondisclosure and concealment,
violation of C.R.S. Section 8-2-104 (obtaining workers by
misrepresentation), breach of contract, breach of the implied
covenant of good faith and fair dealing, promissory estoppel,
negligent misrepresentation, unjust enrichment, violation of
California Labor Code Section 970, violation of California
Civil Code Sections 1709-1710, rescission, violation of
California Business & Professions Code Section 17200

then, four other individuals have joined the suit as plaintiffs.
Although there can be no assurance that an

action.

GTE Wireless Incorporated
(GTE) v.QUALCOMM:

On
June 29, 1999, GTE filed an action in the United States
District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia asserting
that wireless telephones sold by the Company infringe a single
patent allegedly owned by GTE. On September 15, 1999, the
Court granted the Company’s motion to transfer the action
to the United States District Court for the Southern District of
California. Trial has been set for June 3, 2002. Although
there can be no assurance that an unfavorable outcome of the
dispute would not have a material adverse effect on the
Company’s operating results, liquidity or financial
position, the Company believes the action is without merit and
will vigorously defend the action.

Durante, et al v. QUALCOMM:

On February 2, 2000, four former
QUALCOMM employees filed a putative class action against the
Company, ostensibly on behalf of themselves and those former
employees of the Company whose employment was terminated in
April 1999. Virtually all of the purported class of plaintiffs
received severance packages at the time of the termination of
their employment, in exchange for a release of claims, other
than federal age discrimination claims, against the Company. The
complaint was filed in California Superior Court in and for the
County of Los Angeles and purports to state ten causes of action
including breach of contract, age discrimination, violation of
Labor Code Section 200, violation of Labor Code
Section 970, unfair business practices, intentional
infliction of emotional distress, unjust enrichment, breach of
the covenant of good faith and fair dealing, declaratory relief
and undue influence. The complaint seeks an order accelerating
all unvested stock options for the members of the class. On
June 27, 2000, the case was ordered transferred from Los
Angeles County Superior Court to San Diego County Superior
Court. On July 3, 2000, the Company removed the case to the
United States District Court for the Southern District of
California, and discovery has commenced. On May 29, 2001,
the Court dismissed all plaintiffs’ claims except for
claims arising under the federal Age Discrimination in
Employment Act. On July 16, 2001, the Court granted
condition class certification on the remaining claims, to be
revisited by the Court at the end of the discovery period.
Although there can be no assurance that an unfavorable outcome
of the dispute would not have a material adverse effect on the
Company’s operating results, liquidity or financial
position, the Company believes the claims are without merit and
will vigorously defend the action.

Zoltar Satellite Alarm Systems, Inc. v.
QUALCOMM and SnapTrack:

On
March 30, 2001, Zoltar Satellite Alarm Systems, Inc. filed
suit against QUALCOMM and SnapTrack, a QUALCOMM wholly-owned
subsidiary, alleging infringement of three patents. On
August 27, 2001, Zoltar filed an amended complaint adding
Sprint Corp. as a named defendant and narrowing certain
infringement claims against QUALCOMM and SnapTrack. Since then,
Zoltar has stated its intention to dismiss Sprint Corp. as a
defendant. QUALCOMM and SnapTrack have filed responsive
pleadings and discovery has commenced. Although there can be no
assurance that an unfavorable outcome of this dispute would not
have a material adverse effect on QUALCOMM’s operating
results, liquidity or financial position, QUALCOMM believes the
claims are without merit and will vigorously defend the action.

The Company is engaged in other legal actions
arising in the ordinary course of its business and believes that
the ultimate outcome of these actions will not have a material
adverse effect on its operating results, liquidity or financial
position.

Operating Leases

The Company leases certain of its facilities and
equipment under noncancelable operating leases, with terms
ranging from two to ten years and with provisions for
cost-of-living increases. Rental expense for these facilities
and equipment for fiscal 2001, 2000 and 1999 was $28 million,
$19 million and $17 million, respectively. Future minimum lease
payments in each of the next five years from fiscal 2002 through
2006 are $35 million, $27 million, $17 million, $13 million and
$10 million, respectively, and $13 million thereafter.

Purchase Obligations

The Company has agreements with certain suppliers
to purchase components and estimates its noncancelable
obligations under these agreements to be approximately $1
million through fiscal 2003. The Company also has commitments to
purchase telecommunications and research and development
services for approximately $28 million in fiscal 2002 and $16
million in each of the subsequent fiscal years through 2006.

Letters of Credit, Financial Guarantees and
Other Financial Commitments

On December 22, 1999 and April 25,
2000, the Company and Pegaso Telecomunicaciones, S.A. de C.V.
(Pegaso) executed commitment letters in which the Company agreed
to underwrite up to $500 million of debt financing to Pegaso and
its wholly-owned subsidiary, Pegaso Comunicaciones y Sistemas, a
CDMA wireless operating company in Mexico. No amounts were drawn
on this commitment, and it expired on June 15, 2001.

In May 1999, the Company agreed to advance $115
million, including capitalized interest, under a bridge facility
to Pegaso. Subsequent amendments to the bridge facility extended
amounts available under the facility and its final maturity and
increased the interest rate. At the end of fiscal 2001, $414
million was outstanding under the bridge facility, net of
deferred interest and unearned fees. The facility was payable in
full on September 19, 2001 or August 29, 2002 if
certain milestones were met, including the completion of a
strategic sale or merger with a third party. The bridge facility
was amended in October 2001 to, among other things, change the
timing of milestones required for the August 29, 2002
maturity from September 19 to October 31, 2001 and
reduce the interest rate from 20% to 19% on a prospective basis
in exchange for the granting of a second lien on substantially
all of Pegaso’s assets.

The Company also has an equipment loan facility
with Pegaso. At September 31, 2001, $260 million was
outstanding under the equipment loan facility, net of deferred
interest and unearned fees. The equipment loan facility is
payable through December 31, 2006 and bears interest at
LIBOR plus 4.5%. The Company has a further commitment to provide
an additional $96 million in long-term financing to Pegaso under
its arrangement with Ericsson (Note 3), subject to Pegaso
meeting certain conditions.

A strategic sale or merger was not completed by
October 31, 2001, such that Pegaso failed to meet covenants
in both the amended bridge facility and the equipment loan. On
October 31, 2001, Pegaso also failed to make a scheduled
payment of approximately $3 million on the equipment loan.
Pegaso is currently engaged in strategic discussions with a
third party for a potential sale or merger, and the Company is
actively working with Pegaso and the third party to complete a
transaction or, alternatively, to assist Pegaso in raising
additional funds. As the transaction did not close on the
targeted date of October 31, 2001 and such additional
financing is not certain, the Company ceased accruing interest
on these loans effective at the beginning of the fourth fiscal
quarter of 2001.

In March 2001, the Company transferred a
$125 million Auction Discount Voucher (ADV) to Leap
Wireless to support its spectrum acquisition activities in the
FCC’s current auction of PCS spectrum. The transfer was
funded under the Company’s $125 million senior credit
facility with Leap Wireless, and the face value was recorded as
a note receivable on the Company’s balance sheet. The
facility is repayable in a lump sum payment, including principal
and interest accrued through October 2002, no later than
March 9, 2006. After October 2002, interest is payable
semi-annually. The facility bears interest at LIBOR plus 7.5%.
The Company deferred the recognition of income related to the
ADV transfer due to Leap Wireless’ right to return the ADV
in satisfaction of the note within two years upon the occurrence
of certain future events. In August 2001, Leap Wireless
transferred the ADV back to the Company, and the Company removed
the note

STATEMENTS

receivable and the related deferred income from
the balance sheet. In September 2001, the Company recognized
$11 million in other operating income related to the
irrevocable transfer of a portion of the ADV to another
third-party. Under the terms of the senior credit facility with
Leap Wireless, the Company is committed to fund up to
$125 million as a result of the return of the ADV until the
earlier of settlement of the FCC auction or Leap Wireless’
withdrawal from the auction. At September 30, 2001, no cash
has been advanced to Leap Wireless, but $1 million in loan
fees and accrued interest were outstanding under the facility.

In addition to the financing commitments to Leap
Wireless and Ericsson (Note 3), the Company had
$4 million of letters of credit and $12 million of
other financial guarantees and commitments outstanding as of
September 30, 2001, none of which were collateralized.

Note 12 — Segment
Information

The Company is organized on the basis of products
and services. Reportable segments are as follows: QUALCOMM CDMA
Technologies (QCT) is a leading developer and supplier
worldwide of CDMA-based integrated circuits and system software
for wireless voice and data communications and global
positioning products; QUALCOMM Technology Licensing
(QTL) licenses third parties to design, manufacture, and
sell products incorporating the Company’s technologies; and
QUALCOMM Wireless Systems (QWS) designs, manufactures,
markets, and deploys infrastructure and handset products for use
in terrestrial and non-terrestrial CDMA wireless and satellite
networks and provides satellite and terrestrial-based two-way
data messaging and position reporting services to transportation
companies and private fleets. The Company sold its
terrestrial-based CDMA wireless consumer phone business, the
former operating segment, QUALCOMM Consumer Products (QCP), to
Kyocera in February 2000 (Note 14).

The Company evaluates the performance of its
segments based on earnings before income taxes and accounting
change (EBT), excluding certain impairment and other charges
that are not allocated to the segments for management reporting
purposes. EBT includes the allocation of certain corporate
expenses to the segments, including depreciation and
amortization expense related to unallocated corporate assets.
Segment data includes intersegment revenues. Segment assets are
comprised of accounts receivable, finance receivables and
inventory. Total segment assets differ from total assets on a
consolidated basis as a result of unallocated corporate assets.

The table below presents information about
reported segments for the years ended September 30 (in
thousands):

QUALCOMM INCORPORATED

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS

Other reconciling items for the years ended
September 30 were comprised as follows (in thousands):

The net book value of long-lived assets located
outside of the United States was $10 million, $10 million and
$16 million at September 30, 2001, 2000 and 1999,
respectively.

Note 13 — Acquisitions

SnapTrack, Inc.

In March 2000, the Company completed the
acquisition of all of the outstanding capital stock of
SnapTrack, Inc. (SnapTrack), a developer of wireless position
location technology, in a transaction accounted for as a
purchase. The purchase price was approximately $1 billion,
representing the value of QUALCOMM shares issued to effect the
purchase, the value of vested and unvested options and warrants
exchanged at the closing date and estimated transaction costs of
$2 million. The allocation of purchase price, based on the
estimated fair values of the acquired assets and assumed
liabilities, reflects acquired goodwill of $948 million,
purchased in-process technology of $60 million and other
intangible assets of $34 million. Tangible assets acquired and
liabilities assumed were not material to the Company’s
financial statements. Amounts allocated to goodwill and other
intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over
their estimated useful lives of four years. The acquisition has
been treated as a non-cash transaction in the statement of cash
flows.

Purchased in-process technology was expensed upon
acquisition because technological feasibility had not been
established and no future alternative uses existed. The fair
values for each of the in-process technologies were determined
by estimating the resulting net cash flows from such products
after their completion and commercialization, discounting the
net cash flows to present value, and applying the percentage
completion of the projects thereto. The fair value of in-process
technology was determined to be $60 million, including
Multimedia ASIC ($27 million), Server Release 2.0 ($23 million),
DSP Release 2.0 ($8 million) and the pager product ($2 million).
Net cash flow projections were made based on an assessment of
customer needs and the expected pricing and cost structure. If
these projects are not developed, future revenue and
profitability of QUALCOMM may be adversely affected.
Additionally, the value of other intangible assets acquired may
become impaired.

The consolidated financial statements include the
operating results of SnapTrack from the date of acquisition.
Unaudited pro forma operating results for the Company, assuming
the acquisition of SnapTrack had been made at the beginning of
the years ended September 30, were as follows (in
thousands, except per share data):

comparative purposes only and may not be indicative of the
operating results which actually would have occurred had the
combination been in effect at the beginning of the respective
periods or of future operating results of the consolidated
entities.

Note 14 — Disposition of Assets and
Other Charges

In February 2000, the Company sold its
terrestrial-based CDMA wireless consumer phone business,
including its phone inventory, manufacturing equipment and
customer commitments, to Kyocera Wireless (Kyocera). Under the
agreement with Kyocera, Kyocera agreed to purchase a majority of
its CDMA integrated circuit sets and system software
requirements from QUALCOMM for a period of five years. Kyocera
will continue its existing royalty-bearing CDMA license
agreement with QUALCOMM. QUALCOMM received $242 million,
including interest, during fiscal 2000 for the net assets sold.

As part of the agreement with Kyocera, QUALCOMM
formed a new subsidiary that has a substantial number of
employees from QUALCOMM Consumer Products business to provide
services to Kyocera on a cost-plus basis to support
Kyocera’s phone business for up to three years. In
addition, selected employees of QPE were transferred to Kyocera.
As a condition of the purchase, QPE paid down and cancelled its
two revolving credit agreements. QUALCOMM recorded $83 million
in charges during fiscal 2000 to reflect the estimated
difference between the carrying value of the net assets and the
consideration received from Kyocera, less costs to sell, and
employee termination costs.

In May 1999, the Company sold certain of its
assets related to its terrestrial CDMA wireless infrastructure
business to Ericsson and entered into various license and
settlement agreements with Ericsson. Pursuant to the
Company’s agreement with Ericsson, the Company has and will
extend financing for possible future sales by Ericsson of
infrastructure equipment and related services to specific
customers in certain geographic areas, including Brazil, Chile,
Mexico, and Russia or in other areas selected by Ericsson
(Note 3). The Company recorded charges of $251 million
during fiscal 1999 related to the sale of its terrestrial CDMA
wireless infrastructure business.

The Company leases certain facilities to Ericsson
and Kyocera under noncancelable operating leases, with
provisions for cost-of-living increases. The leases expire on
various dates through May 31, 2004 and February 20,
2005, respectively, and generally provide for renewal options
thereafter. Future minimum rentals in each of the next four
years from fiscal 2002 to 2005 are $21 million, $21 million, $17
million and $4 million, including $1 million in fiscal
2002 and fiscal 2003 related to subleases.

Note 15 — Spin-Off of Leap Wireless
International, Inc.

On September 23, 1998, the Company completed
the spin-off and distribution (the Distribution or Leap Wireless
Spin-off) to its stockholders of shares of Leap Wireless. In
connection with the Distribution, the Company transferred to
Leap Wireless its joint venture and equity interests in certain
domestic and international emerging terrestrial-based wireless
telecommunications operating companies and recorded a $17
million liability in connection with its agreement to transfer
its ownership interest in Telesystems of Ukraine (TOU), a
wireless telecommunications company in Ukraine, and its working
capital loan receivable from TOU (TOU assets) to Leap Wireless
if certain events occurred within 18 months of the Leap Wireless
Spin-off. During the first six months of fiscal 1999, the
Company provided an additional $2 million working capital loan
to TOU and recorded 100% of the losses of TOU, net of
eliminations, because the other investors’ equity interests
were depleted. In March 1999, the Company reassessed the
recoverability of TOU assets in light of certain developments
affecting the TOU business and the disposition of other assets
related to the terrestrial CDMA wireless infrastructure business
(Note 14). As a result, the Company recorded a $15 million
non-operating charge to write off the TOU assets, as well as a
$12 million charge to operations to write off other assets
related to the TOU contract, and the adjusted liability to
transfer TOU to Leap Wireless of $15 million was reversed
against equity as an adjustment to the Distribution. As of
September 30, 1999, all TOU assets

QUALCOMM INCORPORATED

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS

were written off. In fiscal 2001, the Company
assessed its remaining liabilities related to the Leap Wireless
spin-off and reversed $2 million against equity as an adjustment
to the Distribution.

In connection with the Distribution, Leap
Wireless issued to QUALCOMM a warrant to purchase 5,500,000
shares of Leap Wireless common stock at $6.10625 per share. The
Company recorded the warrant at its predecessor basis of $24
million net of the related deferred tax liability. In
March 1999, the Company agreed to reduce the number of
shares under warrant to 4,500,000 in exchange for
$3 million in consideration from Leap Wireless, resulting
in a pre-tax loss of $3 million. The Company agreed to the
cancellation to enable Leap Wireless to meet Federal
Communications Commission regulatory requirements. At
September 30, 2001 and 2000, the Company had the right to
purchase 3,375,000 and 4,500,000 shares, respectively, of Leap
Wireless common stock under warrants. The estimated fair values
of the warrant at September 30, 2001 and 2000 were $49
million and $250 million, respectively, as calculated using the
Black-Scholes option-pricing model.

Note 16 — Restructuring

During January 1999, the Company completed a
review of its operating structure to identify opportunities to
improve operating effectiveness in connection with the
Company’s plan to exit certain activities in its
infrastructure equipment business. As a result of this review,
management approved a formal restructuring plan that eliminated
651 positions. The Company recorded charges to operations of $15
million during the second quarter of fiscal 1999, including $10
million in employee termination costs, $3 million in asset
impairments and $1 million in estimated net losses on
subleases or lease cancellation penalties. The activities
related to the restructuring have been completed. The following
table presents the roll forward from the initial provision
during fiscal 1999 to September 30, 2000 (in thousands):

Note 17 — Subsequent Events
(Unaudited)

Effective October 25, 2001, Wireless
Knowledge Inc. (Wireless Knowledge), a joint venture established
by QUALCOMM and Microsoft Corp. (Microsoft) in 1998, acquired
all shares held by Microsoft in exchange for an agreement that
Microsoft’s royalty obligations under a Development,
License, and Alliance Agreement dated July 19, 2000 by and
between Wireless Knowledge and Microsoft would be considered
fully paid, and certain other consideration. As a result,
Wireless Knowledge will become a subsidiary of QUALCOMM.

Note 18 — Summarized Quarterly
Data

The following financial information reflects all
normal recurring adjustments that are, in the opinion of
management, necessary for a fair statement of the results of the
interim periods. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2001, the
