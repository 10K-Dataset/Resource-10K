2003 fiscal year ended on September 28, 2003, but we present our 2003 fiscal
year as ending on September 30, 2003.

Overview

In 1989, we publicly introduced the concept that a digital communication
technique called CDMA could be commercially successful in wireless
communication applications. CDMA stands for Code Division Multiple Access and
is one of the three main technologies currently used in digital wireless
communications networks. CDMA and the two other main digital wireless
communications technologies, TDMA (which stands for Time Division Multiple
Access) and GSM (which is a form of TDMA and stands for Global System for
Mobile Communications) are the digital technologies used to transmit a wireless
phone user’s voice or data over radio waves using the wireless phone operator’s
network. CDMA works by converting speech into digital information, which is
then transmitted in the form of a radio signal over the phone network. These
digital wireless phone networks are complete phone systems comprised primarily
of base stations, or “cells,” which are geographically placed throughout a
service or coverage area. Once communication between a wireless phone user and
a base station is established, the system detects the movement of the wireless
phone user and the communication is handed off to another base station, or
cell, as the wireless phone user moves throughout the service area.

Because we led the development of CDMA technology, we own significant
intellectual property, including patents, patent applications and trade
secrets, that we license to other companies and integrate into our own
products. The wireless communications industry generally recognizes that a
company seeking to develop, manufacture and/or sell products that use CDMA
technology will require a license from us.



There are currently four versions of CDMA technology recognized worldwide
as public wireless standards. The version known as cdmaOne is currently in use
by most CDMA-based mobile phone networks. Newer versions of CDMA, which also
enable the rapid communication of data as well as voice, are popularly referred
to as third generation or 3G technologies. These versions of CDMA are known
commonly throughout the wireless industry as:

•

CDMA2000, including 1X, 1xEV-DO (where DO refers to Data
Optimized) and 1xEV-DV (where DV refers to Data and Voice);

•

Wideband CDMA (WCDMA) or Universal Mobile Telecommunications Systems (UMTS), and;

•

Time Division Synchronous CDMA (TD-SCDMA).

Our
revenues.

We generate revenues by licensing our CDMA technology to
other manufacturers of CDMA products (such as wireless phones and the hardware
required to establish and operate a CDMA wireless network). Revenues are
generated through licensing fees and royalties on CDMA-based products sold by
our licensees. We also sell products and services, which include the following,
all of which are described in greater detail below:

•

CDMA-based integrated circuits (also known as chips) and the
related software used in wireless phones (also known as subscriber
units and handsets) and wireless networks;

•

Messaging and other services and related equipment and
software used by transportation and other companies to communicate
with and track their equipment fleets;

•

Software products and services related to BREW (which stands
for Binary Runtime Environment for Wireless), a package of products
that enable software developers to create applications, or programs,
to run on mobile phones. BREW includes porting tools and technical
assistance for device manufacturers and the BREW Distribution System
(BDS) that allows for over-the-air distribution of applications to
mobile phones and coordinates billing and payment for wireless
operators; and

•

Software and hardware development services.

We make investments to promote the development of new CDMA products as
well as the adoption of CDMA by more mobile phone service providers. We also
continue to provide products and services to service providers and other
customers of Globalstar L.P., a company that operates a worldwide,
low-Earth-orbit satellite-based telecommunications system.

Our engineering resources.

We have significant engineering resources,
including engineers with substantial expertise in CDMA technology. Using these
engineering resources, we expect to develop new versions of CDMA, develop new
technologies that use CDMA, participate in the formulation of new wireless
telecommunications standards that use CDMA and assist in deploying wireless
voice and data communications networks around the world.

Our integrated circuits business.

We develop and sell CDMA-based
integrated circuits and system software for use in wireless phones, wireless
networks and global positioning systems (GPS). Our integrated circuits related
products include both the integrated circuits for wireless phones and the
equipment used to operate the wireless phone network. Because of our broad and
unique experience in designing and developing CDMA-based products, we not only
design the integrated circuit, but we also design the entire supporting system.
This approach enables us to optimize the performance of the wireless phone
itself with improved product features, as well as the integration and
performance of the network system. Our design of the entire system also allows
CDMA systems and devices manufactured by our customers to come to market
faster. We provide our integrated circuits and related system software,
including reference designs and tools, to many of the world’s leading wireless
phone and infrastructure equipment manufacturers. We plan to add additional
features and capabilities to our future integrated circuit products to help our
customers reduce the costs and size of their products and to simplify our
customers’ design processes. We also design and create multimode and multiband
integrated circuits incorporating other wireless standards for global roaming
markets. In addition, we will continue to provide high quality support to
enable our customers to reduce the time required to design their products and
bring their products to market faster.

Our asset tracking and messaging business.

We design, manufacture and sell
equipment and provide two-way messaging services to transportation companies,
private fleets and construction equipment fleets throughout parts of the world.
These products permit our customers to track the location of their vehicles and
to communicate with them en route. These products and services use commercially
available satellite and land-based mobile phone technologies



to permit this communication. Our customers use these
products to communicate with drivers, monitor vehicle location and performance,
provide automated driver logs, fuel tax reporting and enhanced customer
service. Our products, which collect and transmit this data, are also
integrated with our customers’ operations software, such as dispatch, payroll
and accounting, so our customers can better manage their information and
operations.

Our phone software and related services business.

We provide our BREW
(Binary Runtime Environment for Wireless) product and services to network
operators, handset manufacturers and application developers and support for
developing and delivering over-the-air wireless applications and services. The
BREW product and services include the BREW SDK (software development kit) for
developers, the BREW applications platform (i.e. software programs) and
interface tools for device manufacturers, and the BREW Distribution System that
enables network operators to get applications from developers to market and
coordinate the billing and payment process. The BREW platform is a software
application that provides an open, standard platform for wireless devices,
which means that BREW can be made to interface with many software applications,
including those developed by others. We make the BREW SDK available, free of
charge, to any qualified person or company interested in developing a new
product for wireless communications. BREW leverages the capabilities available
in integrated circuits and system software, enabling our customers to develop
feature-rich applications and content while reducing memory and maximizing
system performance of the wireless phone itself. BREW can be used on wireless
phones and other devices that support wireless technologies other than CDMA,
such as GSM/GPRS (General Packet Radio System) and WCDMA.

Subscriber
growth.

In October 2003, EMC World Cellular Information Service
(EMC), a researcher and publisher of wireless industry market intelligence,
forecast that there will be 1.4 billion mobile phone users, also referred to as
subscribers, by the end of this calendar year and that the figure will grow to
2.2 billion globally by the end of 2007. Wireless networks based on cdmaOne,
the version of CDMA currently in use by most CDMA-based mobile telephone
networks, and CDMA2000 have been commercially deployed in 60 countries around
the world. The CDMA Development Group (CDG) is an international consortium of
companies who have joined together to lead the adoption and evolution of CDMA
wireless systems around the world. According to the CDG, there were more than
164 million CDMA subscribers in June 2003. In June 2003, the CDG reported that
over the year ended June 2003, CDMA subscribers grew 29% worldwide. CDMA is the
leading mobile phone technology in North America with market share of 48% at
June 2003 according to EMC. As reported by the CDG, North America is the
largest CDMA market with nearly 69 million subscribers at
June 16, 2003,
representing annual growth of 24%. In the Asian Pacific market, CDMA carriers
added nearly 18 million subscribers during the year ended June 2003, bringing
the total number of CDMA subscribers in this region to over 63 million, an
increase of 39% over the prior year. In January 2002, China Unicom launched its
nationwide CDMA network, and in October 2003, China Unicom announced that it
had more than 16 million CDMA subscribers. CDMA is outpacing GSM in India,
adding 1.2 million new users in July 2003 and capturing the largest share of
new subscribers for any wireless technology. In May 2003, Reliance Infocomm
launched its nationwide CDMA network in India, and Reliance Infocomm had
approximately 4 million subscribers as of the end of September 2003. In Latin
America, the number of CDMA subscribers grew by 23% over the year ended June
2003, reaching nearly 30 million in 20 countries.

Next generation technologies.

We have already developed and deployed the
next generation of our CDMA technology, or what is being called 3G (third
generation). Our 3G technology, CDMA2000 1X, was first deployed commercially in
October 2000 in South Korea, where 22 million, or approximately 67%, of the
nation’s total mobile service users were using this technology by the end of
September 2003, according to public reports made available at 3Gtoday.com.
Today there are 59 commercial 3G operators located in 31 countries. In the
United States there are eleven operators that have commercially deployed
CDMA2000 1X: Verizon Wireless, Sprint PCS, Leap Wireless, Metro PCS, US
Cellular, Kiwi PCS, Alltel, Midwest Wireless, Centennial Wireless, Cellular
South and Monet Mobile, making CDMA2000 1X the first 3G technology to be
commercially available in North America. In October 2003, more than 350
CDMA2000 user devices are being sold across all markets today, according to public reports made
available at 3Gtoday.com.

Further investments.

We continue to invest heavily in research and
development focused on extending the market for CDMA-based products and
services. We are developing and commercializing CDMA technology and products to
support high-speed wireless Internet access and multimode, multiband,
multinetwork products that can use cdmaOne, CDMA2000 1X/1xEV-DO/1xEV-DV,
GSM/GPRS, Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN), WCDMA, BREW and GPS position
location technologies.

We are devoting significant research and development resources to
developing high-speed wireless data and Internet access products using our CDMA
technology, including efforts to meet and exceed the standards for 3G



products
set by the International Telecommunications Union (ITU). CDMA wireless phone
network operators that have integrated new features, such as Internet access,
GPS position location and advanced multimedia capabilities like digital photos
and video clips, into their products made possible by our 3G CDMA2000 1X
technology have experienced increased numbers of subscribers and increased
revenues. Our 1xEV-DO technology also permits CDMA wireless network providers
to separately process voice transmissions and data transmissions, allowing them
to optimize each type of transmission. We believe the transfer rate
of 1xEV-DO will satisfy the demand for high-speed, cost-effective, fixed and mobile
alternatives for Internet access, competing with digital subscriber line, cable
and satellite networks. As of today, two wireless phone operators in South
Korea, SK Telecom (SKT) and Korea Telecom Freetel Co., Ltd. (KTF), have
commercially deployed our CDMA2000 1xEV-DO technology. Vésper
in Brazil and Monet Mobile in the United States have also launched CDMA2000 1xEV-DO.
Verizon Wireless deployed CDMA2000 1xEV-DO in Washington, D.C. and in San
Diego, California on October 1, 2003. KDDI has announced that it will start its
1xEV-DO-based service in Japan on November 28, 2003.

Wireless Local Area Networks (WLAN), such as Wi-Fi (Wireless Fidelity),
are complementary to Wide Area Networks (WAN) such as CDMA2000 and WCDMA. They
both provide affordable high-speed wireless access to the World Wide Web. The
high-speed data air link and limited coverage of Wi-Fi is well suited for
private networks (e.g. enterprises, campuses, homes) and certain public “hot spots”
(e.g. airports, conference halls, coffee shops) where data usage is expected to
be high in a limited portable and stationary environment, whereas 3G CDMA
networks are ideally suited for geographically diverse voice and data coverage
(e.g. cities, highways, neighborhoods). Because wireless operators are looking
to use Wi-Fi to extend their coverage indoors and include Wi-Fi services in
their monthly billing structure, we have begun developing our own core chip for
handling Wi-Fi services based on 802.11b and plan to incorporate it into our
future multimode 3G CDMA chips.

We intend to continue our active support of CDMA-based systems and the
technologies and features CDMA permits in order to grow our royalty revenues
and integrated circuit and software revenues. We also plan to continue to
broadly grant royalty-bearing licenses to our technology and patents for CDMA
and other wireless applications.

We make strategic investments to promote the worldwide adoption of CDMA
products and services. Our strategy has been to invest in CDMA carriers (also known
as wireless phone operators, wireless network operators or wireless service
providers), licensed device manufacturers and start-up companies that we
believe open new markets for CDMA technology, support the design and
introduction of new CDMA-based products or possess unique capabilities or
technology. Most of our strategic investments entail a high degree of risk and
will not become liquid until more than one year from the date of investment, if
at all. To the extent such investments become liquid and meet strategic
objectives, we attempt to make regular periodic sales of our interests in these
investments that are recognized in investment income (expense). In some cases,
we make strategic investments in early stage companies which require us to
consolidate or record our equity in losses of those companies. These losses
will adversely affect our financial results until we exit from or reduce our
exposure to these investments. We also provide financing to CDMA carriers to
facilitate the marketing and sale of CDMA equipment by licensed manufacturers.
We have provided equipment financing to customers of Ericsson on a shared basis
with respect to Ericsson’s sale of CDMA infrastructure equipment in Brazil,
Mexico and elsewhere. In November 2001, we acquired controlling interests in
two CDMA carriers in Brazil (Vésper Operating Companies). We have agreed to
sell these two CDMA carriers, subject to certain conditions, in fiscal 2004 but
will continue to fund their operations until the anticipated sale
closes. We had a net cash inflow from investments in QSI in fiscal
2003 and plan to reduce the level of investment in operators from
the levels of fiscal 2002 and before.

Wireless Telecommunications Industry Overview

From the international perspective, the ITU is the central
telecommunication standards setting organization. The ITU is recognized as an
impartial, international organization within which governments and the private
sector work together to coordinate the operation of telecommunication networks
and services to advance the development of communications technology. The ITU’s
standardization activities foster the growth of new technologies, such as
mobile telephony and the Internet, as well as the emerging global information
infrastructure which handles a mix of voice, data and multimedia signals. The
ITU develops internationally-agreed technical and operating standards to foster
seamless interconnection of the world’s communication network and systems. As
the world of telecommunications, information technology and content provision
rapidly converge, the role of the ITU is to forge new recommendations that promote the interoperability of equipment and
facilitate the development of communication networks. The ITU’s objective is to
identify sound technical recommendations, which are then developed into
internationally recognized ITU recommendations.



The Telecommunications Industry Association (TIA) is the leading U.S.
based non-profit trade association serving the communications and information
technology industry. Through its worldwide activities, the TIA facilitates
business development opportunities and a competitive market environment. The
TIA provides a market-focused forum for its member companies, which manufacture
or supply the products and services used in global communications. The TIA
facilitates the convergence of new communications networks while working for a
competitive and innovative market environment. The TIA is a major contributor
of voluntary industry standards that support global trade and commerce in
communications products and systems.

Neither of these bodies have the enforcement authority or the ability to
protect intellectual property rights. These bodies merely ask participating
companies to declare whether they believe they hold patents essential for
compliance with a particular standard and whether they are willing to license
such patents on a royalty-free basis or on a royalty- basis on fair, reasonable
and nondiscriminatory terms.

Usage of mobile phones and other types of wireless telecommunications
equipment has increased dramatically in the past decade. Growth in the market
for wireless telecommunications services has traditionally been fueled by
demand for voice communications. There have been several factors responsible
for this increasing demand, including:

In addition to the tremendous demand for wireless voice services, wireless
service providers are increasingly focused on providing wireless data services
through mobile phones, including wireless access to the Internet, multimedia
entertainment and position location services. In October 2003, International
Data Corporation (IDC), a global market intelligence and advisory firm in the
technology and telecommunications industries, estimated that over one billion
people will be using the Internet by 2007 and over 625 million will be
accessing the Internet through wireless networks using devices other than
personal computers, such as phones. We believe the growing availability of
3G-enabled handsets capable of performing a wide variety of consumer and
enterprise applications will accelerate Internet use on a global basis and lead
to an increased replacement rate in mobile devices using our technology and
chips. Critical to the adoption of wireless Internet devices and services is
high-speed data connectivity, which is driving the evolution of wireless
standards. We expect that the spread of high-speed, cost-effective wireless
Internet access will encourage the development of other remote supervision,
position location and telematic automobile applications. However, projected
growth in the number of people accessing the Internet through wireless networks
and the corresponding demand for wireless data services may not be achieved.

The adoption of wireless standards for mobile communications by individual
countries is generally based on economic criteria and the technology preference
of the telecommunication service providers operating in those countries. A
notable exception is the European Community, which approximately a decade ago
developed regulations requiring the use of a telecommunication standard known
as Global System for Mobile Communications, commonly referred to as GSM. The
use of this standard has spread throughout the world and currently is the basis
for approximately 73% of the digital mobile communications in use according to
EMC. Outside of the European Community, the markets or countries in which we do
business are free to decide which standard to use based on the most
economically advantageous business prospects. One exception is South Korea,
which requires the use of CDMA technology for wireless service providers.

The Evolution of Wireless Standards

The significant growth in the use of wireless phones worldwide and demand
for enhanced network functionality requires constant innovation to further
improve network reliability, expand capacity and introduce new types of
services. To meet these requirements, progressive generations of wireless
telecommunications technology standards have evolved.



First Generation.

The first generation of wireless telecommunications,
widely adopted in the late 1980s, was based on analog technology. While this
generation helped increase the adoption of wireless telecommunications, the
technology was characterized by inherent capacity limitations, minimal data
transfer capabilities, low security, inconsistent service levels and
significant power consumption.

Second Generation.

As the deployment of mobile phone systems grew, the
limitations of analog technology drove the development of second generation,
digital-based technologies, which are the primary technology standards in use
today. Second generation digital technology provided for significantly enhanced
efficiency within a broadcast spectrum as well as greatly increased capacity
compared to analog systems. Second generation technologies also enabled
numerous enhanced services, including paging, e-mail and facsimile, connections
to computer networks, greater privacy, lower prices, a greater number of
service options and greater fraud protection. The three main second-generation
digital technologies are CDMA, called cdmaOne or IS-95A/B, a technology we
developed and patented, TDMA and GSM, a form of TDMA.

Our second generation CDMA technology offers 10 to 20 times the capacity
of analog systems and more than three times the capacity of TDMA- and GSM-based
systems through more efficient utilization of wireless carriers’ licensed
spectrum. Some of the advantages of CDMA technology over both analog and TDMA-
and GSM-based technologies include enhanced call security, increased network
capacity, network flexibility, compatibility with Internet protocols, lower
power requirements, higher capacity for data and faster access to data
(Internet), higher data throughput rates and easier transition to 3G networks.
We are not aware of any technological advantages that GSM has over CDMA.

Many GSM operators have deployed or are expected to deploy GPRS, a packet
data technology, as a bridge technology, and some plan to deploy EDGE (Enhanced
Data Rates for GSM Evolution), while waiting for 3G WCDMA devices to become
readily available. We do not believe that GPRS and EDGE will be competitive
with 3G CDMA-based packet data services, either on a cost or performance basis,
although these technologies will be deployed in GSM networks.

Third Generation.

As demand for wireless networks that carry both data and
voice traffic at faster speeds has increased significantly, several 3G wireless
standards have been proposed to the ITU by a variety of companies and
alliances. These proposals include both CDMA- and TDMA-based technologies. A
technology standard selected for 3G must efficiently support significantly
increased data speeds and capacity over limited spectrum bandwidth, thereby
enabling new and enhanced services and applications such as mobile e-commerce,
position location and mobile multimedia web browsing, including music and video
downloads.

CDMA-Based 3G Technology.

In May 2000, the ITU adopted the 3G standard
known as IMT-2000, which encompasses five terrestrial operating modes, three of
them based on our CDMA intellectual property.

The three IMT-2000 CDMA modes are:

(1)

CDMA2000, also known as Multi-Carrier, which includes CDMA2000
1X/1xEV-DO/1xEV-DV;

(2)

WCDMA, also known as Direct Spread or UMTS; and

(3)

Time Division Duplex, also known as TDD or TD-SCDMA.

The two operating modes not based on CDMA are UWC-136 and DECT+.

The two current commercial versions of CDMA2000 are CDMA2000 1X and
1xEV-DO. These versions use a 1.25 megahertz (MHz) channel bandwidth to provide
for high-speed wireless data. CDMA2000 1X/1xEV-DO utilizes the same standard
channel bandwidth as existing cdmaOne systems and, as a result, is compatible
with wireless telecommunications carriers’ existing network equipment, making
the migration to 3G simple and affordable. We believe CDMA2000 1X provides
approximately twice the voice capacity of cdmaOne and six to eight times that
of TDMA-based networks. Additionally, a hybrid approach that utilizes signals
from both the GPS satellite constellation and CDMA cell sites enables CDMA
system operators to meet the Federal Communications
Commission (FCC) mandate requiring wireless carriers to implement enhanced
911 (E911) wireless emergency location services. In the future, the peak data
rates of CDMA2000 1X and 1xEV-DO are expected to increase. Other enhancements,
such as longer battery life, push-to-talk services and Quality of Service (QoS)
features are expected to be available to improve the user experience.



Commercial deployment of CDMA2000 1X began in October 2000 in South Korea
where more than 22 million, or approximately 67%, of the nation’s total mobile
service users were using this technology by the end of September 2003.
Commercial deployment of CDMA2000 1X in North America, Brazil and Romania began
in December 2001. KDDI commercially deployed CDMA2000 1X in Japan in April 2002
and reported more than 10 million CDMA2000 1X subscribers as of September 2003
in a press release dated September 17, 2003.

Commercial deployment of CDMA2000 1xEV-DO began in January 2002 in South
Korea with the introduction of SKT’s high-speed mobile multimedia and broadcast
service. As of August 2003, SKT and KTF reported more than 2 million CDMA2000
1xEV-DO subscribers worldwide, with more than 65% of the CDMA market in various
stages of 1xEV-DO deployments and trials. For example, Verizon Wireless began
offering 1xEV-DO services in the United States on October 1, 2003, and KDDI in
Japan has announced that it will begin offering 1xEV-DO-based services on
November 28, 2003. Several other operators with non-publicly announced trials
are in the process of rolling out 1xEV-DO commercially over the next 18 months.

Commercial deployments of CDMA2000 1xEV-DV are expected to begin in the
year 2005. CDMA2000 1xEV-DV will offer mobile peak data rates equal
to a version of 1xEV-DO, which is expected to become commercially available around the same time or
earlier.

The European Community has focused primarily on the second mode of the
IMT-2000 standard, known as WCDMA, which is based on our underlying CDMA
technology. Most of the world’s leading wireless phone and infrastructure
manufacturers have licensed our technology, enabling them to utilize this WCDMA
mode of the 3G technology. Our 3G CDMA licensees include Siemens, Nokia,
Ericsson, Motorola, Lucent, Samsung, LG Electronics, Hitachi, NEC, Nortel,
Toshiba, Sanyo, Sharp, Fujitsu, Denso, Agilent, Alcatel, Matsushita,
Mitsubishi, and Kyocera, among others.

Knowing that many GSM operators would not have access to WCDMA spectrum
and most of those that do may not be ready to offer WCDMA services until 2004,
we developed a soft-switch based technology called GSM1x. GSM1x allows GSM operators
to begin offering revenue-generating 3G services (while preserving
their existing capital investment in GSM) by overlaying the commercially proven
CDMA2000 radio access network on top of their GSM network. GSM1x combines the increased voice and high-speed data capacity offered
by the CDMA2000 air interface with the familiar features and services offered
by the existing GSM-MAP core network. Commercial deployments of GSM1x are
expected to occur within the next year.

The
TD-SCDMA mode is the least developed of the 3G CDMA alternatives. Support
for the development of this version of the 3G technologies has been provided by
the Chinese government, which hopes this technology will provide a path to the
development of a stronger wireless industry in China.

The three 3G CDMA wireless operating modes discussed above are all based
on the underlying core principles of CDMA technology; however, each has
different features which some technologists believe enable a clearer migration
path from the existing second generation technologies. The CDMA2000 mode
enables a direct and relatively more economical conversion for current cdmaOne
networks. We believe it also offers an economical transition from current GSM
networks. While we believe that the CDMA2000 mode offers a quicker path to
third generation services and offers a number of technical advantages, we
actively support each of these 3G CDMA modes. We will continue to develop
integrated circuits for all modes of the 3G standard based on CDMA. In
addition, our intellectual property rights include core and primary patents
utilized by each of the 3G CDMA alternatives, and the royalty rate to be paid
to us by a licensee for 3G CDMA products has not differed from the rate that a
licensee will pay for second-generation cdmaOne products.

These three 3G CDMA wireless operating modes require separate
implementations and are not interchangeable from a technological perspective.
While the fundamental core technologies are derived from CDMA and are covered
by our patents, they each require unique infrastructure products, network
design and management.

respectively. QCT is dependent on four major customers, Samsung Electronics
Company, Motorola Inc., Kyocera Wireless and LG Electronics. The loss of any
one of these customers could reduce our revenues and harm our ability to
achieve or sustain acceptable levels of operating results. QCT subcontracts all
of the manufacturing and assembly, and most of the testing, of its integrated
circuits. QCT depends on a limited number of third parties to perform these
functions, some of which are only available from single sources with which QCT
does not have long-term contracts.

QCT sells products to both wireless phone and infrastructure
manufacturers. For wireless phone manufacturers, QCT’s products include
baseband and system software, radio frequency, intermediate frequency, and
power management devices. These highly integrated products enable manufacturers
to design very small, feature-rich handsets with longer standby times that
support existing cdmaOne and 3G services. For wireless infrastructure
manufacturers, QCT offers CDMA integrated circuits and system software that
provide wireless standards-compliant processing of voice and data signals to

communications industry. QCT is also closely aligned with manufacturers and
carriers in product plans, design specifications and development timelines.

Our gpsOne wireless location feature has enabled a host of new
value-added, high-precision location-based services such as friend finder,
child safety, personal direction finding and mobile yellow page services, and
has enabled CDMA system operators to meet the FCC’s E911 mandate. Using a
hybrid approach that utilizes signals from both the GPS satellite constellation
and CDMA cell sites, the gpsOne feature enhances location services
availability, expands terrain coverage, accelerates the location determination
process and provides better accuracy for callers, whether during emergency
situations or while using GPS-enabled commercial applications. E911 deployments
by CDMA carriers in the United States are well under way. Approximately fifteen
million gpsOne-enabled terminals are in use today, supporting well in excess of
130 high-precision location-based services in Japan, South Korea and China.

We have developed 1xEV-DO technology designed to provide reliable,
cost-effective and always-on wireless data and Internet access to consumers. It
is fully compatible with existing cdmaOne and CDMA2000 1X technologies, and has
been standardized as part of the CDMA2000 mode of the 3G standard. The
versatility of 1xEV-DO allows the technology to be embedded in phones, laptop
and handheld computers, and other fixed, portable and mobile devices; 1xEV-DO
enables manufacturers to deliver products with access to services that were
previously only available through wired connections to the Internet or
enterprise networks. The 1xEV-DO technology allows carriers to leverage their
current infrastructure investment and maintain compatibility with existing
phone equipment. We designed and developed a complete package of products,
including both infrastructure and phone integrated circuits, in support of the
industry-wide movement to standardize, develop and deploy 1xEV-DO technology in
CDMA2000 networks.

Our MSM series integrated circuits are the primary integrated circuits in
a CDMA wireless phone. Our Cell Site Modem (CSM) series integrated circuits are
the primary integrated circuits in a wireless service provider’s base station

QUALCOMM Technology Licensing Segment (QTL)

QTL grants licenses to use our intellectual property portfolio, which
includes certain patent rights essential to and/or useful in the manufacture
and sale of CDMA (including cdmaOne, CDMA2000 1X/1xEV-DO/1xEV-DV, TD-SCDMA and
WCDMA) products. QTL generates revenue from license fees as well as ongoing
royalties based on worldwide sales by licensees of products incorporating our
intellectual property. The license fees are generally nonrefundable and may be
paid in one or more installments. Ongoing royalties are nonrefundable and are
generally based upon a percentage of the net selling price of licensed
products. Revenues generated from royalties are subject to quarterly and annual
fluctuations. Fluctuations are the result of variations in product mix, product
pricing and quantities of sales by our licensees and the impact of currency
fluctuations associated with royalties generated from international sales. QTL
revenues comprised 25%, 28% and 29% of total consolidated revenues in fiscal
2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively.

QUALCOMM Wireless & Internet Segment (QWI)

QWI revenues comprised 12%, 14% and 16% of total consolidated revenues in

fiscal 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. The three segments aggregated into
QWI are:

QUALCOMM Internet Services (QIS)

The QIS division provides technology to support and accelerate the
convergence of wireless data, Internet and voice services. The BREW (Binary
Runtime Environment for Wireless) platform is an application execution
environment that provides an open platform for wireless devices,
which means that BREW can be made to interface with many software applications,
including those developed by others. The BREW platform is part of a complete
package of products for wireless applications development, device
configuration, application distribution, and billing and payment. The BREW
platform currently leverages the capabilities available in QCT’s integrated
circuits and system software, enabling development of feature-rich applications
and content while reducing memory overhead and maximizing system performance.
The BREW product and services include the BREW SDK (software development kit)
for developers, the BREW applications platform (i.e. software programs) and
interface tools for device manufacturers, and the BREW Distribution System that
enables network operators to get applications from developers to market and
coordinate the billing and payment process. This includes BREW extensions, such
as virtual machines, browsers and other interpreters that process executable
content, such as JAVA midlets, XHTML, HTML, JavaScript and Flash. Commercial
BREW-based services enable consumers to customize their handsets by downloading
applications over-the-air from an operator’s application download server.

In November 2001, KTF, a leading wireless phone operator in South Korea,
launched the world’s first commercial BREW-enabled applications service. KTF’s
BREW-enabled wireless data service runs on a CDMA2000 1X high-speed data
network as well as EV-DO. Nine additional operators have since commercially
launched BREW services including Verizon Wireless, Alltel, US Cellular, and
Midwest Cellular in the US, KDDI in Japan, Telstra in Australia, BellSouth in
Colombia, VIVO in Brazil, and China Unicom. Additionally, Reliance, the largest
CDMA carrier in India, has signed a definitive agreement to launch BREW
services in the rapidly growing India wireless market.

In January 2002, we announced a multi-year licensing agreement with Nextel
for QChat, a technology developed to provide a reliable method of instant
connection and two-way communication between users via their mobile phones.
Using QChat, users may speak with other users virtually instantaneously at the
push of a button. It enables one-to-one (private) and one-to-many (group) calls
over 3G CDMA networks. The technology also allows over-the-air upgrades of
handset software, management of group membership by subscribers and ad-hoc
creation of chat groups. It uses standard voice-over Internet protocol
technologies. This means sending voice information in
digital form over Internet protocol-based data networks (including CDMA)
in discrete packets rather than the traditional circuit-switched protocols of
the public switched telephone network. In addition to Nextel, we are actively
pursuing QChat deployments with other carriers around the world.

QUALCOMM Wireless Business Solutions (QWBS)

We provide satellite and terrestrial-based two-way data messaging and
position reporting services to transportation companies, private fleets and
construction equipment fleets. The satellite-based OmniTRACS mobile



communications system was first introduced in the United States in 1988.
Through September 2003, we have shipped nearly 489,000 OmniTRACS TruckMAIL,
OmniExpress, GlobalTRACS and LINQ mobile communications systems, which
currently operate in over 39 countries. Message transmission and position
tracking for the OmniTRACS and TruckMAIL systems are provided by use of leased
Ku-band and C-band transponders on commercially available geostationary earth
orbit satellites. The OmniExpress, GlobalTRACS and LINQ systems use wireless
digital terrestrial networks for messaging transmission, and the GPS
constellation for position tracking. These mobile communications systems help
transportation companies, private fleets and construction equipment fleets
improve the utilization of assets and increase efficiency and safety by
improving communications between drivers, machines and dispatchers. System
features include status updates, load and pick-up reports, position reports at
regular intervals, and vehicle and driving performance information.

In the United States, we manufacture and sell OmniTRACS, TruckMAIL,
OmniExpress and GlobalTRACS mobile communications equipment and related
software packages and provide ongoing messaging and maintenance services. We
have sold OmniTRACS, TruckMAIL and OmniExpress system products for use by
private trucking fleets, service vans, marine vessels, trains, federal
emergency vehicles, and for oil and gas pipeline control and monitoring sites.
In fiscal 2003, we announced and began shipping our GlobalTRACS system to the
construction equipment industry, providing wireless access to equipment
operating data and location, regardless of equipment type or manufacturer.
Message transmissions for operations in the United States are formatted and
processed at our Network Management Center in San Diego, California, with a
fully-redundant backup Network Management Center located in Las Vegas, Nevada.
We estimate the Network Management Center currently processes over seven
million messages and position reports per day.

Recently we announced the availability of driver authentication, wireless
panic button and tamper detection features, three new security enhancements for
the OmniTRACS system to help customers meet increased homeland security needs
and to help deter cargo theft. We announced OmniOne, a new enterprise
application for BREW-enabled CDMA handsets that facilitates mobile worker
assignments and tracking status updates for numerous industries, including
transportation and logistics, utilities and service fleets. We also announced
our agreement with CardioNet, a provider of outpatient cardiac telemetry
technology and services, in which we will utilize our QUALCOMM QConnect service
to provide connectivity between the CardioNet mobile monitoring devices and the
CardioNet Monitoring Center.

Outside of the United States, Mexico and Europe, we work with
telecommunications companies and carriers to establish the OmniTRACS system
concept and products in foreign markets. The OmniTRACS system is currently
operating throughout Europe and in the Middle East, Argentina, Brazil, Canada,
China, Japan and South Korea. Internationally, we generate revenues from the
OmniTRACS system through license fees, sales of network products and terminals,
messaging and service fees. Service providers that operate network management
centers for a region under our granted licenses provide OmniTRACS messaging
services. We also run QUALCOMM Wireless Business Solutions Europe, B.V., a
Netherlands subsidiary, that brings mobile communications products and
messaging services to the European market. In September 2003, this subsidiary
acquired certain assets of Alcatel Mobicom, a competitor of QWBS in Europe.

QUALCOMM Digital Media (QDM)

The QDM division is comprised of the Government Systems and Digital Cinema
businesses.

The Government Systems business provides development, hardware and
analytical expertise to United States Government (USG) agencies involving
wireless communications technologies. We have developed a CDMA Type 1 secure
wireless terrestrial phone for the USG, the QSec-800, that operates in enhanced
security modes and incorporates end-to-end encryption. During fiscal 2003,
QSec-800 phones were shipped to the USG. In fiscal 2003, the next generation
Type 1 secure phone development was launched with USG funding. Additionally,
OmniTRACS products and services are being marketed and sold for USG worldwide
applications.

We develop technologies to support the processing, transmission and
management of content for a variety of media applications, including the
delivery of digitized motion pictures. In fiscal 2002, we released an
end-to-end Digital Cinema System product which combines our expertise in
advanced image compression, electronic security, network management and
integrated circuit design to provide the secure delivery of digitized motion
pictures to theatres worldwide. In May 2000, we entered into a strategic
alliance with Technicolor Digital Cinema, Inc. (Technicolor) and formed a joint
venture, Technicolor Digital Cinema, LLC (TDC), in which we owned a 20%
interest. The joint venture has marketed the QUALCOMM Digital Cinema System and
worked with the motion



picture industry as a technology enabler and service
provider while supporting open standards for the digital delivery of motion
pictures. In August 2003, we jointly announced with Thomson, the parent company
of Technicolor, that we sold our equity interest in TDC to Thomson, a move that
results in sole Thomson ownership of the venture. As part of the sale,
Technicolor has acquired exclusive rights to manufacture, sell and service the
multi-screen Theatre Management System, a key component of the Digital Cinema
System. This sale arrangement does not preclude us from continuing to develop
and market core digital cinema products and technologies, including decoder
modules, encoders and conditional access systems that are based on our
compression and decryption technology.

QUALCOMM Strategic Initiatives Segment (QSI)

We make strategic investments to promote the worldwide adoption of CDMA
products and services for wireless voice and Internet data communications,
including CDMA carriers, licensed device manufacturers and companies that
support the design and introduction of new CDMA-based products or possess
unique capabilities or technology. We make strategic investments in early stage
companies and, from time to time, venture funds to support the adoption of CDMA
and the use of the wireless Internet. We also provide financing to CDMA
wireless operators to facilitate the marketing and sale of CDMA equipment by
licensed manufacturers. In November 2001, we acquired controlling interests in
two CDMA carriers in Brazil (Vésper Operating Companies). We have agreed to
sell these two CDMA carriers, subject to certain conditions, in fiscal 2004 but
will continue to fund their operations until the anticipated sale closes. We
have a significant equity investment in Inquam Limited (Inquam). Inquam owns,
develops and manages wireless communications systems, either directly or
indirectly, with the primary intent of deploying CDMA-based technology. QSI
revenues comprised 3% and 4% of total consolidated revenues in fiscal 2003 and
2002, respectively, primarily resulting from the consolidation of Vésper
Holding. QSI did not generate revenues in fiscal 2001.

Other Businesses

QUALCOMM Consumer Products (QCP)

In February 2000, we sold our terrestrial-based CDMA wireless consumer
phone business, including our phone inventory, manufacturing equipment and
customer commitments, to Kyocera Wireless (Kyocera). As part of the agreement
with Kyocera, we formed a subsidiary that had a substantial number of employees
from the former QUALCOMM Consumer Products business to provide services to
Kyocera on a cost-plus basis to support Kyocera’s phone business. This
arrangement expired in February 2003, and Kyocera offered employment to
substantially all employees of the subsidiary. During fiscal 2003, 2002 and
2001, revenues from this arrangement were $39 million, $105 million and $107
million, respectively, and earnings before taxes were not material.

QUALCOMM Wireless Systems (QWS)

Under now-terminated contracts with Globalstar L.P. (Globalstar), we
designed, developed and manufactured subscriber products and ground
communications systems utilizing CDMA technology and provided contract
development services. Globalstar was formed to design, construct and operate a
worldwide, low-Earth-orbit satellite-based telecommunications system (the
Globalstar System). We currently hold an approximate 6.3% interest in
Globalstar through certain limited partnerships and other indirect interests.

On January 16, 2001, Globalstar announced that, in order to have
sufficient funds available for the continued progress of its marketing and
service activities, it had suspended indefinitely principal and interest
payments on all of its debt, including its vendor financing obligations.
Globalstar also announced its intent to restructure its debt. Globalstar filed
for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection during fiscal 2002. On April 25, 2003, the
U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Delaware approved the sale of Globalstar’s assets to a
new company to be controlled by ICO Global Communications (Holdings) Limited
(ICO), however ICO has indicated as of October 2003 that it does not believe
it will complete the acquisition. Globalstar has opened negotiations with
other parties with respect to an acquisition of Globalstar’s assets.

We continue to provide services and sell products to Globalstar service
providers and other customers involved with the Globalstar System. In addition,
we are in negotiations with potential acquirers to provide products and
services to the new operating company.

carriers and software developers for BREW in China, as well as supporting
research and development of 3G wireless standards based on CDMA. The center
houses our CDMA University, which offers classroom and hands-on training
programs and a highly-integrated test program designed to enable time and cost
savings when bringing products to market. The center and its staff are focused
on providing China with the resources to enable the most timely development of
its mobile communications industry using our technologies and applications,
such as cdmaOne, CDMA2000 1X/1xEV-DO, gpsOne and the BREW platform. The center
also supports the transfer of certain hardware and software technologies for
product development and manufacturing to licensed manufacturers, as well as
network implementation methods to carriers and government bodies in China.

Competition

Competition in the wireless telecommunications industry in the United
States and throughout the world continues to increase at a rapid pace, as
businesses and foreign governments realize the market potential of
telecommunications services. Many of these current and potential competitors
have advantages over us, including:

•

longer operating histories and presence in key markets;

•

greater name recognition;

•

access to larger customer bases; and

•

greater sales and marketing, manufacturing, distribution, technical and other resources than we have.



As a result of these and other factors, our competitors may be more
successful than us. These competitors may have more established relationships
and greater technical, marketing, sales and distribution capabilities and
greater access to channels in markets not currently deploying wireless
communications technology. These competitors also have established or may
establish financial or strategic relationships among themselves or with our
existing or potential customers, resellers or other third parties. These
relationships may affect customers’ decisions to purchase products or license
technology from us. Accordingly, new competitors or alliances among competitors
could emerge and rapidly acquire significant market share to our detriment. In
addition, many of these companies are licensees of our technology and have
established market positions, trade names, trademarks, patents, copyrights,
intellectual property rights and substantial technological capabilities. We may
face competition throughout the world with new technologies and services
introduced in the future as additional competitors enter the market place for
products based on 3G standards. Although we intend to employ relatively new
technologies, there will be a continuing competitive threat from even newer
technologies that may render our technologies obsolete. We also expect that the
price we charge for our products and services may continue to decline as
competition intensifies.

QUALCOMM CDMA Technologies Segment (QCT)

The markets in which our QCT segment operates are intensely competitive.
QCT competes worldwide with a number of United States and international
manufacturers. As a result of the trend toward global expansion by foreign and
domestic competitors and technological and public policy changes, we anticipate
that additional competitors will enter this market. We believe that the
principal competitive factors for CDMA integrated circuit providers to our
addressed markets are product performance, level of integration, quality,
compliance with industry standards, price, time to market, system cost, design
and engineering capabilities, new product innovation and customer support. The
specific bases on which we compete against alternative CDMA integrated circuit
providers vary by product platform. We also compete against alternative
wireless communications technologies including, but not limited to, GSM/GPRS,
TDMA and analog.

QCT’s current competitors include major semiconductor companies such as
Texas Instruments, STMicroelectronics, VIA Telecom, NEC, Infineon and
Philips, as well as major telecommunication equipment companies such as
Motorola, Nokia, Ericsson and Matsushita. In addition, QCT faces competition
from the in-house development efforts of many of our key customers, including
Samsung. QCT also faces competition from start-up ventures.

Our competitors may devote a significantly greater amount of their
financial, technical, marketing and other resources to aggressively market
competitive telecommunications systems or to develop and adopt competitive
digital cellular technologies, and those efforts may materially and adversely
affect QCT. Moreover, competitors may offer more attractive product pricing or
financing terms than we do as a means of gaining access to the wireless
telecommunications markets.

We have entered into licensing agreements with certain companies,
including Philips, Motorola, Lucent, Texas Instruments, VIA Telecom,
PrairieComm, NEC, EoNex Technologies and Infineon. These licenses permit the
licensees to manufacture CDMA-based integrated circuits using certain of our
intellectual property for sale to CDMA-based phone manufacturers. In exchange
for granting the licenses, we are entitled to receive license fees, royalties (payable as a
percentage of the selling price of the integrated circuits) and/or royalty-free
cross-licenses, which allow us to use these companies’ CDMA and, in some cases,
non-CDMA intellectual property for specified purposes. In every case, the phone
manufacturers’ sales of CDMA-based phones are subject to the payment of
royalties to us on the products into which the integrated circuits are
incorporated in accordance with the manufacturers’ separate licensing
arrangements with us. We license our CDMA intellectual property to the
competitors of our QCT segment to support the deployment of CDMA-based
systems and technologies worldwide in order to grow our royalty revenues from
customers licensed to sell CDMA phones and equipment. We believe that, if the
use of CDMA expands sufficiently, QCT’s business will also grow, even if we
lose market share. Also, our QTL segment will receive royalties from sales of
CDMA integrated circuits by certain competitors of QCT. To date, most
CDMAOne and CDMA2000 phone
manufacturer licensees have elected to purchase their CDMA-based integrated
circuits from us.

QUALCOMM Technology Licensing Segment (QTL)

As part of our strategy to generate new licensing revenues, significant
resources are allocated to develop leading edge technology for the
telecommunications industry. We face competition in the development of
intellectual property for next-generation digital wireless communications
technology and services. There are no guarantees that our technologies will
continue to be adopted or we will be able to secure patents for our technology
to subsequently



license. Furthermore, there are no guarantees that existing
systems and applications cannot or will not be replaced by competitors’
technologies, thereby jeopardizing our existing royalty and licensing revenues.

On a worldwide basis, we currently compete primarily with two digital
wireless telecommunications technologies, TDMA and GSM/GPRS. TDMA has been
deployed primarily in the United States and Latin America. Variations of TDMA
have also been deployed in other countries, such as PDC (Personal Digital
Cellular) in Japan and PAS (Personal Access System) in China. GSM has been
extensively utilized in Europe, much of Asia other than Japan and Korea, and
certain other markets. To date, GSM has been more widely adopted than CDMA,
and, although CDMA technology has been proposed for all third generation
wireless systems, there can be no assurance that wireless communications
service providers will select CDMA for their networks or update to any
CDMA-based third generation technology. WCDMA, a technology designed as an
alternative to CDMA2000, is currently in the standardization process and has
been adopted by several European, Japanese and United States carriers. We
expect that, although limited systems have been placed in service (e.g., the
largest WCDMA system is that of NTT DoCoMo in Japan with one million
subscribers as of September 30, 2003 according to NTT DoCoMo’s October 1, 2003
press release), widespread and standardized WCDMA networks will not begin
operation until 2004 or later, given that the WCDMA standard and
interoperability testing is not yet complete. In addition, many GSM operators
have deployed or are expected to deploy GPRS, a packet data technology, as a
2.5G bridge technology, and some plan to deploy EDGE, while waiting for third
generation WCDMA to become available and/or cost effective for their system. We
believe that our CDMA patent portfolio is applicable to all CDMA systems.
However, we cannot assure you that the wireless communications industry will
widely adopt 3G standards based on CDMA technology, or that our CDMA patents
will be determined to be applicable to future standards beyond the 3G
standards.

QUALCOMM Wireless & Internet Segment (QWI)

Existing competitors of our QWBS division offering alternatives to our
OmniTRACS, TruckMAIL, OmniExpress, GlobalTRACS, QConnect, EutelTRACS and LINQ
system products are aggressively pricing their products and services and could
continue to do so in the future. In addition, these competitors are offering
new value-added products and services similar in many cases to our existing or
developing technologies. Emergence of new competitors, particularly those
offering low cost terrestrial-based products and current as well as future
satellite-based systems, may impact margins and intensify competition in new
markets. Similarly, some original equipment manufacturers of trucks and truck
components are beginning to offer built-in, on-board communications and
position location reporting systems that may impact our margins and intensify
competition in our current and new markets.

Competitors
to our BREW platform are continuing to develop their products with a
focus on client, provisioning, and billing products and services.
These competitors are attempting to offer value added products and
services similar, in many cases, to our existing or developing BREW
technologies. In some cases, competitors are continuing to explicitly
attempt to displace only certain components or areas of the greater
BREW offering, such as only the runtime client/device environment
portion of BREW. In addition, certain competitors in the computing
industry and device manufacturing space are now beginning to more
aggressively attempt to replicate the entire BREW system offering
that includes both runtime device environments and
billing/distribution systems. Similarly, some carriers are creating
internally developed solutions by piecing together several components
or are being pressured by governments to adopt alternatives to our
products and services. Emergence of these and other new competitors
may adversely impact our margins and market share.

Patents, Trademarks and Trade Secrets

We rely on a combination of patents, copyrights, trade secrets, trademarks
and proprietary information to maintain and enhance our competitive position.
We have been granted more than 1,000 United States patents and have over 1,700
patent applications pending in the United States. The vast majority of such
patents and patent applications relate to our CDMA digital wireless
communications technology. We also have and will continue to actively file for
patent protection outside the United States and have received numerous CDMA
patents with broad coverage throughout most of the world, including China,
Japan, South Korea, Europe, Brazil and elsewhere.

The standards bodies and the ITU have been informed that we hold essential
intellectual property rights for the 3G standards that are based on CDMA. We
have committed to the ITU to license our essential patents for these CDMA
standards on a fair and reasonable basis free from unfair discrimination.

Under our CDMA license agreements, licensees are generally required to pay
us a non-refundable license fee as well as ongoing royalties based on a
percentage of the net selling price of CDMA subscriber, infrastructure, test
and integrated circuits products. License fees are paid in one or more
installments, while royalties generally continue throughout the life of the
licensed patents. Our CDMA license agreements generally provide cross-licenses
to us to use certain of our licensees’ technology to manufacture and sell
certain CDMA products (e.g. CDMA application specific integrated circuits or
ASICs, subscriber units and/or infrastructure equipment). In most cases, our
use of our licensees’ technology is royalty free. However, under some of the
licenses, if we incorporate certain of the licensed technology into certain of
our products, we are obligated to pay royalties on the sale of such products.
For a limited period of time, Motorola is entitled, subject to the terms of
their license agreement, to share in a percentage of certain third-party
subscriber unit royalties paid by licensees to us. For a limited period of
time, the Korean Electronics Telecommunications Research Institute is entitled,
subject to the terms of a development agreement with us, to share in a
percentage of subscriber and infrastructure royalties paid by certain South
Korean licensees for sales of certain CDMA products sold solely for use in
South Korea.



As part of our strategy to generate licensing revenues and support
worldwide adoption of our CDMA technology, we license to other companies the
rights to design, manufacture and sell products utilizing our CDMA technology.

RISK FACTORS

You should consider each of the following factors as well as the other
information in this Annual Report in evaluating our business and our prospects.
The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face.
Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we
currently consider immaterial may also impair our business operations. If any
of the following risks actually occur, our business and financial results could
be harmed. In that case, the trading price of our common stock could decline.
You should also refer to the other information set forth in this Annual Report,
including our financial statements and the related notes.

Risks Related to Our Businesses

If CDMA technology is not widely deployed, our revenues may not grow as
anticipated.

We focus our business primarily on developing, patenting and
commercializing CDMA technology for wireless telecommunications applications.
Other digital wireless communications technologies, particularly GSM
technology, have been more widely deployed than CDMA technology. If CDMA
technology does not become the preferred wireless communications industry
standard in the countries where our products and those of our customers and
licensees are sold, or if wireless operators do not deploy networks that
utilize CDMA technology, our business and financial results could suffer.

To increase our revenues and market share in future periods, we are
dependent upon the commercial deployment of 3G wireless communications
equipment, products and services based on our CDMA technology. Although



network operators have commercially deployed CDMA2000 1X, we cannot
predict the timing or success of further commercial deployments of CDMA2000 1X,
WCDMA or other CDMA systems. If existing deployments are not commercially
successful, or if new commercial deployments of CDMA2000 1X, WCDMA or other
CDMA systems are delayed or unsuccessful, our business and financial results
may be harmed. In addition, our business could be harmed if network operators
deploy competing technologies or switch existing networks from CDMA to GSM or
if network operators introduce new technologies.

Our business and the deployment of CDMA technology are dependent on the
success of our customers and licensees. Our customers and licensees may incur
lower operating margins on CDMA-based products than on products using
alternative technologies due to greater competition in the CDMA-based market,
lack of product improvements or other factors. If CDMA handset and/or
infrastructure manufacturers exit the CDMA market, the deployment of CDMA
technology could be negatively affected, and our business could suffer.

Our four largest customers as of September 30, 2003 accounted for 51% and 48%
of consolidated revenues in fiscal 2003 and 2002, respectively. The loss of any
one of our major customers or any reduction in the demand for devices utilizing
our CDMA technology could reduce our revenues and harm our ability to achieve
or sustain acceptable levels of operating results.

QCT Segment

The loss of any one of our QCT segment’s significant customers or the
delay, even if only temporary, or cancellation of significant orders from any
of these customers would reduce our revenues in the period of the cancellation
or deferral and could harm our ability to achieve or sustain acceptable levels
of profitability. Accordingly, unless and until our QCT segment diversifies and
expands its customer base, our future success will significantly depend upon
the timing and size of future purchase orders, if any, from these customers.
Factors that may impact the size and timing of orders from customers of our QCT
segment include, among others, the following:

QTL Segment

Our QTL segment derives royalty revenues from sales of CDMA products by
our licensees. We derive a significant portion of our royalty revenue from a
limited number of licensees. Our future success depends upon the ability of our
licensees to develop, introduce and deliver high volume products that achieve
and sustain market acceptance. We have little or no control over the sales
efforts of our licensees, and we cannot assure you that our licensees will be
successful or that the demand for wireless communications devices and services
offered by our licensees will continue to increase. Any reduction in the demand
for or any delay in the development, introduction or delivery of wireless
communications devices utilizing our CDMA technology could have a material
adverse effect on our business. Weakness in the value of foreign currencies in
which our customers’ products are sold may reduce the amount of royalties
payable to us in U.S. dollars.



QWI Segment

Our QIS division derives revenue primarily from software development and
services revenues related to our BREW product and services and a QChat
licensing agreement with Nextel. We derive a significant portion of our QIS
revenue from network operators offering BREW services. The future success of
our QIS division depends in part upon the ability of network operators,
wireless device manufacturers and developers to continue the momentum in
wireless data and sustain market acceptance for quality wireless applications
and services. We cannot assure you that they will be successful or will not
build or buy similar capacity such that they no longer require BREW services.
We also cannot assure you that the demand for BREW services will continue to
increase. Any reduction in the demand for these services could have a material
adverse effect on our business.

We are subject to the risks of our and our licensees’ conducting business
outside the United States.

A significant part of our strategy involves our continued pursuit of
growth opportunities in a number of international markets. We market, sell and
service our products internationally. We have established sales offices around
the world. We will continue to expand our international sales operations and
enter new international markets. This expansion will require significant
management attention and financial resources to successfully develop direct and
indirect international sales and support channels, and we cannot assure you
that we will be successful or that our expenditures in this effort will not
exceed the amount of any resulting revenues. If we are not able to maintain or
increase international market demand for our products and technologies, we may
not be able to maintain an acceptable rate of growth in our business.

Consolidated revenues from international customers as a percentage of
total revenues were 78% in fiscal 2003, 70% in fiscal 2002, and 65% in fiscal
2001. Because most of our foreign sales are denominated in U.S. dollars, our
products and those of our customers and licensees that are sold in U.S. dollars
become less price-competitive in international markets if the value of the U.S.
dollar increases relative to foreign currencies.

In many international markets, barriers to entry are created by
long-standing relationships between our potential customers and their local
providers and protective regulations, including local content and service
requirements. In addition, our pursuit of international growth opportunities
may require significant investments for an extended period before we realize
returns, if any, on our investments. Our business could be adversely affected
by a variety of uncontrollable and changing factors, including:

In addition to general risks associated with our international sales,
licensing activities and operations, we are also subject to risks specific to
the individual countries in which we do business. Declines in currency values
in selected



regions may adversely affect our operating results because our products
and those of our customers and licensees may become more expensive to purchase
in the countries of the affected currencies. During fiscal 2003, 43% and 15% of
our revenues were from customers and licensees based in South Korea and Japan,
respectively, as compared to 37% and 18% during fiscal 2002, respectively, and
35% and 22% during fiscal 2001, respectively. A significant downturn in the
economies of Asian countries where many of our customers and licensees are
located, particularly the economies of South Korea and Japan, would materially
harm our business. The wireless markets in China and India represent
significant growth opportunities for us. In January 2002, China Unicom launched
its nationwide CDMA network, and China Unicom had approximately 16 million CDMA
subscribers in October 2003. In May 2003, Reliance Infocomm launched its
nationwide CDMA network in India, and Reliance Infocomm had approximately 4
million subscribers as of the end of September 2003. If China Unicom or
Reliance Infocomm or the governments of China or India make technology
deployment or other decisions that result in actions that are adverse to the
expansion of CDMA technologies in China or India, our business could be harmed.

We are subject to risks in certain global markets in which wireless
operators provide subsidies on phone sales to their customers. Increases in
phone prices that negatively impact phone sales can result from changes in
regulatory policies related to phone subsidies. Limitations or changes in
policy on phone subsidies in South Korea, Japan, China and other countries may
have additional negative impacts on our revenues.

We expect that royalty revenues derived from international licensees based
upon sales of their products outside of the United States will continue to
represent a significant portion of our total revenues in the future. Revenues
from international licensees are denominated in U.S. dollars. However, to the
extent that such licensees’ sales to their customers are not denominated in
U.S. dollars, any royalties that we receive as a result of such sales are
subject to fluctuations in currency exchange rates. In addition, if the
effective price of products sold by our customers were to increase as a result
of fluctuations in the exchange rate of the relevant currencies, demand for the
products could fall, which in turn would reduce our royalty revenues.

Currency fluctuations could negatively affect future product sales or royalty
revenue, harm our ability to collect receivables, or increase the U.S. dollar
cost of the activities of our foreign subsidiaries and international strategic
investments.

We are exposed to risk from fluctuations in currencies, which may change
over time as our business practices evolve, that could impact our operating
results, liquidity and financial condition. We operate and invest globally.
Adverse movements in currency exchange rates may negatively affect our business
due to a number of situations, including the following:



•

Foreign exchange hedging transactions could affect our cash
flows and earnings because they may require the payment of
structuring fees and they may limit the U.S. dollar value of
royalties from licensees’ sales that are denominated in foreign
currencies.

Because we have made significant investments in and loans to CDMA wireless
operators, our financial condition may be harmed if those CDMA wireless
operators are not successful.

We have provided significant funding to CDMA wireless operators to promote
the worldwide adoption of CDMA products and services. Due to financial and
competitive challenges facing CDMA wireless operators, we cannot assure you
that our investments will generate financial returns or that they will result
in increased adoption or continued use of CDMA technologies. Domestic and
international CDMA wireless operators to whom we have provided financing have
limited operating histories, are faced with significant capital requirements,
are highly leveraged and/or have limited financial resources. If these CDMA
wireless operators are not successful, we may have to write down our
investments in or loans to these wireless operators. Certain wireless operators
to whom we have provided financing have defaulted on their obligations to us,
and it is possible that others will default on their obligations to us in the
future. Any such write-downs or defaults could have a material adverse effect
on our financial condition and operating results. Due to currency fluctuations
and international risks, foreign borrowers may become unable to pay their debts
to us from revenues generated by their projects that are denominated in local
currencies. Further, we may not be permitted to retain a security interest in
any spectrum licenses held by foreign wireless operators that we finance. These
spectrum licenses initially may constitute the primary asset of the wireless
operators. The amount of financing that we have provided and that we could
provide in the future is substantial. If we are unable to recover our
investments in or loans to these CDMA wireless operators, our financial
condition may be harmed. See “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note
2 – Marketable Securities, Note 3 – Composition of Certain Financial Statement
Captions, Finance Receivables and Note 4 – Investments in Other Entities.”

We may engage in strategic transactions that could result in significant
charges or management disruption and fail to enhance stockholder value.

From time to time, we engage in strategic transactions with the goal of
maximizing stockholder value. In the past we have acquired businesses, entered
into joint ventures and made strategic investments in early stage companies and
venture funds or incubators to support global adoption of CDMA and the use of
the wireless Internet. Most of our strategic investments entail a high degree
of risk and will not become liquid until more than one year from the date of
investment, if at all.

We will continue to evaluate potential strategic transactions and
alternatives that we believe may enhance stockholder value. These potential
future transactions may include a variety of different business arrangements,
including acquisitions, spin-offs, strategic partnerships, joint ventures,
restructurings, divestitures, business combinations and investments. Although
our goal is to maximize stockholder value, such transactions may impair
stockholder value or otherwise adversely affect our business and the trading
price of our stock. Any such transaction may require us to incur non-recurring
or other charges and/or to consolidate or record our equity in losses and may
pose significant integration challenges and/or management and business
disruptions, any of which could harm our operating results and business.

We depend upon a limited number of third party manufacturers to provide
subassemblies and parts for our products. Any disruptions in the operations of,
or the loss of, any of these third parties could harm our ability to meet our
delivery obligations to our customers and increase our cost of sales.

QCT Segment

We subcontract all of the manufacturing and assembly, and most of the
testing, of our integrated circuits. We depend upon a limited number of third
parties to perform these functions, some of which are only available from
single sources with which we do not have long-term contracts. IBM, Taiwan
Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. and United Microelectronics are the primary
foundry partners for our family of baseband integrated circuits. IBM, Motorola
and Texas Instruments are the primary foundry partners for our family of radio
frequency and analog integrated circuits. Our reliance on a sole-source vendor
primarily occurs during the start-up phase of a new product. Once a new product
reaches a significant volume level, we typically establish alternative
suppliers for technologies that we consider critical. Our reliance on sole or
limited-source vendors involves risks. These risks include possible shortages
of capacity, product performance shortfalls, and reduced controls over delivery
schedules, manufacturing capability, quality assurance, quantity and costs. We
have no firm long-term commitments from our manufacturers to



supply products to us for any specific period, or in any specific
quantity, except as may be provided in a particular purchase order. As a
result, these manufacturers may allocate, and in the past have allocated,
capacity to the production of other products while reducing deliveries to us on
short notice.

Our operations may also be harmed by lengthy or recurring disruptions at
any of the facilities of our manufacturers and may be harmed by disruptions in
the distribution channels from our suppliers and to our customers. These
disruptions may include labor strikes, work stoppages, widespread illness,
terrorism, war, fire, earthquake, flooding or other natural disasters. These
disruptions could cause significant delays in shipments until we are able to
shift the products from an affected manufacturer to another manufacturer. The
loss of a significant third-party manufacturer or the inability of a
third-party manufacturer to meet performance and quality specifications or
delivery schedules could harm our ability to meet our delivery obligations to
our customers.

In addition, one or more of our manufacturers may obtain licenses from us
to manufacture CDMA integrated circuits that compete with our products. In this
event, the manufacturer could elect to allocate scarce components and
manufacturing capacity to their own products and reduce deliveries to us. In
the event of a loss of or a decision to change a key third-party manufacturer,
qualifying a new manufacturer and commencing volume production or testing could
involve delay and expense, resulting in lost revenues, reduced operating
margins and possible loss of customers.

QWI Segment

Several of the critical subassemblies and parts used in our QWBS
division’s existing and proposed products are currently available only from
third-party single or limited sources. These include items such as electronic
and radio frequency components, and other sophisticated parts and subassemblies
which are used in the OmniTRACS, OmniExpress and GlobalTRACS products. These
third parties include companies such as Tyco International (M/A Com), Rakon,
Mini-Circuits, Cambridge Tool & Mfg., Andrew Corporation, American Design,
Deutsch ECD, PCI Limited, KeyTronic EMS, Seavey Engineering Associates, Symbol
Technologies, Navman NZ, Thomson-Airpax Mechatronics, Eagle-Picher Industries
and Sony/Ericsson. Our reliance on sole or limited source vendors involves
risks. These risks include possible shortages of certain key components,
product performance shortfalls, and reduced control over delivery schedules,
manufacturing capability, quality and costs. In the event of a long-term supply
interruption, alternate sources could be developed in a majority of the cases.
The inability to obtain adequate quantities of significant compliant materials
on a timely basis could have a material adverse effect on our business,
operating results, liquidity and financial position.

A reduction or interruption in component supply or a significant increase in
component prices could have a material adverse effect on our business or
profitability.

Our ability to meet customer demands depends, in part, on our ability to
obtain timely and adequate delivery of parts and components from our suppliers
and internal manufacturing capacity. We have experienced component shortages in
the past, including components for our integrated circuit products, that have
adversely affected our operations. Although we work closely with our suppliers
to avoid these types of shortages, we may continue to encounter these problems
in the future. Component shortages could adversely affect our ability and that
of our customers and licensees to ship products on a timely basis and our
customers’ or licensees’ demand for our products. Any such shipment delays or
declines in demand could reduce our revenues and harm our ability to achieve or
sustain acceptable levels of profitability. Additionally, failure to meet
customer demand in a timely manner could damage our reputation and harm our
customer relationships.

Defects or errors in our products or in those made by our suppliers could harm
our relations with our customers and expose us to liability. Similar problems
related to the products of our customers or licensees would harm our business.

Our software and integrated circuit products are inherently complex and
may contain defects and errors that are detected only when the products are in
use. Further, because our products perform critical functions in our customers’
products and networks, such defects or errors could have a serious impact on
our customers, which could damage our reputation, harm our customer
relationships and expose us to liability. Defects or impurities in our
components, materials or software or those used by our customers or licensees,
equipment failures or other difficulties could adversely affect our ability and
that of our customers and licensees to ship products on a timely basis as well
as customer or licensee demand for our products. Any such shipment delays or
declines in demand could reduce our revenues and harm our ability to achieve or
sustain acceptable levels of profitability. We and our



customers or licensees may also experience component or software failures
or defects which could require significant product recalls, reworks and/or
repairs which are not covered by warranty reserves and which could consume a
substantial portion of the capacity of our third-party manufacturers or those
of our customers or licensees. Resolving any defect or failure related issues
could consume financial and/or engineering resources that could affect future
product release schedules.

Global economic conditions that impact the wireless communications industry
could negatively affect our revenues and operating results.

Global economic weakness can have wide-ranging effects on markets that we
serve, particularly wireless communications equipment manufacturers and network
operators. The wireless communications industry recently appears to be
recovering from an industry-wide recession. We cannot predict whether a
recovery will continue, the rate of any such recovery, or what effects negative
events, such as war, may have on the economy. The continued threat of terrorism
and heightened security and military action in response to this threat, or any
future acts of terrorism, may cause further disruptions to the global economy
and to the wireless communications industry and create further uncertainties.
Further, an economic recovery may not benefit us in the near term. If it does
not, our ability to increase or maintain our revenues and operating results may
be impaired. In addition, because we intend to continue to make significant
investments in research and development and to maintain extensive ongoing
customer service and support capability, any decline in the rate of growth of
our revenues will have a significant adverse impact on our operating results.

Our industry is subject to competition that could result in decreased demand
for our products and the products of our customers and licensees and/or
declining average selling prices for our licensees’ products and our products,
negatively affecting our revenues and operating results.

We currently face significant competition in our markets and expect that
competition will continue. Competition in the telecommunications market is
affected by various factors including:

This competition may result in reduced average selling prices for our
products and those of our customers and licensees. Reductions in the average
selling price of our licensees’ products generally result in reduced royalties.
While pricing pressures from competition may, to a large extent, be mitigated
by the introduction of new features and functionality in our licensees’
products, there is no guarantee that such mitigation will occur. We anticipate
that additional competitors will enter our markets as a result of growth
opportunities in wireless telecommunications, the trend toward global expansion
by foreign and domestic competitors, technological and public policy changes
and relatively low barriers to entry in selected segments of the industry.

Our competitors include companies that promote non-CDMA technologies and
companies that design competing CDMA integrated circuits, such as Nokia,
Motorola, Philips, Ericsson, Texas Instruments, Intel, NEC, Nortel, VIA
Telecom, Samsung, Matsushita and Siemens, all of whom are also our licensees
with the exception of Intel. With respect to our OmniTRACS, TruckMAIL,
OmniExpress, GlobalTRACS, QConnect, EutelTRACS and LINQ products and services,
our existing competitors are aggressively pricing their products and services
and could continue to do so in the future. In addition, these competitors are
offering new value-added products and services similar in many cases to those
we have developed or are developing. Emergence of new competitors, particularly



those offering low cost terrestrial-based products and current as well as
future satellite-based systems, may impact margins and intensify competition in
new markets. Similarly, some original equipment manufacturers of trucks and
truck components are beginning to offer built-in, on-board communications and
position location reporting systems that may impact our margins and intensify
competition in our current and new markets. Some potential competitors of our
QWBS business, if they are successful, may harm our ability to compete in
certain markets.

Many of these current and potential competitors have advantages over us, including:

As a result of these and other factors, our competitors may be more
successful than us. In addition, we anticipate additional competitors will
enter the market for products based on 3G standards. These competitors may have
more established relationships and distribution channels in markets not
currently deploying wireless communications technology. These competitors also
may have established or may establish financial or strategic relationships
among themselves or with our existing or potential customers, resellers or
other third parties. These relationships may affect customers’ decisions to
purchase products or license technology from us. Accordingly, new competitors
or alliances among competitors could emerge and rapidly acquire significant
market share to our detriment.

Our operating results are subject to substantial quarterly and annual
fluctuations and to market downturns.

Our revenues, earnings and other operating results have fluctuated
significantly in the past and may fluctuate significantly in the future.
General economic or other conditions causing a downturn in the market for our
products or technology, affecting the timing of customer orders or causing
cancellations or rescheduling of orders could also adversely affect our
operating results. Moreover, our customers may change delivery schedules or
cancel or reduce orders without incurring significant penalties and generally
are not subject to minimum purchase requirements.

Our future operating results will be affected by many factors, including,
but not limited to: our ability to retain existing or secure anticipated
customers or licensees, both domestically and internationally; our ability to
develop, introduce and market new technology, products and services on a timely
basis; management of inventory by us and our customers and their customers in
response to shifts in market demand; changes in the mix of technology and
products developed, licensed, produced and sold; seasonal customer demand; and
other factors described elsewhere in this report and in these risk factors.

These factors affecting our future operating results are difficult to
forecast and could harm our quarterly or annual operating results. If our
operating results fail to meet the expectations of investment analysts or
investors in any period, the market price of our common stock may decline.

Our stock price is volatile.

The stock market in general, and the stock prices of technology-based and
wireless communications companies in particular, have experienced extreme
volatility that often has been unrelated to the operating performance of any
specific public company. The market price of our common stock has fluctuated in
the past and is likely to fluctuate in the future as well. Factors that may
have a significant impact on the market price of our stock include:



Our future earnings and stock price may be subject to significant
volatility, particularly on a quarterly basis. Shortfalls in our revenues or
earnings in any given period relative to the levels expected by securities
analysts could immediately, significantly and adversely affect the trading
price of our common stock.

From time to time, we may repurchase our common stock at prices that may
later be higher than the fair market value of the stock. This could result in a
loss of value for stockholders if the shares were reissued at lower prices.

In the past, securities class action litigation has often been brought
against a company following periods of volatility in the market price of its
securities. Due to the volatility of our stock price, we may be the target of
securities litigation in the future. Securities litigation could result in
substantial costs and divert management’s attention and resources.

Our industry is subject to rapid technological change that we must keep pace
with to successfully compete.

New technological innovations generally require a substantial investment
before they are commercially viable. We intend to continue to make substantial
investments in developing new products and technologies, and it is possible
that our development efforts will not be successful and that our new
technologies will not result in meaningful revenues. In particular, we intend
to continue to invest significant resources in developing integrated circuit
products to support multimedia applications, high-speed wireless Internet
access and multimode, multiband, multinetwork operation including CDMA2000
1X/1xEV-DO/1xEV-DV, GSM/GPRS, WLAN, WCDMA and GPS position location
technologies. We will also continue our significant development efforts with
respect to our BREW applications development platform, providing applications
developers with an open standard platform for wireless devices on which to
develop their products. An open standard platform means that BREW can be made
to interface with many software applications, including those developed by
others. We cannot assure you that the revenues generated from these products
will meet our expectations.

The market for our products and technology is characterized by many factors, including:

•

rapid technological advances and evolving industry standards;

•

changes in customer requirements;

•

frequent introductions of new products and enhancements; and

•

evolving methods of building and operating telecommunications systems.

Our future success will depend on our ability to continue to develop and
introduce new products, technology and enhancements on a timely basis. Our
future success will also depend on our ability to keep pace with technological
developments, protect our intellectual property, satisfy varying customer
requirements, price our products competitively and achieve market acceptance.
The introduction of products embodying new technologies and the emergence of
new industry standards could render our existing products and technology, and
products and technology currently under development, obsolete and unmarketable.
If we fail to anticipate or respond adequately to technological developments or
customer requirements, or experience any significant delays in development,



introduction or shipment of our products and technology in commercial
quantities, demand for our products and our customers’ and licensees’ products
that use our technology could decrease, and our competitive position could be
damaged.

The enforcement and protection of our intellectual property rights may be
expensive and could divert our valuable resources.

We rely primarily on patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws,
as well as nondisclosure and confidentiality agreements and other methods, to
protect our proprietary information, technologies and processes, including our
patent portfolio. Policing unauthorized use of our products and technologies is
difficult. We cannot be certain that the steps we have taken will prevent the
misappropriation or unauthorized use of our proprietary information and
technologies, particularly in foreign countries where the laws may not protect
our proprietary rights as fully as United States laws.

The vast majority of our patents and patent applications relate to our
CDMA digital wireless communications technology and much of the remainder of
our patents and patent applications relate to our gpsOne, BREW, OmniTRACS,
Digital Cinema, Globalstar and Eudora products. Litigation may be required to
enforce our intellectual property rights, protect our trade secrets or
determine the validity and scope of proprietary rights of others. As a result
of any such litigation, we could lose our proprietary rights or incur
substantial unexpected operating costs. Any action we take to protect our
intellectual property rights could be costly and could absorb significant
management time and attention, which, in turn, could negatively impact our
operating results. In addition, failure to protect our trademark rights could
impair our brand identity.

Claims by other companies that we infringe their intellectual property or that
patents on which we rely are invalid could adversely affect our business.

From time to time, companies may assert patent, copyright and other
intellectual proprietary rights to our technologies or technologies used in our
industry. These claims may result in our involvement in litigation. We may not
prevail in such litigation given the complex technical issues and inherent
uncertainties in intellectual property litigation. If any of our products were
found to infringe on protected technology, we could be required to redesign or
license such technology and/or pay damages or other compensation to the
infringed party. If we were unable to license protected technology used in our
products, we could be prohibited from making and selling such products.

In addition, as the number of competitors in our market increases and the
functionality of our products is enhanced and overlaps with the products of
other companies, we may become subject to claims of infringement or
misappropriation of the intellectual property rights of others. Any claims,
with or without merit, could be time consuming, result in costly litigation,
divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel or cause product
release or shipment delays, any of which could have a material adverse effect
upon our operating results. In any potential dispute involving our patents or
other intellectual property, our licensees could also become the targets of
litigation. Any such litigation could severely disrupt the business of our
licensees, which in turn could hurt our relations with our licensees and cause
our revenues to decrease.

A number of other companies have claimed to own patents essential to
various proposed 3G CDMA standards. If we or other product manufacturers are
required to obtain additional licenses and/or pay royalties to one or more
patent holders, this could have a material adverse effect on the commercial
implementation of our CDMA products and technologies and our profitability.

Other companies or entities also may commence actions seeking to establish
the invalidity of our patents. In the event that one or more of our patents are
challenged, a court may invalidate the patent or determine that the patent is
not enforceable, which could harm our competitive position. If any of our key
patents are invalidated, or if the scope of the claims in any of these patents
is limited by court decision, we could be prevented from licensing the
invalidated or limited portion of our technology and our licensees may be
prevented from manufacturing and selling the products that incorporate such
technology without obtaining a license to use a third party’s technology. Even
if such a patent challenge is not successful, it could be expensive and time
consuming, divert management attention from our business and harm our
reputation.

Potential tax liabilities could adversely affect our results.

We are subject to income taxes in both the United States and numerous
foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining our
worldwide provision for income taxes. In the ordinary course of our



business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate
tax determination is uncertain. We are regularly under audit by tax
authorities. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the final
determination of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially
different than that which is reflected in historical income tax provisions and
accruals. Should additional taxes be assessed as a result of an audit or
litigation, a material effect on our income tax provision and net income in the
period or periods for which that determination is made could result.

The high amount of capital required to obtain radio frequency licenses and
deploy and expand wireless networks could slow the growth of the wireless
communications industry and adversely affect our business.

Our growth is dependent upon the increased use of wireless communications
services that utilize our CDMA technology. In order to provide wireless
communications services, wireless operators must obtain rights to use specific
radio frequencies. The allocation of frequencies is regulated in the United
States and other countries throughout the world and limited spectrum space is
allocated to wireless communications services. Industry growth may be affected
by the amount of capital required to: obtain licenses to use new frequencies;
deploy wireless networks to offer voice and data services; and expand wireless
networks to grow voice and data services. Over the last several years, the
amount paid for spectrum licenses has increased significantly, particularly for
frequencies used in connection with 3G technology. In addition, litigation and
disputes involving prior and future spectrum auctions has delayed the expansion
of wireless networks in the United States and elsewhere, and it is possible
that this delay could continue for a significant amount of time. The
significant cost of licenses and wireless networks, and delays associated with
disputes over new licenses, may slow the growth of the industry if wireless
operators are unable to obtain or service the additional capital necessary to
implement 3G wireless networks. Our growth could be adversely affected if this
occurs.

If we experience product liability claims or recalls, we may incur significant
expenses and experience decreased demand for our products.

Testing, manufacturing, marketing and use of our products and those of our
licensees and customers entails the risk of product liability. Although we
believe our product liability insurance will be adequate to protect against
product liability claims, we cannot assure you that we will be able to continue
to maintain such insurance at a reasonable cost or in sufficient amounts to
protect us against losses due to product liability. Our inability to maintain
insurance at an acceptable cost or to otherwise protect against potential
product liability claims could prevent or inhibit the commercialization of our
products and those of our licensees and customers and harm our future operating
results. In addition, a product liability claim or recall could harm our
reputation and result in decreased demand for our products.

If wireless phones pose safety risks, we may be subject to new regulations, and
demand for our products and those of our licensees and customers may decrease.

Concerns over the effects of radio frequency emissions, even if unfounded,
may have the effect of discouraging the use of wireless phones, which would
decrease demand for our products and those of our licensees and customers. In
recent years, the FCC and foreign regulatory agencies have updated the
guidelines and methods they use for evaluating radio frequency emissions from
radio equipment, including wireless phones. In addition, interest groups have
requested that the FCC investigate claims that wireless communications
technologies pose health concerns and cause interference with airbags, hearing
aids and medical devices. There also may be some safety risks associated with
the use of wireless phones while driving. Concerns over these safety risks and
the effect of any legislation that may be adopted in response to these risks
could reduce demand for our products and those of our licensees and customers
in the United States as well as foreign countries.

Our business depends on the availability of satellite and other networks for
our OmniTRACS, EutelTRACS, OmniExpress, LINQ, GlobalTRACS and QConnect systems
and other communications products.

Our OmniTRACS system currently operates in the United States market on
leased Ku-band satellite transponders. Our data satellite transponder and
position reporting satellite transponder lease runs through October 2006 and
includes transponder and satellite protection (back-up capacity in the event of
a transponder or satellite failure). Based on system capacity analysis, we
believe that the United States OmniTRACS operations will not require additional
transponder capacity through 2004. We believe that in the event additional
transponder capacity would be required in fiscal 2004 or in future years,
additional capacity will be available on acceptable terms. However, we cannot
assure you that we will be able to acquire additional transponder capacity on
acceptable terms in a timely



manner. A failure to maintain adequate satellite capacity would harm our
business, operating results, liquidity and financial position.

Our OmniExpress, LINQ, GlobalTRACS, QConnect and OmniOne systems are
terrestrial-based products and thus rely on various wireless terrestrial
communications networks operated by third parties. We believe these terrestrial
networks will be available for our products; however, we cannot assure you that
these networks will continue to be available to us or that they will perform
adequately for our needs. The unavailability or nonperformance of these network
systems could harm our business.

Our business and operations would suffer in the event of system failures.

Despite system redundancy, the implementation of security measures and the
existence of a Disaster Recovery Plan for our internal information technology
networking systems, our systems are vulnerable to damages from computer
viruses, unauthorized access, energy blackouts, natural disasters, terrorism,
war and telecommunication failures. Any system failure, accident or security
breach that causes interruptions in our operations or to our customers’ or
licensees’ operations could result in a material disruption to our business. To
the extent that any disruption or security breach results in a loss or damage
to our customers’ data or applications, or inappropriate disclosure of
confidential information, we may incur liability as a result. In addition, we
may incur additional costs to remedy the damages caused by these disruptions or
security breaches.

Message transmissions for domestic OmniTRACS, OmniExpress, GlobalTRACS,
QConnect and OmniOne operations are formatted and processed at the Network
Management Center in San Diego, California, which we operate, with a fully
redundant backup Network Management Center located in Las Vegas, Nevada. Our
Network Management Center operations are subject to system failures, which
could interrupt the services and have a material adverse effect on our
operating results.

From time to time, we install new or upgraded business management systems.
To the extent such systems fail or are not properly implemented, we may
experience material disruptions to our business that could have a material
adverse effect on our results of operations.

We cannot provide assurance that we will continue to declare dividends at all
or in any particular amounts.

We intend to continue to pay quarterly dividends subject to continued
capital availability and a determination that cash dividends continue to be in
the best interest of the stockholders. Our dividend policy may be affected by,
among other items, our views on potential future capital requirements,
including those related to research and development, creation and expansion of
sales distribution channels and investments and acquisitions, legal risks,
stock repurchase programs and challenges to our business model. Our dividend
policy may change from time to time, and we cannot provide assurance that we
will continue to declare dividends at all or in any particular amounts. A
change in our dividend policy could have a negative effect on our stock price.

Government regulation may adversely affect our business

.

Our products and those of our customers and licensees are subject to
various regulations, including FCC regulations in the United States and other
international regulations, as well as the specifications of national, regional
and international standards bodies. Changes in the regulation of our
activities, including changes in the allocation of available spectrum by the
United States government and other governments or exclusion or limitation of
our technology by a government or standards body, could have a material adverse
effect on our business, operating results, liquidity and financial position.

Our business and operating results will be harmed if we are unable to manage
growth in our business.

Certain of our businesses have experienced periods of rapid growth that
have placed, and may continue to place, significant demands on our managerial,
operational and financial resources. In order to manage this growth, we must
continue to improve and expand our management, operational and financial
systems and controls, including quality control and delivery and service
capabilities. We also need to continue to expand, train and manage our employee
base. We must carefully manage research and development capabilities and
production and inventory levels to meet product demand, new product
introductions and product and technology transitions. We cannot assure you that
we will be able to timely and effectively meet that demand and maintain the
quality standards required by our existing and potential customers and
licensees.



In addition, inaccuracies in our demand forecasts, or failure of the
systems used to develop the forecasts, could quickly result in either
insufficient or excessive inventories and disproportionate overhead expenses.
If we ineffectively manage our growth or are unsuccessful in recruiting and
retaining personnel, our business and operating results will be harmed.

We may not be able to attract and retain qualified employees.

Our future success depends largely upon the continued service of our Board
members, executive officers and other key management and technical personnel.
Our success also depends on our ability to continue to attract, retain and
motivate qualified personnel. In addition, implementing our product and
business strategy requires specialized engineering and other talent, and our
revenues are highly dependent on technological and product innovations. Key
employees represent a significant asset, and the competition for these
employees is intense in the wireless communications industry. Our fiscal 2004
plan anticipates a significant increase in engineering resources. If we are
unable to attract and retain the qualified employees that we need, our business
may be harmed.

We may have particular difficulty attracting and retaining key personnel
in periods of poor operating performance given the significant use of incentive
compensation by our competitors. We do not have employment agreements with our
key management personnel and do not maintain key person life insurance on any
of our personnel. The loss of one or more of our key employees or our inability
to attract, retain and motivate qualified personnel could negatively impact our
ability to design, develop and commercialize our products and technology.

Since our inception, we have used stock options and other long-term equity
incentives as a fundamental component of our employee compensation packages. We
believe that stock options and other long-term equity incentives directly
motivate our employees to maximize long-term stockholder value and, through the
use of long-term vesting, encourage employees to remain with us. New
regulations implemented by The NASDAQ National Market requiring shareholder
approval for all stock option plans as well as new regulations implemented by
the New York Stock Exchange, prohibiting member organizations from giving a
proxy to vote on equity-compensation plans unless the beneficial owner of the
shares has given voting instructions, could make it more difficult for us to
grant options to employees in the future. To the extent that new regulations
make it more difficult or expensive to grant options to employees, we may incur
increased compensation costs, change our equity compensation strategy or find
it difficult to attract, retain and motivate employees, each of which could
materially and adversely affect our business.

Future changes in financial accounting standards or practices or existing
taxation rules or practices may cause adverse unexpected revenue fluctuations
and affect our reported results of operations.

A change in accounting standards or practices or a change in existing
taxation rules or practices can have a significant effect on our reported
results and may even affect our reporting of transactions completed before the
change is effective. New accounting pronouncements and taxation rules and
varying interpretations of accounting pronouncements and taxation practice have
occurred and may occur in the future. Changes to existing rules or the
questioning of current practices may adversely affect our reported financial
results or the way we conduct our business.

For example, any changes requiring that we record compensation expense in
the statement of operations for employee stock options using the fair value
method or changes in existing taxation rules related to stock options could
have a significant negative effect on our reported results. Several agencies
and entities are considering, and the Financial Accounting Standards Board has
announced, proposals to change generally accepted accounting principles in the
United States that, if implemented, would require us to record charges to
earnings for employee stock option grants. This pending requirement would
negatively impact our earnings. For example, recording a charge for employee
stock options under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123,
“Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation,” would have reduced our net income by
$260 million and $234 million for fiscal 2003 and 2002, respectively, and
increased our net loss by $167 million for fiscal 2001.

Compliance with changing regulation of corporate governance and public
disclosure may result in additional expenses.

Changing laws, regulations and standards relating to corporate governance
and public disclosure, including the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, new SEC
regulations and NASDAQ National Market rules, are creating uncertainty for
companies such as ours. These new or changed laws, regulations and standards
are subject to varying interpretations in many cases due to their lack of
specificity, and as a result, their application in practice may evolve over
time as



new guidance is provided by regulatory and governing bodies, which could
result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and higher costs
necessitated by ongoing revisions to disclosure and governance practices. We
are committed to maintaining high standards of corporate governance and public
disclosure. As a result, we intend to invest resources to comply with evolving
laws, regulations and standards, and this investment may result in increased
general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management time and
attention from revenue-generating activities to compliance activities. If our
efforts to comply with new or changed laws, regulations and standards differ
from the activities intended by regulatory or governing bodies due to
ambiguities related to practice, our reputation may be harmed.

Our stockholder rights plan, certificate of incorporation and Delaware law
could adversely affect the performance of our stock.

Our certificate of incorporation provides for cumulative voting in the
election of directors. In addition, our certificate of incorporation provides
for a classified board of directors and includes a provision that requires the
approval of holders of at least 66 2/3% of our voting stock as a condition to a
merger or certain other business transactions with, or proposed by, a holder of
15% or more of our voting stock. This approval is not required in cases where
certain of our directors approve the transaction or where certain minimum price
criteria and other procedural requirements are met. Our certificate of
incorporation also requires the approval of holders of at least 66 2/3% of our
voting stock to amend or change the provisions mentioned relating to the
classified board, cumulative voting or the transaction approval. Under our
bylaws, stockholders are not permitted to call special meetings of our
stockholders. Finally, our certificate of incorporation provides that any
action required or permitted to be taken by our stockholders must be effected
at a duly called annual or special meeting rather than by any consent in
writing.

The classified board, transaction approval, special meeting and other
charter provisions may discourage certain types of transactions involving an
actual or potential change in our control. These provisions may also discourage
certain types of transactions in which our stockholders might otherwise receive
a premium for their shares over then current market prices and may limit our
stockholders’ ability to approve transactions that they may deem to be in their
best interests.

Further, we have distributed a dividend of one right for each outstanding
share of our common stock pursuant to the terms of our preferred share purchase
rights plan. These rights will cause substantial dilution to the ownership of a
person or group that attempts to acquire us on terms not approved by our Board
of Directors and may have the effect of deterring hostile takeover attempts. In
addition, our Board of Directors has the authority to fix the rights and
preferences of and issue shares of preferred stock. This right may have the
effect of delaying or preventing a change in our control without action by our
stockholders.

In addition to the facilities above, we also own or lease an additional
1,333,884 square feet of properties that are leased or subleased to third
parties. Our leases expire at varying dates through 2012 not including renewals
that would be at our option.

In fiscal 2003, we began construction on two facilities in San Diego,
California totaling one million square feet to meet the requirements projected
in our long-term business plan. We believe that our facilities will be suitable
and adequate for the present purposes, and that the productive capacity in such
facilities is substantially being utilized.

Item 3. Legal Proceedings

Schwartz,
et al v. QUALCOMM:

87 former QUALCOMM employees filed a lawsuit
against us in the District Court for Boulder County, Colorado, alleging claims
for intentional misrepresentation, nondisclosure and concealment, violation of
C.R.S. Section 8-2-104 (obtaining workers by misrepresentation), breach of
contract, breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing,
promissory estoppel, negligent misrepresentation, unjust enrichment, violation
of California Labor Code Section 970, violation of California Civil Code
Sections 1709-1710, rescission, violation of California Business & Professions
Code Section 17200 and violation of California Civil Code Section 1575. The
complaint seeks economic, emotional distress and punitive damages and
unspecified



amounts of interest. On November 29, 2001, the Court granted our
motion to dismiss 17 of the plaintiffs from the lawsuit. Subsequently, the
Court dismissed three other plaintiffs from the lawsuit. On November 18, 2002,
the Court granted our motion to dismiss 61 of the remaining 67 plaintiffs from
the lawsuit. We subsequently resolved the matters with the remaining
plaintiffs. Those plaintiffs whose claims were dismissed have appealed.
Although there can be no assurance that an unfavorable outcome of the dispute
would not have a material adverse effect on our operating results, liquidity or
financial position, we believe the claims are without merit and will vigorously
defend the action.

Hanig et al. v. QUALCOMM, Boesel, et al v. QUALCOMM, Stone et al v.
QUALCOMM, Ortiz et al v. QUALCOMM, Shannon et al. v. QUALCOMM, Deshon et al v.
QUALCOMM, Earnhart et al. v. QUALCOMM.

These cases were filed in San Diego
County Superior Court by over 100 former employees, alleging claims for
declaratory relief, breach of contract, intentional/negligent fraud,
concealment, rescission, specific performance, work, labor and services, breach
of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, violation of California
Business & Professions Code Section 17200 and unjust enrichment, claiming that
they were entitled to full vesting of unvested stock options as a result of the
sale of our infrastructure business to Ericsson in 1999. We have answered the
complaints, which have been consolidated. Although there can be no assurance
that an unfavorable outcome of the dispute would not have a material adverse
effect on our operating results, liquidity or financial position, we believe
the claims are without merit and will vigorously defend the action.

GTE Wireless Incorporated (GTE) v. QUALCOMM:

On June 29, 1999, GTE filed
an action against us in the United States District Court for the Eastern
District of Virginia seeking damages and injunctive relief and asserting that
wireless telephones sold by us infringe a single patent allegedly owned by GTE.
On September 15, 1999, the Court granted our motion to transfer the action to
the United States District Court for the Southern District of California. On
February 14, 2002, the District Court granted our motion for summary judgment
that our products did not infringe GTE’s asserted patent and denied GTE’s
motion seeking summary judgment of infringement. On July 14, 2003, GTE and we
entered into a settlement agreement dismissing all claims and counterclaims
with prejudice.

Durante,
et al v. QUALCOMM:

On February 2, 2000, three former employees
filed a putative class action against us, ostensibly on behalf of themselves
and those former employees of ours whose employment was terminated in April
1999. Virtually all of the purported class of plaintiffs received severance
packages at the time of the termination of their employment, in exchange for a
release of claims, other than federal age discrimination claims, against us.
The complaint was filed in California Superior Court in and for the County of
Los Angeles and purports to state ten causes of action including breach of
contract, age discrimination, violation of Labor Code Section 200, violation of
Labor Code Section 970, unfair business practices, intentional infliction of
emotional distress, unjust enrichment, breach of the covenant of good faith and
fair dealing, declaratory relief and undue influence. The complaint seeks an
order accelerating all unvested stock options for the members of the class,
plus economic and liquidated damages of an unspecified amount. On June 27,
2000, the case was ordered transferred from Los Angeles County Superior Court
to San Diego County Superior Court. On July 3, 2000, we removed the case to the
United States District Court for the Southern District of California, and
discovery commenced. On May 29, 2001, the Court dismissed all plaintiffs’
claims except for claims arising under the federal Age Discrimination in
Employment Act. On July 16, 2001, the Court granted conditional class
certification on the remaining claims, to be revisited by the Court at the end
of the discovery period. On April 15, 2003, the Court granted our summary
judgment motions as to all remaining class members’ disparate impact claims. On
June 18, 2003, the Court ordered decertification of the class and dismissed the
remaining claims of the opt-in plaintiffs without prejudice. Plaintiffs have
filed an appeal. On June 20, 2003, 76 of the opt-in plaintiffs filed an action
in Federal District Court for the Southern District of California, alleging
violations of the Age Discrimination in Employment Act as a result of their
layoffs in 1999. To date, the complaint has not been served. Although there can
be no assurance that an unfavorable outcome of these disputes would not have a
material adverse effect on our operating results, liquidity or financial
position, we believe the claims are without merit and will vigorously defend
the actions.

Zoltar Satellite Alarm Systems, Inc. v. QUALCOMM and SnapTrack:

On March
30, 2001, Zoltar Satellite Alarm Systems, Inc. (Zoltar) filed suit against us
and SnapTrack, a QUALCOMM wholly-owned subsidiary, in the United States
District Court for the Northern District of California seeking damages and
injunctive relief and alleging infringement of three patents. On August 27,
2001, Zoltar filed an amended complaint adding Sprint Corp. as a named
defendant and narrowing certain infringement claims against SnapTrack and us.
Since then, Zoltar has dismissed Sprint Corp. as a defendant. On September 23,
2002, the court denied Zoltar’s motion for summary judgment that the accused
products infringe. Since then, the court has denied a second motion for summary
judgment



by Zoltar and denied summary judgment motions by us with leave to
renew the motions at trial. The court is also considering further claim
construction and will consider further evidence on invalidity prior to trial.
Trial is currently set for February 24, 2004. Although there can be no
assurance that an unfavorable outcome of this dispute would not have a material
adverse effect on our operating results, liquidity or financial position, we
believe the claims are without merit and will vigorously defend the action.

Texas Instruments:

On July 25, 2003, we filed an action in Delaware
Superior Court against Texas Instruments Incorporated for breach of a patent
portfolio license agreement between the parties, seeking damages and
other relief. On September 23, 2003, Texas
Instruments filed an action in Delaware Chancery Court against us alleging
breach of the same agreement, seeking damages and
other relief. Although there can be no assurance that an
unfavorable outcome of the action brought by Texas Instruments would not have a
material adverse effect on our operating results, liquidity or financial
position, we believe the claims are without merit and will vigorously defend
the action.

We have been named, along with many other manufacturers of wireless
phones, wireless operators and industry-related organizations, as a defendant
in purported class action lawsuits (In re Wireless Telephone Frequency
Emissions Products Liability Litigation, United States District Court for the
District of Maryland), and in several individually filed actions, seeking
personal injury, economic and/or punitive damages arising out of our sale of
cellular phones. On March 5, 2003, the Court granted the defendants motions to
dismiss five of the consolidated cases (Pinney, Gimpleson, Gillian, Farina and
Naquin) on the grounds that the claims were preempted by federal law. On April
2, 2003, the plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal of this order and the Court’s
order denying remand. All remaining cases filed against us allege personal
injury as a result of their use of a wireless telephone. The courts that have
reviewed similar claims against other companies to date have held that there
was insufficient scientific basis for the plaintiffs’ claims in those cases,
and the judge responsible for the multi-district litigation proceedings
recently made such a ruling (which was upheld on appeal) in another case to
which we are not a party. Although there can be no assurance that an
unfavorable outcome of these and other disputes would not have a material
adverse effect on our operating results, liquidity or financial position, we
believe the claims are without merit and will vigorously defend the actions.

We have not recorded any accrual for contingent liability associated with
the legal proceedings described above based on our belief that a liability,
while possible, is not probable. Further, any possible range of loss cannot be
estimated at this time. We are engaged in numerous other legal actions arising
in the ordinary course of our business and believe that the ultimate outcome of
these actions will not have a material adverse effect on our operating results,
liquidity or financial position.

Item 4. Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders

No matters were submitted to a vote of security holders during the quarter

on November 28, 2003. We intend to continue to pay quarterly dividends subject
to continued capital availability and a determination that cash dividends
continue to be in the best interests of the stockholders. Our dividend policy
may be affected by, among other items, our views on potential future capital
requirements, including those relating to research and development, creation
and expansion of sales distribution channels and investments and acquisitions,
legal risks, stock repurchase programs and challenges to our business model.

Employee Stock Options

Our stock option plans are part of a broad-based, long-term retention
program that is intended to attract and retain talented employees and directors
and align stockholder and employee interests.

Pursuant to our 2001 Stock Option Plan (2001 Plan), we may grant options
to selected employees, directors and consultants to purchase shares of our
common stock at a price not less than the fair market value of the stock at the
date of grant. The 2001 Plan provides for the grant of both incentive stock
options and non-qualified stock options. Generally, options outstanding vest
over periods not exceeding six years and are exercisable for up to ten years
from



the grant date. We also may grant options pursuant to our 2001
Non-Employee Directors’ Stock Option Plan (the 2001 Directors’ Plan). This plan
provides for non-qualified stock options to be granted to non-employee
directors at an exercise price of not less than fair market value of the stock
at the date of grant, vesting over periods not exceeding five years and
exercisable for up to ten years from the grant date. The Board of Directors may
terminate the 2001 Plan and/or the 2001 Directors’ Plan at any time though it
must nevertheless honor any stock options previously granted pursuant to the
plans.

Additional information regarding our stock option plans and plan activity
for fiscal 2003, 2002 and 2001 is provided in our consolidated financial
statements. See “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 8 – Employee
Benefit Plans.”

Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

In addition to historical information, the following discussion contains
forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual
results may differ substantially from those referred to herein due to a number
of factors, including but not limited to risks described in the section
entitled Risk Factors and elsewhere in this Annual Report. Our consolidated
financial data includes SnapTrack, Inc., Vésper Holding Ltd. and other
consolidated subsidiaries.

Overview

We design, manufacture and market digital wireless telecommunications
products and services based on CDMA and other technologies. We derive revenue
principally from sales of integrated circuit products, from license fees and
royalties from our intellectual property, from services and related hardware
sales and from software development and related services. Operating expenses
primarily consist of cost of equipment and services revenues, research and
development, selling, general and administrative, amortization of
acquisition-related intangible assets, and asset impairment charges.

Our QUALCOMM CDMA Technologies (QCT) segment is a leading developer and
supplier of CDMA-based integrated circuits and system software for wireless
voice and data communications and global positioning system products. QCT
software products are the interface link between the operating system that
controls the phone and the functionality embedded in our integrated circuit
products. QCT products are sold to many of the world’s leading wireless phone
and infrastructure manufacturers. QCT revenues comprised 61%, 52% and 51% of
total consolidated revenues in fiscal 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively.

Our QUALCOMM Technology Licensing (QTL) segment grants licenses to use our
intellectual property portfolio, which includes certain patent rights essential
to and/or useful in the manufacture and sale of CDMA (including cdmaOne,
CDMA2000 1X/1x EV-DO/1xEV-DV, TD-SCDMA and WCDMA) products. QTL receives
license fees as well as ongoing royalties based on worldwide sales by licensees
of products incorporating our intellectual property. QTL revenues comprised
25%, 28% and 29% of total consolidated revenues in fiscal 2003, 2002 and 2001,
respectively.

Our QUALCOMM Wireless & Internet (QWI) segment, which includes QUALCOMM
Wireless Business Solutions (QWBS), QUALCOMM Internet Services (QIS) and
QUALCOMM Digital Media (QDM), generates revenue primarily through mobile
communication products and services, software, and software development aimed
at support and delivery of wireless applications. QWBS provides satellite and
terrestrial-based two-way data messaging and position reporting services to
transportation companies, private fleets and construction equipment fleets. QIS
provides the BREW product and services for the development and over-the-air
CDMA deployment of data services on wireless devices. QIS also provides QChat, which
enables virtually instantaneous push-to-talk functionality on CDMA wireless devices.
The QDM division is comprised of the Government Systems and Digital Cinema
businesses. The Government Systems business provides development, hardware and
analytical expertise to United States government agencies involving wireless
communications technologies. The Digital Cinema business develops technologies
to support the processing, transmission and management of content for a variety
of media applications, including the delivery of digitized motion pictures. QWI
revenues comprised 12%, 14% and 16% of total consolidated revenues in fiscal
2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively.

Our QUALCOMM Strategic Initiatives (QSI) segment makes strategic
investments to promote the worldwide adoption of CDMA products and services for
wireless voice and Internet data communications. Our strategy has been to invest in
CDMA operators, licensed device manufacturers and start-up companies that we
believe open new markets for CDMA technology, support the design and
introduction of new CDMA-based products or possess unique capabilities or
technology to promote Internet data communications. QSI’s revenues relate
primarily to the consolidation of our investment in Vésper Holding. QSI
revenues comprised 3% and 4% of total consolidated revenues in fiscal 2003 and
2002, respectively. QSI did not generate revenues in 2001.

Global economic weakness can have wide-ranging effects on markets that we
serve, particularly wireless communications equipment manufacturers and network
operators. The wireless communications industry recently appears to be
recovering from an industry-wide recession. We cannot predict whether a
recovery will continue, the rate of such recovery, or what effects negative
events, such as war, may have on the economy. Further, an economic recovery may
not benefit us in the near term. If it does not, our ability to increase or
maintain our revenues and operating results may be impaired. To increase our
revenues and market share in future periods, we are dependent



upon the adoption and commercial deployment of 3G wireless communications
equipment, products and services based on our CDMA technology. Although network
operators have commercially deployed CDMA2000 1X, we cannot predict the timing
or success of other commercial deployments. If existing deployments are not
commercially successful, or if new commercial deployments of CDMA2000 1X are
delayed or unsuccessful, our business and financial results may be harmed.

We currently face significant competition in our markets and expect that
competition will continue. This competition may result in reduced average
selling prices for our products and those of our customers and licensees.
Reductions in the average selling price of our licensees’ products generally
result in reduced average royalties. While pricing pressures resulting from
competition may, to a large extent, be mitigated by the introduction of new
features and functionality in our licensees’ products, there is no guarantee
that such mitigation will occur.

We will continue to expand our international sales operations and enter
new international markets. This expansion will require significant management
attention and financial resources to successfully develop direct and indirect
international sales and support channels, and we cannot assure you that we will
be successful or that our expenditures in this effort will not exceed the
amount of any resulting revenues. If we are not able to maintain or increase
international market demand for our products and technologies, then we may not
be able to maintain an acceptable rate of growth in our business.

Revenues from customers in South Korea, the United States, and Japan
comprised 43%, 22% and 15%, respectively, of total consolidated revenues in
fiscal 2003, as compared to 37%, 30%, and 18%, respectively, in fiscal 2002,
and 35%, 35% and 22%, respectively, in fiscal 2001. We distinguish revenue from
external customers by geographic areas based on customer location. The increase
in revenues from customers in South Korea, as a percentage of the total, is
primarily attributed to higher chipset sales to phone manufacturers in South
Korea who have leading CDMA market share in South Korea and worldwide. The
decrease in revenues from customers in the United States and Japan, as a
percentage of the total, is primarily attributed to overall increases in
revenues in geographic regions other than the United States and Japan.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

Our discussion and analysis of our results of operations and liquidity and
capital resources are based on our consolidated financial statements which have
been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in
the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to
make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets,
liabilities, revenues and expenses, and disclosure of contingent assets and
liabilities. On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates and judgments,
including those related to revenue recognition, adequacy of allowances for
doubtful accounts, valuation of intangible assets and investments, income
taxes, and litigation. We base our estimates on historical and anticipated
results and trends and on various other assumptions that we believe are
reasonable under the circumstances, including assumptions as to future events.
These estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values
of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. By
their nature, estimates are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty.
Actual results that differ from our estimates could have a significant adverse
effect on our operating results and financial position. We believe that the
following significant accounting policies and assumptions may involve a higher
degree of judgment and complexity than others.

Revenue Recognition

We derive revenue principally from sales of integrated circuit products,
from royalties, from messaging and other services and related hardware sales,
from software development and related services, and from license fees for
intellectual property. The timing of revenue recognition and the amount of
revenue actually recognized in each case depends upon a variety of factors,
including the specific terms of each arrangement and the nature of our
deliverables and obligations. Determination of the appropriate amount of
revenue recognized involves judgments and estimates that we believe are
reasonable, but it is possible that actual results may differ from our
estimates.

In December 1999, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) issued
Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 101 (SAB 101), “Revenue Recognition in Financial
Statements” which we adopted in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2001 and applied
retroactively to the first quarter of fiscal 2001. We recognized $44 million,
$66 million and $95 million during fiscal 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively, in
operating income related to revenue and expense that were recognized in prior
years.



In November 2002, the Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) issued Issue No.
00-21, “Accounting for Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables” which
we adopted in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003. This issue addresses
determination of whether an arrangement involving more than one deliverable
contains more than one unit of accounting and how arrangement consideration
should be measured and allocated to the separate units of accounting. Beginning
with the adoption of SAB 101 until the fourth
quarter of fiscal 2003, we recognized revenues and expenses from sales of
certain satellite and terrestrial-based two-way data messaging and position
reporting hardware and related software products by our QWBS division ratably
over the shorter of the estimated useful life of the hardware product or the
expected messaging service period, which is typically five years. SAB 101
required the ratable recognition of these sales because the messaging service
was considered integral to the functionality of the hardware and software.
Because EITF Issue No. 00-21 does not require the deferral of revenue when an
undelivered element is considered integral to the functionality of a delivered
element and because EITF Issue No. 00-21 otherwise requires separate unit
accounting, we began recognizing revenues and expenses from such sales starting
in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003 at the time of shipment, or when title and
risk of loss pass to the customer and other criteria for revenue recognition
are met, if later. We have elected to adopt EITF Issue No. 00-21 prospectively
for revenue arrangements entered into after the third quarter of fiscal 2003,
rather than reporting the change in accounting as a cumulative-effect
adjustment. As a result, during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003, we
recognized certain revenue and related cost of sales for QWBS equipment sales
upon shipment, while continuing to amortize unearned revenue and cost of sales,
with an $11 million gross margin effect, for units shipped in prior periods.
Deferred revenues and expenses related to the historical QWBS sales that will
continue to be amortized in future periods were $183 million and $102 million,
respectively, at September 30, 2003. Gross margin related to these prior sales
is expected to be recognized as follows: $37 million in fiscal 2004, $24
million in fiscal 2005, $13 million in fiscal 2006, $6 million in fiscal 2007
and $1 million in fiscal 2008.

We license rights to use our intellectual property portfolio, which
includes certain patent rights essential to and/or useful in the manufacture
and sale of CDMA (including cdmaOne, CDMA2000 1X/1x EV-DO/1xEV-DV, TD-SCDMA and
WCDMA) products. Licensees typically pay a non-refundable license fee in one or
more installments and on-going royalties based on their sales of products
incorporating our intellectual property. License fees are generally recognized
over the estimated period of future benefit to the average licensee, typically
five to seven years. We recognize royalty revenue as earned when reasonable
estimates of such amounts can be made.

Revenues from sales of our CDMA-based integrated circuits are recognized
at the time of shipment, or when title and risk of loss pass to the customer
and other criteria for revenue recognition are met, if later. Revenues from
providing services are recorded when earned. Revenues from long-term contracts
are generally recognized using the percentage-of-completion method of
accounting, based on costs incurred compared with total estimated costs. The
percentage-of-completion method relies on estimates of total contract revenue
and costs. Revenues and profit are subject to revisions as the contract
progresses to completion. Revisions in profit estimates are charged or credited
to income in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision
become known. If actual contract costs are greater than expected, reduction of
contract profit would be required. Billings on uncompleted contracts in excess
of incurred cost and accrued profits are classified as unearned revenue.
Estimated contract losses are recognized when determined. If substantive
uncertainty related to customer acceptance exists or the contract’s duration is
relatively short, we use the completed-contract method.

Revenues from software license fees are recognized when all of the
following criteria are met: the written agreement is executed; the software is
delivered; the license fee is fixed and determinable; collectibility of the
license fee is probable; and if applicable, when vendor-specific objective
evidence exists to allocate the total license fee to elements of
multiple-element arrangements, including post-contract customer support. When
contracts contain multiple elements wherein vendor-specific objective evidence
exists for all undelivered elements, we recognize revenue for the delivered
elements and defer revenue for the fair value of the undelivered elements until
the remaining obligations have been satisfied. If vendor-specific objective
evidence does not exist for all undelivered elements, revenue for the delivered
and undelivered elements is deferred until remaining obligations have been
satisfied, or if the only undelivered element is post-contract customer
support, revenue is recognized ratably over the support period. Significant
judgments and estimates are made in connection with the recognition of software
license revenue, including assessments of collectibility and the fair values of
deliverable elements. The amount or timing of our software license revenue may
differ as a result of changes in these judgments or estimates.



Unearned revenue consists primarily of fees related to software products
and license fees for intellectual property for which delivery is not yet
complete and to hardware products sales with a continuing service obligation.

Allowances for Doubtful Accounts

We maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses
resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments. We
consider the following factors when determining if collection of a fee is
reasonably assured: customer credit-worthiness, past transaction history with
the customer, current economic industry trends and changes in customer payment
terms. If we have no previous experience with the customer, we typically obtain
reports from various credit organizations to ensure that the customer has a
history of paying its creditors. We may also request financial information,
including financial statements or other documents (e.g., bank statements) to
ensure that the customer has the means of making payment. If these factors do
not indicate collection is reasonably assured, revenue is deferred until
collection becomes reasonably assured, which is generally upon receipt of cash.
If the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate, adversely
affecting their ability to make payments, additional allowances would be
required.

We also maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses
resulting from the inability of entities we have financed to make required
payments. We evaluate the adequacy of allowances for doubtful finance and note
receivables based on analyses of the financed entities’ credit-worthiness,
current economic trends or market conditions, review of the entities’ current
and projected financial and operational information, and consideration of the
fair value of collateral to be received, if applicable. From time to time, we
may consider third party evaluations, valuation reports or advice from
investment banks. If the financial condition of the financed entities were to
deteriorate, adversely affecting their ability to make payments, additional
allowances would be required.

Valuation of Intangible Assets and Investments

Our business acquisitions typically result in goodwill and other
intangible assets, and the recorded values of those assets may become impaired
in the future. The determination of the value of such intangible assets
requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect our
consolidated financial statements. We assess potential impairments to
intangible assets when there is evidence that events or changes in
circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be
recovered. Our judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators and
future cash flows related to intangible assets are based on operational
performance of our acquired businesses, market conditions and other factors.
Future events could cause us to conclude that impairment indicators exist and
that goodwill or other intangible assets associated with our acquired
businesses is impaired. Any resulting impairment loss could have an adverse
impact on our results of operations.

We hold minority strategic investments in publicly-traded companies whose
share prices may be highly volatile. We record impairment charges when we
believe an investment has experienced a decline that is other than temporary.
The determination that a decline is other than temporary is subjective and
influenced by many factors. Future adverse changes in market conditions or poor
operating results of investees could result in losses or an inability to
recover the carrying value of the investments, thereby possibly requiring
impairment charges in the future. When assessing a publicly-traded investment
for an other-than-temporary decline in value, we consider such factors as,
among other things, how significant the decline in value is as a percentage of
the original cost, how long the market value of the investment has been less
than its original cost, the performance of the investee’s stock price in
relation to the stock price of its competitors within the industry and the
market in general and analyst recommendations. We also review the financial
statements of the investee to determine if the investee is experiencing
financial difficulties. Any resulting impairment loss could have an adverse
impact on our results of operations.

We hold minority strategic investments in private companies whose values
are difficult to determine. We record impairment charges when we believe an
investment has experienced a decline that is other than temporary. The
determination that a decline is other than temporary is subjective and
influenced by many factors. Future adverse changes in market conditions or poor
operating results of investees could result in losses or an inability to
recover the carrying value of the investments, thereby possibly requiring
impairment charges in the future. When assessing investments in private
companies for an other-than temporary decline in value, we consider such
factors as, among other things, the share price from the investee’s latest
financing round, the performance of the investee in relation to its own
operating targets and its business plan, the investee’s revenue and cost
trends, the liquidity and cash position, including its cash burn rate and
market acceptance of the investee’s products and services. From time to time,
we may consider third party evaluations, valuation reports or advice from
investment banks. We also consider new products/services that the investee may
have forthcoming, any significant news that has been released specific to the



investee or the investee’s competitors and/or industry and the outlook of
the overall industry in which the investee operates. Any resulting impairment
loss could have an adverse impact on our results of operations.

Income Taxes

Our income tax provision is based on calculations and assumptions that
will be subject to examination by the Internal Revenue Service and other tax
authorities. We regularly assess the potential outcomes of these examinations
in determining the adequacy of our provision for income taxes. Should the
actual results differ from our estimates, we would have to adjust the income
tax provision in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision
become known. Tax law and rate changes are reflected in the income tax
provision in the period in which such changes are enacted.

We reversed approximately $1.1 billion of our valuation allowance on
substantially all of our United States deferred tax assets during fiscal 2003
as a credit to stockholders’ equity. We now believe that we will more likely
than not have sufficient taxable income after stock option deductions to
utilize our deferred tax assets. We continue to provide a valuation allowance
on substantially all of our foreign deferred tax assets because of uncertainty
regarding their realization due to a history of losses from operations.

We can only use our capital losses and capital loss carrybacks or
carryforwards to offset capital gains. We expect that our future capital gains
will be sufficient to utilize the capital losses that we have incurred through
fiscal 2002. Beginning in fiscal 2003, we have provided a valuation allowance
for new deferred tax assets related to capital loss items through our statement
of operations. We expect that any additional capital losses in future years
will also require the provision of a valuation allowance through the statement
of operations, if we are unable to generate sufficient future capital gains to
utilize these additional capital losses through our tax planning strategies. If
capital losses are utilized and any portion of the valuation allowance is
removed, the release would be accounted for as a reduction of the income tax
provision.

We consider the operating earnings of non-United States subsidiaries to be
indefinitely invested outside the United States. No provision has been made for
United States federal and state, or foreign taxes that may result from future
remittances of undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries. Should we
repatriate foreign earnings, we would have to adjust the income tax provision
in the period in which the decision to repatriate earnings of foreign
subsidiaries is made.

Litigation

We are currently involved in certain legal proceedings. We estimate the
range of liability related to pending litigation where the amount and range of
loss can be estimated. We record our best estimate of a loss when the loss is
considered probable. Where a liability is probable and there is a range of
estimated loss with no best estimate in the range, we record the minimum
estimated liability related to the claim. As additional information becomes
available, we assess the potential liability related to our pending litigation
and revise our estimates. Revisions in our estimates of the potential liability
could materially impact our results of operations.

Licensing

We grant licenses to use our intellectual property portfolio, which
includes certain patent rights essential to and/or useful in the manufacture
and sale of CDMA (including cdmaOne, CDMA2000 1X/1xEV-DO/1xEV-DV, TD-SCDMA and
WCDMA) products. Licensees typically pay a non-refundable license fee in one or
more installments and on-going royalties based on their sales of products
incorporating our intellectual property. License fees are recognized over the
estimated period of future benefit to the average licensee, typically five to
seven years. We earn royalties on CDMA products sold worldwide by our licensees
in the period that the licensees’ sales occur. Our licensees, however, do not
report and pay royalties owed until the subsequent quarter and, in some
instances, payment is on a semi-annual basis. Therefore, we estimate the
royalty revenues from certain licensees (the Estimated Licensees) in the
current quarter when reasonable estimates of such amounts can be made. Not all
royalties earned are estimated. Royalties for licensees for which we have
minimal history and certain licensees that do not buy our integrated circuit
products are recorded one quarter in arrears when they are reported to us by
those licensees. Estimates of royalty revenues for the Estimated Licensees are
based on analyses of our sales of integrated circuits to our Estimated
Licensees, historical royalty data by Estimated Licensee, the relationship
between the timing of our sales of integrated circuits to our Estimated
Licensees and our Estimated Licensees’ sales of CDMA products, average sales
price forecasts, and current market and economic trends. Once royalty reports
are received from the



Estimated Licensees, the variance between such reports and the estimate is
recorded in royalty revenue in the period the reports are received. The
recognition of this variance in most cases lags the royalty estimate by one
quarter.

The following table summarizes royalty related data for fiscal 2003, 2002
and 2001 (in millions):

* This amount is the estimate for the fourth quarter of the previous fiscal year.

For example, for fiscal 2002, we estimated royalties of $150 million from
the Estimated Licensees for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2002. The actual
royalties reported to us by the Estimated Licensees, on a one quarter lag
basis, during the first quarter of fiscal 2003 were $167 million. The variance
of $17 million was recorded in royalty revenues in the first quarter of fiscal
2003. Therefore, total royalty revenues from licensees for fiscal 2003 of $838
million included: 1) the variance of $17 million, 2) other royalties reported
during fiscal 2003 of $670 million, and 3) the estimate made in the fourth
quarter of fiscal 2003 of $151 million based upon Estimated Licensees’
estimated sales during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003, which we believe will
be reported by the Estimated Licensees in the first quarter of fiscal 2004.

Strategic Investments and Financing

Our QSI segment makes strategic investments to promote the worldwide
adoption of CDMA products and services for wireless voice and Internet data
communications. In general, we enter into strategic relationships with CDMA
wireless operators and developers of innovative technologies or products for
the wireless communications industry. As part of the agreement to sell our
infrastructure equipment business to Ericsson in 1999, we have provided
equipment financing to customers of Ericsson on a shared basis with respect to
Ericsson’s sale of CDMA infrastructure. Due to financial and competitive
challenges facing CDMA wireless operators, we cannot assure you that our
investments will generate financial returns or that they will result in
increased adoption or continued use of CDMA technologies. Domestic and
international CDMA wireless operators to whom we have provided financing have
limited operating histories, are faced with significant capital requirements,
are highly leveraged and/or have limited financial resources. If these CDMA
wireless operators are not successful, we may have to write down our
investments in or loans to these wireless operators.

Our QSI segment maintains strategic holdings of various issuers and types.
These securities include available-for-sale equity securities and derivative
investments that are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value. We
strategically invest in companies in the high-technology industry and typically
do not attempt to reduce or eliminate our exposure to market risks in these
investments. Available-for-sale equity securities and derivative investments
recorded at fair value subject us to equity price risk. The fair values of
these strategic investments are subject to substantial quarterly and annual
fluctuations and to significant market price volatility. Our strategic
investments in specific companies and industry segments may vary over time, and
changes in concentrations may affect price volatility. In general, our
investments in available-for-sale equity securities and derivative investments
suffered significant decreases in market value during the last three years.
Downward fluctuations and market trends could further adversely affect our
operating results. In addition, the realizable value of these securities and
derivative investments is subject to market and other conditions.

QSI also makes strategic investments in privately held companies,
including early stage companies and venture funds. These investments are
recorded at cost or under the equity method, but the recorded values may be
written down due to changes in the companies’ conditions or prospects. These
strategic investments are inherently risky as the market for the technologies
or products the investees are developing may never materialize. As a result, we
could



lose all or a portion of our investments in these companies, which could
negatively affect our financial position and operating results. Most of these
strategic investments will not become liquid until more than one year from the
date of investment, if at all. To the extent such investments become liquid and
meet strategic and price objectives, we may sell the investments and recognize
the realized gain (loss) in investment income (expense).

We regularly monitor and evaluate the realizable value of our investments
in both marketable and private securities. If events and circumstances indicate
that a decline in the value of these assets has occurred and is other than
temporary, we will record a charge to investment income (expense). During
fiscal 2003, 2002 and 2001, we recognized $138 million, $230 million and $198
million, respectively, in charges related to other-than-temporary losses on
marketable and private securities. In some cases, we make strategic investments
that require us to consolidate or record our equity in the losses of early
stage companies. The consolidation of these losses can adversely affect our
financial results until we exit from or reduce our exposure to the investments.

From time to time, we may accept an equity interest in a licensee as
consideration for a portion or all of the license fee payable under our CDMA
license agreement. We record license fee revenue based on the fair value of the
equity instruments received, if determinable. The measurement date for
determination of fair value is the earlier of the date at which a performance
commitment is made or the date at which the performance is complete. The
evaluation procedures used to determine fair value include, but are not limited
to, examining the current market price for the shares if the licensee is
publicly traded, examining recent rounds of financing and the licensee’s
business plan if not publicly traded, and performing other due diligence
procedures. This equity program does not affect the licensees’ obligations to
pay royalties under their CDMA license agreements. The amount of cash
consideration and the timing of revenue recognition vary depending on the terms
of each agreement. As of September 30, 2003, ten licensees have participated in
this program. We recognized $5 million, $6 million and $7 million of revenue in
fiscal 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively, related to equity received as
consideration for license fees.

Vésper Holding, Ltd

.

In fiscal 1999, we acquired an ownership interest in Vésper São Paulo S.A.
and Vésper S.A. (the Vésper Operating Companies or collectively, Vésper). The
Vésper Operating Companies were formed by a consortium of investors to provide
fixed wireless and wireline telephone services in the northern, northeast and
eastern regions of Brazil and in the state of São Paulo. In addition, we
extended long-term financing to Vésper in fiscal 2000. In November 2001, we
consummated a series of transactions resulting in an overall financial
restructuring (the Restructuring) of the Vésper Operating Companies, which
resulted in our obtaining a controlling financial interest in Vésper.

Pursuant to the Restructuring, we invested $266 million, and VeloCom, Inc.
(VeloCom) invested $80 million, in a newly formed holding company called Vésper
Holding, Ltd. (Vésper Holding). Vésper Holding acquired certain liabilities of
the Vésper Operating Companies from their vendors for $135 million and the
issuance of warrants to purchase an approximate 7% interest in Vésper Holding,
and the vendors released in full any claims that they might have against us,
VeloCom, Vésper, its direct and indirect parent companies and other related
parties arising from or related to the acquired liabilities. In a series of
related transactions, Vésper Holding agreed to contribute the acquired
liabilities to the Vésper Operating Companies in exchange for equity securities
and to cancel the contributed liabilities.

On November 29, 2001, we forgave $119 million under our debt facility with
VeloCom. We also converted our remaining $56 million convertible promissory
note into equity securities of VeloCom in conjunction with our acquisition of
Vésper Holding. The conversion increased our equity interest in VeloCom to
49.9%. We used the equity method to account for our investment in VeloCom. On
July 2, 2003, we transferred to VeloCom all of our equity interest in VeloCom
in exchange for (a) 49.9% of the shares of Vésper Holding held by VeloCom,
which represented approximately 11.9% of the issued and outstanding shares of
Vésper Holding, and (b) elimination of VeloCom’s minority consent rights with
respect to Vésper Holding. We recorded a net loss of $7 million on the exchange
resulting primarily from the recognition of cumulative translation losses,
previously included in stockholders’ equity, in the statement of operations
during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003. After giving effect to the exchange,
we own an approximate 83.9% direct interest in Vésper Holding and hold no
continuing interest in VeloCom at September 30, 2003.

On November 19, 2002, we won bids to acquire personal mobile service (SMP)
licenses in the state of São Paulo (excluding São Paulo metro), the state of
Minas Gerais, and in the Northeast region of Brazil. Approximately $8 million
of the approximate $82 million purchase price for the SMP licenses was paid in
December 2002. The



remaining Brazilian real-denominated obligation is financed by the
Brazilian government at an interest rate of 12% per annum, plus an adjustment
for inflation, payable in six equal annual installments starting in fiscal
2006. At September 30, 2003, the outstanding license fee obligation was
approximately $111 million, having increased as a result of accrued interest
and the strengthening of the Brazilian real against the U.S. dollar.

Due to a series of adverse regulatory developments that negatively
affected Vésper’s prospects, we are pursuing an expedited exit strategy whereby
Vésper and/or its assets will be sold or otherwise disposed of. In accordance
with this strategy, on September 25, 2003, Embratel Participações S.A.
(Embratel) entered into an agreement to acquire from us for nominal
consideration the Vésper Operating Companies (the Embratel sale transaction),
excluding the tower and rooftop antennae assets and related property leases
(Tower Sites). Concurrent with the closing, Vésper will enter into a multi-year arrangement
whereby it pays a monthly fee to us to use the Tower Sites. The sum of these
fees, net of certain pass through expenses, is expected to exceed $77 million
over the life of the arrangement. The SMP licenses also are not included in the
Embratel sale transaction, except for a right of first refusal of Embratel to
purchase the SMP licenses in the event of a sale to a third party or return of
the SMP licenses to Anatel, the telecommunications regulatory agency in Brazil.
We are evaluating our options with respect to the SMP licenses, including a possible return of the
licenses to Anatel.

The closing of the Embratel sale transaction is contingent upon a number
of events being completed prior to or concurrent with closing. The status of
certain of these items follows:

Given the uncertainty associated with the closing contingencies, we have
not presented the Vésper-related assets and liabilities as “held for sale” in
our September 30, 2003 balance sheet. Further, we do not expect to present
Vésper’s historical operations as discontinued operations in our consolidated
statements of operations in future financial statements because of our
expectation of a continuing involvement in the Vésper business by way of an
on-going tower usage arrangement. In the near term, prior to the close of the
Embratel sale transaction, Vésper will



continue to operate its existing fixed wireless and wireline network.
Vésper will continue to undertake significant cost cutting measures to preserve
the value of its core assets and existing business while reducing cash
expenditures.

As a result of adverse regulatory developments, and after an evaluation of
the potential acquirers and the valuations that they may ascribe to Vésper
given the regulatory situation, we recorded a $160 million impairment loss on
our long-lived assets related to Vésper during the second quarter of fiscal
2003. The impairment loss recognized was the difference between the assets’
carrying values and their estimated fair values at that date. At September 30,
2003, the carrying values of assets and liabilities related to Vésper totaled
$265 million and $307 million, respectively.

Assuming the requisite government approvals are received and all
conditions to close are satisfied, we anticipate providing approximately $40 million to
$45 million in aggregate funding (including the $6 million of interim funding)
by the closing date to facilitate the Embratel sale transaction. We expect to
recognize cumulative foreign currency translation losses, previously included
in stockholders’ equity, as part of the gain or loss on a sale or other
disposition of Vésper. We expect to record an approximate $35 million to $45
million loss if and when the transaction closes, including the cumulative
foreign currency translation losses.

We may incur additional losses related to Vésper if we are not successful
in closing the sale transaction with Embratel or, in that event, if we are
unable to realize the estimated fair value of Vésper’s assets upon their sale
to another party or other disposition or if we are unable to effect such a sale
or other disposition of Vésper and/or its assets quickly.

Additional risks and uncertainties specific to Vésper include risks
associated with:

Pegaso Telecomunicaciones, S.A. de C.V.

We have had various financing arrangements, including a bridge loan
facility, an equipment loan facility and interim and additional interim loan
facilities, with Pegaso Comunicaciones y Sistemas S.A. de C.V., a wholly owned
subsidiary of Pegaso Telecomunicaciones, S.A. de C.V., a CDMA wireless operator
in Mexico (collectively referred to as Pegaso). On September 10, 2002,
Telefónica Móviles (Telefónica) acquired a 65% controlling interest in Pegaso.
On October 10, 2002, Pegaso paid $82 million in full satisfaction of the
interim and additional interim loans. On November 8, 2002, Pegaso paid $435
million in full satisfaction of the bridge loan facility. We used approximately
$139 million of the bridge loan proceeds to purchase outstanding vendor debt
owed by Pegaso to



other lenders. On March 31, 2003, Pegaso paid $4 million on the equipment
loan facility. On June 13, 2003, Pegaso prepaid $281 million of the equipment
loan facility, including accrued interest, in accordance with certain terms of
the equipment loan facility. As a result of these transactions, finance
receivables from Pegaso decreased by $663 million.

At September 30, 2003, amounts outstanding, net of deferred interest,
under the Pegaso equipment loan facility were $181 million, including the
acquired vendor debt, as compared to $821 million outstanding under the various
financing arrangements with Pegaso at September 30, 2002. The remaining
equipment loan facility outstanding with Pegaso, including the acquired vendor
debt, is payable quarterly starting in March 2006 through December 2008 and
bears interest at the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus 1% through
September 9, 2004, LIBOR plus 3% thereafter through September 9, 2007 and LIBOR
plus 6% thereafter. We recognized $41 million, $9 million and $90 million in
interest income related to the Pegaso financing arrangements during fiscal
2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively, including $23 million of deferred interest
income recorded as a result of the prepayment in fiscal 2003.

Pegaso is an early stage wireless operator facing significant competition
in Mexico. Based on current information and available evidence, including the
acquisition of Pegaso by Telefónica, we believe that we will ultimately be able
to collect the remaining long-term financing due from Pegaso, however Pegaso
may not succeed. Failure to collect our finance receivables could have a
material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition.

Inquam Ltd

In October 2000, we agreed to invest $200 million in the convertible
preferred shares of Inquam Limited (Inquam) for an approximate 42% ownership
interest in Inquam. Inquam owns, develops and manages wireless communications
systems, either directly or indirectly, with the primary intent of deploying
CDMA-based technology, primarily in Europe. We provided the final $27 million
under this equity commitment during fiscal 2003 and had no remaining equity
funding commitment at September 30, 2003.

On March 26, 2003, we agreed to extend $25 million of bridge loan
financing to Inquam. Another investor in Inquam also agreed to provide $25
million in bridge loan financing. We provided the $25 million in funding during
fiscal 2003 and had no remaining commitment under the bridge loan at September
30, 2003.

On July 14, 2003, we approved an additional $50 million investment in
Inquam, subject to certain conditions, including a matching $50 million
investment by another existing investor in Inquam. No commitments related to
these potential investments were in place at September 30, 2003. On September
19, 2003, we agreed, along with this other existing investor, to provide an
additional $5 million each in bridge financing to enable Inquam to meet its
cash flow requirements while the terms of a new equity investment are being
negotiated. It is the intention of both parties that this second $10 million
bridge loan will be repaid with the proceeds from the anticipated equity
investment. We provided $2 million under this second bridge loan during fiscal
2003 and had a remaining funding commitment of $3 million at September 30,
2003.

On September 22, 2003, we agreed, along with another investor in Inquam,
to guarantee the payment of amounts due by Inquam under a bank credit
agreement. Our maximum liability under the guarantee is limited to an amount
equal to 50% of the amounts outstanding under Inquam’s credit agreement, up to
a maximum of $10 million. No amounts were outstanding under the bank credit
agreement as of September 30, 2003.

We use the equity method to account for our investment in Inquam. During
fiscal 2003, we recorded an $11 million other-than-temporary impairment loss
related to our investment in Inquam. The impairment loss was the difference
between the carrying value of the investment and its estimated fair value. At
September 30, 2003, our equity and debt investment in Inquam was $68 million,
net of equity in losses and impairment. We expect that Inquam will focus its
resources on the development of CDMA properties in the 450MHz frequency band in
Romania and western Europe and will transfer its non-CDMA operations to one or
more of Inquam’s other shareholders. Inquam is expected to use approximately
$70 million to $80 million in cash through the first half of calendar 2004.
Inquam’s management does not expect Inquam to be cash flow positive until
calendar 2007 with its current business plan. If the Inquam operating companies
cannot raise debt financing as expected or new investors cannot be found,
Inquam’s growth potential and the value of our investment in Inquam may be
negatively affected.



Fiscal 2003 Compared to Fiscal 2002

Total revenues for fiscal 2003 were $3,971 million, compared to $3,040
million for fiscal 2002. Revenues from Samsung, LG Electronics, Motorola, and
Kyocera, customers of our QCT, QTL and other nonreportable segments, comprised
an aggregate of 17%, 13%, 13% and 9% of total consolidated revenues,
respectively, in fiscal 2003 as compared to 15%, 11%, 7% and 14% of total
consolidated revenues, respectively, in fiscal 2002. The percentages for
Kyocera included 1% and 3% in fiscal 2003 and 2002, respectively, related to
services provided to Kyocera by employees from our terrestrial-based CDMA
wireless consumer phone business which was sold to Kyocera in February 2000.
This arrangement expired in February 2003.

Revenues from sales of equipment and services for fiscal 2003 were $2,986
million, compared to $2,205 million for fiscal 2002. Revenues from sales of
equipment and services for fiscal 2003 included $123 million related to the
consolidation of Vésper Holding, compared to $125 million in fiscal 2002.
Revenues from sales of integrated circuits increased $828 million, primarily
due to an increase in unit shipments of Mobile Station Modem (MSM) and
accompanying radio frequency (RF) integrated circuits.

Revenues from licensing and royalty fees for fiscal 2003 were $985
million, compared to $835 million for fiscal 2002. The increase resulted from
higher QTL segment royalties, resulting primarily from an increase in phone
sales by our licensees.

Cost of equipment and services revenues for fiscal 2003 was $1,430
million, compared to $1,137 million for fiscal 2002. The increase primarily
resulted from an increase in revenues from sales of equipment and services.
Cost of equipment and services revenues as a percentage of equipment and
services revenues was 48% for fiscal 2003, compared to 52% for fiscal 2002. The
margin percentage improvement in fiscal 2003 compared to fiscal 2002 was
primarily due to the increase in QCT revenues as a percentage of total
equipment and services revenues, resulting in increased QCT margin relative to
the total. Cost of equipment and services revenues for fiscal 2003 included
$162 million related to the consolidation of Vésper Holding, compared to $183
million in fiscal 2002. Cost of equipment and services revenues as a
percentage of equipment and services revenues may fluctuate
in future quarters depending on the mix of products sold and services provided,
competitive pricing, new product introduction costs and other factors.

For fiscal 2003, research and development expenses were $523 million or
13% of revenues, compared to $452 million or 15% of revenues for fiscal 2002.
The dollar increase in research and development expenses was primarily due to
an $88 million increase in costs primarily related to increased engineering
resources for integrated circuit product initiatives to support multimedia
applications, high-speed wireless Internet access and multimode, multiband,
multinetwork products, including CDMA2000 1X/1xEV-DO/1xEV-DV, GSM/GPRS, WLAN,
WCDMA and radioOne technologies, partially offset by an $11 million reduction in
research and development efforts supporting the QDM division of the QWI segment and a $3 million
reduction of support efforts related to the Globalstar business.

For fiscal 2003, selling, general and administrative expenses were $535
million or 13% of revenues, compared to $509 million or 17% of revenues for
fiscal 2002. The dollar increase was primarily due to a $27 million increase in
employee-related expenses, a $12 million increase in depreciation and
amortization expense, a $6 million increase in professional fees, primarily
patent administration, and outside services and a $6 million increase related
to international marketing and support efforts, partially offset by a $45
million decrease in Vésper expenses, including the effects of foreign currency
fluctuations. Selling, general and administrative expenses for fiscal 2003
included $62 million related to the consolidation of Vésper Holding, compared
to $107 million in fiscal 2002.

Amortization of goodwill and other acquisition-related intangible assets
was $9 million for fiscal 2003, compared to $259 million in fiscal 2002.
Starting in fiscal 2003, we no longer record goodwill amortization as a result
of the adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142.
Amortization charges were primarily related to the acquisition of SnapTrack in
March 2000.

For fiscal 2003, asset impairment and related charges were $194 million,
compared to less than $1 million of such charges in fiscal 2002. Asset
impairment and related charges during fiscal 2003 were comprised of a $160
million impairment loss on long-term assets related to Vésper and a $34 million
impairment loss on our wireless licenses in Australia due to recent
developments that affected potential strategic alternatives for using the
spectrum. The impairment loss recognized was the difference between the assets’
carrying values and their estimated fair values.

For fiscal 2003, other operating income was $31 million, compared to other
operating expenses of $9 million in fiscal 2002. Other operating income during
fiscal 2003 resulted from $47 million of other income related to the



transfer of a portion of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) auction
discount voucher’s value to two wireless operators, offset by a $16 million
charge related to the write down of notes receivable from an early stage CDMA
wireless operator and an early stage media company. Other operating expenses
during fiscal 2002 resulted from the write down of a note receivable from an
early stage CDMA wireless operator.

Interest expense was $31 million for fiscal 2003, compared to $26 million
for fiscal 2002. Interest expense was primarily related to the $226 million and
$113 million Vésper-related long-term debt at September 30, 2003 and 2002,
respectively.

Net investment income was $6 million for fiscal 2003 compared to net
investment expense of $186 million for fiscal 2002. The change was primarily
comprised as follows (in millions):

The increase in interest income on corporate cash and marketable
securities was a result of higher average cash and marketable securities
balances, partially offset by the impact of lower interest rates earned on
these balances. The increase in QSI interest income was primarily the result of
$23 million of deferred interest income recorded as a result of a prepayment on
Pegaso debt facilities in fiscal 2003. The other-than-temporary losses on
marketable securities during fiscal 2003 primarily related to an $81 million
impairment of our investment in KTF and a $16 million impairment of our
investment in a provider of semiconductor packaging, test and distribution
services. The increase in other-than-temporary losses on other investments is
primarily related to an $11 million impairment of our investment in Inquam and
a $9 million impairment of our investment in a development stage CDMA wireless
operator. The change in fair values of derivative investments during fiscal
2002 primarily resulted from movements in the price of Leap Wireless stock,
which affected the fair values of our warrants to acquire Leap Wireless stock.
Equity in losses of investees primarily increased due to a $43 million increase
in our equity in losses incurred by Inquam.

Income tax expense was $458 million for fiscal 2003, compared to $101
million for fiscal 2002. The annual effective tax rate was approximately 36%
for fiscal 2003, compared to a rate of 22% for fiscal 2002. The annual
effective tax rate for fiscal 2003 was lower than the combined
federal and state statutory tax rate of approximately 39%
primarily due to the U.S. tax write-off of investments in certain
foreign subsidiaries that became worthless during the year and foreign earnings that were taxed at less than
the federal rate. The reductions were partially offset by foreign and capital losses for
which we are not recording a tax benefit. The fiscal 2002 effective tax rate
was lower than the fiscal 2003 effective tax rate principally due to the reduction
of valuation allowances in fiscal 2002 that were previously charged to tax
expense, partially offset by the amortization of non-deductible goodwill in
fiscal 2002.

Our Segment Results for Fiscal 2003 Compared to Fiscal 2002

QUALCOMM CDMA Technologies Segment (QCT)

QCT segment revenues for fiscal 2003 were $2,424 million, compared to
$1,591 million for fiscal 2002. Earnings before taxes for fiscal 2003 were $797
million, compared to $441 million for fiscal 2002. QCT’s
operating income as a percentage of its revenues (operating margin



percentage) was 33% in fiscal 2003, compared to 28% in fiscal 2002. Revenues and
earnings before taxes increased
primarily due to an increase in unit shipments of MSM and accompanying RF
integrated circuits. Approximately 99 million MSM integrated circuits were sold
during fiscal 2003, compared to approximately 65 million for fiscal 2002.
Research and development and selling, general and administrative expenses were
$62 million higher and $19 million higher, respectively, for fiscal 2003 as
compared to fiscal 2002 primarily associated with new integrated circuit
product and technology initiatives to support multimedia applications,
high-speed wireless Internet access and multiband, multimode, multinetwork
products including CDMA2000 1X/1xEV-DO/1xEV-DV, GSM/GPRS, WLAN, WCDMA and
radioOne technologies. The increase in operating margin percentage in fiscal
2003 as compared to fiscal 2002 was primarily related to the 52% increase in
revenue as compared to the 18% increase in research and development and
selling, general and administrative expenses. QCT inventories were $75 million
at September 30, 2003, representing a 48% increase from September 30, 2002,
primarily as a result of anticipated future demand for 1X products.

QUALCOMM Technology Licensing Segment (QTL)

QTL segment revenues for fiscal 2003 were $1,000 million, compared to $847
million for fiscal 2002. Royalty revenues from licensees were $838 million in
fiscal 2003, compared to $725 million in fiscal 2002. Revenues from license
fees were $59 million in fiscal 2003, compared to $55 million in fiscal 2002.
Other revenues were comprised of intersegment royalties. Royalty revenues
include an estimate of royalties from certain licensees that have been earned,
but will not be reported by those licensees to us until after the end of the
fiscal year. Once royalty reports are received from those licensees, the
variance between such reports and the estimate is recorded in royalty revenue
in the period the reports are received, usually the following quarter.
Royalties for fiscal 2003 included $151 million in estimated royalties for the
fourth quarter of fiscal 2003 and $17 million in royalties earned, but not
estimated, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2002. By comparison, royalties for
fiscal 2002 included $150 million in estimated royalties for the fourth quarter
of fiscal 2002 and $24 million in royalties earned, but not estimated, in the
fourth quarter of fiscal 2001. Earnings before taxes for fiscal 2003 were $897
million, compared to $756 million for fiscal 2002. QTL’s operating margin
percentage was 89% in both fiscal 2003 and 2002. The increase in revenues and
earnings before taxes was primarily due to an increase in sales of CDMA
products by licensees resulting from higher demand for CDMA products across all
major regions of CDMA deployment. During fiscal 2003, we recognized $5 million
in revenue related to equity received as consideration for license fees,
compared to $6 million in fiscal 2002.

QUALCOMM Wireless & Internet Segment (QWI)

QWI segment revenues for fiscal 2003 were $485 million, compared to $439
million for fiscal 2002. Earnings before taxes for fiscal 2003 were $27
million, compared to losses before taxes of $9 million for fiscal 2002. QWI’s
operating margin was 6% in fiscal 2003, compared to negative 2% in fiscal 2002.
Revenues increased primarily due to a $19 million increase in QWBS revenue, an
$11 million increase in revenue related to the sale of test
equipment used primarily in testing WCDMA networks, a $10
million increase in QDM revenue, primarily as a result of license revenue
related to the sale of the TDC joint venture, and a $7 million increase in
software and services revenue related to our QChat and BREW products. The
increase in QWBS revenue was attributable to $23 million in revenue amortized
in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003 related to equipment sales in prior
periods, while equipment sales during the fourth quarter were recognized as
revenue upon shipment. (See “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 1
– The Company and its Significant Accounting Policies.”) The increase in
earnings before taxes and improvement in operating margin were primarily due to
a $25 million increase in QWBS gross margin and an
$11 million decrease in QDM
research and development spending. The increase in QWBS gross margin was
primarily attributable to $11 million in gross margin amortized in the fourth
quarter of fiscal 2003 related to equipment sales in prior periods, while
equipment sales during the fourth quarter were recognized upon shipment, a $12
million increase resulting from an increase in higher margin messaging services
and the effect of a $6 million release of warranty reserves resulting from the
substantial completion of a QWBS warranty program. We shipped approximately
38,000 OmniTRACS and other related communications systems during fiscal 2003,
compared to approximately 46,000 in fiscal 2002.

QUALCOMM Strategic Initiatives Segment (QSI)

QSI segment revenues for fiscal 2003 were $124 million, compared to $126
million in fiscal 2002. QSI segment revenues were primarily related to the
consolidation of Vésper Holding. QSI segment losses before taxes for fiscal
2003 were $448 million, compared to $507 million for fiscal 2002. During fiscal
2003, we recorded a $238 million loss, net of minority interest, due to the
consolidation of Vésper Holding and $24 million of equity in losses of VeloCom,
as compared with a $130 million loss, net of minority interest, due to the
consolidation of Vésper Holding and $30 million of equity in losses of VeloCom
and the Vésper Operating Companies (pre-acquisition) in fiscal



2002. We
recorded a $43 million increase in our equity in losses incurred by Inquam and
a $14 million increase in
other-than-temporary losses on other investments, partially offset by a
$97 million decrease in other-than-temporary losses on marketable securities
and a $56 million decrease in the change in fair values of derivative
investments, during fiscal 2003 as compared to fiscal 2002. During fiscal 2003,
we also recorded other income of $47 million related to the transfer of
portions of the FCC auction discount voucher value to two wireless operators,
partially offset by a $34 million impairment loss on our wireless licenses in
Australia due to recent developments that affected strategic alternatives for
using the spectrum.

For additional financial information relating to our reportable business
segments, see Note 10 of the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Fiscal 2002 Compared to Fiscal 2001

Total revenues for fiscal 2002 were $3,040 million, compared to $2,680
million for fiscal 2001. Revenues from Samsung, Kyocera, and LG Electronics,
customers of our QCT, QTL and other nonreportable segments, comprised an
aggregate of 15%, 14% and 11% of total consolidated revenues, respectively, in
fiscal 2002. In fiscal 2001, revenues from Samsung, Kyocera and LG Electronics,
comprised an aggregate of 14%, 12% and 10% of total consolidated revenues,
respectively. The percentages for Kyocera included 3% and 4% in fiscal 2002 and
2001, respectively, related to services provided to Kyocera by employees from
our terrestrial-based CDMA wireless consumer phone business which was sold to
Kyocera in February 2000.

Revenues from sales of equipment and services for fiscal 2002 were $2,205
million, compared to $1,908 million for fiscal 2001. Revenues from sales of
equipment and services for fiscal 2002 included $125 million related to the
consolidation of Vésper Holding effective in November 2001 and $8 million
related to the Globalstar business. Revenues from sales of equipment and
services for fiscal 2001 included $54 million related to Globalstar. Revenues
from sales of integrated circuits increased by $218 million, primarily due to
an increase in unit shipments of MSM integrated circuits, and the effect of the
change in product mix toward the higher end devices utilizing our 3G CDMA2000
1X integrated circuits products. Software development services revenues related
to the QChat licensing agreement increased $34 million.

Revenues from licensing and royalty fees for fiscal 2002 were $835
million, compared to $772 million for fiscal 2001. QTL segment royalty revenues
from licensees increased $64 million.

Cost of equipment and services revenues for fiscal 2002 was $1,137
million, compared to $1,035 million for fiscal 2001. Cost of revenues for
fiscal 2002 included $183 million related to the consolidation of Vésper
Holding and $11 million related to our on-going obligation to Globalstar. Cost
of revenues for fiscal 2001 included $129 million related to Globalstar. Cost
of revenues as a percentage of revenues was 52% for fiscal 2002, compared to
54% for fiscal 2001. The margin improvement in fiscal 2002 was primarily due to
the change in product mix toward the higher end devices utilizing our CDMA2000
1X integrated circuits products and the increase in revenues from royalties in
the QTL segment.

For fiscal 2002, research and development expenses were $452 million or
15% of revenues, compared to $415 million or 15% of revenues for fiscal 2001.
The dollar increase in research and development expenses was primarily due to
$41 million in increased integrated circuit product initiatives to support
high-speed wireless Internet access and multimode, multiband, multinetwork
products including cdmaOne, CDMA2000 1X/1xEV-DO, GSM/GPRS, WCDMA and position
location technologies and $14 million in increased QWBS research and
development initiatives, partially offset by a $29 million reduction of
development efforts related to the Globalstar business.

For fiscal 2002, selling, general and administrative expenses were $509
million or 17% of revenues, compared to $367 million or 14% of revenues for
fiscal 2001. Selling, general and administrative expenses for fiscal 2002
included $107 million related to the consolidation of Vésper Holding. The
remaining dollar increase was primarily due to a $33 million increase in
marketing and support efforts related to products and services of our QIS
division, including the BREW product, $23 million associated with the expansion
of our integrated circuit customer base and international business development
activities, particularly in China, and $13 million resulting from the
consolidation of Wireless Knowledge, Inc. (Wireless Knowledge), partially
offset by a $22 million reduction in support efforts related to the Globalstar
business and a $14 million reduction in bad debt expense.

Amortization of goodwill and other acquisition-related intangible assets
was $259 million for fiscal 2002, compared to $255 million in fiscal 2001.
Amortization charges were primarily related to the acquisition of SnapTrack in
March 2000.



For fiscal 2002, asset impairment and related charges were less than $1
million, compared to $518 million of such charges in fiscal 2001. Asset
impairment and related charges during fiscal 2001 were comprised primarily of
$519 million in charges resulting from management’s determination that certain
assets related to the Globalstar business were impaired.

For fiscal 2002, other operating expenses were $9 million, compared to $51
million in fiscal 2001. Other operating expenses for fiscal 2002 resulted from
the write down of a note receivable from a development stage CDMA carrier.
Other operating expenses for fiscal 2001 were comprised of a $62 million
arbitration decision against us, offset by $11 million in other income related
to the irrevocable transfer of a portion of an FCC auction discount voucher to
a third party.

Interest expense was $26 million for fiscal 2002, compared to $10 million
for fiscal 2001. Interest expense for fiscal 2002 was primarily related to the
long-term debt of Vésper Holding. Interest expense for fiscal 2001 was
primarily related to interest charges resulting from the arbitration decision
made against us.

Net investment expense was $186 million for fiscal 2002 compared to $317
million for fiscal 2001. The change was primarily comprised as follows (in
millions):

The decline in interest income on corporate cash and marketable debt
securities was a result of lower interest rates. The decline in QSI interest
income was a result of the cessation of interest income recognition on Pegaso
debt facilities starting in the fourth fiscal quarter of fiscal 2001 and on
Leap Wireless bonds starting in the third quarter of fiscal 2002. The
other-than-temporary losses on marketable securities during fiscal 2002
primarily related to $162 million and $18 million in losses on our investments
in Leap Wireless bonds and common stock, respectively. We determined that the
declines in fair values were other than temporary, as the market values of the
bond and common stock had significantly declined during fiscal 2002 as a result
of unfavorable developments in Leap Wireless’ business. The
other-than-temporary losses on marketable securities during fiscal 2001
primarily related to a $134 million loss on our investment in NetZero, Inc.,
which subsequently completed a merger with Juno Online Services, Inc. and
became United Online, Inc. The change in fair values of derivative instruments
primarily resulted from $59 million in losses resulting from declines in the
price of Leap Wireless common stock, which reduced the fair values of our
warrants to acquire Leap Wireless common stock. The warrants had insignificant
value at September 30, 2002. Equity in losses of investees decreased as a
result of the consolidation of Vésper Holding effective November 13, 2001, as
these losses are now included in operations.

For fiscal 2002 there were no other non-operating charges, compared to
$167 million in fiscal 2001. Other non-operating charges in fiscal 2001 were
primarily comprised of a $120 million write-down of the note receivable from



VeloCom to its fair value and $58 million in write-downs of recorded values of
a note receivable from Globalstar and warrants to acquire partnership interests
in Globalstar to their estimated fair values.

Income tax expense was $101 million for fiscal 2002, compared to $105
million for fiscal 2001. The annual effective tax rate was 22% for fiscal 2002,
compared to a negative 23% rate for fiscal 2001. The annual effective tax
rate for fiscal 2002 was lower than the statutory rate due to the
reduction of deferred tax assets and the related valuation allowance that was
previously charged to tax expense, partially offset by foreign losses for which
we are not recording a tax benefit. The fiscal 2001 effective tax rate was the
result of pre-tax losses for which no tax benefit was recorded and foreign tax
expense. The annual effective tax rate on profits for fiscal 2002 cannot be
meaningfully compared to the effective tax rate on losses for the prior fiscal
year.

We recorded an $18 million loss, net of taxes, in fiscal 2001 as the net
cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles at September 30, 2000.
The cumulative effect of the adoption of SAB 101 was a $147 million loss, net
of taxes, offset by a $129 million gain, net of taxes, resulting from the
cumulative effect of the adoption of FAS 133. The gain resulting from the
adoption of FAS 133 related primarily to the unrealized gain on a warrant to
purchase 4,500,000 shares of Leap Wireless common stock issued to us in
connection with our spin-off of Leap Wireless in September 1998.

Our Segment Results for Fiscal 2002 Compared to Fiscal 2001

QUALCOMM CDMA Technologies Segment (QCT)

QCT segment revenues for fiscal 2002 were $1,591 million, compared to
$1,365 million for fiscal 2001. Earnings before taxes for fiscal 2002 were $441
million, compared to $306 million for fiscal 2001. Revenues and earnings before
taxes increased primarily due to an increase in unit shipments of MSM
integrated circuits and the effect of the change in product mix toward the
higher end devices utilizing our CDMA2000 1X products. Approximately 65 million
MSM integrated circuits were sold during fiscal 2002, compared to approximately
58 million for fiscal 2001. Approximately 10 million CSM infrastructure
integrated circuits equivalent voice channels were sold during fiscal 2002,
compared to approximately 9 million for fiscal 2001. Both research and
development and selling and marketing expenses were $22 million higher for
fiscal 2002 as compared to fiscal 2001 primarily associated with new integrated
circuit product and technology initiatives to support high-speed wireless
Internet access and multiband, multimode, multinetwork products including
cdmaOne, CDMA2000 1X/1xEV-DO, GSM/GPRS, WCDMA and position location
technologies. QCT inventories decreased by 27% during fiscal 2002 primarily as
a result of strong demand for 1X products across our customer base and improved
component availability.

QUALCOMM Technology Licensing Segment (QTL)

QTL segment revenues for fiscal 2002 were $847 million, compared to $782
million for fiscal 2001. Royalty revenues from licensees were $725 million in
fiscal 2002, compared to $661 million in fiscal 2001. Revenues from license
fees were $55 million in fiscal 2002, compared to $67 million in fiscal 2001.
Other revenues were comprised of intersegment royalties. Earnings before taxes
for fiscal 2002 were $756 million, compared to $706 million for fiscal 2001.
The increase in revenues and earnings before taxes was primarily due to an
increase in sales of CDMA products by licensees resulting from higher demand
for CDMA products across all major regions of CDMA deployment. During fiscal
2002, we recognized $6 million in revenue related to equity received as
consideration for license fees, compared to $7 million in fiscal 2001.

QUALCOMM Wireless & Internet Segment (QWI)

QWI segment revenues for fiscal 2002 were $439 million, compared to $426
million for fiscal 2001. Losses before taxes for fiscal 2002 were $9 million,
compared to earnings before taxes of $33 million for fiscal 2001. Revenues
increased primarily due to an increase in software development and services
revenues related to our BREW products and QChat licensing agreement. Earnings
before taxes decreased primarily due to a $35 million increase in our
development, support and marketing efforts related to products and services of
our QIS division, including the BREW product and a $14 million increase in QWBS
research and development expenditures. We shipped approximately 46,000
OmniTRACS and other related communications systems during fiscal 2002, compared
to approximately 43,000 in fiscal 2001.

QUALCOMM Strategic Initiatives Segment (QSI)

QSI segment revenues for fiscal 2002 were $126 million, primarily related
to the consolidation of Vésper Holding. QSI segment losses before taxes for
fiscal 2002 were $507 million, compared to $1,125 million for fiscal 2001. The
decrease in losses was primarily due to $568 million in charges incurred in
fiscal 2001 related to



Globalstar. During fiscal 2002, we recorded a $130
million loss, net of minority interest, due to the consolidation of Vésper
Holding and $30 million of equity losses in the Vésper Operating Companies
(pre-acquisition) and VeloCom, as compared with $150 million of equity losses
for the Vésper Operating Companies in fiscal 2001. During fiscal 2002, we
recorded $180 million in other-than-temporary losses on Leap Wireless
marketable
securities, compared to an $11 million realized gain in fiscal 2001. We
also recorded $59 million in losses related to changes in the fair values of
Leap Wireless derivative investments in fiscal 2002, compared to $213 million
in losses in fiscal 2001. Losses on Leap Wireless derivative investments
resulted from declines in the market price of Leap Wireless common stock during
those fiscal years. During fiscal 2001, we recorded a $120 million charge to
write down a note receivable from VeloCom to its fair value as a result of the
reorganization of the Vésper Operating Companies initiated during fiscal 2001.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities were $5.4 billion at
September 30, 2003, an increase of $2.2 billion from September 30, 2002. The
increase during fiscal 2003 was primarily the result of $1.8 billion in cash
provided by operating activities, $663 million in net collections received on
finance receivables, mainly comprised of payments from Pegaso, $191 million in
net proceeds from the issuance of common stock under our stock option and
employee stock purchase plans and $37 million in net marketable securities
purchases pending cash settlement, partially offset by $231 million in capital
expenditures, $158 million in net purchases of our common stock and $135
million in dividend payments.

Accounts receivable decreased by 10% during fiscal 2003. The decrease in
accounts receivable was primarily due to the timing of cash receipts and the
expiration of our services arrangement with Kyocera in February 2003. Days
sales outstanding, on a consolidated basis, were 46 days at September 30, 2003
compared to 54 days at September 30, 2002. The change in days sales outstanding
is consistent with the increase in revenue and improved cash collections
resulting in the decrease in the accounts receivable balance.

In February 2003, we committed up to $1 billion to repurchase shares of
our common stock over a two year period. During fiscal 2003, we bought
4,915,000 shares at a net aggregate cost of $158 million. At September 30,
2003, $834 million remains to be expended. Repurchased shares are retired upon
repurchase. In connection with our stock repurchase program, we sold put
options in March 2003 that could have required us to purchase three million
shares of our common stock upon exercise. All of these written put options
expired unexercised. We recorded $7 million in premiums received for the put
options as additions to paid-in capital. We declared dividends totaling
approximately $135 million or $0.17 per share during fiscal 2003.

We believe our current cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities
and cash generated from operations will satisfy our expected working and other
capital requirements for the foreseeable future based on current business
plans, including investments in other companies and other assets to support the
growth of our business, financing for customers of CDMA infrastructure products
in accordance with the agreements with Ericsson, financing under agreements
with CDMA telecommunications carriers, other commitments, the payment of
dividends and possible additional stock buy backs. In fiscal 2003, we began
construction on two new facilities in San Diego, California totaling one
million square feet to meet the requirements projected in our long-term
business plan. The cost of these new facilities is expected to approximate $250
million.

We intend to continue our strategic investment activities to promote the
worldwide adoption of CDMA products and the growth of CDMA-based wireless data
and wireless Internet products. As part of these investment activities, we may
provide financing to facilitate the marketing and sale of CDMA equipment by
authorized suppliers. In the event additional needs for cash arise, we may
raise additional funds from a combination of sources including potential debt
and equity issuance.

On September 25, 2003, Embratel entered into an agreement to acquire from
us for nominal consideration the Vésper Operating Companies, excluding the
tower and rooftop antennae assets and related property leases (Tower Sites).
Concurrent with the closing, Vésper will enter into a multi-year arrangement whereby it pays a
monthly fee to us to use the Tower Sites. The sum of these fees, net of certain
pass through expenses, is expected to exceed $77 million over the life of the
arrangement. The closing of the Embratel sale transaction is contingent upon a
number of events being completed prior to or concurrent with closing. We are
required to provide $6 million in interim funding to Vésper on, or prior to,
closing of the Embratel sale transaction. Assuming the requisite government
approvals are received and all conditions to close are satisfied, we anticipate
providing approximately $40 million to $45 million in aggregate



funding (including the
$6 million of interim funding) by the closing date to facilitate the Embratel sale transaction.

On July 14, 2003, we approved an additional $50 million investment in
Inquam, subject to certain conditions, including a matching $50 million
investment by another existing investor in Inquam. We are currently negotiating
the terms and conditions of an investment agreement. No commitments
related to these potential investments were in place at September 30, 2003.

Contractual Obligations

We have no significant contractual obligations not fully recorded on our
Consolidated Balance Sheets or fully disclosed in the Notes to our Consolidated
Financial Statements. We have no off-balance sheet arrangements as defined in
S-K 303(a)(4)(ii).

At September 30, 2003, our outstanding contractual obligations included
(in millions):

(1)

The majority of these commitments do not have fixed funding dates,
and the expected funding dates cannot be forecast. Amounts are presented
based on the expiration of the commitment, but actual funding may occur
earlier or not at all as funding is subject to certain conditions.
Commitments represent the maximum amounts to be financed or funded under
these arrangements; actual financing or funding may be in lesser
amounts.

(2)

Certain long-term liabilities reflected on our balance sheet, such as
unearned revenue, are not presented in this table because they do not
require cash settlement in the future.

The long-term financing commitment under our arrangement with Ericsson
included $346 million that expires on November 6, 2003.

Additional information regarding our financial commitments at September
30, 2003 is provided in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements. See
“Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 3 –
Composition of



Certain
Financial Statement Captions, Finance Receivables, Note 4 – Investments in
Other Entities, Note 9 – Commitments and Contingencies and Note 11 –
Acquisitions.”

Future Accounting Requirements

Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Interpretation No. 46 (FIN
46), “Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities,” was issued in January 2003.
FIN 46 requires certain variable interest entities to be consolidated by the
primary beneficiary of the entity if the equity investors in the entity do not
have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have
sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without
additional subordinated financial support from other parties. The provisions of
FIN 46 are effective immediately for all arrangements entered into after
January 31, 2003. Since January 31, 2003, we have not invested in any entities
we believe are variable interest entities. For those arrangements entered into
prior to February 1, 2003, we are required to adopt the provisions of FIN 46 at
the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2004, in accordance with the FASB Staff
Position 46-6 which delayed the effective date of FIN 46 for those
arrangements. We are in the process of determining the effect, if any, the
adoption of FIN 46 will have on our financial statements.

Item 7a. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure about Market Risk

Interest Rate Market Risk.

We have fixed income securities consisting of
cash equivalents and investments in marketable debt securities. We also have
diversified portfolios of non-investment grade securities managed by
institutional portfolio managers, which are subject to a higher degree of
default risk than our investment grade fixed income portfolios. Changes in the
general level of United States interest rates can affect the principal values
and yields of fixed income investments. Our fixed income investments have grown
significantly in size and are subject to interest rate risk and credit risk. If
interest rates in the general economy were to rise rapidly in a short period of
time, our fixed income investments could lose value. If the general economy
were to weaken significantly, the credit profile of issuers of securities held
in our investment portfolios could deteriorate and our fixed income investments
could lose value. We may implement investment strategies of different types
with varying duration and risk/return trade-offs that do not perform well. (See
Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements – Marketable Securities for
information about investments in marketable debt securities.)

We have finance receivables and notes receivable (included in other
assets) from third parties that bear interest at both fixed and variable rates
(see Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements – Composition of Certain
Financial Statement Captions for information about finance receivables).
Interest earned on certain finance receivables and notes is at variable
interest rates and is affected by changes in the general level of United States
interest rates and/or changes in the LIBOR index. Finance receivables and notes
that bear interest at fixed rates could lose value if interest rates increase.

The following table provides information about our financial instruments
that are sensitive to changes in interest rates. For our fixed income
investment portfolio, the table presents principal cash flows and related
weighted-average yield at cost. For our finance receivables and notes
receivable, the table presents contractual interest rates by expected maturity
dates. Additionally, we have assumed that our fixed income securities are
similar enough within the specified categories to aggregate those securities
for presentation purposes.

The Vésper-related bank loans and $33 million of the capital lease
obligations are callable by the bank creditors as a result of the failure of
the Vésper Operating Companies to make interest and certain lease payments. The
Vésper Operating Companies were charged a 2% default penalty and are being
charged an additional 1% interest rate per month on the amount in default until
the default is cured. The bank creditors have provided forbearance through
December 15, 2003 with respect to the amounts owed under certain agreements
that are in payment default. (See Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements – Acquisitions for information about long-term debt.) The fair
values of bank loans and capital lease obligations will change as interest
rates change. Interest expense will be affected by changes in the Certificate
of Deposit InterBank (CDI) rate.

Equity Price Market Risk.

We hold marketable securities and derivative
instruments subject to equity price risk which are accounted for under FAS 115
and FAS 133. The recorded values of marketable equity securities totaled $140
million at September 30, 2003. As of September 30, 2003, one equity position
constituted approximately 59% of the fair value of the marketable securities
portfolio. The recorded value of derivative instruments subject to FAS 133 at
September 30, 2003 was $2 million. We generally invest in technology companies
and typically do not attempt to reduce or eliminate our market exposure on
these securities. These investments are held for purposes other



than trading.
The portfolio’s concentrations in specific companies and industry segments may
vary over time, and changes in concentrations may affect the portfolio’s price
volatility. During the last three years, many technology stocks experienced
significant decreases in value, negatively affecting the fair values of our
available-for-sale equity securities and derivative instruments. A 10% decrease
in the market price of our marketable equity
securities, at September 30, 2003 would cause a corresponding 10% decrease
in the carrying amounts of these securities, or $14 million.

Our strategic investments in other entities consist substantially of
investments in private early stage companies accounted for under the equity and
cost methods. Accordingly, we believe that our exposure to market risk from
these investments is not material. Additionally, we do not anticipate any
near-term changes in the nature of our market risk exposures or in management’s
objectives and strategies with respect to managing such exposures. The recorded
values of these strategic investments totaled $153 million at September 30,
2003.

Additional information regarding our strategic investments is provided in
Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Operating
Results in this Annual Report.

Foreign Exchange Market Risk.

We manage our exposure to foreign exchange
market risks, when deemed appropriate, through the use of derivative financial
instruments, consisting primarily of forward contracts and options. Derivative
financial instruments are viewed as risk management tools and are not used for
speculative or trading purposes. At September 30, 2003, no foreign currency
forward contracts were outstanding. (See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements – The Company and its Significant Accounting Policies for a
description of our foreign currency accounting policies.)

Financial instruments held by consolidated subsidiaries and equity method
investees which are not denominated in the functional currency of those
entities are subject to the effects of currency fluctuations and may affect
reported earnings. As a global concern, we face exposure to adverse movements
in foreign currency exchange rates. We may hedge currency exposures associated
with certain assets and liabilities denominated in nonfunctional currencies and
certain anticipated nonfunctional currency transactions. As a result, we could
experience unanticipated gains or losses on anticipated foreign currency cash
flows, as well as economic loss with respect to the recoverability of
investments. While we may hedge certain transactions with non-United States
customers, declines in currency values in certain regions may, if not reversed,
adversely affect future product sales because our products may become more
expensive to purchase in the countries of the affected currencies.

We are exposed to foreign exchange risk related to our consolidation of
the Vésper Operating Companies. We report our financial statements in U.S.
dollars. The Vésper Operating Companies account for the majority of their
transactions in Brazilian real, and their results are translated into U.S.
dollars during and at the end of the fiscal quarter. In addition, the Vésper
Operating Companies capital lease commitments are denominated in U.S. dollars.
As a result, a significant change in the value of the U.S. dollar against the
Brazilian real could have a material effect on the Vésper Operating Companies
and on us. A significant devaluation of the Brazilian real occurred in the past
and may occur again in the future. A 10% weakening of the U.S. dollar relative
to the Brazilian real during fiscal 2003 would have resulted in a decrease in
net income of approximately $25 million for the year ended September 30, 2003.

Finance receivables and notes receivable from international carriers and
customers that do not use the United States dollar as their functional
currencies subject us to credit risk. Because our financing is U.S. dollar
denominated, any significant change in the value of the U.S. dollar against the
debtors’ functional currencies could result in an increase in the debtor’s cash
flow requirements and could thereby affect our ability to collect our
receivables. At September 30, 2003, finance and note receivables from
international carriers and customers totaled $214 million, net of allowances.

Our analysis methods used to assess and mitigate risk discussed above
should not be considered projections of future risks.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT AUDITORS

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of QUALCOMM Incorporated

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in the index
appearing under Item 15(a)(1) on page 62 present fairly, in all material
respects, the financial position of QUALCOMM Incorporated and its subsidiaries
(the “Company”) at September 30, 2003 and 2002, and the results of their
operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
September 30, 2003 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States of America. In addition, in our opinion, the financial
statement schedule listed in the index appearing under Item 15(a)(2) on page 62
presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein
when read in conjunction with the related consolidated financial statements.
These financial statements and financial statement schedule are the
responsibility of the Company’s management; our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these financial statements and financial statement schedule based on
our audits. We conducted our audits of these statements in accordance with
auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America, which
require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about
whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit
includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles
used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the
Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 142, “Goodwill
and Other Intangible Assets,” during the year ended September 30, 2003, and the
Company changed its method of recognizing revenue and adopted Statement of
Financial Accounting Standard No. 133, “Accounting for Derivative Instruments
and Hedging Activities,” during the year ended September 30, 2001.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Note 1. The Company and its Significant Accounting Policies

The Company

QUALCOMM Incorporated (the Company or QUALCOMM), a Delaware corporation,
develops, designs, manufactures and markets digital wireless telecommunications
products and services based on its Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA)
technology. The Company is a leading developer and supplier of CDMA-based
integrated circuits and system software for wireless voice and data
communications and global positioning system products to wireless device and
infrastructure manufacturers. The Company grants licenses to use its
intellectual property portfolio, which includes certain patent rights essential
to and/or useful in the manufacture and sale of CDMA products, and receives
license fees as well as ongoing royalties based on sales by licensees of
wireless telecommunications equipment products incorporating its CDMA
technologies. The Company provides satellite and terrestrial-based two-way data
messaging and position reporting services for transportation companies, private
fleets and construction equipment fleets. The Company provides the BREW (Binary
Runtime Environment for Wireless) product and services to network operators,
handset manufacturers and application developers and support for developing and
delivering over-the-air wireless applications and services. The Company also
makes strategic investments to promote the worldwide adoptions of CDMA products
and services for wireless voice and Internet data communications.

Principles of Consolidation

The Company’s consolidated financial statements include the assets,
liabilities and operating results of majority-owned subsidiaries and other
subsidiaries controlled by the Company. The ownership of the other interest
holders of consolidated subsidiaries is reflected as minority interest. All
significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated.

Financial Statement Preparation

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and the disclosure
of contingent amounts in the Company’s financial statements and the
accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Certain
prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year
presentation.

Fiscal Year

The Company operates and reports using a 52-53 week fiscal year ending on
the last Sunday in September. As a result, the fiscal years ended September 30,
2003, 2002, and 2001 include 52 weeks, 52 weeks, and 53 weeks, respectively.
For presentation purposes, the Company presents its fiscal years as ending on
September 30.

Revenue Recognition

The Company derives revenue principally from sales of integrated circuit
products, from royalties, from messaging and other services and related
hardware sales, from software development and related services, and from
license fees for intellectual property. The timing of revenue recognition and
the amount of revenue actually recognized in each case depends upon a variety
of factors, including the specific terms of each arrangement and the nature of
the Company’s deliverables and obligations.

In December 1999, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) issued
Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 101 (SAB 101), “Revenue Recognition in Financial
Statements” which the Company adopted in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2001 and
applied retroactively to the first quarter of fiscal 2001. The Company recorded
a $147 million loss, net of taxes of $98 million, as the cumulative effect of
the accounting change as of the beginning of fiscal 2001 to reflect the
deferral of revenue and expenses related to future periods. The Company
recognized $44 million, $66 million and $95 million during fiscal 2003, 2002
and 2001, respectively, in operating income related to revenue and expense that
were recognized in prior years.

In November 2002, the Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) issued Issue No.
00-21, “Accounting for Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables” which
the Company adopted in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003. This issue
addresses determination of whether an arrangement involving more than one
deliverable contains more than one unit of accounting and how arrangement
consideration should be measured and allocated to the separate units of

F-6


QUALCOMM Incorporated

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

accounting. Beginning with the
adoption of SAB 101 until the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003, the Company recognized revenues and
expenses from sales of certain satellite and terrestrial-based two-way data
messaging and position reporting hardware and related software products by its
QWBS division (Note 10) ratably over the shorter of the estimated useful life
of the hardware product or the expected messaging service period, which is
typically five years. SAB 101 required the ratable recognition of these sales
because the messaging service was considered integral to the functionality of
the hardware and software. Because EITF Issue No. 00-21 does not require the
deferral of revenue when an undelivered element is considered integral to the
functionality of a delivered element and because EITF Issue No. 00-21 otherwise
requires separate unit accounting, the Company began recognizing revenues and
expenses from such sales starting in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003 at the
time of shipment, or when title and risk of loss pass to the customer and other
criteria for revenue recognition are met, if later. The Company has elected to
adopt EITF Issue No. 00-21 prospectively for revenue arrangements entered into
after the third quarter of fiscal 2003, rather than reporting the change in
accounting as a cumulative-effect adjustment. As a result, during the fourth
quarter of fiscal 2003, the Company recognized certain revenue and related cost
of sales for QWBS equipment sales upon shipment, while continuing to amortize
unearned revenue and cost of sales, with an $11 million gross margin effect,
for units shipped in prior periods. Deferred revenues and expenses related to
the historical QWBS sales that will continue to be amortized in future periods
were $183 million and $102 million, respectively, at September 30, 2003. Gross
margin related to these prior sales is expected to be recognized as follows:
$37 million in fiscal 2004, $24 million in fiscal 2005, $13 million in fiscal
2006, $6 million in fiscal 2007 and $1 million in fiscal 2008.

The Company licenses rights to use its intellectual property portfolio,
which includes patent rights to use cdmaOne, CDMA2000 1X/1xEV-DO/1xEV-DV,
TD-SCDMA and WCDMA technologies. Licensees typically pay a non-refundable
license fee in one or more installments and on-going royalties based on their
sales of products incorporating the Company’s intellectual property. License
fees are generally recognized over the estimated period of future benefit to
the average licensee, typically five to seven years. The Company earns
royalties on CDMA products sold worldwide by its licensees in the period that
the licensees’ sales occur. The Company’s licensees, however, do not report and
pay royalties owed until the subsequent quarter and, in some instances, payment
is on a semi-annual basis. Therefore, the Company estimates royalty revenues
from certain licensees (the Estimated Licensees) in the current quarter when
reasonable estimates of such amounts can be made. Not all royalties earned are
estimated. Royalties for licensees for which the Company has minimal history
and certain licensees that do not buy its integrated circuit products are
recorded one quarter in arrears when they are reported to the Company by those
licensees. Estimates of royalty revenues for the Estimated Licensees are based
on analyses of the Company’s sales of integrated circuits to its Estimated
Licensees, historical royalty data by Estimated Licensee, the relationship
between the timing of the Company’s sales of integrated circuits to its
Estimated Licensees and its Estimated Licensees’ sales of CDMA products,
average sales price forecasts, and current market and economic trends. Once
royalty reports are received from the Estimated Licensees, the variance between
such reports and the estimate is recorded in royalty revenue in the period the
reports are received. The recognition of this variance in most cases lags the
royalty estimate by one quarter.

The following table summarizes royalty related data for fiscal 2003, 2002
and 2001 (in millions):

This amount is the estimate for the fourth quarter of the previous fiscal year.

For example, for fiscal 2002, the Company estimated royalties of $150
million from the Estimated Licensees for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2002. The
actual royalties reported to the Company by the Estimated Licensees, on a one
quarter lag basis, during the first quarter of fiscal 2003 were $167 million.
The variance of $17 million was recorded in royalty revenues in the first
quarter of fiscal 2003. Therefore, total royalty revenues from licensees for
fiscal 2003 of $838 million included: 1) the variance of $17 million, 2) other
royalties reported during fiscal 2003 of $670 million, and 3) the estimate made
in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003 of $151 million based upon Estimated
Licensees’ estimated sales during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003, which the
Company believes will be reported by the Estimated Licensees in the first
quarter of fiscal 2004.

Revenues from sales of the Company’s CDMA-based integrated circuits are
recognized at the time of shipment, or when title and risk of loss pass to the
customer and other criteria for revenue recognition are met, if later. Revenues
from providing services are recorded when earned. Revenues from long-term
contracts are generally recognized using the percentage-of-completion method of
accounting, based on costs incurred compared with total estimated costs. The
percentage-of-completion method relies on estimates of total contract revenue
and costs. Revenues and profit are subject to revisions as the contract
progresses to completion. Revisions in profit estimates are charged or credited
to income in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision
become known. If actual contract costs are greater than expected, reduction of
contract profit would be required. Billings on uncompleted contracts in excess
of incurred cost and accrued profits are classified as unearned revenue.
Estimated contract losses are recognized when determined. If substantive
uncertainty related to customer acceptance exists or the contract’s duration is
relatively short, the Company uses the completed-contract method.

Revenues from software license fees are recognized when all of the
following criteria are met: the written agreement is executed; the software is
delivered; the license fee is fixed and determinable; collectibility of the
license fee is probable; and if applicable, when vendor-specific objective
evidence exists to allocate the total license fee to elements of
multiple-element arrangements, including post-contract customer support. When
contracts contain multiple elements wherein vendor-specific objective evidence
exists for all undelivered elements, the Company recognizes revenue for the
delivered elements and defers revenue for the fair value of the undelivered
elements until the remaining obligations have been satisfied. If
vendor-specific objective evidence does not exist for all undelivered elements,
revenue for the delivered and undelivered elements is deferred until remaining
obligations have been satisfied, or if the only undelivered element is
post-contract customer support, revenue is recognized ratably over the support
period. Significant judgments and estimates are made in connection with the
recognition of software license revenue, including assessments of
collectibility and the fair value of deliverable elements. The amount or timing
of the Company’s software license revenue may differ as a result of changes in
these judgments or estimates.

Unearned revenue consists primarily of fees related to software products
and license fees for intellectual property for which delivery is not yet
complete and to hardware products sales with a continuing service obligation.

Concentrations

A significant portion of the Company’s revenues is concentrated with a
limited number of customers as the worldwide market for wireless
telecommunications products is dominated by a small number of large
corporations.

QUALCOMM Incorporated

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Revenues from Samsung, LG Electronics and Motorola, customers of the
Company’s QCT, QTL and other nonreportable segments, comprised 17%, 13% and 13%
of total consolidated revenues, respectively, in fiscal 2003. Revenues from
Samsung, Kyocera and LG Electronics, customers of the Company’s QCT, QTL and
other nonreportable segments, comprised 15%, 14% and 11% of total consolidated
revenues, respectively, in fiscal 2002, as compared to 14%, 12% and 10%,
respectively, in fiscal 2001. Aggregated accounts receivable from Samsung and LG
Electronics comprised 25% and 23% of net receivables at September 30, 2003 and
2002, respectively.

Revenues from international customers were approximately 78%, 70% and 65%
of total revenues in fiscal 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively.

Research and Development

Costs incurred in research and development activities are expensed as
incurred, except certain software development costs capitalized after
technological feasibility of the software is established.

Shipping and Handling Costs

Costs incurred for shipping and handling are included in cost of revenues
at the time the related revenue is recognized. Amounts billed to a customer for
shipping and handling are reported as revenue.

Income Taxes

The asset and liability approach is used to recognize deferred tax assets
and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary
differences between the carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and
liabilities. Tax law and rate changes are reflected in income in the period
such changes are enacted. The Company records a valuation allowance to reduce
the deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be
realized.

Cash Equivalents

The Company considers all highly liquid investments with original
maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents. Cash equivalents are
comprised of money market funds, certificates of deposit, commercial paper and
government agencies’ securities. The carrying amounts approximate fair value
due to the short maturities of these instruments.

Marketable Securities

Management determines the appropriate classification of marketable
securities at the time of purchase and reevaluates such designation as of each
balance sheet date. Held-to-maturity securities are carried at amortized cost,
which approximates fair value. Available-for-sale securities and trading
securities are stated at fair value as determined by the most recently traded
price of each security at the balance sheet date. The net unrealized gains or
losses on available-for-sale securities are reported as a component of
comprehensive income (loss), net of tax. Unrealized gains or losses on trading
securities are reported in investment income (expense). The specific
identification method is used to compute the realized gains and losses on debt
and equity securities.

The Company regularly monitors and evaluates the realizable value of its
marketable securities. When assessing marketable securities for
other-than-temporary declines in value, the Company considers such factors as,
among other things, how significant the decline in value is as a percentage of
the original cost, how long the market value of the investment has been less
than its original cost, the performance of the investee’s stock price in
relation to the stock price of its competitors within the industry and the
market in general, analyst recommendations, any news that has been released
specific to the investee and the outlook for the overall industry in which the
investee operates. The Company also reviews the financial statements of the
investee to determine if the investee is experiencing financial difficulties
and considers new products/services that the investee may have forthcoming that
will improve its operating results. If events and circumstances indicate that a
decline in the value of these assets has occurred and is other than temporary,
the Company records a charge to investment income (expense).

Allowances for Doubtful Accounts

The Company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated
losses resulting from the inability of the Company’s customers to make required
payments. The Company considers the following factors when determining

F-9


QUALCOMM Incorporated

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

if
collection of a fee is reasonably assured: customer credit-worthiness, past
transaction history with the customer,
current economic industry trends and changes in customer payment terms. If
the Company has no previous experience with the customer, the Company typically
obtains reports from various credit organizations to ensure that the customer
has a history of paying its creditors. The Company may also request financial
information, including financial statements or other documents (e.g., bank
statements) to ensure that the customer has the means of making payment. If
these factors do not indicate collection is reasonably assured, revenue is
deferred until collection becomes reasonably assured, which is generally upon
receipt of cash. If the financial condition of the Company’s customers were to
deteriorate, adversely affecting their ability to make payments, additional
allowances would be required.

The Company also maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated
losses resulting from the inability of entities it has financed to make
required payments. The Company evaluates the adequacy of allowances for
doubtful finance and note receivables based on analyses of the financed
entities’ credit-worthiness, current economic trends or market conditions,
review of the entities’ current and projected financial and operational
information, and consideration of the fair value of collateral to be received,
if applicable. From time to time, the Company may consider third party
evaluations, valuation reports or advice from investment banks. If the
financial condition of the financed entities were to deteriorate, adversely
affecting their ability to make payments, additional allowances would be
required.

Inventories

Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market (replacement cost,
not to exceed net realizable value) using the first-in, first-out method.
Recoverability of inventory is assessed based on review of committed purchase
orders from customers, as well as purchase commitment projections provided by
customers, among other things.

Property, Plant and Equipment

Property, plant and equipment are recorded at cost and depreciated or
amortized using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives.
Buildings and building improvements are depreciated over thirty years and
fifteen years, respectively. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the
shorter of their estimated useful lives or the remaining term of the related
lease. Other property, plant and equipment have useful lives ranging from two
to eighteen years. Direct external and internal costs of developing software
for internal use are capitalized subsequent to the preliminary stage of
development. Maintenance, repairs, and minor renewals and betterments are
charged to expense as incurred.

Upon the retirement or disposition of property, plant and equipment, the
related cost and accumulated depreciation or amortization are removed and the
gain or loss is recorded.

Other Investments

Investments in Other Entities

The Company makes strategic investments in companies that have developed
or are developing innovative wireless data applications and wireless carriers
that promote the worldwide deployment of CDMA systems. Investments in corporate
entities with less than a 20% voting interest are generally accounted for under
the cost method. The Company uses the equity method to account for investments
in corporate entities in which it has a voting interest of 20% to 50% and other
than minor to 50% ownership interests in partnerships and limited liability
corporations, or in which it otherwise has the ability to exercise significant
influence. Under the equity method, the investment is originally recorded at
cost and adjusted to recognize the Company’s share of net earnings or losses of
the investee, limited to the extent of the Company’s investment in and advances
to the investee and financial guarantees on behalf of the investee that create
additional basis.

The Company regularly monitors and evaluates the realizable value of its
investments. When assessing an investment for an other-than-temporary decline
in value, the Company considers such factors as, among other things, the share
price from the investee’s latest financing round, the performance of the
investee in relation to its own operating targets and its business plan, the
investee’s revenue and cost trends, as well as liquidity and cash position,
including its cash burn rate, market acceptance of the investee’s
products/services as well as any new products or services that may be
forthcoming, any significant news that has been released specific to the
investee or the

F-10


QUALCOMM Incorporated

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

investee’s competitors and/or industry, and the outlook for the
overall industry in which the investee operates. From time to time, the Company
may consider third party evaluations, valuation reports or advice from
investment
banks. If events and circumstances indicate that a decline in the value of
these assets has occurred and is other than temporary, the Company records a
charge to investment income (expense).

Derivatives

The Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133
(FAS 133), “Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities,” as
of the beginning of fiscal 2001. FAS 133 requires that certain derivative
instruments be recorded at fair value. Derivative instruments held by the
Company are comprised of warrants and other rights to purchase equity interests
in certain other companies acquired as a result of strategic investment and
financing activities. The Company recorded a $129 million gain, net of taxes of
$87 million, as the cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle as
of the beginning of fiscal 2001. The cumulative effect of the accounting change
related primarily to the recognition of the unrealized gain on a warrant to
purchase 4,500,000 shares of Leap Wireless International, Inc. (Leap Wireless)
common stock issued to the Company in connection with its spin-off of Leap
Wireless in September 1998 (Leap Wireless Spin-off). At September 30, 2003 and
2002, the Company had the right to purchase 3,375,000 shares of Leap Wireless
common stock under the warrant. The warrant’s value was insignificant at
September 30, 2003 and 2002.

The Company holds warrants to purchase equity interests in certain other
publicly-traded and private companies related to its strategic investment
activities. The Company’s warrants are not held for trading purposes. The
Company’s warrants are recorded at fair value. Changes in fair value are
recorded in investment income (expense) as a change in fair values of
derivative instruments because the warrants do not meet the requirements for
hedge accounting. Warrants that do not have contractual net settlement
provisions are recorded at cost.

The Company enters into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge
certain foreign currency transactions and probable anticipated foreign currency
transactions. Unrealized gains and losses arising from foreign currency forward
contracts are reported in investment income (expense) as a change in fair
values of derivative instruments because the forward contracts are not
designated as hedging instruments. The Company had no foreign currency forward
contracts outstanding as of September 30, 2003 and 2002.

At September 30, 2003 and 2002, the recorded value of the Company’s
derivative investments totaled $2 million and $1 million, respectively, and
none of the Company’s derivatives were designated as hedges. The Company’s
derivative investments are included in other investments.

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

Goodwill represents the excess of purchase price and related costs over
the value assigned to the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets of
businesses acquired. Effective as of the beginning of fiscal 2003, the Company
fully adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 141 (FAS 141),
“Business Combinations,” and Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.
142 (FAS 142), “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets.” The provisions of FAS
141 (1) require that the purchase method of accounting be used for all business
combinations initiated after June 30, 2001, (2) provide specific criteria for
the initial recognition and measurement of intangible assets apart from
goodwill, and (3) require that unamortized negative goodwill be written off
immediately as an extraordinary gain instead of being deferred and amortized.
FAS 141 also required that, upon adoption of FAS 142, the Company reclassify
the carrying amounts of certain intangible assets into or out of goodwill,
based on certain criteria. Upon the adoption of FAS 142, the Company
reclassified approximately $2 million of certain intangible assets into
goodwill.

FAS 142 primarily addresses the accounting for goodwill and intangible
assets subsequent to their initial recognition. The provisions of FAS 142 (1)
prohibit the amortization of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets,
(2) require that goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets be tested
annually for impairment (and in interim periods if certain events occur
indicating that the carrying value of goodwill and/or indefinite-lived
intangible assets may be impaired), (3) require that reporting units be
identified for the purpose of assessing potential impairments of goodwill, and
(4) remove the forty-year limitation on the amortization period of intangible
assets that have finite lives. The Company completed its transitional testing
for goodwill impairment upon adoption of FAS 142 and its annual testing for
fiscal 2003 and determined that its recorded goodwill was not impaired.

F-11


QUALCOMM Incorporated

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Starting in fiscal 2003, the Company no longer records goodwill
amortization. Goodwill is tested annually for impairment and in interim periods
if certain events occur indicating that the carrying value of goodwill may be
impaired. Other intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis
over their useful lives, ranging from three to twenty-eight years. Software
development costs are capitalized when a product’s technological feasibility
has been established through the date a product is available for general
release to customers.

The results of operations and earnings per share, assuming FAS 142 had
been adopted at the beginning of fiscal 2001, are as follows (in thousands,
except per share data):

Valuation of Long-Lived and Intangible Assets

The Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 144
(FAS 144), “Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets” as
of the beginning of fiscal 2003. The adoption of this accounting standard did
not have a material impact on the Company’s operating results and financial
position. The Company assesses potential impairments to its long-lived assets
when there is evidence that events or changes in circumstances indicate that
the carrying amount of an asset may not be recovered. An impairment loss is
recognized when the carrying amount of the long-lived asset is not recoverable
and exceeds its fair value. The carrying amount of a long-lived asset is not
recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to
result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset. Any required
impairment loss is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of a
long-lived asset exceeds its fair value and is recorded as a reduction in the
carrying value of the related asset and a charge to operating results.

Litigation

The Company is currently involved in certain legal proceedings. The
Company estimates the range of liability related to pending litigation where
the amount and range of loss can be estimated. The Company records its best
estimate of a loss when the loss is considered probable. Where a liability is
probable and there is a range of estimated loss with no best estimate in the
range, the Company records the minimum estimated liability related to the
claim. As additional information becomes available, the Company assesses the
potential liability related to the Company’s pending litigation and revises its
estimates.

Guarantees and Product Warranties

Estimated future warranty obligations related to certain products are
provided by charges to operations in the period in which the related revenue is
recognized. The Company establishes a reserve for warranty obligations based on
its historical warranty experience.

In the normal course of business, the Company may provide guarantees to
other parties. Upon issuance of a guarantee, the Company recognizes a liability
for the fair value of the obligation it assumes under that guarantee, as
required. At September 30, 2003, liabilities related to guarantees were not
significant.

Stock-Based Compensation

The Company records compensation expense for employee stock options based
upon their intrinsic value on the date of grant pursuant to Accounting
Principles Board Opinion 25 (APB 25), “Accounting for Stock Issued to
Employees.” Because the Company establishes the exercise price based on the
fair market value of the Company’s stock at the date of grant, the options have
no intrinsic value upon grant, and therefore no expense is recorded. Each
quarter, the Company reports the potential dilutive impact of stock options in
its diluted earnings per share using the treasury-stock method.
Out-of-the-money stock options (i.e., the average stock price during the period
is below the strike price of the option) are not included in diluted earnings
per share.

Equity instruments issued to non-employees for goods or services are
accounted for at fair value and are marked to market until service is complete
or a performance commitment date is reached.

As required under Financial Accounting Standards Board Statement No. 123
(FAS 123), “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation,” and Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 148 (FAS 148), “Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation – Transition and Disclosure,” the pro forma effects of stock-based
compensation on net income and net earnings per common share have been
estimated at the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model
based on the following assumptions:

The Black-Scholes option-pricing model was developed for use in estimating
the fair value of traded options that have no restrictions and are fully
transferable and negotiable in a free trading market. Black-Scholes does not
consider the employment, transfer or vesting restrictions that are inherent in
the Company’s employee options. Use of an option valuation model, as required
by FAS 123, includes highly subjective assumptions based on long-term
predictions, including the expected stock price volatility and average life of
each option grant. Because the Company’s employee options have characteristics
significantly different from those of freely traded options, and because
changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect the Company’s
estimate of the fair value of those options, in the Company’s opinion, the
existing valuation models, including Black-Scholes, are not reliable single
measures and may misstate the fair value of the Company’s employee options. As
required by FAS 123, the Black-Scholes weighted average estimated fair values
of stock options granted during fiscal 2003, 2002 and 2001 were $19.33, $28.20
and $44.25 per share, respectively. The weighted average estimated fair values
of purchase

rights pursuant to the Employee Stock Purchase Plans during fiscal
2003, 2002 and 2001 were $9.60, $14.57 and $24.20, respectively, per share.

For purposes of pro forma disclosures, the estimated fair value of the
options is assumed to be amortized to expense over the options’ vesting
periods. The pro forma effects of recognizing compensation expense under the
fair value method on net income and net earnings per common share for the years
ended September 30 were as follows (in thousands, except for earnings per
share):

Foreign Currency

Foreign subsidiaries operating in a local currency environment use the
local currency as the functional currency. Assets and liabilities are
translated to United States dollars at year-end exchange rates; revenues,
expenses, gains and losses are translated at rates of exchange that approximate
the rates in effect at the transaction date. Resulting translation gains or
losses are recognized as a component of other comprehensive income. The
functional currency of the Company’s foreign investees that do not use local
currencies is the United States dollar. Where the United States dollar is the
functional currency, the monetary assets and liabilities are translated into
United States dollars at the exchange rate in effect at the balance sheet date.
Revenues, expenses, gains and losses associated with the monetary assets and
liabilities are translated at the rates of exchange that approximate the rates
in effect at the transaction date. Non-monetary assets and liabilities and
related elements of expense, gains and losses are translated at historical
rates. Resulting translation gains or losses of these foreign investees are
recognized in the statements of operations.

During fiscal 2003 and 2001, net foreign currency transaction gains and
losses included in the Company’s statements of operations were insignificant.
During fiscal 2002, net foreign currency transaction losses included in the
Company’s statements of operations were $11 million.

Comprehensive Income

Comprehensive income (loss) is defined as the change in equity of a
business enterprise during a period from transactions and other events and
circumstances from non-owner sources, including foreign currency translation
adjustments and unrealized gains and losses on marketable securities. The
Company presents other comprehensive income (loss) in its consolidated
statements of stockholders’ equity.

The reclassification adjustment for other-than-temporary losses on
marketable securities results from the recognition of unrealized losses in the
statement of operations resulting from declines in the market prices of those
securities deemed to be other than temporary. The reclassification adjustment
for net realized losses (gains) results from the recognition of the net
realized losses or gains in the statement of operations when the marketable
securities are sold. The reclassification adjustment for losses included in the
accounting change results from the recognition of unrealized losses
attributable to derivative instruments as of the beginning of fiscal 2001 in
the statement of

operations as a result of the implementation of FAS 133. Unrealized losses
on certain derivative instruments subject to FAS 133 were previously recorded
as a component of other comprehensive income (loss).

Earnings Per Common Share

Basic earnings (loss) per common share is computed by dividing net income
(loss) by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the
reporting period. Diluted earnings (loss) per common share is computed by
dividing net income (loss) by the combination of dilutive common share
equivalents, comprised of shares issuable under the Company’s stock-based
compensation plans and the weighted average number of common shares outstanding
during the reporting period.

The incremental dilutive common share equivalents, calculated using the
treasury stock method, for fiscal 2003 and 2002 were 28,169,000 and 38,442,000,
respectively. The diluted loss per common share for fiscal 2001 is based only
on the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period,
as the inclusion of 51,188,000 common share equivalents would have been
anti-dilutive.

Stock options to purchase approximately 43,270,0000, 40,845,000 and
14,427,000 shares of common stock during fiscal 2003, 2002 and 2001
respectively, were outstanding but not included in the computation of diluted
earnings (loss) per common share because the option exercise price was greater
than the average market price of the common stock, and therefore, the effect on
dilutive earnings (loss) per share would be anti-dilutive.

Future Accounting Requirements

Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Interpretation No. 46 (FIN
46), “Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities,” was issued in January 2003.
FIN 46 requires certain variable interest entities to be consolidated by the
primary beneficiary of the entity if the equity investors in the entity do not
have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have
sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without
additional subordinated financial support from other parties. The provisions of
FIN 46 are effective immediately for all arrangements entered into after
January 31, 2003. Since January 31, 2003, the Company has not invested in any
entities it believes are variable interest entities. For those arrangements
entered into prior to February 1, 2003, the Company is required to adopt the
provisions of FIN 46 at the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2004, in
accordance with the FASB Staff Position 46-6 which delayed the effective date
of FIN 46 for those arrangements. The Company is in the process of determining
the effect, if any, the adoption of FIN 46 will have on its financial
statements.

referred to as Pegaso). On September 10, 2002, Telefónica Móviles (Telefónica)
acquired a 65% controlling interest in Pegaso. On October 10, 2002, Pegaso paid
$82 million in full satisfaction of the interim and additional interim loans.
On November 8, 2002, Pegaso paid $435 million in full satisfaction of the
bridge loan facility. The Company used approximately $139 million of the bridge
loan proceeds to purchase outstanding vendor debt owed by Pegaso to other
lenders. On March 31, 2003, Pegaso paid $4 million on the equipment loan
facility. On June 13, 2003, Pegaso prepaid $281 million of the equipment loan
facility, including accrued interest, in accordance with certain terms of the
equipment loan facility. As a result of these transactions, finance receivables
from Pegaso decreased by $663 million.

At September 30, 2003, amounts outstanding, net of deferred interest,
under the Pegaso equipment loan facility were $181 million, including the
acquired vendor debt, as compared to $821 million outstanding under the various
financing arrangements with Pegaso at September 30, 2002. The remaining
equipment loan facility outstanding with Pegaso, including the acquired vendor
debt, is payable quarterly starting in March 2006 through December 2008 and
bears interest at the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus 1% through
September 9, 2004, LIBOR plus 3% thereafter through September 9, 2007 and LIBOR
plus 6% thereafter. The Company recognized $41 million, $9 million and $90
million in interest income related to the Pegaso financing arrangements during
fiscal 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively, including $23 million of deferred
interest income recorded as a result of the prepayment in fiscal 2003.

At September 30, 2003, commitments to extend long-term financing by the
Company to certain CDMA customers of Ericsson totaled approximately $464
million. The commitment to fund $346 million of this amount expires on November
6, 2003. The funding of the remaining $118 million, if it occurs, is not
subject to a fixed expiration date. The financing commitments are subject to
the CDMA customers meeting conditions prescribed in the financing arrangements
and, in certain cases, to Ericsson also financing a portion of such sales and
services. This financing is generally collateralized by the related equipment.
Commitments represent the maximum amounts to be financed under these
arrangements; actual financing may be in lesser amounts.

million, respectively. At September 30, 2003 and 2002, buildings and
improvements and leasehold improvements with a net book value of $66 million
and $86 million, respectively, including accumulated depreciation and
amortization of $52 million and $43 million, respectively, were leased or held
for lease to third parties. Future minimum rental income in each of the next
five years from fiscal 2004 to 2008 are $14 million, $7 million, $7 million, $7
million and $6 million, respectively.

Intangible Assets

Starting in fiscal 2003, the Company no longer records goodwill
amortization (Note 1). The Company’s reportable segment assets do not include
goodwill (Note 10). The Company allocated goodwill to its reporting units for
transition testing purposes as of the date of its adoption of FAS 142. Goodwill
was allocated to reporting units included in the Company’s reportable segments
as follows: $268 million in QUALCOMM CDMA Technologies, $73 million in QUALCOMM
Technology Licensing, $4 million in QUALCOMM Wireless & Internet and $2 million
in QUALCOMM Strategic Initiatives.

All of the Company’s acquired intangible assets other than goodwill are
subject to amortization. During fiscal 2003, the Company acquired $82 million
in personal mobile services (SMP) licenses in Brazil. During fiscal 2003, the
Company recorded a $160 million impairment loss on its long-lived assets in its
QUALCOMM Strategic Initiatives (QSI) segment related to Vésper (Note 11),
including impairment of $34 million in wireless licenses, $12 million in
marketing-related intangible assets and $5 million in customer-related
intangible assets. The impairment loss recognized was the difference between
the assets’ carrying values and their estimated fair values.

During fiscal 2001, the Company acquired licenses in the third generation
wireless spectrum auctions in Australia for $84 million. During fiscal 2003,
the Company recorded a $34 million impairment loss in its QSI segment on its
wireless licenses in Australia due to recent developments that affected
potential strategic alternatives for using the spectrum. The impairment loss
recognized was the difference between the assets’ carrying values and their
estimated fair values.

technology, primarily in Europe. The Company provided the final $27 million
under this equity commitment during fiscal 2003 and had no remaining equity
funding commitment at September 30, 2003.

On March 26, 2003, the Company agreed to extend $25 million of bridge loan
financing to Inquam. Another investor in Inquam also agreed to provide $25
million in bridge loan financing. The Company provided the $25 million in
funding during fiscal 2003 and had no remaining commitment under the bridge
loan at September 30, 2003.

On July 14, 2003, the Company approved an additional $50 million
investment in Inquam, subject to certain conditions, including a matching $50
million investment by another existing investor in Inquam. No commitments
related to these potential investments were in place at September 30, 2003. On
September 19, 2003, the Company and this other existing investor each agreed to
provide an additional $5 million bridge financing to enable Inquam to meet its
cash flow requirements while the terms of a new equity investment are being
negotiated. It is the intention of both parties that this second $10 million
bridge loan will be repaid with the proceeds from the anticipated equity
investment. The Company provided $2 million under this second bridge loan
during fiscal 2003 and had a remaining funding commitment of $3 million at
September 30, 2003.

On September 22, 2003, the Company and another investor in Inquam agreed
to guarantee the payment of amounts due by Inquam under a bank credit
agreement. The Company’s maximum liability under the guarantee is limited to an
amount equal to 50% of the amounts outstanding under Inquam’s credit agreement,
up to a maximum of $10 million. No amounts were outstanding under the bank
credit agreement as of September 30, 2003.

The Company uses the equity method to account for its investment in
Inquam. During fiscal 2003, the Company recorded an $11 million
other-than-temporary impairment loss related to its investment in Inquam. The
impairment loss was the difference between the carrying value of the investment
and its estimated fair value. At September 30, 2003, the Company’s equity and
debt investment in Inquam was $68 million, net of equity in losses and
impairment. The Company expects that Inquam will focus its resources on the
development of CDMA properties in the 450MHz frequency band in Romania and
western Europe and will transfer its non-CDMA operations to one or more of
Inquam’s other shareholders. Inquam is expected to use approximately $70
million to $80 million in cash through the first half of calendar 2004.
Inquam’s management does not expect Inquam to be cash flow positive until
calendar 2007 with its current business plan. If the Inquam operating companies
cannot raise debt financing as expected or new investors cannot be found,
Inquam’s growth potential and the value of the Company’s investment in Inquam
may be negatively affected.

Inquam’s summarized financial information, derived from its unaudited
financial statements, is as follows (in thousands):

Globalstar L.P.

Under now-terminated contracts with Globalstar L.P. (Globalstar), the
Company designed, developed and manufactured subscriber products and ground
communications systems utilizing CDMA technology and provided contract
development services. Globalstar was formed to design, construct, and operate a
worldwide, low-Earth-orbit satellite-based telecommunications system (the
Globalstar System). Through partnership interests held in certain intermediate
limited partnerships and other indirect interests, the Company owns an
approximate 6.3% interest in Globalstar.

On January 16, 2001, Globalstar announced that, in order to have
sufficient funds available for the continued progress of its marketing and
service activities, it had suspended indefinitely principal and interest
payments on all of its debt, including its vendor financing obligations. As a
result, Globalstar did not make an approximately $22 million payment for
principal and interest due to the Company on January 15, 2001. Globalstar also
announced its intent to restructure its debt. As a result, the Company recorded
total net charges of $49 million in cost of revenues, $519 million in asset
impairment and related charges, $10 million in investment expense and $58
million in other non-operating charges during fiscal 2001 related primarily to
the impairment of certain assets related to its business with Globalstar.
Globalstar filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection during fiscal 2002. On
April 25, 2003, the U.S. Bankruptcy Court approved the sale of Globalstar’s
assets to a new company to be controlled by ICO Global Communications
(Holdings) Limited (ICO), however ICO has indicated as of October 2003 that it
does not believe it will complete the acquisition. Globalstar has opened
negotiations with other parties with respect to an acquisition of Globalstar’s
assets.

The Company continues to provide services and sell products to Globalstar
service providers and other customers involved with the Globalstar System. In
addition, the Company is in negotiations with potential acquirers to provide
products and services to the new operating company.

Revenues resulting from agreements with Globalstar and its consolidated
subsidiaries for fiscal 2003, 2002 and 2001 were $12 million, $4 million and
$35 million, respectively. The Company recorded net credits of
$11 million and
$4 million during fiscal 2003 and 2002, respectively, related to sales of
previously impaired assets. The Company did not recognize any interest income
related to Globalstar during fiscal 2003, 2002 and 2001. All receivables from,
loans to and investments in Globalstar have no remaining recorded values at
September 30, 2003.

Other

Other strategic investments as of September 30, 2003 and 2002 amounted to
$87 million and $130 million, respectively, including $33 million and $73
million, respectively, accounted for using the cost method. The fair values of
cost method investments approximate their recorded values. At September 30,
2003, effective ownership interests in the investees ranged from less than 1%
to 50%.

Summarized financial information regarding our principal equity method
investments, excluding Inquam and Vésper (Note 11), derived from their
unaudited financial statements, follows. These investments are noncontrolling
interests in venture capital funds. Information is presented in the aggregate,

During fiscal 2003, management determined that declines in the market
value of the Company’s investment in Korea Telecom Freetel Co., Ltd. (KTF), a
wireless operator in South Korea, were other than temporary. In reaching this
conclusion, the decline in stock value as a percentage of the original cost and
the length of time in which the market value of the investment had been below
its original cost were considered. As a result, the Company recorded $81
million in other-than-temporary losses on marketable securities. The Company
holds 4,416,000 common shares of KTF as of September 30, 2003. The fair value
of the common shares was $82 million at September 30, 2003.

During fiscal 2002, management determined that declines in the market
values of the Company’s investments in Leap Wireless (Note 1) were other than
temporary when those values declined significantly due to unfavorable business
developments. Subsequently, Leap Wireless filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy
protection in April, 2003. The Company recorded $162 million and $18 million in
other-than-temporary losses on marketable securities for the notes and stock,
respectively, during fiscal 2002. The Company also recorded $59 million and
$213 million in losses related to changes in the fair values of Leap Wireless
derivative investments for fiscal 2002 and 2001,
respectively. The Company holds 308,000 units of Leap Wireless’ senior
discount notes with detachable warrants for $150 million. The warrants entitle
each holder to purchase 2.503 common shares per each senior discount note unit
held at

$96.80 per common share. In addition, the Company holds 489,000 shares of Leap
Wireless’ common stock at September 30, 2003 and a warrant to purchase common
stock issued to the Company in connection with its spin-off of Leap Wireless.
The fair values of the senior discount notes and the common stock totaled $29
million, and the warrants had insignificant value at September 30, 2003.

During fiscal 2001, the Company recorded an other-than-temporary
impairment charge of $134 million in investment income (expense) related to its
investment in NetZero, Inc. (NetZero). NetZero was a publicly-traded company
that provided Internet access and services to consumers and on-line direct
marketing services to advertisers. Effective September 26, 2001, NetZero and
Juno Online Services, Inc. completed a merger and became United Online, Inc.
(United Online). The Company received 2,300,000 shares of United Online for its
11,500,000 shares of NetZero, representing an approximate 5.7% interest in
United Online. During fiscal 2003, the Company sold its shares in United
Online, resulting in realized gains of $53 million. At September 30, 2003, the
Company no longer holds shares in United Online.

The Company did not provide for United States income taxes and foreign
withholding taxes on a cumulative total of approximately $877 million of
undistributed earnings for certain non-United States subsidiaries. The Company
considers the operating earnings of non-United States subsidiaries to be
indefinitely invested outside the United States. Should the Company repatriate
foreign earnings, the Company would have to adjust the income tax provision in
the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known.

At September 30, 2003 and 2002, the Company had net deferred tax assets as
follows (in thousands):

The Company reversed approximately $1.1 billion of its valuation allowance
on substantially all of its United States deferred tax assets during fiscal
2003 as a credit to stockholders’ equity. The Company now believes that it will
more likely than not have sufficient taxable income after stock option
deductions to utilize its deferred tax assets. Although the majority of foreign
net operating losses will not expire, the Company continues to provide a
valuation allowance on substantially all of its foreign deferred tax assets
totaling $494 million at September 30, 2003 because of uncertainty regarding their realization due to a history of losses
from operations. The Company also provides a valuation allowance
totaling $166 million at September 30, 2003 on all net
capital losses generated after September 30, 2002 because of uncertainty
regarding their realization. If any portion of
the valuation allowance is removed, the release would be accounted
for as a reduction of the income tax provision.

At September 30, 2003, the Company had unused federal and state income tax
credits of $505 million and $118 million, respectively, generally expiring from
2004 through 2023. The Company does not expect these credits to expire unused.

F-24


QUALCOMM Incorporated

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Cash amounts paid for income taxes were $125 million, $89 million and $75
million for fiscal 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. The income taxes paid
primarily relate to foreign withholding taxes.

Note 7. Capital Stock

Preferred Stock

The Company has 8,000,000 shares of preferred stock authorized for
issuance in one or more series, at a par value of $0.0001 per share. In
conjunction with the distribution of Preferred Share Purchase Rights, 1,500,000
shares of preferred stock are designated as Series A Junior Participating
Preferred Stock and reserved such shares for issuance upon exercise of the
Preferred Share Purchase Rights. At September 30, 2003 and 2002, no shares of
preferred stock were outstanding.

Preferred Share Purchase Rights Plan

The Company has a Preferred Share Purchase Rights Plan (Rights Plan) to
protect stockholders’ rights in the event of a proposed takeover of the
Company. Under the Rights Plan, the Company declared a dividend of one
preferred share purchase right (a Right) for each share of the Company’s common
stock outstanding. Pursuant to the Rights Plan, each Right entitles the
registered holder to purchase from the Company a one one-hundredth share of
Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock, $0.0001 par value per share, at
a purchase price of $250. In November 1999, the Rights Plan was amended to
provide that the purchase price be set at $400. The Rights are exercisable only
if a person or group (an Acquiring Person) acquires beneficial ownership of 15%
or more of the Company’s outstanding shares of common stock. Upon exercise,
holders, other than an Acquiring Person, will have the right, subject to
termination, to receive the Company’s common stock or other securities, cash or
other assets having a market value, as defined, equal to twice such purchase
price. The Rights, which expire on September 25, 2005, are redeemable in whole,
but not in part, at the Company’s option at any time for a price of $0.005 per
Right.

Stock Repurchase Program

On February 11, 2003, the Company authorized the expenditure of up to $1
billion to repurchase shares of the Company’s common stock over a two year
period. During fiscal 2003, the Company bought 4,915,000 shares at a net
aggregate cost of $158 million. At September 30, 2003, $834 million remains to
be expended. Repurchased shares are retired upon repurchase.

Note 8. Employee Benefit Plans

Employee Savings and Retirement Plan

The Company has a 401(k) plan that allows eligible employees to contribute
up to 50% of their eligible compensation, subject to annual limits. The Company
matches a portion of the employee contributions and may, at
its discretion, make additional contributions based upon earnings. The
Company’s contribution expense for fiscal 2003, 2002 and 2001 was $20 million,
$20 million and $19 million, respectively.

Stock Option Plans

F-25


QUALCOMM Incorporated

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

The Company may grant options to selected employees, directors and
consultants to the Company to purchase shares of the Company’s common stock at
a price not less than the fair market value of the stock at the date of grant.
The 2001 Stock Option Plan (the 2001 Plan) was adopted and replaced the 1991
Stock Option Plan (the 1991 Plan), which expired in August 2001. Options
granted under the 1991 Plan remain outstanding until exercised or cancelled.
The shares reserved under the 2001 Plan are equal to the number of shares
available for future grant under the 1991 Plan on the date the 2001 Plan was
approved by the Company’s stockholders. At that date, 50,541,570 shares were
available for future grants under the 2001 Plan. The Company may terminate the
2001 Plan at any time. The 2001 Plan provides for the grant of both incentive
stock options and non-qualified stock options. Generally, options outstanding
vest over periods not exceeding six years and are exercisable for up to ten
years from the grant date. At September 30, 2003, options for 62,972,000 shares
under both plans were exercisable at prices ranging from $2.19 to $172.38 for
an aggregate exercise price of $1.7 billion.

The Company has adopted the 2001 Non-Employee Directors’ Stock Option Plan
(the 2001 Directors’ Plan), which replaces the 1998 Non-Employee Directors’
Stock Option Plan (the 1998 Directors’ Plan). Options granted under the 1998
Directors’ Plan remain outstanding until exercised or cancelled. The shares
reserved under the 2001 Directors’ Plan are equal to the number of shares
available for future grant under the 1998 Directors’ Plan on the date the 2001
Directors’ Plan was approved by the Company’s stockholders. At that date,
2,050,000 shares were available for future grants under the 2001 Directors’
Plan. The Company may terminate the 2001 Directors’ Plan at any time. This plan
provides for non-qualified stock options to be granted to non-employee
directors at fair market value, vesting over periods not exceeding five years
and are exercisable for up to ten years from the grant date. At September 30,
2003, options for 1,700,000 shares under both plans were exercisable at prices
ranging from $3.15 to $133.00 per share for an aggregate exercise price of $25
million.

In March 2000, the Company assumed 1,560,000 outstanding stock options
under the SnapTrack, Inc. 1995 Stock Option Plan (the SnapTrack Plan), as
amended with respect to the acquisition. The SnapTrack Plan expired on the date
of acquisition, and no additional shares may be granted under that plan. The
SnapTrack Plan provided for the grant of both incentive stock options and
non-qualified stock options. Generally, options outstanding vest over periods
not exceeding four years and are exercisable for up to ten years from the grant
date. At September 30, 2003, options for 324,000 shares were exercisable at
prices ranging from $0.13 to $5.26 for an aggregate exercise price of
$1 million.

Employee Stock Purchase Plans

The Company has employee stock purchase plans for all eligible employees
to purchase shares of common stock at 85% of the lower of the fair market value
on the first or the last day of each six-month offering period. Employees may
authorize the Company to withhold up to 15% of their compensation during any
offering period, subject to certain limitations. The 2001 Employee Stock
Purchase Plan (the 2001 Purchase Plan) was adopted and replaces the 1991
Employee Stock Purchase Plan, which expired in August 2001. The 2001 Purchase
Plan authorizes up to 12,155,000 shares to be granted until the Company
terminates the 2001 Purchase Plan. The 1996 Non-Qualified Employee Stock
Purchase Plan authorizes up to 200,000 shares to be granted at anytime. During
fiscal 2003, 2002 and 2001, shares totaling 1,372,000, 1,150,000 and 758,000
were issued under the plans at an average price of $26.39, $31.45 and $50.16
per share, respectively. At September 30, 2003, 9,718,000 shares were reserved
for future issuance.

Executive Retirement Plans

The Company has voluntary retirement plans that allow eligible executives
to defer up to 100% of their income on a pre-tax basis. On a quarterly basis,
the Company matches up to 10% of the participants’ deferral in Company common
stock based on the then-current market price, to be distributed to the
participant upon eligible retirement. The income deferred and the Company match
held in trust are unsecured and subject to the claims of general creditors of
the Company. Company contributions begin vesting based on certain minimum
participation or service requirements, and are fully vested at age 65.
Participants who terminate employment forfeit their unvested shares. All shares
forfeited are used to reduce the Company’s future matching contributions. The
plans authorize up to 800,000 shares to be allocated to participants at
anytime. During fiscal 2003, 2002 and 2001, 45,000, 44,000 and 33,000 shares,
respectively, were allocated under the plans. The Company’s matching
contribution net of amounts forfeited during fiscal 2003, 2002 and 2001
amounted to approximately $2 million, $2 million and $3 million, respectively.
At September 30, 2003, 219,000 shares, including 40,000 issued and unallocated
forfeited shares, were reserved for future allocation.

Note 9. Commitments and Contingencies

Litigation

Schwartz, et al v. QUALCOMM:

87 former QUALCOMM employees filed a lawsuit
against the Company in the District Court for Boulder County, Colorado,
alleging claims for intentional misrepresentation, nondisclosure and
concealment, violation of C.R.S. Section 8-2-104 (obtaining workers by
misrepresentation), breach of contract, breach of the implied covenant of good
faith and fair dealing, promissory estoppel, negligent misrepresentation,
unjust enrichment, violation of California Labor Code Section 970, violation of
California Civil Code Sections 1709-1710, rescission, violation of California
Business & Professions Code Section 17200 and violation of California Civil
Code Section 1575. The complaint seeks economic, emotional distress and
punitive damages and unspecified amounts of interest. On November 29, 2001, the
Court granted the Company’s motion to dismiss 17 of the plaintiffs from the
lawsuit. Subsequently, the Court dismissed three other plaintiffs from the
lawsuit. On November 18, 2002,

F-28


QUALCOMM Incorporated

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

the Court granted the Company’s motion to dismiss 61 of the remaining 67
plaintiffs from the lawsuit. The Company subsequently resolved the matters with
the remaining plaintiffs. Those plaintiffs whose claims were dismissed have
appealed. Although there can be no assurance that an unfavorable outcome of the
dispute would not have a material adverse effect on the Company’s operating
results, liquidity or financial position, the Company believes the claims are
without merit and will vigorously defend the action.

Hanig et al. v. QUALCOMM, Boesel, et al v. QUALCOMM, Stone et al v.
QUALCOMM, Ortiz et al v. QUALCOMM, Shannon et al. v. QUALCOMM, Deshon et al v.
QUALCOMM, Earnhart et al. v. QUALCOMM.

These cases were filed in San Diego
County Superior Court by over 100 former employees, alleging claims for
declaratory relief, breach of contract, intentional/negligent fraud,
concealment, rescission, specific performance, work, labor and services, breach
of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, violation of California
Business & Professions Code Section 17200 and unjust enrichment, claiming that
they were entitled to full vesting of unvested stock options as a result of the
sale of the Company’s infrastructure business to Ericsson in 1999. The Company
has answered the complaints, which have been consolidated. Although there can
be no assurance that an unfavorable outcome of the dispute would not have a
material adverse effect on the Company’s operating results, liquidity or
financial position, the Company believes the claims are without merit and will
vigorously defend the action.

GTE Wireless Incorporated (GTE) v. QUALCOMM:

On June 29, 1999, GTE filed
an action against the Company in the United States District Court for the
Eastern District of Virginia seeking damages and injunctive relief and
asserting that wireless telephones sold by the Company infringe a single patent
allegedly owned by GTE. On September 15, 1999, the Court granted the Company’s
motion to transfer the action to the United States District Court for the
Southern District of California. On February 14, 2002, the District Court
granted QUALCOMM’s motion for summary judgment that QUALCOMM’s products did not
infringe GTE’s asserted patent and denied GTE’s motion seeking summary judgment
of infringement. On July 14, 2003, the parties entered into a settlement
agreement dismissing all claims and counterclaims with prejudice.

Durante, et al v. QUALCOMM:

On February 2, 2000, three former QUALCOMM
employees filed a putative class action against the Company, ostensibly on
behalf of themselves and those former employees of the Company whose employment
was terminated in April 1999. Virtually all of the purported class of
plaintiffs received severance packages at the time of the termination of their
employment, in exchange for a release of claims, other than federal age
discrimination claims, against the Company. The complaint was filed in
California Superior Court in and for the County of Los Angeles and purports to
state ten causes of action including breach of contract, age discrimination,
violation of Labor Code Section 200, violation of Labor Code Section 970,
unfair business practices, intentional infliction of emotional distress, unjust
enrichment, breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing, declaratory
relief and undue influence. The complaint seeks an order accelerating all
unvested stock options for the members of the class, plus economic and
liquidated damages of an unspecified amount. On June 27, 2000, the case was
ordered transferred from Los Angeles County Superior Court to San Diego County
Superior Court. On July 3, 2000, the Company removed the case to the United
States District Court for the Southern District of California, and discovery
commenced. On May 29, 2001, the Court dismissed all plaintiffs’ claims except
for claims arising under the federal Age Discrimination in Employment Act. On
July 16, 2001, the Court granted conditional class certification on the
remaining claims, to be revisited by the Court at the end of the discovery
period. On April 15, 2003, the Court granted the Company’s summary judgment
motions as to all remaining class members’ disparate impact claims. On June 18,
2003, the Court ordered decertification of the class and dismissed the
remaining claims of the opt-in plaintiffs without prejudice. Plaintiffs have
filed an appeal. On June 20, 2003, 76 of the opt-in plaintiffs filed an action
in Federal District Court for the Southern District of California, alleging
violations of the Age Discrimination in Employment Act as a result of their
layoffs in 1999. To date, the complaint has not been served. Although there can
be no assurance that an unfavorable outcome of these disputes would not have a
material adverse effect on the Company’s operating results, liquidity or
financial position, the Company believes the claims are without merit and will
vigorously defend the actions.

Zoltar Satellite Alarm Systems, Inc. v. QUALCOMM and SnapTrack:

On March
30, 2001, Zoltar Satellite Alarm Systems, Inc. (Zoltar) filed suit against
QUALCOMM and SnapTrack, a QUALCOMM wholly-owned subsidiary, in the United
States District Court for the Northern District of California seeking damages
and injunctive relief and alleging infringement of three patents. On August 27,
2001, Zoltar filed an amended complaint adding Sprint Corp.

F-29


QUALCOMM Incorporated

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

as a named defendant and narrowing certain infringement claims against
QUALCOMM and SnapTrack. Since then, Zoltar has dismissed Sprint Corp. as a
defendant. On September 23, 2002, the court denied Zoltar’s motion for summary
judgment that the accused products infringe. Since then, the court has denied a
second motion for summary judgment by Zoltar and denied summary judgment
motions by QUALCOMM with leave to renew the motions at trial. The court is also
considering further claim construction and will consider further evidence on
invalidity prior to trial. Trial is currently set for February 24, 2004.
Although there can be no assurance that an unfavorable outcome of this dispute
would not have a material adverse effect on QUALCOMM’s operating results,
liquidity or financial position, the Company believes the claims are without
merit and will vigorously defend the action.

Texas Instruments:

On July 25, 2003, the Company filed an action in
Delaware Superior Court against Texas Instruments Incorporated for breach of a
patent portfolio license agreement between the parties, seeking
damages and other relief. On September 23, 2003,
Texas Instruments filed an action in Delaware Chancery Court against the
company alleging breach of the same agreement, seeking damages and
other relief. Although there can be no
assurance that an unfavorable outcome of the action brought by Texas
Instruments would not have a material adverse effect on QUALCOMM’s operating
results, liquidity or financial position, the Company believes the claims are
without merit and will vigorously defend the action.

The Company has been named, along with many other manufacturers of
wireless phones, wireless operators and industry-related organizations, as a
defendant in purported class action lawsuits (In re Wireless Telephone
Frequency Emissions Products Liability Litigation, United States District Court
for the District of Maryland), and in several individually filed actions,
seeking personal injury, economic and/or punitive damages arising out of its
sale of cellular phones. On March 5, 2003, the Court granted the defendants
motions to dismiss five of the consolidated cases (Pinney, Gimpleson, Gillian,
Farina and Naquin) on the grounds that the claims were preempted by federal
law. On April 2, 2003, the plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal of this order
and the Court’s order denying remand. All remaining cases filed against the
Company allege personal injury as a result of their use of a wireless
telephone. The courts that have reviewed similar claims against other companies
to date have held that there was insufficient scientific basis for the
plaintiffs’ claims in those cases, and the judge responsible for the
multi-district litigation proceedings recently made such a ruling (which was
upheld on appeal) in another case to which the Company is not a party. Although
there can be no assurance that an unfavorable outcome of these and other
disputes would not have a material adverse effect on the Company’s operating
results, liquidity or financial position, the Company believes the claims are
without merit and will vigorously defend the actions.

The Company has not recorded any accrual for contingent liability
associated with the legal proceedings described above based on the Company’s
belief that a liability, while possible, is not probable. Further, any possible
range of loss cannot be estimated at this time. The Company is engaged in
numerous other legal actions arising in the ordinary course of its business and
believes that the ultimate outcome of these actions will not have a material
adverse effect on its operating results, liquidity or financial position.

Operating Leases

The Company leases certain of its facilities and equipment under
noncancelable operating leases, with terms ranging from two to ten years and
with provisions for cost-of-living increases. Rental expense for fiscal 2003,
2002 and 2001 was $48 million, $61 million and $28 million, respectively.
Rental expense includes $14 million and $19 million in fiscal 2003 and 2002,
respectively, as a result of the consolidation of Vésper Holding (Note 11).
Future minimum lease payments in each of the next five years from fiscal 2004
through 2008 are $42 million, $32 million, $25 million, $17 million and $8
million, respectively, and $11 million thereafter.

Purchase Obligations

The Company has agreements with suppliers to purchase inventory and other
goods and services and estimates its noncancelable obligations under these
agreements to be approximately $307 million in fiscal 2004 and $13 million in
fiscal 2005. The Company also has commitments to purchase telecommunications
services for approximately $20 million in fiscal 2004, $20 million in fiscal
2005 and $17 million in fiscal 2006.

Note 10. Segment Information

The Company is organized on the basis of products and services. The
Company aggregates three of its divisions into the QUALCOMM Wireless & Internet
segment. Reportable segments are as follows:

Effective as of the beginning of fiscal 2004, the Company expects to
present the revenues and operating results of its wholly-owned subsidiary,
SnapTrack, Inc., a developer of wireless position location technology, in the
QWI operating segment. The revenues and operating results of SnapTrack, Inc.
are currently presented in the QCT operating segment. Prior periods will be
restated to conform to the fiscal 2004 segment presentation in future reports.

The Company evaluates the performance of its segments based on earnings
(loss) before income taxes and accounting changes (EBT), excluding certain
impairment and other charges that are not allocated to the segments for
management reporting purposes. EBT includes the allocation of certain corporate
expenses to the segments, including depreciation and amortization expense
related to unallocated corporate assets. Segment data includes intersegment
revenues.

evaluate the segments’ operating performance. Unallocated charges include
amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, research and development
expense and marketing expenses related to the development of the CDMA market
that were not deemed to be directly related to the businesses of the operating
segments. During fiscal 2003, the Company pursued numerous potential new
business opportunities that contributed to the growth of unallocated research
and development and marketing expenses as compared to fiscal 2002 and 2001.
Beginning in fiscal 2004, the Company will begin allocating certain of these
unallocated research and development and marketing expenses to the reportable
segments.

Other unallocated corporate expenses for fiscal 2001 primarily included
$62 million related to an arbitration decision against the Company and $57

differ from total assets on a consolidated
basis as a result of unallocated corporate assets primarily comprised of cash,
cash equivalents, marketable debt securities, property, plant and equipment,
and goodwill. The net book value of long-lived assets located outside of the
United States, primarily in Brazil, was $117 million, $251 million and $10
million at September 30, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively.

Note 11. Acquisitions

Vésper Holding, Ltd.

In fiscal 1999, the Company acquired an interest in Vésper São Paulo S.A.
and Vésper S.A. (the Vésper Operating Companies or collectively, Vésper). The
Vésper Operating Companies were formed by a consortium of investors to provide
wireless and wireline telephone services in the northern, northeast and eastern
regions of Brazil and in the state of São Paulo. In addition, the Company
extended long-term financing to Vésper related to the Company’s financing
arrangement with Ericsson (Note 3) in fiscal 2000. In November 2001, QUALCOMM
consummated a series of transactions as part of an overall financial
restructuring (the Restructuring) of the Vésper Operating Companies, which
resulted in the Company obtaining a controlling financial interest in Vésper.

Pursuant to the Restructuring, the Company and VeloCom, Inc. (VeloCom)
invested $266 million and $80 million, respectively, in a newly formed holding
company called Vésper Holding, Ltd. (Vésper Holding). Vésper Holding acquired
certain liabilities of the Vésper Operating Companies from their vendors for
$135 million and the issuance of warrants to purchase an approximate 7%
interest in Vésper Holding, and the vendors released in full any claims that
they might have against the Company, VeloCom, Vésper, its direct and indirect
parent companies and other related parties arising from or related to the
acquired liabilities. In a series of related transactions, Vésper Holding
agreed to contribute the acquired liabilities to the Vésper Operating Companies
in exchange for equity securities and to cancel the contributed liabilities.
The purchase price allocation, based on the estimated fair values of acquired
assets and liabilities assumed, included $308 million for property, plant and
equipment, $39 million for licenses and $31 million for other intangible
assets. Property, plant and equipment are depreciated over useful lives ranging
from 2 to 18 years. Licenses and other intangible assets are amortized over
their useful lives of 15 to 18 years and 3 to 18 years, respectively.

On November 29, 2001, the Company forgave $119 million under a debt
facility with VeloCom and converted its remaining $56 million convertible
promissory note into equity securities of VeloCom in conjunction with its
acquisition of Vésper Holding. The conversion increased the Company’s equity
interest in VeloCom to 49.9%. The Company used the equity method to account for
its investment in VeloCom. On July 2, 2003, the Company transferred to VeloCom
all of its equity interest in VeloCom in exchange for (a) 49.9% of the shares
of Vésper Holding held by VeloCom, which represented approximately 11.9% of the
issued and outstanding shares of Vésper Holding, and (b) elimination of
VeloCom’s minority consent rights with respect to Vésper Holding. The Company
recorded a net loss of $7 million on the exchange resulting primarily from the
recognition of cumulative translation losses, previously included in
stockholders’ equity, in the statement of operations during the fourth quarter
of fiscal 2003. After giving effect to the exchange, the Company owns an
approximate 83.9% direct interest in Vésper Holding and holds no continuing
interest in VeloCom at September 30, 2003.

Due to a series of adverse regulatory developments that negatively
affected Vésper’s prospects, the Company is pursuing an expedited exit strategy
whereby Vésper and/or its assets will be sold or otherwise disposed of. In
accordance with this strategy, on September 25, 2003, Embratel Participações
S.A. (Embratel) entered into an agreement to acquire for nominal consideration
the Vésper Operating Companies (the Embratel sale transaction), excluding the
tower and rooftop antennae assets and related property leases (Tower Sites).
Concurrent with the closing, Vésper will enter into a multi-year arrangement whereby it pays a
monthly fee to the Company to use the Tower Sites. The sum of these fees, net
of certain pass through expenses, is expected to exceed $77 million over the
life of the arrangement. The SMP licenses (Note 3) also are not included in the
Embratel sale transaction, except for a right of first refusal of Embratel to
purchase the SMP licenses in the event of a sale to a third party or return of
the SMP licenses to Anatel, the telecommunications regulatory agency in Brazil.
The Company is evaluating its options with respect to the SMP licenses,
including a possible
return of the licenses to Anatel.

F-34


QUALCOMM Incorporated

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

The closing of the Embratel sale transaction is contingent upon a number
of events being completed prior to or concurrent with closing, including
regulatory approval by Anatel. Given the uncertainty regarding the closing
contingencies, the Company has not presented the Vésper-related assets and
liabilities as “held for sale” in its September 30, 2003 balance sheet.
Further, the Company does not expect to present Vésper’s historical operations
as discontinued operations in its consolidated statements of operations in
future financial statements because of its expectation of continuing
involvement in the Vésper business by way of an on-going tower usage
arrangement.

As a result of adverse regulatory developments, and after an evaluation of
the potential acquirers and the valuations that they may ascribe Vésper given
the regulatory situation, the Company recorded a $160 million impairment loss
on its long-lived assets related to Vésper during the second quarter of fiscal
2003. The impairment loss recognized was the difference between the assets’
carrying values and their estimated fair values at that date. At September 30,
2003, the carrying values of assets and liabilities related to Vésper totaled
$265 million and $307 million, respectively.

Assuming the requisite government approvals are received and all
conditions to close are satisfied, the Company anticipates providing
approximately $40 million to $45 million in aggregate funding by the closing date to
facilitate the Embratel sale transaction. The Company expects to recognize
cumulative foreign currency translation losses, previously included in
stockholders’ equity, as part of the gain or loss on a sale or other
disposition of Vésper. The Company expects to record an approximate $35 million
to $45 million loss if and when the transaction closes, including the
cumulative foreign currency translation losses.

The Company consolidates all assets and liabilities of Vésper Holding,
including bank loans and capital lease obligations. The balances of the bank
loans and capital lease obligations, including accrued interest, at
September 30,
2003 were $68 million and $47 million, respectively. The bank loans, which are
denominated in Brazilian real, bear interest at the Certificate of Deposit
Inter Bank (CDI) rate (the LIBOR rate equivalent in Brazil) plus 1.5%
(approximately 21.21% at September 30, 2003). The lease obligations bear
interest at fixed and variable rates ranging from 6.0% to 21.56% at September
30, 2003. These debt facilities are collateralized by certain assets of Vésper.
During May 2003, the Vésper Operating Companies failed to make interest and
certain lease payments owed to six of their local bank creditors. As a result
of these defaults, certain provisions in the bank loans and leases were
triggered making all of the bank loans and certain leases callable. Those bank
loans and leases are presented on the Company’s balance sheet as current
liabilities at September 30, 2003. The Company is working, in conjunction with
Vésper, with the banks to structure arrangements which would, if implemented,
provide for forbearance by the banks on payments under the loans and leases
until a contemplated sale of Vésper could be effected. There is no certainty
that such arrangements with the banks, or any such sale transaction, will be
implemented. The Vésper Operating Companies were charged a 2% default penalty
and are being charged an additional 1% interest rate per month on the amount in
default until the default is cured. The aggregate amounts of debt maturities
and minimum capital lease payments for each of the three years from fiscal 2004
through 2006 are $103 million, $1 million and $4 million, respectively, and $7
million thereafter.

During the first quarter of fiscal 2003, the Company acquired wireless
licenses in Brazil for approximately $82 million. Approximately $8 million of
the purchase price was paid in December 2002. The remaining Brazilian
real-denominated wireless license obligation is financed by the Brazilian
government at an interest rate of 12% per annum, plus an adjustment for
inflation. At September 30, 2003, the outstanding license fee obligation was
approximately $111 million, having increased as a result of interest and the
strengthening of the Brazilian real against the U.S. dollar. The license fee
obligation is payable annually in $17 million installments starting in fiscal
2006, until the obligation is fully repaid.

Cash amounts paid for interest were $12 million, $22 million and $11
million in fiscal 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Cash paid for interest in
fiscal 2003 and 2002 is primarily related to the Vésper Holding bank loans and
capital leases. Cash paid for interest in fiscal 2001 included $8 million
related to an arbitration decision against the Company.

Due to the Company’s practice of consolidating foreign subsidiaries one
month in arrears, the consolidated financial statements for fiscal 2003 and
2002 included $238 million and $130 million in losses, net of minority
interest, respectively, of Vésper Holding from September 1, 2002 through August
31, 2003 and from November 13, 2001 (the acquisition date) through August 31,
2002, respectively. The consolidated financial statements for fiscal

F-35


QUALCOMM Incorporated

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

2003 and
2002 also included $24 million and $30 million of equity in losses of the
Vésper Operating Companies (pre-acquisition) and VeloCom. Pro forma operating

made at the beginning of the periods presented, are as follows (in thousands,

Alcatel Mobicom

In September 2003, a European subsidiary of the Company acquired certain
assets and assumed certain liabilities of Alcatel Mobicom. Due to the Company’s
practice of consolidating foreign subsidiaries one month in arrears, the
acquisition will be reflected in the Company’s consolidated financial
statements during the first quarter of fiscal 2004. The preliminary allocation
of purchase price, based on the estimated fair values of acquired assets and
liabilities assumed, reflects acquired goodwill and intangible assets of $8
million and $5 million, respectively. The Company is in the process of
finalizing the purchase price allocation and does not anticipate material
adjustments to the preliminary allocation. In accordance with FAS 142, amounts
allocated to goodwill are not amortized. Amounts allocated to intangible assets
will be amortized over their expected useful lives. Pro forma results have not
been presented because the effect of this acquisition is not material.

Note 12. Auction Discount Voucher

The Company was awarded a $125 million Auction Discount Voucher (ADV) by
the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) in June 2000 as the result of a
legal ruling. The ADV is fully transferable and may, subject to certain
conditions, be used in whole or in part by any entity in any FCC spectrum
auction over a period of three years, including those in which QUALCOMM is not
a participant. During November 2002, the FCC amended the terms of the ADV to
allow the Company to use the ADV to satisfy existing FCC debt of other
companies. During April 2003, the FCC granted the Company’s request for a
one-year extension of the ADV. As a result, the ADV expires in June 2004.

The Company transferred approximately $58 million of the ADV’s value to
three wireless operators during fiscal 2003 for $57 million in cash and
approximately $11 million of the ADV’s value to a wireless operator during
fiscal 2001 in exchange for a note receivable. As a result of the transfers
during fiscal 2003, the Company recorded $47 million in other operating income
in the QSI segment; an additional $10 million will be recognized as earned as
the

QUALCOMM Incorporated

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Company incurs cooperative marketing expenses pursuant to a concurrent
agreement with one of the wireless operators through December 2003 with no
effect on net income.

The Company also used approximately $8 million of the ADV as a down
payment for wireless licenses in which the Company was the highest bidder in a
FCC auction held during fiscal 2003 and expects to use another $30 million of
the ADV’s value to make the final payment when the licenses are granted in
fiscal 2004. The remaining value of the ADV at September 30, 2003 was
approximately $48 million. The Company had no cost basis in the ADV at
September 30, 2003.
