We were incorporated in 1985 under the laws of the state of California. In 1991, we
reincorporated in the state of Delaware. We operate and report using a 52-53 week fiscal year
ending the last Sunday in September. Our 52-week fiscal years consist of four equal quarters of 13
weeks each, and our 53-week fiscal years consist of three 13-week fiscal quarters and one 14-week
fiscal quarter. The financial results for our 53-week fiscal years and our 14-week fiscal quarters
will not be exactly comparable to our 52-week fiscal years and our 13-week fiscal quarters. Each of
the fiscal years ended September 25, 2005, September 26, 2004 and September 28, 2003 include 52
weeks.

Overview

In 1989, we publicly introduced the concept that a digital communication technique called CDMA
could be commercially successful in wireless communication applications. CDMA stands for Code
Division Multiple Access and is one of the main technologies currently used in digital
wireless communications networks. CDMA and the other main digital wireless communications
technologies, TDMA (which stands for Time Division Multiple Access) and GSM (which is a form of
TDMA and stands for Global System for Mobile Communications) are the digital technologies used to
transmit a wireless phone user’s voice or data over radio waves using the wireless phone operator’s
network. CDMA works by converting speech into digital information, which is then transmitted in the
form of a radio signal over the phone network. These digital wireless phone networks are complete
phone systems comprised primarily of base stations, or “cells,” which are geographically placed
throughout a service or coverage area. Once communication between a wireless phone user and a base
station is established, the system detects the movement of the wireless phone user and the
communication is handed off to another base station, or cell, as the wireless phone user moves
throughout the service area.

Because we led, and continue to lead, the development and commercialization of CDMA
technology, we own significant intellectual property, including patents, patent applications and
trade secrets, portions of which we license to other companies and implement in our own products.
The wireless communications industry generally recognizes that a company seeking to develop,
manufacture and/or sell products that use CDMA technology will require a patent license from us.



There are several versions of CDMA technology recognized worldwide as public cellular
standards. The first version, known as cdmaOne, is a second generation (2G) cellular technology
that was first commercially deployed in the mid-1990s. The other subsequent versions of CDMA are popularly referred to as third
generation (3G) technologies known commonly throughout the wireless industry as:

•

CDMA2000, including 1X and 1xEV-DO (where DO refers to Data Optimized);

•

Wideband CDMA (WCDMA), also known as Universal Mobile Telecommunications Systems
(UMTS), including High Speed Download Packet Access (HSDPA) and High
Speed Uplink Packet Access (HSUPA); and

•

CDMA Time Division Duplex (TDD), of which there are currently two versions, Time
Division Duplex CDMA (TD-CDMA) and Time Division Synchronous-CDMA (TD-SCDMA).

CDMA2000 and WCDMA are deployed today in commercial mobile phone networks throughout the
world. In addition to increasing voice capacity, these 3G CDMA technologies enable greater data
capacity at higher data rates.

Our revenues

.

We generate revenues by licensing portions of our CDMA intellectual property to
other manufacturers of CDMA products (such as wireless phones and the hardware required to
establish and operate a CDMA wireless network). Revenues are generated through licensing fees and
royalties on CDMA-based products sold by our licensees. We also sell products and services, which
include the following, all of which are described in greater detail below:

We make strategic investments to promote the development of new CDMA products as well as the
adoption of CDMA technology by more mobile phone service providers. We also provide products and
services to service providers and other customers of Globalstar LLC, a company that operates a
worldwide, low-Earth-orbit satellite-based telecommunications system.

Our engineering resources.

We have significant engineering resources, including engineers with
substantial expertise in CDMA and other technologies. Using these engineering resources, we expect
to continue to develop new versions and new technologies that use CDMA, develop alternative
technologies for certain specialized applications (including multicast), participate in the
formulation of new wireless telecommunications standards and technologies and assist in deploying
wireless voice and data communications networks around the world.

Our integrated circuits business.

We develop and supply CDMA-based integrated circuits and
system software for use in wireless voice and data communications, multimedia functions and global
positioning. Our integrated circuit products and software are used in wireless devices,
particularly phones, data cards, and infrastructure equipment. The wireless integrated circuits
include the baseband Mobile Station Modem (MSM), Radio Frequency (RF) and Power Management (PM)
devices, as well as the system software embedded within our integrated circuit products to control
the phone and the integrated circuit functionality. Our wireless phone integrated circuits and
software perform voice and data communication, multimedia and global positioning functions,
conversion between RF and baseband signals and PM. Our infrastructure equipment integrated circuits
provide the core baseband CDMA modem functionality in the operator’s equipment. Because of our
broad and unique experience in designing and developing CDMA-based products, we not only design the
baseband integrated circuit, but the supporting system as well, including the RF devices, PM
devices and accompanying software products. This approach enables us to



optimize the performance of the wireless phone itself with improved product features, as well
as the integration and performance of the network system. Our design of the system also allows CDMA
systems and devices manufactured by our customers to come to market faster. We provide our
integrated circuits and related system software, including reference designs and tools, to many of
the world’s leading wireless phone and infrastructure equipment manufacturers. We plan to add
additional features and capabilities to our future integrated circuit products to help our
customers reduce the costs and size of their products and to simplify our customers’ design
processes. We also design and create multimode and multiband integrated circuits incorporating
other wireless standards for global roaming markets. In addition, we will continue to provide high
quality support to enable our customers to reduce the time required to design their products and
bring their products to market faster.

Our asset tracking and messaging business.

We design, manufacture and sell equipment and
provide satellite and terrestrial-based two-way data messaging and position reporting services to
transportation companies, private fleets, construction equipment fleets and other enterprise
companies throughout parts of the world. These products permit our customers to track the location
of their vehicles or other assets and to communicate with them en route. These products and
services use commercially available satellite and wireless terrestrial-based networks to permit
this communication. Our customers use these products to communicate with drivers, monitor vehicle
location and performance and provide automated driver logs, fuel tax reporting, security and enhanced
customer services. Our products, which collect and transmit this data, are also integrated with our
customers’ operations software, such as dispatch, payroll and accounting, so our customers can
better manage their information and operations. Using our asset tracking and messaging
infrastructure, we also provide a managed wireless data service, QConnect, to other service
providers. For example, we provide the QConnect service to CardioNet, a provider of outpatient
cardiac telemetry technology services, where we manage the wireless data service connectivity
between CardioNet mobile monitoring devices and the CardioNet Monitoring Center.

Our phone software and related services business.

We provide our BREW (Binary Runtime
Environment for Wireless) products and services to wireless network operators, handset
manufacturers and application developers. We support the development and delivery of over-the-air
wireless applications and services. The BREW products and services include the BREW software
development kit (SDK) for developers, the BREW applications platform (i.e. software programs) and
interface tools for device manufacturers, the uiOne customized user interface product and services,
and the deliveryOne Content Distribution System that enables wireless network operators to
distribute content and applications to the market, and coordinate the billing and payment process.
The BREW platform is a software application that provides an open, standard platform for wireless
devices, which means that BREW can be made to interface with many software applications, including
those developed by others. We make the BREW SDK available, free of charge, to any qualified person
or company interested in developing a new software application for wireless communications. BREW
leverages the capabilities available in integrated circuits and system software, enabling our
customers to develop feature-rich applications and content while reducing memory and maximizing
system performance of the wireless phone itself. In addition to CDMA2000, BREW can be used on
wireless phones and other devices that support other wireless technologies, such as GSM, General
Packet Radio System (GPRS), Enhanced Data Rates for GSM Evolution (EDGE) and WCDMA. We also provide
QChat, which enables push-to-chat functionality on CDMA-based wireless devices, and QPoint, which
enables operators to offer enhanced 911 (E911) wireless emergency and other location-based
applications and services.

Subscriber growth

.

In June 2005, EMC World Cellular Information Service (EMC), a researcher
and publisher of wireless industry market intelligence, forecast that there will be 2.2 billion
mobile phone users, also referred to as subscribers, by the end of this calendar year and that the
figure will grow to nearly 3.2 billion globally by the end of 2010. In April 2005, In-Stat/MDR, a
provider of research, assessments and market forecasts of semiconductor and advanced communications
equipment and services, published a report estimating that CDMA2000 and WCDMA will capture the
largest market share in terms of number of subscribers by 2009.

The CDMA Development Group (CDG) is an international consortium of companies that joined
together to lead the adoption and evolution of CDMA wireless systems around the world. CDG reports
subscriber information which includes 2G cdmaOne and 3G CDMA2000. According to the CDG, wireless networks
based on both cdmaOne and CDMA2000 have been commercially deployed in 73 countries around the world. As
reported by CDG, worldwide CDMA subscribers grew by 27% during the year ended June 2005, to more
than 270 million, including nearly 186 million 3G CDMA2000
subscribers and approximately 84 million 2G cdmaOne subscribers.

CDMA is the leading mobile phone technology in North America with market share of
47% at June 2005 according to the CDG. As reported by the CDG, the North America CDMA market has
more than 100 million subscribers at June 2005, representing annual growth of 17%. In the Asian
Pacific market, the largest and fastest-growing region for CDMA, CDMA



operators added more than 27 million subscribers during the year ended June 2005, bringing the
total number of CDMA subscribers in this region to over 116 million, an increase of 31% over the
prior year. In January 2002, China Unicom launched its nationwide CDMA network, and as of September
2005, China Unicom announced that it had nearly 32 million CDMA subscribers. In Latin America and
the Caribbean, the number of CDMA subscribers grew by 41% during the year ended June 2005, reaching
more than 49 million through 41 CDMA operators.

Next generation technologies.

The primary
3G standards commonly referred to throughout the wireless industry are CDMA2000,
WCDMA, and TDD which includes TD-CDMA and TD-SCDMA. CDMA2000 was first deployed
commercially in October 2000 in South Korea.
The first commercial
deployment of WCDMA was in Japan in October 2001. Another 3G technology,
 TD-SCDMA, is being considered for launch in China. Within the CDMA2000 family,
the higher speed CDMA2000 lxEV-DO was first deployed commercially in January 2002
in South Korea and has been commercially deployed by 19 operators
worldwide as of August 2005. CDMA2000 lxEV-DO continues to evolve
with CDMA2000 lxEV-DO Revision A
and future enhancements, which will allow operators to introduce
voice over Internet protocol, multi-megabit-per-second speeds,
multimedia and broadcast capabilities in the coming years.

According to data from a large portion of
operators around the world through September 2005:

•

3G
subscribers to wireless operators’ services grew to at least
213 million worldwide;

•

There are at least
159 commercial 3G operators;

•

South Korea has over 35 million
CDMA2000 subscribers;

•

There are at least 15 million lxEV-DO
subscribers, including over 11 million in South Korea; and

•

In the United States, there are 17 operators that have commercially deployed CDMA2000 1X, making CDMA2000 IX the first 3G technology to be
commercially available in North America.

As of
September 2005, nearly 700 different models of CDMA2000 handsets are
being sold across all markets, according to public reports made
available at www.cdg.org. Based on data from a large portion of
operators around the world, there are at
least 35 million WCDMA subscribers as of September 2005,
including nearly 19 million in Japan with the remainder primarily located in Europe.
The WCDMA family includes HSDPA, which is in trial phase,
HSUPA and other future enhancements with increasing
capability and data speeds.

Further investments.

We continue to invest heavily in research and development in a variety of
ways, to grow our earnings and extend the market for our products and services.

We continue to develop and commercialize third generation CDMA-based technologies, such as
CDMA2000 1X, 1xEV-DO, Scalable Bandwidth EV-DO, WCDMA, HSDPA
and HSUPA. These technologies support more efficient voice
communications, broadband access to the Internet, multimedia services, delay sensitive applications
(including voice over Internet protocol, video telephony, push-to-talk and multiplayer gaming) and
other revenue-generating services, in turn accelerating the growth of CDMA. At the same time, we
are working to fulfill the growing demand for affordable, voice-centric CDMA phones within the
emerging entry-level market through various efforts including the introduction of Single Chip (SC)
solutions, streamlined test and certification processes and the aggregation of device procurements.
With regards to our EV-DO technology, we have improved its value, performance and economics through
the integration of several enhancements, and several leading manufacturers are planning to sell
laptop PCs with embedded EV-DO by the end of 2005.

We also continue to develop and commercialize multimode, multiband and multinetwork products
that embody technologies such as GSM, GPRS, EDGE, Bluetooth, Wireless Fidelity (Wi-Fi), Universal
Serial Bus (USB), Forward Link Only (FLO), Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM),
Global System for Mobile Communications-Mobile Application Port (GSM-MAP), Interim Standard 41
(IS-41) and Internet Protocol-based (IP-based) core networks. We continue to support multiple
mobile client software environments in our multimedia and convergence chipsets, such as BREW, Java,
Windows Mobile, PalmOS and Linux.

We continue to develop on our own, and with our partners, new innovations that are integrated
into our product portfolio to further expand the market and enhance the value of our products and
services. These products and features include BREW, uiOne, deliveryOne, OmniOne, gpsOne, QChat,
Qtunes, QConcert, Qtv, Q3Dimension, Qcamera, Qcamcorder, QVideophone, Secure MSM, compact media
extension (CMX), mobile display digital interface (MDDI), next-generation voice codec (4GV),
Platinum Multicasting and MediaFLO. At the same time, we are very active within several standards
bodies, such as 3

rd

Generation Partnership Project (3GPP), 3

rd

Generation
Partnership Project 2 (3GPP2), Institute for Electrical and Electronic Engineers (IEEE) and Open
Mobile Alliance (OMA), to ensure these innovations are (1) universally implemented to support
economies of scale and (2) interoperable with existing and future mobile communication services to
preserve ongoing investments. These innovations are expected to enable our customers to improve the
performance or value of their existing services, offer these services more affordably, and
introduce new revenue-generating services well ahead of their competition. CDMA network service
providers also benefit from these innovations through increased numbers of subscribers, handset
replacements and increased annual revenues per user.



Wireless Local Area Networks (WLAN), such as Wi-Fi, are complementary to Wide Area Networks
(WAN), such as CDMA2000 and WCDMA. They both provide affordable high-speed wireless access to the
Internet. The limited coverage offered by Wi-Fi is well suited for private networks (e.g.,
enterprises, campuses and homes) and certain public “hot spots” (e.g., airports, conference halls
and coffee shops) where data usage is expected to be high in a limited portable and stationary
environment; whereas, 3G CDMA networks are ideally suited for geographically diverse voice and data
coverage (e.g., cities, highways and neighborhoods) and in environments where public access to the
Wi-Fi network is blocked due to a firewall (e.g., a client’s enterprise). We may incorporate this
OFDM-based standard into our future multimode 3G CDMA chipsets as we continue to identify and
integrate other complementary wireless technologies into our chipsets.

We are also developing our MediaFLO Media Distribution System (MDS) and OFDM-based FLO
technology to optimize the low cost delivery of multimedia content to multiple wireless subscribers
simultaneously, otherwise known as mediacasting. As part of the standardization of FLO technology,
the FLO Forum (www.floforum.org) was established in fiscal 2005. To
date, 24 members have joined
the FLO Forum, including leaders from across the mobile content distribution industry. Our
subsidiary, MediaFLO USA, Inc. (MediaFLO USA), plans to deploy and operate a nationwide mediacast
network based on our FLO technology. MediaFLO USA will use nationwide 700 MHz spectrum for which we
hold licenses to deliver high-quality video and audio programming to wireless subscribers.
Additionally, MediaFLO USA plans to procure and distribute content which we will make
available wholesale to our wireless operator customers. The MediaFLO USA network will
require access to third generation networks (CDMA or WCDMA) operated by our wireless operator
customers for activities such as subscription management. We believe that the service provided by
MediaFLO USA will serve to complement many of the wireless operators’ third generation network
offerings.

Consistent with our strategic approach over the past fifteen years, we intend to continue our
active support of CDMA-based technologies, products and network operations to grow our royalty
revenues and integrated circuit and software revenues. We also plan to continue to broadly grant
royalty-bearing licenses to our patented technologies and software applications under fair and
reasonable terms and conditions that are free from unfair discrimination. From time to time, we may
also make acquisitions to meet certain technology needs, to obtain development resources or to
pursue new business opportunities. For example, in October 2004, we completed the acquisitions of
Iridigm Display Corporation (Iridigm), a display technology company, and Trigenix Limited
(Trigenix), a mobile user interface company. Iridigm’s display technology, known as iMoD, enables
high-resolution on mobile devices, while providing lower power consumption and other benefits. Our
acquisition of Trigenix complements our BREW product offerings by enhancing the capabilities of our
BREW uiOne user interface and providing other benefits. In August 2005, we completed the
acquisition of ELATA, Ltd. (ELATA), a developer of mobile content delivery and device management
software systems, which systems we have integrated into our “deliveryOne” family of BREW product
offerings. In August 2005, we announced our intention to acquire Flarion Technologies, Inc.
(Flarion), a developer of Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing Access (OFDMA) technology.
This acquisition is anticipated to close in the first half of fiscal 2006, pending regulatory
approval and other customary closing conditions. Our acquisition of Flarion is intended to broaden
our ability to effectively support operators who may prefer an OFDMA or a hybrid OFDM/CDMA/WCDMA
network alternative for differentiating their services. The addition of Flarion’s intellectual
property and engineering resources will also supplement the resources that we have already
dedicated over the years towards the development of OFDM/OFDMA technologies.

We plan to continue to make strategic investments in operators (also known as wireless phone
operators, wireless network operators, wireless service providers or wireless operators), licensed
device manufacturers and start-up companies that we believe open new markets for our technology,
support the design and introduction of new products or possess unique capabilities or technology.
Most of our strategic investments entail a high degree of risk and will not become liquid until
more than one year from the date of investment, if at all. To the extent such investments become
liquid and meet our strategic objectives, we intend to make regular periodic sales of our interests
in these investments that are recognized in investment income (expense). In some cases, we make
strategic investments in early stage companies, which require us to consolidate or record our
equity in losses of those companies. These losses will adversely affect our financial results until
we exit from or reduce our exposure to these investments. We also provide financing to CDMA
operators to facilitate the marketing and sale of CDMA equipment by licensed manufacturers. In
fiscal 2004, we sold our controlling interests in two CDMA operators in Brazil (the Vésper
Operating Companies). We plan to continue to reduce the level of investment in wireless operators,
other than investments in our MediaFLO USA subsidiary, from the levels of fiscal 2003 and before.

difference in educational systems in the various regions in which we do business. Our charitable
giving and volunteer programs are based on respect for community organizations, cooperative
leadership development and philanthropic creativity.

Wireless Telecommunications Industry Overview

The International Telecommunications Union (ITU) is a telecommunication standards setting
organization that is recognized as an impartial, international organization within which
governments and the private sector work together to advance the development of international
standards for communications technology. The ITU’s standardization activities foster the growth of
new technologies, such as mobile telephony, mobile broadcast and mobile Internet, as well as the
emerging global information infrastructure which handles a mix of voice, data and multimedia
signals. The ITU develops internationally-agreed upon technical and operating standards to foster
seamless interconnection of the world’s communication networks and their subsystems. As the world
of telecommunications, information technology and media content distribution rapidly converge, the
role of the ITU is to forge new recommendations that promote the interoperability of equipment and
facilitate the development of advanced communication networks. The ITU identifies sound technical
recommendations and develops them into internationally recognized ITU standards.

The Telecommunications Industry Association (TIA) is a U.S.-based non-profit trade association
serving the telecommunications technology industry. The TIA provides a forum for its member
companies, which manufacture or supply the products and services used in global communications.
Through its voluntary standards setting committees, the TIA facilitates the interoperability of new
communications networks with the stated objective of working towards a competitive and innovative
market environment. The TIA is a major contributor of voluntary industry standards that support
global trade and commerce in communications products and systems.

Standards Development Organizations (SDO), including, among others, TIA and Alliance for
Telecommunications Industry Solutions (ATIS) in the United States, European Telecommunications
Standards Institute (ETSI), Telecommunications Technology Association (TTA) in Korea, Association
of Radio Industries and Businesses (ARIB) in Japan, China Communications Standards Association
(CCSA), and the Institute for Electrical and Electronic Engineers (IEEE), are non-profit voluntary
standards, trade and professional associations that serve the telecommunications technology
industry. Through their worldwide activities, these organizations work in conjunction with the ITU,
to develop common specifications to facilitate global business development opportunities. They each
provide a market-focused forum for their member companies, which manufacture or supply products and
services used in global communications. They also facilitate the interoperability of new
communications networks with a stated objective of working towards a competitive and innovative
market environment. Each organization contributes voluntary industry standards that support global
trade and commerce in communications products and systems.

None of these organizations have the enforcement authority or the ability to protect
intellectual property rights. Today, these organizations generally ask participating companies to
declare whether they believe they hold patents essential for compliance with a particular standard
and, if so, whether they are willing to license such patents on terms and conditions that are fair,
reasonable and free from unfair discrimination (and, in some instances, whether the patent holder
is willing to license royalty free).

Usage of mobile phones and other types of wireless telecommunications equipment has increased
dramatically in the past decade. It is estimated that there will be nearly 3.2 billion mobile
subscribers worldwide by 2010, based on forecasts made by EMC as of June 2005. Growth in the market
for wireless telecommunications services has traditionally been fueled by demand for voice
communications. There have been several factors responsible for the increasing demand for wireless
voice services, including:

•

lower cost of wireless handsets, joined with an increasing selection of appealing mobile devices;



In addition to the tremendous demand for wireless voice services, wireless service providers
are increasingly focused on providing broadband wireless access to the Internet, as well as
multimedia entertainment, messaging, mobile commerce and position location services. These services
have been aided by the development and commercialization of 3G wireless networks and 3G handsets
which are capable of supporting higher data rates that incorporate an ever-increasing array of new
features and functionality, such as assisted GPS-based position location, digital cameras with
flash and zoom capabilities, internet browsers, email, interactive games, music and video downloads
and software download capability (e.g., QUALCOMM’s BREW platform). In March 2005, the Yankee Group,
a global market intelligence and advisory firm in the technology and telecommunications industries,
estimated that nearly 1.5 billion people will be using mobile data services by 2009 and the revenue
produced from these services will account for 21% of total service revenue worldwide. We believe
the growing availability of 3G-enabled handsets capable of performing a wide variety of consumer
and enterprise applications will accelerate the demand for many wireless data services on a global
basis and thus lead to an increased replacement rate of mobile devices to those using our
technology and integrated circuits. Affordable wireless broadband data connectivity is important to
the consumer and enterprise, and its demand will continue to drive the evolution of wireless
standards.

The adoption of wireless standards for mobile communications within individual countries is
generally determined by the telecommunication service providers operating in those countries and,
in some instances, local government regulations. Such determinations are typically based on
economic criteria and the service provider’s evaluation of each technology’s ability to provide the
features and functionality required for its business plan. More than a decade and a half ago, the
European Community developed regulations requiring the use of a telecommunication standard known as
Global System for Mobile Communications, commonly referred to as GSM, a TDMA-based technology.
According to EMC, the use of this second generation wireless standard has spread throughout the
world and is currently the basis for approximately 73% of the digital mobile communications in use.
More than one-third of the more than 1.5 billion GSM subscribers are expected to migrate to third
generation CDMA services before the end of this decade.

The Evolution of Wireless Standards

The significant growth in the use of wireless phones worldwide and demand for enhanced network
functionality requires constant innovation to further improve network reliability, expand capacity
and introduce new types of services. To meet these requirements, progressive generations of
wireless telecommunications technology standards have evolved.

First Generation.

The first generation of wireless telecommunications, widely deployed by the
late 1980s in most of the developed world, was based on analog technology. While this generation
helped introduce the adoption of cellular wireless telecommunications by some business and consumer
users, the technology was characterized by inherent capacity limitations, minimal or no data
transfer capabilities, lack of privacy, inconsistent service levels and significant power
consumption.

Second Generation.

As the deployment of mobile phone systems grew, the limitations of analog
technology drove the development of second generation, digital-based technologies. Second
generation digital technology provided for significantly enhanced efficiency within a fixed
spectrum as well as greatly increased voice capacity compared to analog systems. Second generation
technologies also enabled numerous enhanced services, including paging, e-mail, facsimile,
connections to computer networks, greater privacy, lower prices, a greater number of service
options and greater fraud protection. However, data services (email, fax, computer connections)
were generally limited to low speed transmission rates. The main second-generation digital cellular
technologies are CDMA, called cdmaOne or IS-95A/B, a technology we developed and patented, North
American TDMA, PDC (Personal Digital Cellular—a variant of North American TDMA), and GSM, also a
form of TDMA.



Some of the advantages of CDMA technology over both analog and TDMA and GSM-based technologies
include increased network capacity, network flexibility, compatibility with Internet protocols,
higher capacity for data and faster access to data (Internet), higher data throughput rates and
easier transition to 3G networks. GSM has the benefits of roaming due to its wider worldwide
deployment, and, for the near term, lower priced low-end handsets.

Many GSM operators are deploying 2.5G mobile packet data technologies, such as GPRS and EDGE
(Enhanced Data Rates for GSM Evolution) in areas serviced by GSM, as a bridging technology, while
they wait for 3G WCDMA devices to become more readily available and affordable and can justify the
expense of upgrading their GSM system to provide WCDMA service. We do not believe that GPRS and
EDGE effectively compete with 3G CDMA-based packet data services, either on a cost/bit transmitted
or performance basis

.

Third Generation.

As a result of demand for wireless networks that simultaneously carry both
high speed data and voice traffic, several 3G wireless standards were proposed to the ITU by a
variety of SDOs. These proposals included both CDMA- and TDMA-based technologies. A technology
standard selected for 3G must efficiently support significantly increased data speeds and increased
voice and data capacity, thereby enabling new and enhanced services and applications such as mobile
e-commerce, position location and mobile multimedia web browsing, including music and video
downloads.

CDMA-Based 3G Technology.

In May 2000, the ITU adopted the 3G standard known as IMT-2000,
which encompasses five terrestrial operating radio interfaces, three of them based on our CDMA
intellectual property.

The three IMT-2000 CDMA radio interfaces are:

(1)

CDMA Multicarrier (MC). This is also called MC-CDMA and CDMA2000. It includes CDMA2000
1X, CDMA2000 3X, 1xEV-DO, and 1xEV-DV;

(2)

CDMA Direct Spread (DS). This is also called WCDMA (Wideband CDMA) and UTRA-FDD
(Universal Terrestrial Radio-Access Frequency Division Duplex).

(3)

CDMA TDD. There are two versions of CDMA TDD: TD-CDMA, also known as UTRA-TDD (Time
Division Duplex), and TD-SCDMA. Effectively TD-CDMA and TD-SCDMA are different radio
interfaces, but are classified as one by the ITU.

There are two IMT-2000 radio interfaces that are not based upon CDMA:

(4)

TDMA Single Carrier. This is also called Universal Wireless Communication-136
(UWC-136). The main parts are based upon the TIA/EIA-136 standard for TDMA and EDGE.

(5)

FDMA/TDMA. This is also called Digital Enhanced Cordless Telephone (DECT).

The two current commercial versions of CDMA2000 are: CDMA2000 1X and 1xEV-DO. These versions
use a pair of 1.25 megahertz (MHz) channels to provide both voice and high-speed wireless data
communications. CDMA2000 1X/1xEV-DO utilizes the same standard channel bandwidth as existing
cdmaOne systems and, as a result, is compatible with wireless telecommunications operators’
existing network equipment, making the migration to 3G simple and affordable. We believe CDMA2000
1X provides approximately twice the voice capacity of cdmaOne and six to eight times that of
TDMA-based networks. Position location technology, accomplished through a hybrid approach that
utilizes signals from both the GPS satellite constellation and CDMA cell sites, enables CDMA system
operators to meet the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) mandate requiring wireless operators
to implement enhanced 911 (E911) wireless emergency location services and offer other commercial
location based services. In the future, updates of CDMA2000 1X and 1xEV-DO are expected to further
increase performance. Other enhancements, such as multicast services, higher-resolution displays,
longer battery life, push-to-talk services and voice over Internet protocol are becoming available
to improve the user experience and operator profitability. The price differential between low-end
third generation CDMA2000 handsets and GSM handsets is diminishing.

Commercial deployment of CDMA2000 1X began in October 2000 in South Korea. As of August 2005,
91 operators in 46 countries offer CDMA2000 1X services on a commercial basis to more than 153
million subscribers (not including 1xEV-DO subscribers). Over 50 wireless equipment manufacturers
currently offer CDMA2000 handsets or modem cards.



Commercial deployment of CDMA2000 1xEV-DO began in January 2002 in South Korea with the
introduction of SKT’s high-speed mobile multimedia and broadcast service called “June.” As of
September 2005, SKT and KTF reported more than eleven million CDMA2000 1xEV-DO subscribers in Korea
accounting for more than 30% of the nation’s total mobile subscriber base. Other prominent carriers
such as Verizon Wireless and Sprint in the United States, KDDI in Japan, VIVO in Brazil and Telstra
in Australia have deployed 1xEV-DO network equipment in numerous markets and are expanding coverage
nationwide. Today, more than 80% of the CDMA market is in various stages of 1xEV-DO deployments and
trials. As of August 2005, 19 operators in 13 countries offer CDMA2000 1xEV-DO services on a
commercial basis to more than 15 million subscribers. The rapid growth of CDMA2000 1xEV-DO
subscribers is expected to continue as more operators begin to offer the service and the cost of
providing the wireless broadband service becomes more affordable and attractive through lower cost
handsets, additional network enhancements, the embedding of the technology into laptops and
increased competition between operators. Recently, three major laptop computer companies, Lenovo,
Dell, and HP, have announced laptop products incorporating 1xEV-DO technology.

The European Community and Cingular, a United States carrier, have focused primarily on the
UTRA-FDD radio interface of the IMT-2000 standard, known as WCDMA, which is based on our underlying
CDMA technology (as are all of the CDMA radio interfaces of the IMT-2000 Standard). The majority of
the world’s leading wireless phone and infrastructure manufacturers (more than 60) have licensed
our technology for use in WCDMA products, enabling them to utilize this WCDMA mode of the 3G
technology. This includes the following major wireless equipment suppliers: Agilent, Alcatel, BenQ,
Ericsson, Fujitsu, Hitachi, Kyocera, LG Electronics, Lucent, Panasonic, Mitsubishi, Motorola,
Pantech & Curitel, NEC, Nokia, Nortel, Novatel Wireless, Samsung, Sanyo, Sharp, Siemens, Sierra
Wireless and Toshiba, among others

.

We expect a significant growth in the WCDMA subscriber base
over the next five years, mostly in Japan (led by NTT DoCoMo), Europe, China and the United States
(led by Cingular); thus, we have allocated a significant amount of engineering, production and
business resources to adequately support this large growth opportunity.

The three ITU 3G CDMA radio interfaces are all based on the underlying core principles of CDMA
technology; however, the CDMA2000 mode enables a direct and more economical conversion for current
cdmaOne networks. While the WCDMA wireless air interface does use CDMA technology, the core network
has been specifically designed to be compatible with the GSM core network, which is why it is
expected that most GSM operators will migrate to WCDMA rather than to CDMA2000

.

We will continue to
develop integrated circuits for CDMA2000 and WCDMA and expect to develop integrated circuits for
all 3G versions based on CDMA when commercially worthwhile. In addition, our intellectual property
rights include patents essential to implementation of each of the 3G CDMA alternative standards,
and the royalty rate to be paid to us by each of our current 3G subscriber unit licensees for sales
of its licensed 3G CDMA (regardless of whether it is CDMA2000, WCDMA, TD-CDMA or TD-SCDMA)
subscriber products is no less than the rate that such licensee will pay for its licensed second
generation cdmaOne subscriber products.

These 3G CDMA versions (CDMA2000, WCDMA, TD-CDMA and TD-SCDMA) from a technological
perspective require separate implementations and are not interchangeable. While the fundamental
core technologies are derived from CDMA and, in addition to other features and functionality, are
covered by our patents, they each require unique infrastructure products, network design and
management. However, subscriber roaming amongst systems using different air interfaces is made
possible through multimode wireless devices.

single-chip product, which addresses CDMA2000 1X, CDMA2000 1xEV-DO, CDMA2000 1xEV-DO Revision A and
GSM/GPRS air interfaces and incorporates popular digital electronics functionalities into wireless
devices.

Our Cell Site Modem (CSM) integrated circuit products are the primary integrated circuits in a
wireless operator’s base station equipment. In fiscal 2005, we shipped samples of the CSM6800, for
CDMA2000 1xEV-DO Revision A infrastructure equipment, which provides a seamless migration path to
the next evolution of CDMA2000. Revision A enables rich wireless multimedia services such as
high-speed transfer of bandwidth-intensive files (including high-quality pictures, video and music)
and interactive 3D gaming, as well as multicasting services powered by our FLO technology. The
CSM6700 product is compatible with IS-95 and CDMA2000 1X Revision A standards.

Our gpsOne position-location technology is in more than 150 million gpsOne-enabled handsets
sold worldwide. Enabling a range of more than 200 consumer and enterprise location-based services
around the globe, gpsOne supports four modes of operation across a variety of terrains: Hybrid
Mobile Station-Assisted GPS (Global Positioning System) enables a location fix whenever a call can
be placed; Mobile Station-Assisted GPS provides extreme sensitivity to GPS signals across a broad
range of environments; Mobile Station-Based GPS provides repetitive fix capabilities that are ideal
for navigation, tracking and games; and Standalone GPS enables positioning in off-network
scenarios. Compatible with all major air interfaces, the gpsOne technology is the industry’s only
fully-integrated wireless baseband and GPS product, and has enabled CDMA system operators to
cost-effectively meet the FCC’s E911 mandate.

In order to provide optimized system products, we expanded our portfolio of power management
integrated circuits to address all market segments. The PM6620 was announced in fiscal 2005, and is
designed to address cost-sensitive markets by being interfaced with MSM products from the Value
Platform. The PM6630 and PM6640 were also announced in fiscal 2005, and support the Multimedia
Platform of products. All three PM integrated circuits deliver enhanced performance, time-to-market
advantages and reduced power demands on wireless handsets when combined with MSM integrated
circuits.

In fiscal 2005, we announced a relationship with Philips Semiconductor, Inc. to provide
support for Philips’ wireless local area network (WLAN) module on select MSM integrated circuits.
These MSM integrated circuits will offer connectivity to WLAN networks, as well as to existing
wireless networks, and will feature compatibility with 802.11b and 802.11g protocols on both
CDMA2000 and WCDMA networks.

In fiscal 2005, we also announced the introduction of the MBD1000 integrated circuit, which
supports our FLO technology. Operating in the 700 MHz spectrum with an RBR1000 radio receiver, the
MBD1000 will interface with integrated circuits from the Multimedia Platform for both CDMA2000 and
WCDMA networks.

QUALCOMM Technology Licensing Segment (QTL)

and 26% of total consolidated revenues in fiscal 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.

QUALCOMM Wireless & Internet Segment (QWI)

QWI revenues comprised 11%, 12% and 13% of total consolidated revenues in fiscal 2005, 2004
and 2003, respectively. The three divisions aggregated into QWI are:

QUALCOMM Internet Services (QIS).

The QIS division provides technology to support and
accelerate the growth of the wireless data market. The BREW (Binary Runtime Environment for
Wireless) platform is an application execution environment that provides an open platform for
wireless devices, which means that BREW can



be made to interface with many software applications, including those developed by others. The
BREW platform is part of a complete package of products for wireless applications development,
device configuration, application distribution, and billing and payment. The BREW platform
currently leverages the capabilities available in QCT’s integrated circuits and system software,
enabling development of feature-rich applications and content while maximizing memory utilization
and system performance. BREW products and services include the BREW SDK for developers, the BREW
applications platform (i.e. software programs) and interface tools for device manufacturers, the
uiOne customized user interface product, and the deliveryOne Content Distribution System that
enables wireless network operators to deliver applications and content to market while providing
settlement of the billing and payment process. The BREW platform also includes BREW extensions,
such as virtual machines, browsers and other interpreters that process executable content, such as
JAVA midlets (applications written using the Java language to run on JAVA 2 Micro Edition Virtual
Machines within wireless mobile devices), JavaScript (a scripting language used to author
instructions from execution on a device), Flash (a technology developed by Macromedia to author
Scalable Vector Graphics), XHTML and HTML (“mark up” program languages used to author web-based
content). BREW-based services enable consumers to customize their handsets by downloading
applications over-the-air from an operator’s application download server.

KTF, a leading wireless phone operator in South Korea, launched the world’s first commercial
BREW-enabled applications service in 2001. KTF’s BREW-enabled wireless data service runs on both
CDMA2000 1X and EV-DO high-speed data networks. Numerous other operators have since commercially
launched BREW services, including Verizon Wireless, Alltel, US Cellular and Midwest Cellular in the
United States, KDDI in Japan, Telstra in Australia, Telefonica in Colombia, VIVO in Brazil,
Reliance and Tata in India, and China Unicom in China.

In January 2002, we announced a multi-year licensing agreement with Nextel for QChat, a
technology developed to provide a reliable method of instant connection and two-way communication
between users via their mobile phones. Using QChat, users may speak with other users virtually
instantaneously at the push of a button. It enables one-to-one (private) and one-to-many (group)
calls over 3G CDMA networks. The technology also allows over-the-air upgrades of handset software,
management of group membership by subscribers and ad-hoc creation of chat groups. It uses
voice-over Internet protocol technologies, thereby sending voice information in digital form over
Internet protocol-based data networks (including CDMA) in discrete packets rather than the
traditional circuit-switched protocols of the public switched telephone network.

QUALCOMM Wireless Business Solutions (QWBS).

The QWBS division provides satellite and
terrestrial-based two-way data messaging and position reporting services to transportation
companies, private fleets, construction equipment fleets and other enterprise companies. The
satellite-based OmniTRACS mobile communications system was first introduced in the United States in
1988. Through September 2005, we have shipped over 566,000 satellite-based mobile communications
systems (OmniTRACS, EutelTRACS and TruckMAIL) and over 85,000 terrestrial-based mobile
communications systems (OmniExpress, T2 Untethered TrailerTRACS and GlobalTRACS), which currently
operate in over 39 countries. Message transmission and position tracking for the OmniTRACS and
TruckMAIL systems are provided by use of leased Ku-band and C-band transponders on commercially
available geostationary earth orbit satellites. The OmniExpress, T2 Untethered TrailerTRACS,
GlobalTRACS and OmniOne systems use wireless digital terrestrial networks for messaging
transmission, and the GPS constellation for position tracking. These mobile communications systems
help transportation companies, private fleets and construction equipment fleets improve the
utilization of assets and increase efficiency and safety by improving communications between
drivers, machines and dispatchers. System features include status updates, load and pick-up
reports, position reports at regular intervals, and vehicle and driving performance information.

In the United States and Mexico, we manufacture and sell OmniTRACS, TruckMAIL, OmniExpress, T2
Untethered TrailerTRACS and GlobalTRACS mobile communications equipment, sell related software
packages and provide ongoing messaging and maintenance services. We have sold OmniTRACS, TruckMAIL
and OmniExpress systems for use by private trucking fleets, service vans, marine vessels, trains,
federal emergency vehicles, and for oil and gas pipeline control and monitoring sites. Our
GlobalTRACS system is sold to the construction equipment industry, providing wireless access to
equipment operating data and location, regardless of equipment type or manufacturer. Message
transmissions for operations in the United States are formatted and processed at our Network
Management Center in San Diego, California, with a fully-redundant backup Network Management Center
located in Las Vegas, Nevada. We estimate the Network Management Center currently processes over
nine million messages and position reports per day.



In fiscal 2004, we began shipping T2 Untethered TrailerTRACS for private fleets and for-hire
carriers. The T2 Untethered TrailerTRACS product is an advanced, stand-alone wireless system that
provides rapid-status visibility into trailer locations and operational events and vehicle position
reporting for improved fleet utilization and security. Features include sophisticated on-board
hardware, advanced power management, complete network services, cargo and door sensors and data
integration capabilities using state-of-the-art, multimode communications. We recently announced
the availability of two new applications, the QUALCOMM Hours of Service (HOS) and Automated Arrival
& Departure (AA&D) applications. The QUALCOMM HOS application is a management tool that helps fleet
managers optimize dispatch assignments by providing driver availability information. AA&D gives
fleet managers information needed to monitor delivery schedules, recognize inefficiencies, improve
on-time performance and prevent detention billing disputes.

In addition to the United States, the OmniTRACS system is currently operating throughout
Europe and in the Middle East, Argentina, Brazil, Canada, Mexico, China, Japan and South Korea.
Outside of the United States, Mexico and Europe, we work with distributors or through joint
ventures to provide the OmniTRACS service and products in foreign markets. We generate revenues
from the OmniTRACS system through license fees, sales of network products and terminals, and
messaging and service fees. Service providers that operate network management centers for a region
under our granted licenses provide OmniTRACS messaging services.

QUALCOMM Government Technologies (QGOV).

The QGOV division (formerly known as QUALCOMM Digital
Media, or QDM) provides development, hardware and analytical expertise to United States government
(USG) agencies involving wireless communications technologies. We have developed, produced and
shipped second generation CDMA secure wireless terrestrial phones for the USG that operate in
enhanced security modes (referred to as Type 1) and incorporate end-to-end encryption. In fiscal
2005, QGOV adapted, integrated and shipped CDMA2000 1X deployable base stations to the USG.
Additionally, OmniTRACS products and services are being used for USG worldwide applications and
were sold to the USG during fiscal 2005. Based on the percentage of QGOV revenues to our total
consolidated revenues, the USG is not a major customer.

QUALCOMM Strategic Initiatives Segment (QSI)

We make strategic investments to promote the worldwide adoption of CDMA products and services
for wireless voice and Internet data communications, including CDMA operators, licensed device
manufacturers and companies that support the design and introduction of new CDMA-based products or
possess unique capabilities or technology. We make strategic investments in early stage companies
and, from time to time, venture funds to support the adoption of CDMA and the use of the wireless
Internet. In November 2001, we acquired controlling interests in two CDMA operators in Brazil
(Vésper Operating Companies). We sold these two operators in fiscal 2004. We have a significant
investment in Inquam Limited (Inquam). Inquam owns, develops and manages wireless CDMA-based
communications systems, either directly or indirectly, primarily in Romania and Portugal.

Our MediaFLO USA subsidiary, a wireless multimedia operator, is expected to begin commercial
operations in latter 2006. MediaFLO USA will offer a nationwide mediacast network based on our FLO
(Forward Link Only) technology and MediaFLO MDS (Media Distribution System) as a shared resource
for wireless operators and their customers within the United States

.

We are developing our MediaFLO
MDS and FLO technology to optimize the low cost delivery of multimedia content to multiple wireless
subscribers simultaneously. The MDS will provide wireless network operators the ability to enhance
their multimedia service offering capabilities via efficient scheduling and delivery of multimedia
content. Wireless network operators can utilize the MDS with their current unicast networks and
with multicast networks, which are soon to be available, operating on CDMA2000 1xEV-DO or WCDMA.
The MDS is not air interface specific and thus can be utilized by CDMA2000, WCDMA and FLO
technology operators alike. FLO is a multicast air interface technology specifically designed for
markets where dedicated spectrum is available and where regulations permit high-power transmission,
thereby reducing the number of towers and related infrastructure required to provide market
coverage. MediaFLO MDS and FLO technology are complementary to existing wireless networks because
interactive services are supported within the mobile device using the CDMA2000 1X, 1xEV-DO or WCDMA
wireless link. Furthermore, the MediaFLO MDS can seamlessly integrate multicasting services
provided over 3G operator networks with such services provided over a stand-alone FLO network.

MediaFLO USA plans to use nationwide 700 MHz spectrum for which we hold licenses and will be
procuring and distributing content which we will make available wholesale to our
wireless operator customers. Distribution, marketing, billing and customer relationships are
expected to remain services provided by our wireless



operator customers. Effective as of the beginning of fiscal 2005, we presented the operating
results of MediaFLO USA in the QSI segment. We are evaluating a number of corporate structuring
options, including distributing our ownership interest in MediaFLO USA to our stockholders in a
spin-off transaction.

Other Businesses

QUALCOMM Wireless Systems (QWS)

. The QWS division sells products and provides services under
new commercial agreements to Globalstar LLC (New Globalstar) and its service providers and other
customers. New Globalstar operates a worldwide, low-Earth-orbit satellite-based telecommunications
system. We received membership interests in New Globalstar in fiscal 2004 as a result of its
emergence from bankruptcy related to our claims as a creditor. On October 5, 2004, we received an
additional ownership interest in New Globalstar as partial consideration for the sale of mobile
phones. At September 25, 2005, we held an approximate 6.7% interest in New Globalstar in our QSI
segment.

QUALCOMM MEMS Technologies (QMT).

QMT is developing display technology for the full range of
consumer-targeted mobile products. QMT’s iMoD technology, based on a
micro-electro-mechanical-systems (MEMS) structure combined with thin film optics, is expected to
provide substantial performance, power consumption and cost benefits as compared to current display
technologies. We expect the iMoD product to deliver a vivid and realistic display image quality
that can withstand extreme temperatures and be viewed in virtually any environment, including
bright sunlight. Displays have become a key factor in the overall power consumption of wireless
devices, with the increasing use of vibrant color screens and multimedia applications that generate
rapidly changing images. The iMoD product is expected to offer significantly lower power
consumption than existing display products, thereby extending the battery life of wireless devices.
With the inclusion of color displays in all types of wireless phones, including models at the low
end of the market, the cost of the display has become an even more significant factor in the
overall cost of the handset. An iMoD display should cost less to manufacture than a comparable
liquid crystal display because it requires fewer components and processing steps, thus enabling
advanced multimedia capabilities on all tiers of mobile devices.

Research and Development

The wireless telecommunications industry is characterized by rapid technological change,
requiring a continuous effort to enhance existing products and develop new products and
technologies. Our research and development team has a strong and proven track record of innovation
in wireless communications technologies. Our research and development expenditures in fiscal 2005,
2004 and 2003 totaled approximately $1.01 billion, $720 million and $523 million, respectively.
Research and development expenditures in fiscal 2005, 2004 and 2003 were primarily related to
integrated circuit product and other initiatives to support lower cost phones, multimedia
applications, high-speed wireless Internet access and multimode, multiband, multinetwork products
and technologies, including CDMA2000 1X/1xEV-DO, WCDMA, HSDPA, GSM/GPRS/EDGE and OFDMA, and the
development of our FLO technology, MediaFLO MDS and iMoD display products using MEMS technology.

In fiscal 2005, we opened six research and development centers in California, India, Taiwan
and the United Kingdom. The centers support our global CDMA development activities and ongoing
efforts to advance CDMA technologies. We continue to use our substantial engineering resources and
expertise to develop new technologies, applications and services and make them available to
licensees to help grow the wireless telecommunications market and generate new or expanded
licensing opportunities. In addition to internally sponsored research and development, we perform
contract research and development for various government agencies and commercial contractors.

Corporate Marketing provides company information on products, strategies and technology to industry
analysts and publications which are also supported on our Internet website. We also developed and
maintain an Internet website (www.3Gtoday.com) dedicated to highlighting commercial 3G wireless
services and products around the world.

Our CDMA Development Center in China is a 36,000 square foot facility in Beijing in what is
popularly known as “China’s Silicon Valley.” The center provides training, support and equipment
testing services primarily to manufacturers and mobile operators in China, as well as supporting
research and development of 3G wireless standards based on CDMA. The center houses the QUALCOMM
CDMA University which offers classroom and hands-on training programs on CDMA2000 and WCDMA. The
center also offers a highly-integrated test program designed to enable time and cost savings when
bringing products to market. The center and its staff are focused on providing China with the
resources to enable the most timely development of its mobile communications industry using our
technologies and applications, such as cdmaOne, CDMA2000 1X/1xEV-DO, GSM1x and gpsOne. The center
also supports the transfer of certain hardware and software technologies for product development
and manufacturing to licensed manufacturers, as well as network design and optimization methods to
operators and government bodies in China.

Competition

Competition in the wireless telecommunications industry throughout the world continues to
increase at a rapid pace as businesses and governments realize the market potential of
telecommunications products and services. We have facilitated competition in the CDMA market by
licensing a large number of manufacturers. Although we have attained a major position in the
industry, many of our current and potential competitors may have advantages over us, including:

•

longer operating histories and presence in key markets;

•

greater name recognition;

•

access to larger customer bases; and

•

greater sales and marketing, manufacturing, distribution, technical and other resources than we have.

These competitors may have more established relationships and greater technical, marketing,
sales and distribution capabilities and greater access to channels in markets not currently
deploying wireless communications technology or markets primarily deploying 2G wireless
communications technology. These competitors also have established or may establish financial or
strategic relationships among themselves or with our existing or potential customers, resellers or
other third parties. These relationships may affect customers’ decisions to purchase products or
license technology from us or to use alternative technologies. Accordingly, new competitors or
alliances among competitors could emerge and rapidly acquire significant market share to our
detriment. In addition, many of these companies are licensees of our technology and have
established market positions, trade names, trademarks, patents, copyrights, intellectual property
rights and substantial technological capabilities. We may face competition throughout the world
with new technologies and services introduced in the future as additional competitors enter the
market place for products based on 3G standards. Although we intend to continuously develop
improvements to existing technologies, as well as potential new technologies, there may be a
continuing competitive threat from companies introducing alternative versions of wireless
technologies. We also expect that the price we charge for our products and services may continue to
decline as competition intensifies.

QCT Segment.

The markets in which our QCT segment operates are intensely competitive. QCT
competes worldwide with a number of United States and international semiconductor designers and
manufacturers in the United States and internationally. As a result of the trend toward global
expansion by foreign and domestic competitors and technological and public policy changes, we
anticipate that additional competitors will enter this market. We believe that the principal
competitive factors for CDMA integrated circuit providers to our addressed



markets are product performance, level of integration, quality, compliance with industry
standards, price, time to market, system cost, design and engineering capabilities, new product
innovation and customer support. The specific bases on which we compete against alternative CDMA
integrated circuit providers vary by product platform. We also compete against alternative wireless
communications technologies including, but not limited to, GSM/GPRS/EDGE, TDMA and analog.

QCT’s current competitors include major semiconductor companies such as Freescale, Infineon,
NEC, Philips, STMicroelectronics, Texas Instruments and VIA Telecom, as well as major
telecommunication equipment companies such as Ericsson, Matsushita, Motorola, Nokia and Samsung,
who design their own integrated circuits and software for certain products. QCT also faces
competition from some start-up ventures.

Our competitors may devote a significantly greater amount of their financial, technical,
marketing and other resources to aggressively market competitive telecommunications systems or to
develop and adopt competitive digital cellular technologies, and those efforts may materially and
adversely affect QCT. Moreover, competitors may offer more attractive product pricing or financing
terms than we do as a means of gaining access to the wireless telecommunications markets.

We have entered into licensing agreements with certain companies, including EoNex
Technologies, Infineon, Lucent, Motorola, NEC, Philips, Texas Instruments and VIA Telecom. These
licenses permit the licensees to manufacture CDMA-based integrated circuits using certain of our
intellectual property for sale to CDMA-based phone manufacturers. In exchange for granting the
licenses, we are entitled to receive license fees, royalties (determined as a percentage of the
selling price of the integrated circuits) and/or royalty-free cross-licenses, which allow us to use
these companies’ CDMA and, in some cases, non-CDMA intellectual property for specified purposes. In
every case, the phone manufacturers’ sales of CDMA-based phones are subject to the payment of
royalties to us on the products into which the integrated circuits are incorporated in accordance
with the manufacturers’ separate licensing arrangements with us. We license our CDMA intellectual
property to the competitors of our QCT segment to support the deployment of CDMA-based systems and
technologies worldwide in order to grow our royalty revenues from customers licensed to sell CDMA
phones and equipment. We believe that, if CDMA based systems expand sufficiently, QCT’s business
will also grow, even if we lose market share. To date, most cdmaOne and CDMA2000
phone manufacturer licensees have elected to purchase their CDMA-based integrated circuits from us.

QTL Segment

.

As part of our strategy to generate new and ongoing licensing revenues,
significant resources are allocated to develop leading edge technology for the telecommunications
industry. In addition to licensing manufacturers of subscriber and network equipment, we have made
licenses to our essential CDMA patents available to competitors of our QCT segment. We face
competition in the development of intellectual property for future generations of digital wireless
communications technology and services.

On a worldwide basis, we currently compete primarily with two digital wireless
telecommunications technologies, TDMA and GSM/GPRS. TDMA has been deployed primarily in the United
States and Latin America. Variations of TDMA have also been deployed in other countries, such as
PDC (Personal Digital Cellular) in Japan and PAS (Personal Access System) in China. GSM has been
extensively utilized in Europe, much of Asia other than Japan and Korea, and certain other markets.
To date, GSM has been more widely adopted than CDMA, however, CDMA technologies have been adopted
for all third generation wireless systems. In addition, many GSM operators have deployed or are
expected to deploy GPRS, a packet data technology, as a 2.5G bridge technology, and some GSM
operators plan to deploy EDGE, while waiting for third generation WCDMA to become available and/or
more cost effective for their system. A limited number of operators have started testing OFDMA
technology, a multi-carrier transmission technique not based on CDMA technology, that divides the
available spectrum into many carriers, with each carrier being modulated at a low data rate
relative to the combined rate for all carriers. We have invested in the development of our own
OFDMA technology and intellectual property and have recently entered into an agreement to purchase
Flarion, a major developer and patent holder of OFDMA technology.

QWI Segment.

Existing competitors of our QWBS division offering alternatives to our products
are aggressively pricing their products and services and could continue to do so in the future. In
our domestic markets, we face over ten key competitors to our OmniTRACS, TruckMAIL, OmniExpress, T2
Untethered TrailerTRACS, QConnect and OmniOne products and services, as well as over six key
competitors to our GlobalTRACS system. Internationally, we face several key competitors each in
Europe and Mexico. These competitors are offering new value-added



products and services similar in many cases to our existing or developing technologies.
Emergence of new competitors, particularly those offering low cost terrestrial-based products and
current as well as future satellite-based systems, may impact margins and intensify competition in
new markets. Similarly, some original equipment manufacturers of trucks and truck components are
beginning to offer built-in, on-board communications and position location reporting systems that
may impact our margins and intensify competition in our current and new markets.

We have numerous competitors for each of our BREW products and services. These competitors are
continuing to develop their products with a focus on client, provisioning, user interface, content
distribution, and billing products and services. Competitors are attempting to offer value added
products and services similar, in many cases, to our existing or developing BREW technologies. In
some cases, competitors are continuing to explicitly attempt to displace only certain components or
areas of the greater BREW offering, such as only the runtime client/device environment portion of
BREW. In addition, certain competitors in the computing and device manufacturing industries are now
beginning to more aggressively attempt to replicate the entire BREW system offering that includes
both runtime device environments and billing/distribution systems. Similarly, some operators are
developing their own solutions by piecing together both internal and external components. Emergence
of these and other new competitors may adversely impact our margins and market share.

Patents, Trademarks and Trade Secrets

We rely on a combination of patents, copyrights, trade secrets, trademarks and proprietary
information to maintain and enhance our competitive position. We have been granted more than 1,540
United States patents and have over 2,500 patent applications pending in the United States. The
vast majority of such patents and patent applications relate to our CDMA digital wireless
communications technology. We also have and will continue to actively file for patent protection
outside the United States and have received numerous CDMA patents with broad coverage throughout
most of the world, including China, Japan, South Korea, Europe, Brazil, India and elsewhere.

The standards bodies and the ITU have been informed that we hold essential intellectual
property rights for all 3G standards that are based on CDMA. We have committed to the ITU to
license our essential patents for these CDMA standards on a fair and reasonable basis free from
unfair discrimination.

Under our CDMA license agreements, licensees are generally required to pay us a license fee as
well as ongoing royalties based on a percentage of the net selling price of CDMA subscriber,
infrastructure, test and integrated circuits products. License fees are paid in one or more
installments, while royalties generally continue throughout the life of the licensed patents. Our
CDMA license agreements generally provide us rights to use certain of our licensees’ technology and
intellectual property rights to manufacture and sell certain CDMA products, e.g., CDMA application
specific integrated circuits (ASICs) and related software, subscriber units and/or infrastructure
equipment. In most cases, our use of our licensees’ technology and intellectual property is royalty
free. However, under some of the licenses, if we incorporate certain of the licensed technology or
intellectual property into certain products, we are obligated to pay royalties on the sale of such
products. Under their existing agreements with us, two entities were entitled to share in a
percentage of the royalty revenues that we receive from third parties for their sale of certain
CDMA products. Our sharing obligation under one of these arrangements expired in fiscal 2005, and
the other sharing obligation will expire in fiscal 2006.

As part of our strategy to generate licensing revenues and support worldwide adoption of our
CDMA technology, we license to other companies, including the competitors of our QCT segment, the
rights to design, manufacture and sell products utilizing certain portions of our CDMA intellectual
property. Our current publicly-announced CDMA licensees are listed on our Internet website
(www.qualcomm.com).

Employees

As of September 25, 2005, we employed approximately 9,300 full-time, part-time and temporary
employees. During fiscal 2005, the number of employees increased by approximately 300 from
acquisitions and 1,400 primarily from increases in engineering resources.

RISK FACTORS

You should consider each of the following factors as well as the other information in this
Annual Report in evaluating our business and our prospects. The risks and uncertainties described
below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us
or that we currently consider immaterial may also impair our business operations. If any of the
following risks actually occur, our business and financial results could be harmed. In that case
the trading price of our common stock could decline. You should also refer to the other information
set forth in this Annual Report, including our financial statements and the related notes.

Risks Related to Our Businesses

If CDMA technology deployment does not expand as anticipated, our revenues may not grow as
anticipated.

We focus our business primarily on developing, patenting and commercializing CDMA technology
for wireless telecommunications applications. In addition, with the anticipated acquisition of
Flarion, there will be an increased emphasis on developing, patenting and commercializing OFDMA technology. Other digital wireless communications
technologies, particularly GSM technology, have been more widely deployed than CDMA technology.
OFDMA has not been widely deployed commercially. Notwithstanding our portfolio of OFDMA/OFDM
intellectual property, technology and products, if CDMA technology does not become the preferred wireless communications
industry standard in the countries where our products and those of our customers and licensees are
sold, or if wireless operators do not select CDMA for their networks or update their current
networks to any CDMA-based third generation technology, our business and financial results could
suffer. Further, if OFDMA technology is not adopted and deployed commercially, our anticipated
investment in Flarion and OFDMA technology may not provide us a significant return on investment.

To increase our revenues and market share in future periods, we are dependent upon the
commercial deployment of third generation (3G) wireless communications equipment, products and
services based on our CDMA technology. Although wireless network operators have commercially
deployed CDMA2000 and WCDMA, we cannot predict the timing or success of further commercial
deployments of CDMA2000, WCDMA or other CDMA systems. If existing deployments are not commercially
successful, or if new commercial deployments of CDMA2000, WCDMA or other CDMA systems are delayed
or unsuccessful, our business and financial results may be harmed. In addition, our business could
be harmed if wireless network operators deploy competing technologies or switch existing networks
from CDMA to GSM or if wireless network operators introduce new technologies. A limited number of
operators have started testing OFDMA technology, but there can be no assurance that OFDMA will be
adopted or deployed commercially or that we will be successful in developing and marketing OFDMA
products. Although we have hundreds of issued or pending patents relating to applications of GPRS,
EDGE, OFDM, OFDMA and multi in, multi out (MIMO), there can be no assurance that our patent
portfolio in these areas would be as valuable as our CDMA portfolio.

Our business and the deployment of our technologies are dependent on the success of our
customers and licensees. Our licensees may incur lower operating margins on products
based on our technologies than on products using alternative technologies due to greater
competition in the relevant market or other factors. If CDMA phone
and/or infrastructure manufacturers exit the CDMA market, the deployment of CDMA technology could
be negatively affected, and our business could suffer.



Our three largest customers accounted for 39%, 40% and 43% of consolidated revenues in fiscal 2005,
2004 and 2003, respectively. The loss of any one of our major customers or any reduction in the
demand for devices utilizing
our CDMA technology could reduce our revenues and harm our ability to achieve or sustain desired
levels of operating results.

QCT Segment.

The loss of any one of our QCT segment’s significant customers or the delay, even
if only temporary, or cancellation of significant orders from any of these customers would reduce
our revenues in the period of the cancellation or deferral and could harm our ability to achieve or
sustain desired levels of profitability. Accordingly, unless and until our QCT segment diversifies
and expands its customer base, our future success will significantly depend upon the timing and
size of future purchase orders, if any, from these customers. Factors that may impact the size and
timing of orders from customers of our QCT segment include, among others, the following:

QTL Segment.

Our QTL segment derives royalty revenues from sales of CDMA products by our
licensees. Although we have more than 130 licensees, we derive a significant portion of our royalty
revenue from a limited number of licensees. Our future success depends upon the ability of our
licensees to develop, introduce and deliver high volume products that achieve and sustain market
acceptance. We have little or no control over the sales efforts of our licensees, and we cannot
assure you that our licensees will be successful or that the demand for wireless communications
devices and services offered by our licensees will continue to increase. Any reduction in the
demand for or any delay in the development, introduction or delivery of wireless communications
devices utilizing our CDMA technology could have a material adverse effect on our business.
Reductions in the average selling price of wireless communications devices utilizing our CDMA
technology, without a comparable increase in the volumes of such devices sold, could have a
material adverse effect on our business. Weakness in the value of foreign currencies in which our
customers’ products are sold may reduce the amount of royalties payable to us in U.S. dollars.

Royalties under our license agreements are generally payable to us for the life of the patents
that we license under our agreements. The licenses granted to and from us under a number of our
license agreements include only patents that are either filed or issued prior to a certain date,
and, in a small number of agreements, royalties are payable on those patents for a specified time
period. As a result, there are agreements with some licensees where later patents are not licensed
by or to us under our license agreements. In order to license any such later patents, we will need
to extend or modify our license agreements or enter into new license agreements with such
licensees. Although in the past we have amended many of our license agreements to include later
patents without affecting the material terms and conditions of our license agreements, there is no
assurance that we will be able to modify our license agreements in the future to license any such
later patents or extend such date(s) to incorporate later patents without affecting the material
terms and conditions of our license agreements with such licensees.



Changes in financial accounting standards related to share-based payments are expected to have a
significant effect on our reported results.

The Financial Accounting Standards Board recently issued a revised standard that requires that
we record compensation expense in the statement of operations for share-based payments, such as
employee stock options, using the fair value method. The adoption of the new standard is expected
to have a significant effect on our reported earnings, although it will not affect our cash flows,
and could adversely impact our ability to provide accurate guidance on our future reported
financial results due to the variability of the factors used to estimate the values of share-based
payments. As a result, our adoption of the new standard in the first quarter of fiscal 2006 could
negatively affect our stock price and our stock price volatility.

We depend upon a limited number of third party manufacturers to provide component parts,
subassemblies and finished goods for our products. We are expanding our manufacturing model to
purchase silicon wafers from foundries and to contract directly with third party manufacturers for
assembly and test services. Any disruptions in the operations of, or the loss of, any of these
third parties could harm our ability to meet our delivery obligations to our customers and increase
our cost of sales.

Our ability to meet customer demands depends, in part, on available manufacturing capacity and
our ability to obtain timely and adequate delivery of parts and components from our suppliers. A
reduction or interruption in component supply, an inability of our partners to react to rapid
shifts in demand or a significant increase in component prices could have a material adverse effect
on our business or profitability. Component shortages could adversely affect our ability and that
of our customers to ship products on a timely basis and our customers’ demand for our products. Any
such shipment delays or declines in demand could reduce our revenues and harm our ability to
achieve or sustain desired levels of profitability. Additionally, failure to meet customer demand
in a timely manner could damage our reputation and harm our customer relationships potentially
resulting in reduced market share.

QCT Segment.

Die, cut from silicon wafers, are the essential components for all of our
integrated circuits and a significant portion of the total integrated circuit cost. We do not own
or operate foundries for the production of silicon wafers from which our integrated circuits are
made. Instead, we utilize a fabless model whereby we rely on a limited number of independent third
party manufacturers to perform the manufacturing and assembly, and most of the testing, of our
integrated circuits. Our suppliers are also responsible for the procurement of most of the raw
materials used in the production of our integrated circuits. The majority of our integrated
circuits are purchased on a turnkey basis, in which our foundry partners are responsible for
supplying fully assembled and tested integrated circuits. IBM, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing
Co. and United Microelectronics are the primary foundry partners for our family of baseband
integrated circuits. Atmel, Freescale (formerly Motorola Semiconductor) and IBM are the primary
foundry partners for our family of radio frequency and analog integrated circuits.

Our fabless model provides us the flexibility to select suppliers that offer advanced process
technologies to manufacture, assemble and test our integrated circuits at a competitive price. We
work closely with our customers to expedite their processes for evaluating new integrated circuits
from our foundry suppliers; however, in some instances, transition of integrated circuit production
to a new foundry supplier may cause a temporary decline in shipments of specific integrated
circuits to individual customers. To the extent that we do not have firm commitments from our
manufacturers over a specific time period or in any specific quantity, our manufacturers may
allocate, and in the past have allocated, capacity to the production of products for their other
customers while reducing deliveries to us on short notice.

Some of our integrated circuits products are only available from single sources, with which we
do not have long-term contracts. Our reliance on a sole-source vendor primarily occurs during the
start-up phase of a new product. Once a product reaches a significant volume level, we typically
establish alternate suppliers for technologies that we consider critical. Our reliance on sole or
limited-source vendors involves risks. These risks include possible shortages of capacity, product
performance shortfalls and reduced controls over delivery schedules, manufacturing capability,
quality assurance, quantity and costs. During fiscal 2004 and the first quarter of fiscal 2005, we
experienced supply constraints which resulted in our inability to meet certain customer demands.
These constraints substantially diminished during the second quarter of fiscal 2005 and were
alleviated in the third quarter of fiscal 2005, with improvements to supply more closely aligning
with our then current customer demand profile. To improve the supply and delivery of integrated
circuits from our suppliers, we worked with our existing suppliers to increase available
manufacturing capacity and increased and extended our firm orders to our suppliers.



To further enable flexibility of supply and access to potential new foundry suppliers, and in
response to the complexity of our product roadmap, we began to expand our manufacturing model in fiscal
2005 to include purchasing silicon wafers directly from semiconductor manufacturing foundries.
Under our expanded manufacturing model, we contract directly with third party manufacturers for
assembly and test services, and we ship the final integrated circuits to our customers. We expect
to increase the volume of our silicon wafer purchases directly from our foundry suppliers and to
continue to purchase products on a turnkey basis. We do not have a history working with these third
parties under this expanded manufacturing model, and their services and volume of activity may not
be completely reliable during the ramp-up stages. We cannot guarantee that this change will not
cause disruptions in our operations that could harm our ability to meet our delivery obligations to
our customers or increase our cost of sales.

In addition to the expansion of our manufacturing model, our operations may also be harmed by
lengthy or recurring disruptions at any of the facilities of our manufacturers and may be harmed by
disruptions in the distribution channels from our suppliers and to our customers. These disruptions
may include labor strikes, work stoppages, widespread illness, terrorism, war, political unrest,
fire, earthquake, flooding or other natural disasters. These disruptions could cause significant
delays in shipments until we are able to shift the products from an affected manufacturer to
another manufacturer. The loss of a significant third party manufacturer or the inability of a
third party manufacturer to meet performance and quality specifications or delivery schedules could
harm our ability to meet our delivery obligations to our customers.

In addition, one or more of our manufacturers may obtain licenses from us to manufacture CDMA
integrated circuits that compete with our products. In this event, the manufacturer could elect to
allocate scarce components and manufacturing capacity to their own products and reduce deliveries
to us. In the event of a loss of or a decision to change a key third party manufacturer, qualifying
a new manufacturer and commencing volume production or testing could involve delay and expense,
resulting in lost revenues, reduced operating margins and possible loss of customers.

We and our licensees are subject to the risks of conducting business outside the United States.

A significant part of our strategy involves our continued pursuit of growth opportunities in a
number of international markets. We market, sell and service our products internationally. We have
established sales offices around the world. We expect to continue to expand our international sales
operations and enter new international markets. This expansion will require significant management
attention and financial resources to successfully develop direct and indirect international sales
and support channels, and we cannot assure you that we will be successful or that our expenditures
in this effort will not exceed the amount of any resulting revenues. If we are not able to maintain
or increase international market demand for our products and technologies, we may not be able to
maintain a desired rate of growth in our business.

Our international customers sell their products to markets throughout the world, including
China, India, Japan, Korea, North America, South America and Europe. We distinguish revenues from
external customers by geographic areas based on customer location. Consolidated revenues from
international customers as a percentage of total revenues were 82%, 79% and 77% in fiscal 2005,
2004 and 2003, respectively. Because most of our foreign sales are denominated in U.S. dollars, our
products and those of our customers and licensees that are sold in U.S. dollars become less
price-competitive in international markets if the value of the U.S. dollar increases relative to
foreign currencies.

In many international markets, barriers to entry are created by long-standing relationships
between our potential customers and their local service providers and protective regulations,
including local content and service requirements. In addition, our pursuit of international growth
opportunities may require significant investments for an extended period before we realize returns,
if any, on our investments. Our business could be adversely affected by a variety of uncontrollable
and changing factors, including:

•

changes in legal or regulatory requirements, including regulations governing the
materials used in our products;

•

difficulty in protecting or enforcing our intellectual property rights and/or
contracts in a particular foreign jurisdiction, including challenges to our licensing
practices under such jurisdictions’ competition laws;

•

our inability to succeed in significant foreign markets, such as China, India or Europe;



In addition to general risks associated with our international sales, licensing activities and
operations, we are also subject to risks specific to the individual countries in which we do
business. We cannot be certain that the laws and policies of any country with respect to
intellectual property enforcement or licensing, issuance of wireless licenses or the adoption of
standards will not be changed or be enforced in a way detrimental to our licensing program or to
the sale or use of our products or technology. Declines in currency values in selected regions may
adversely affect our operating results because our products and those of our customers and
licensees may become more expensive to purchase in the countries of the affected currencies. During
fiscal 2005, 37% and 21% of our revenues were from customers and licensees based in South Korea and
Japan, respectively, as compared to 43% and 18%, respectively, during fiscal 2004, and 45% and 15%
during fiscal 2003, respectively. These customers based in South Korea and Japan sell their
products to markets worldwide, including Japan, South Korea, North America, South America and
Europe. A significant downturn in the economies of Asian countries where many of our customers and
licensees are located, particularly the economies of South Korea and Japan, or the economies of the
major markets they serve would materially harm our business.

The wireless markets in China and India, among others, represent growth opportunities for us.
If wireless carriers in China or India, or the governments of China or India, make technology
deployment or other decisions that result in actions that are adverse to the expansion of CDMA
technologies our business could be harmed.

We are subject to risks in certain global markets in which wireless operators provide
subsidies on phone sales to their customers. Increases in phone prices that negatively impact phone
sales can result from changes in regulatory policies related to phone subsidies. Limitations or
changes in policy on phone subsidies in South Korea, Japan, China and other countries may have
additional negative impacts on our revenues.

We expect that royalty revenues from international licensees based upon sales of their
products outside of the United States will continue to represent a significant portion of our total
revenues in the future. Our royalty revenues from international licensees are denominated in U.S.
dollars. To the extent that such licensees’ products are sold in foreign currencies, any royalties
that we derive as a result of such sales are subject to fluctuations in currency exchange rates. In
addition, if the effective price of products sold by our customers were to increase as a result of
fluctuations in the exchange rate of the relevant currencies, demand for the products could fall,
which in turn would reduce our royalty revenues.

Currency fluctuations could negatively affect future product sales or royalty revenue, harm our
ability to collect receivables, or increase the U.S. dollar cost of the activities of our foreign
subsidiaries and international strategic investments.

We are exposed to risk from fluctuations in currencies, which may change over time as our
business practices evolve, that could impact our operating results, liquidity and financial
condition. We operate and invest globally.



Adverse movements in currency exchange rates may negatively affect our business due to a
number of situations, including the following:

We may engage in strategic transactions that could result in significant charges or management
disruption and fail to enhance stockholder value.

From time to time, we engage in strategic transactions with the goal of maximizing stockholder
value. In the past we have acquired businesses, entered into joint ventures and made strategic
investments in or loans to CDMA wireless operators, early stage companies, or venture funds to
support global adoption of CDMA and the use of the wireless Internet. Most of our strategic
investments entail a high degree of risk and will not become liquid until more than one year from
the date of investment, if at all. We cannot assure you that our strategic investments (either
those we currently hold or future investments) will generate financial returns or that they will
result in increased adoption or continued use of CDMA technologies.

We will continue to evaluate potential strategic transactions and alternatives that we believe
may enhance stockholder value. These potential future transactions may include a variety of
different business arrangements, including acquisitions, spin-offs, strategic partnerships, joint
ventures, restructurings, divestitures, business combinations and equity or debt investments.
Although our goal is to maximize stockholder value, such transactions may impair stockholder value
or otherwise adversely affect our business and the trading price of our stock. Any such transaction
may require us to incur non-recurring or other charges and/or to consolidate or record our equity
in losses and may pose significant integration challenges and/or management and business
disruptions, any of which could harm our operating results and business.

Defects or errors in our products and services or in products made by our suppliers could harm our
relations with our customers and expose us to liability. Similar problems related to the products
of our customers or licensees could harm our business.

Our products are inherently complex and may contain defects and errors that are detected only
when the products are in use. Further, because our products and services are responsible for
critical functions in our customers’ products and/or networks, such defects or errors could have a
serious impact on our customers, which could damage our reputation, harm our customer relationships
and expose us to liability. Defects or impurities in our components, materials or software or those
used by our customers or licensees, equipment failures or other



difficulties could adversely affect our ability and that of our customers and licensees to ship
products on a timely basis as well as customer or licensee demand for our products. Any such
shipment delays or declines in demand could reduce our revenues and harm our ability to achieve or
sustain desired levels of profitability. We and our customers or licensees may also experience
component or software failures or defects which could require significant product recalls, reworks
and/or repairs which are not covered by warranty reserves and which could consume a substantial
portion of the capacity of our third-party manufacturers or those of our customers or licensees.
Resolving any defect or failure related issues could consume financial and/or engineering resources
that could affect future product release schedules. Additionally, a defect or failure in our
products or the products of our customers or licensees could harm our reputation and/or adversely
affect the growth of 3G wireless markets.

Global economic conditions that impact the wireless communications industry could negatively affect
our revenues and operating results.

Global economic conditions can have wide-ranging effects on markets that we serve,
particularly wireless communications equipment manufacturers and wireless network operators. We
cannot predict negative events, such as war, that may have adverse effects on the economy or on
phone inventories at CDMA equipment manufacturers and operators. The continued threat of terrorism
and heightened security and military action in response to this threat, or any future acts of
terrorism, may cause disruptions to the global economy and to the wireless communications industry
and create uncertainties. Recent reports suggest that inflation could have adverse effects on the
global economy and capital markets. Inflation could adversely affect our customers, including their
ability to obtain financing, upgrade wireless networks and purchase our products and services, and
our end consumers, by lowering their standards of living and diminishing their ability to purchase
wireless devices based on our technology. Inflation could also increase our costs of raw materials
and operating expenses and harm our business in other ways. Should such negative events occur,
subsequent economic recovery may not benefit us in the near term. If it does not, our ability to
increase or maintain our revenues and operating results may be impaired. In addition, because we
intend to continue to make significant investments in research and development and to maintain
extensive ongoing customer service and support capability, any decline in the rate of growth of our
revenues will have a significant adverse impact on our operating results.

Our industry is subject to competition that could result in decreased demand for our products and
the products of our customers and licensees and/or declining average selling prices for our
licensees’ products and our products, negatively affecting our revenues and operating results.

We currently face significant competition in our markets and expect that competition will
continue. Competition in the telecommunications market is affected by various factors, including:

This competition may result in increased development costs and reduced average selling prices
for our products and those of our customers and licensees. Reductions in the average selling price
of our licensees’ products, unless offset by an increase in volumes, generally result in reduced
royalties payable to us. While pricing pressures from competition may, to a large extent, be
mitigated by the introduction of new features and functionality in our licensees’ products, there
is no guarantee that such mitigation will occur. We anticipate that additional competitors



will enter our markets as a result of growth opportunities in wireless telecommunications, the
trend toward global expansion by foreign and domestic competitors, technological and public policy
changes and relatively low barriers to entry in selected segments of the industry.

Companies that promote non-CDMA technologies (e.g., GSM and WiMax) and companies that design
competing CDMA integrated circuits are included amongst our competitors. Examples of such
competitors (some of whom are strategic partners of ours in other areas) include Ericsson,
Freescale, Intel, NEC, Broadcom, Nokia, Samsung, Agere, Texas Instruments and VIA Telecom. With respect to
our QWBS business, our competitors are aggressively pricing products and services and are offering
new value-added products and services which may impact margins, intensify competition in current
and new markets and harm our ability to compete in certain markets.

Many of these current and potential competitors have advantages over us, including:

As a result of these and other factors, our competitors may be more successful than us. In
addition, we anticipate additional competitors will enter the market for products based on 3G
standards. These competitors may have more established relationships and distribution channels in
markets not currently deploying wireless communications technology. These competitors also may have
established or may establish financial or strategic relationships among themselves or with our
existing or potential customers, resellers or other third parties. These relationships may affect
our customers’ decisions to purchase products or license technology from us. Accordingly, new
competitors or alliances among competitors could emerge and rapidly acquire significant market
share to our detriment.

Our operating results are subject to substantial quarterly and annual fluctuations and to market
downturns.

Our revenues, earnings and other operating results have fluctuated significantly in the past
and may fluctuate significantly in the future. General economic or other conditions causing a
downturn in the market for our products or technology, and in turn affecting the timing of customer
orders or causing cancellations or rescheduling of orders, could also adversely affect our
operating results. Moreover, our customers may change delivery schedules or cancel or reduce orders
without incurring significant penalties and generally are not subject to minimum purchase
requirements.

Our future operating results will be affected by many factors, including, but not limited to:
our ability to retain existing or secure anticipated customers or licensees, both domestically and
internationally; our ability to develop, introduce and market new technology, products and services
on a timely basis; management of inventory by us and our customers and their customers in response
to shifts in market demand; changes in the mix of technology and products developed, licensed,
produced and sold; seasonal customer demand; the Flarion acquisition; and other factors described
elsewhere in this Annual Report and in these risk factors. Our cash investments represent a
significant asset that may be subject to fluctuating or even negative returns depending upon
interest rate movements and financial market conditions in fixed income and equity securities.

These factors affecting our future operating results are difficult to forecast and could harm
our quarterly or annual operating results. If our operating results fail to meet the financial
guidance we provide to investors or the expectations of investment analysts or investors in any
period, securities class action litigation could be brought against us and/or the market price of
our common stock could decline.

Our stock price may be volatile.

The stock market in general, and the stock prices of technology-based and wireless
communications companies in particular, have experienced volatility that often has been unrelated
to the operating performance of any specific public company. The market price of our common stock
has fluctuated in the past and is likely to fluctuate in the future as well. Factors that may have
a significant impact on the market price of our stock include:



Our future earnings and stock price may be subject to volatility, particularly on a quarterly
basis. Shortfalls in our revenues or earnings in any given period relative to the levels expected
by securities analysts could immediately, significantly and adversely affect the trading price of
our common stock.

From time to time, we may repurchase our common stock at prices that may later be higher than
the market value of the stock on the repurchase date. This could result in a loss of value for
stockholders if new shares are issued at lower prices.

In the past, securities class action litigation has often been brought against a company
following periods of volatility in the market price of its securities. Due to changes in the
volatility of our stock price, we may be the target of securities litigation in the future.
Securities litigation could result in substantial costs and divert management’s attention and
resources. In addition, stock volatility may be precipitated by failure to meet earnings
expectations or other factors, such as the potential uncertainty in future reported earnings
created by the adoption of option expensing and the related valuation models used to determine such
expense.

Our industry is subject to rapid technological change, and we must make substantial investments in
new products and technologies to compete successfully.

New technological innovations generally require a substantial investment before they are
commercially viable. We intend to continue to make substantial investments in developing new
products and technologies, and it is possible that our development efforts will not be successful
and that our new technologies will not result in meaningful revenues. In particular, we intend to
continue to invest significant resources in developing integrated circuit products to support
high-speed wireless Internet access and multimode, multiband, multinetwork operation and multimedia
applications which encompass development of graphical display, camera and video capabilities, as
well as higher computational capability and lower power on-chip computers and signal processors.
While our research and development activities have resulted in inventions relating to applications
of GPRS, EDGE, OFDM, OFDMA and MIMO and hundreds of issued or pending patent applications, there
can be no assurance that our patent portfolio in these areas would be as valuable as our CDMA
portfolio. Further, if OFDMA technology is not adopted and deployed commercially, our anticipated
investment in Flarion and OFDMA technology may not provide us a significant return on investment.
We also continue to invest in the development of our BREW applications



development platform, our MediaFLO MDS and FLO technology and our iMoD display technology. All
of these new products and technologies face significant competition, and we cannot assure you that
the revenues generated from these products will meet our expectations.

The market for our products and technology is characterized by many factors, including:

Our future success will depend on our ability to continue to develop and introduce new
products, technology and enhancements on a timely basis. Our future success will also depend on our
ability to keep pace with technological developments, protect our intellectual property, satisfy
customer requirements, price our products competitively and achieve market acceptance. The
introduction of products embodying new technologies and the emergence of new industry standards
could render our existing products and technology, and products and technology currently under
development, obsolete and unmarketable. If we fail to anticipate or respond adequately to
technological developments or customer requirements, or experience any significant delays in
development, introduction or shipment of our products and technology in commercial quantities,
demand for our products and our customers’ and licensees’ products that use our technology could
decrease, and our competitive position could be damaged.

The enforcement and protection of our intellectual property rights may be expensive and could
divert our valuable resources.

We rely primarily on patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws, as well as
nondisclosure and confidentiality agreements and other methods, to protect our proprietary
information, technologies and processes, including our patent portfolio. Policing unauthorized use
of our products and technologies is difficult and time consuming. We cannot be certain that the
steps we have taken will prevent the misappropriation or unauthorized use of our proprietary
information and technologies, particularly in foreign countries where the laws may not protect our
proprietary rights as fully or as readily as United States laws. We cannot be certain that the laws
and policies of any country, including the United States, or the practices of any of the
international standards bodies, foreign or domestic, with respect to intellectual property
enforcement or licensing, issuance of wireless licenses or the adoption of standards, will not be
changed in a way detrimental to our licensing program or to the sale or use of our products or
technology. Any action we take to influence such potential changes could absorb significant
management time and attention, which, in turn, could negatively impact our operating results.

The vast majority of our patents and patent applications relate to our CDMA digital wireless
communications technology and much of the remainder of our patents and patent applications relate
to our other technologies and products. Litigation may be required to enforce our intellectual
property rights, protect our trade secrets or determine the validity and scope of proprietary
rights of others. As a result of any such litigation, we could lose our proprietary rights or incur
substantial unexpected operating costs. Any action we take to enforce our intellectual property
rights could be costly and could absorb significant management time and attention, which, in turn,
could negatively impact our operating results. In addition, failure to protect our trademark rights
could impair our brand identity.

Claims by other companies that we infringe their intellectual property or that patents on which we
rely are invalid could adversely affect our business.

From time to time, companies may assert patent, copyright and other intellectual proprietary
rights against our products or products using our technologies or other technologies used in our
industry. These claims may result in our involvement in litigation. We may not prevail in such
litigation given the complex technical issues and inherent uncertainties in intellectual property
litigation. If any of our products were found to infringe on another company’s intellectual
property rights, we could be required to redesign our products or license such rights and/or pay
damages or other compensation to such other company. If we were unable to redesign our products or
license such intellectual property rights used in our products, we could be prohibited from making
and selling such products.

In addition, as the number of competitors in our market increases and the functionality of our
products is enhanced and overlaps with the products of other companies, we may become subject to
claims of infringement or misappropriation of the intellectual property rights of others. Any
claims, with or without merit, could be time



consuming to address, result in costly litigation, divert the efforts of our technical and
management personnel or cause product release or shipment delays, any of which could have a
material adverse effect upon our operating results. In any potential dispute involving other
companies’ patents or other intellectual property, our licensees could also become the targets of
litigation. Any such litigation could severely disrupt the business of our licensees, which in turn
could hurt our relations with our licensees and cause our revenues to decrease.

A number of other companies have claimed to own patents essential to various CDMA standards,
GSM standards and implementations of OFDM and OFDMA systems. If we or other product manufacturers
are required to obtain additional licenses and/or pay royalties to one or more patent holders, this
could have a material adverse effect on the commercial implementation of our CDMA or multimode
products and technologies, demand for our licensees’ products, and our profitability.

Other companies or entities also may commence actions seeking to establish the invalidity of
our patents. In the event that one or more of our patents are challenged, a court may invalidate
the patent or determine that the patent is not enforceable, which could harm our competitive
position. If any of our key patents are invalidated, or if the scope of the claims in any of these
patents is limited by court decision, we could be prevented from licensing the invalidated or
limited portion of such patents. Even if such a patent challenge is not successful, it could be
expensive and time consuming to address, divert management attention from our business and harm our
reputation.

Potential tax liabilities could adversely affect our results.

We are subject to income taxes in both the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions.
Significant judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes. Although we believe
our tax estimates are reasonable, the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation
could be materially different than that which is reflected in historical income tax provisions and
accruals. In such case, a material effect on our income tax provision and net income in the period
or periods in which that determination is made could result.

The high amount of capital required to obtain radio frequency licenses and deploy and expand
wireless networks could slow the growth of the wireless communications industry and adversely
affect our business.

Our growth is dependent upon the increased use of wireless communications services that
utilize our technology. In order to provide wireless communications services, wireless operators
must obtain rights to use specific radio frequencies. The allocation of frequencies is regulated in
the United States and other countries throughout the world and limited spectrum space is allocated
to wireless communications services. Industry growth may be affected by the amount of capital
required to: obtain licenses to use new frequencies; deploy wireless networks to offer voice and
data services; and expand wireless networks to grow voice and data services. The significant cost
of licenses and wireless networks may slow the growth of the industry if wireless operators are
unable to obtain or service the additional capital necessary to implement or expand 3G wireless
networks. Our growth could be adversely affected if this occurs.

If we experience product liability claims or recalls, we may incur significant expenses and
experience decreased demand for our products.

Testing, manufacturing, marketing and use of our products and those of our licensees and
customers entails the risk of product liability. Although we believe our product liability
insurance will be adequate to protect against product liability claims, we cannot assure you that
we will be able to continue to maintain such insurance at a reasonable cost or in sufficient
amounts to protect us against losses due to product liability. Our inability to maintain insurance
at an acceptable cost or to otherwise protect against potential product liability claims could
prevent or inhibit the commercialization of our products and those of our licensees and customers
and harm our future operating results. Furthermore, not all losses associated with alleged product
failure are insurable. In addition, a product liability claim or recall, whether against us, our
licensees or customers, could harm our reputation and result in decreased demand for our products.

If wireless phones pose safety risks, we may be subject to new regulations, and demand for our
products and those of our licensees and customers may decrease.

Concerns over the effects of radio frequency emissions, even if unfounded, may have the effect
of discouraging the use of wireless phones, which would decrease demand for our products and those
of our licensees and customers. In recent years, the FCC and foreign regulatory agencies have
updated the guidelines and methods they use for evaluating radio frequency emissions from radio
equipment, including wireless phones. In addition, interest groups



have requested that the FCC investigate claims that wireless communications technologies pose
health concerns and cause interference with airbags, hearing aids and medical devices. Concerns
have also been expressed over the possibility of safety risks due to a lack of attention associated
with the use of wireless phones while driving. Any legislation that may be adopted in response to
these expressions of concern could reduce demand for our products and those of our licensees and
customers in the United States as well as foreign countries.

Our QWBS business depends on the availability of satellite and other networks.

Our OmniTRACS system currently operates in the United States market on leased Ku-band
satellite transponders. Our primary data satellite transponder and position reporting satellite
transponder lease runs through October 2012 and includes transponder and satellite protection
(back-up capacity in the event of a transponder or satellite failure), which we believe will
provide sufficient transponder capacity for our United States OmniTRACS operations through fiscal
2012. A failure to maintain adequate satellite capacity could harm our business, operating results,
liquidity and financial position. QWBS terrestrial-based products rely on various wireless
terrestrial communication networks operated by third parties. The unavailability or nonperformance
of these network systems could harm our business.

Our business and operations would suffer in the event of system failures.

Despite system redundancy, the implementation of security measures and the existence of a
Disaster Recovery Plan for our internal information technology networking systems, our systems are
vulnerable to damages from computer viruses, unauthorized access, energy blackouts, natural
disasters, terrorism, war and telecommunication failures. Any system failure, accident or security
breach that causes interruptions in our operations or to our customers’ or licensees’ operations
could result in a material disruption to our business. To the extent that any disruption or
security breach results in a loss or damage to our customers’ data or applications, or
inappropriate disclosure of confidential information, we may incur liability as a result. In
addition, we may incur additional costs to remedy the damages caused by these disruptions or
security breaches.

Message transmissions for QWBS operations are formatted and processed at the Network
Management Center in San Diego, California, with a fully redundant backup Network Management Center
located in Las Vegas, Nevada. Both centers, operated by us, are subject to system failures, which
could interrupt the services and have an adverse effect on our operating results.

From time to time, we install new or upgraded business management systems. To the extent such
systems fail or are not properly implemented, we may experience material disruptions to our
business, delays in our external financial reporting or failures in our system of internal
controls, that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.

We cannot provide assurance that we will continue to declare dividends at all or in any particular
amounts.

We intend to continue to pay quarterly dividends subject to capital availability and periodic
determinations that cash dividends are in the best interest of our stockholders. Future dividends
may be affected by, among other items, our views on potential future capital requirements,
including those related to research and development, creation and expansion of sales distribution
channels and investments and acquisitions, legal risks, stock repurchase programs, changes in
federal income tax law and changes to our business model. Our dividend payments may change from
time to time, and we cannot provide assurance that we will continue to declare dividends at all or
in any particular amounts. A reduction in our dividend payments could have a negative effect on our
stock price.

Government regulation may adversely affect our business.

Our products and those of our customers and licensees are subject to various regulations,
including FCC regulations in the United States and other international regulations, as well as the
specifications of national, regional and international standards bodies. Changes in the regulation
of our activities, including changes in the allocation of available spectrum by the United States
government and other governments or exclusion or limitation of our technology or products by a
government or standards body, could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating
results, liquidity and financial position.

Our business and operating results will be harmed if we are unable to manage growth in our
business.

Certain of our businesses have experienced periods of rapid growth that have placed, and may
continue to place, significant demands on our managerial, operational and financial resources. In
order to manage this growth, we must continue to improve and expand our management, operational and
financial systems and controls, including quality



control and delivery and service capabilities. We also need to continue to expand, train and
manage our employee base. We must carefully manage research and development capabilities and
production and inventory levels to meet product demand, new product introductions and product and
technology transitions. We cannot assure you that we will be able to timely and effectively meet
that demand and maintain the quality standards required by our existing and potential customers and
licensees.

In addition, inaccuracies in our demand forecasts, or failure of the systems used to develop
the forecasts, could quickly result in either insufficient or excessive inventories and
disproportionate overhead expenses. If we ineffectively manage our growth or are unsuccessful in
recruiting and retaining personnel, our business and operating results will be harmed.

We may not be able to attract and retain qualified employees.

Our future success depends largely upon the continued service of our board members, executive
officers and other key management and technical personnel. Our success also depends on our ability
to continue to attract, retain and motivate qualified personnel. In addition, implementing our
product and business strategy requires specialized engineering and other talent, and our revenues
are highly dependent on technological and product innovations. Key employees represent a
significant asset, and the competition for these employees is intense in the wireless
communications industry. We continue to anticipate significant increases in human resources,
particularly in engineering, through fiscal 2006. If we are unable to attract and retain the
qualified employees that we need, our business may be harmed.

We may have particular difficulty attracting and retaining key personnel in periods of poor
operating performance given the significant use of incentive compensation by our competitors. We do
not have employment agreements with our key management personnel and do not maintain key person
life insurance on any of our personnel. The loss of one or more of our key employees or our
inability to attract, retain and motivate qualified personnel could negatively impact our ability
to design, develop and commercialize our products and technology.

Since our inception, we have used stock options and other long-term equity incentives as a
fundamental component of our employee compensation packages. We believe that stock options and
other long-term equity incentives directly motivate our employees to maximize long-term stockholder
value and, through the use of long-term vesting, encourage employees to remain with us. To the
extent that new regulations make it less attractive to grant options to employees, we may incur
increased compensation costs, change our equity compensation strategy or find it difficult to
attract, retain and motivate employees, each of which could materially and adversely affect our
business.

Future changes in financial accounting standards or practices or existing taxation rules or
practices may cause adverse unexpected revenue fluctuations and affect our reported results of
operations.

A change in accounting standards or practices or a change in existing taxation rules or
practices can have a significant effect on our reported results and may even affect our reporting
of transactions completed before the change is effective. New accounting pronouncements and
taxation rules and varying interpretations of accounting pronouncements and taxation practice have
occurred and may occur in the future. Changes to existing rules or the questioning of current
practices may adversely affect our reported financial results or the way we conduct our business.

Compliance with changing regulation of corporate governance and public disclosure may result in
additional expenses.

Changing laws, regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public
disclosure may create uncertainty regarding compliance matters. New or changed laws, regulations
and standards are subject to varying interpretations in many cases. As a result, their application
in practice may evolve over time. We are committed to maintaining high standards of corporate
governance and public disclosure. Complying with evolving interpretations of new or changed legal
requirements may cause us to incur higher costs as we revise current practices, policies and
procedures, and may divert management time and attention from revenue generating to compliance
activities. If our efforts to comply with new or changed laws, regulations and standards differ
from the activities intended by regulatory or governing bodies due to ambiguities related to
practice, our reputation may also be harmed. In addition, it has become more difficult and more
expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance, and we have purchased reduced
coverage at substantially higher cost than in the past. Further, our board members, chief executive
officer and chief financial officer could face an increased risk of personal liability in
connection with the
performance of their duties. As a result, we may have difficulty attracting and retaining
qualified board members and executive officers, which could harm our business.



Our stockholder rights plan, certificate of incorporation and Delaware law could adversely affect
the performance of our stock.

Our certificate of incorporation provides for cumulative voting in the election of directors.
In addition, our certificate of incorporation provides for a classified board of directors and
includes a provision that requires the approval of holders of at least 66 2/3% of our voting stock
as a condition to a merger or certain other business transactions with, or proposed by, a holder of
15% or more of our voting stock. This approval is not required in cases where certain of our
directors approve the transaction or where certain minimum price criteria and other procedural
requirements are met. Our certificate of incorporation also requires the approval of holders of at
least 66 2/3% of our voting stock to amend or change the provisions mentioned relating to the
classified board, cumulative voting or the transaction approval. Under our bylaws, stockholders are
not permitted to call special meetings of our stockholders. Finally, our certificate of
incorporation provides that any action required or permitted by our stockholders must be effected
at a duly called annual or special meeting rather than by any consent in writing.

The classified board, transaction approval, special meeting and other charter provisions may
discourage certain types of transactions involving an actual or potential change in our control.
These provisions may also discourage certain types of transactions in which our stockholders might
otherwise receive a premium for their shares over then current market prices and may limit our
stockholders’ ability to approve transactions that they may deem to be in their best interests.

Further, we have distributed a dividend of one right for each outstanding share of our common
stock pursuant to the terms of our preferred share purchase rights agreement. These rights will
cause substantial dilution to the ownership of a person or group that attempts to acquire us on
terms not approved by our board of directors and may have the effect of deterring hostile takeover
attempts. In addition, our board of directors has the authority to fix the rights and preferences
of and issue shares of preferred stock. This right may have the effect of delaying or preventing a
change in our control without action by our stockholders.

In addition to the facilities above, we also own or lease an additional approximate 661,000
square feet of properties that are leased or subleased to third parties. Our leases expire at
varying dates through 2015 not including renewals that would be at our option.



We started construction of two facilities in San Diego, California in fiscal 2003, totaling
approximately one million additional square feet, to meet the requirements projected in our
long-term business plan. In fiscal 2005, we announced our plans to expand our backup Network
Management Center in Las Vegas, which uses satellite and terrestrial-based technologies to track
freight transportation and shipping nationwide, by approximately two hundred
thousand square feet. We expect to place the new and expanded facilities in service starting
in fiscal 2006 through fiscal 2008. We believe that our facilities will be suitable and adequate
for the present purposes, and that the productive capacity in such facilities is substantially
being utilized. In the future, we may need to purchase, build or lease additional facilities to
meet the requirements projected in our long-term business plan.

Item 3. Legal Proceedings

Durante, et al v. QUALCOMM

: On February 2, 2000, three former employees filed a putative class
action against us, alleging unlawful age discrimination in their selection for layoff in 1999, and
seeking monetary damages based thereon. On June 18, 2003, the Court ordered decertification of the
class and dismissed all remaining claims of the plaintiffs. On August 1, 2005, the Ninth Circuit
Court of Appeals upheld the judgment in our favor. On June 20, 2003, 76 of the opt-in plaintiffs
filed, but did not serve, a new action in the same court, alleging violations of the Age
Discrimination in Employment Act as a result of their layoffs in 1999. All plaintiffs have now
dismissed all remaining claims in exchange for our agreement not to seek litigation costs against
them.

Zoltar Satellite Alarm Systems, Inc. v. QUALCOMM, Inc. and SnapTrack, Inc.

: On March 30, 2001,
Zoltar Satellite Alarm Systems, Inc. filed suit against us and SnapTrack, Inc. (Snaptrack), a
QUALCOMM wholly-owned subsidiary, in the United States District Court for the Northern District of
California seeking monetary damages and injunctive relief based on the alleged infringement of
three patents. Following a verdict and finding of no infringement of Zoltar’s patent claims, the
Court entered a judgment in our and Snaptrack’s favor on Zoltar’s complaint and awarded us and
SnapTrack our costs of suit. Zoltar filed a notice of appeal, and we and SnapTrack filed a
responsive notice and motion to dismiss. Zoltar’s appeal was dismissed and the issue of reaching a
final judgment on issues aside from non-infringement is pending before the district court.

QUALCOMM Incorporated v. Maxim Integrated Products, Inc.:

On December 2, 2002, we filed an
action in the United States District Court for the Southern District of California against Maxim
alleging infringement of three patents and seeking monetary damages and injunctive relief based
thereon. We amended the complaint, bringing the total number of patents at issue to four and adding
misappropriation of trade secret and unfair competition claims. Maxim counterclaimed against us,
alleging antitrust violations, patent misuse and unfair competition seeking monetary damages and
injunctive relief based thereon. On May 5, 2004, the Court granted Maxim’s motion that no indirect
infringement arose in connection with defendants’ sales of certain products to certain of our
licensees. A motion we made for preliminary injunction regarding the alleged trade secret
misappropriations by Maxim was heard on January 4, 2005. The Court found that Maxim had acted
unlawfully by misappropriating our trade secrets and issued an injunction order prohibiting further
misappropriation and requiring Maxim to notify customers of the order. Maxim has sought appellate
review of the injunction order.

Whale Telecom Ltd v. QUALCOMM Incorporated:

On November 15, 2004, Whale Telecom Ltd. sued us
in the New York State Supreme Court, County of New York, seeking monetary damages based on the
claim that we fraudulently induced it to enter into certain infrastructure services agreements in
1999 and later interfered with their performance of those agreements.

Broadcom Corporation v. QUALCOMM Incorporated:

On May 18, 2005, Broadcom filed two actions in
the United States District Court for the Central District of California against us alleging
infringement of ten patents and seeking monetary damages and injunctive relief based thereon. On
the same date, Broadcom also filed a complaint in the United States International Trade Commission
(ITC) alleging infringement of five of the same patents at issue in the Central District Court
cases seeking a determination and relief under Section 337 of the Tariff Act of 1930. On July 1,
2005, Broadcom filed an action in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey
against us alleging violations of state and federal antitrust and unfair competition laws as well
as common law claims, generally relating to licensing and chip sales activities, seeking monetary
damages and injunctive relief based thereon. Discovery has commenced in the actions.

QUALCOMM Incorporated v. Broadcom Corporation:

On July 11, 2005, we filed an action in the
United States District Court for the Southern District of California against Broadcom alleging
infringement of seven patents, each of which is essential to the practice of either the GSM or
802.11 standards, and seeking monetary damages and injunctive relief based thereon. On September
23, 2005, Broadcom answered and counterclaimed, alleging infringement of six patents. Discovery has
yet to begin in the action.



QUALCOMM Incorporated v. Broadcom Corporation:

On October 14, 2005, we filed an action in the
United States District Court for the Southern District of California against Broadcom alleging
infringement of two patents,
each of which relates to video encoding and decoding for high-end multimedia processing, and
seeking monetary damages and injunctive relief based thereon. Broadcom has yet to answer.

Other:

We have been named, along with many other manufacturers of wireless phones, wireless
operators and industry-related organizations, as a defendant in purported class action lawsuits,
including In re Wireless Telephone Frequency Emissions Products Liability Litigation, United States
District Court for the District of Maryland, and several individually filed actions, seeking
monetary damages arising out of its sale of cellular phones. On March 5, 2003, the Court granted
the defendants’ motions to dismiss five of the consolidated cases (Pinney, Gimpleson, Gillian,
Farina and Naquin) on the grounds that the claims were preempted by federal law. On March 21, 2005,
the 4

th

Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the ruling by the District Court and ordered
the cases remanded to state court. All remaining cases filed against us allege personal injury as a
result of their use of a wireless telephone. Those cases have been remanded to the Washington, D.C.
Superior Court. The courts that have reviewed similar claims against other companies to date have
held that there was insufficient scientific basis for the plaintiffs’ claims in those cases.

On October 28, 2005, it was reported that six telecommunications companies (Broadcom, Nokia,
Texas Instruments, NEC, Panasonic and Ericsson) filed complaints with the European Commission,
alleging that we violated European Union competition law in our WCDMA licensing practices. To date,
we have not been formally served with the complaints.

Although there can be no assurance that unfavorable outcomes in any of the foregoing matters
would not have a material adverse effect on our operating results, liquidity or financial position,
we believe the claims made by other parties are without merit and will vigorously defend the
actions. We have not recorded any accrual for contingent liability associated with the legal
proceedings described above based on our belief that a liability, while possible, is not probable.
Further, any possible range of loss cannot be estimated at this time. We are engaged in numerous
other legal actions arising in the ordinary course of its business and believe that the ultimate
outcome of these actions will not have a material adverse effect on our operating results,
liquidity or financial position. In addition, some matters that have previously been disclosed may
no longer be described because of rulings in the case, settlements, changes in our business or
other developments rendering them, in our judgment, no longer material to our operating results,
liquidity or financial position.

Item 4. Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders

No matters were submitted to a vote of security holders during the quarter ended September 25,
2005.

to pay quarterly dividends subject to capital availability and periodic determinations that cash
dividends are in the best interests of our stockholders. Future dividends may be affected by, among
other items, our views on potential future capital requirements, including those relating to
research and development, creation and expansion of sales distribution channels and investments and
acquisitions, legal risks, stock repurchase programs, changes in federal income tax law and changes
to our business model.

Stock Options

Our stock option plans are part of a broad-based, long-term retention program that is intended
to attract and retain talented employees and directors and align stockholder and employee
interests.

Pursuant to our 2001 Stock Option Plan (2001 Plan), we may grant options to selected
employees, directors and consultants to purchase shares of our common stock at a price not less
than the fair market value of the stock at the date of grant. The 2001 Plan provides for the grant
of both incentive stock options and non-qualified stock options. Generally, options outstanding
vest over five years and are exercisable for up to 10 years from the grant date. We also may grant
options pursuant to our 2001 Non-Employee Directors’ Stock Option Plan (the 2001 Directors’ Plan).
This plan provides for non-qualified stock options to be granted to non-employee directors at an
exercise price of not less than fair market value of the stock at the date of grant, vesting over
periods not exceeding five years and exercisable for up to 10 years from the grant date. The Board
of Directors may terminate the 2001 Plan and/or the 2001 Directors’ Plan at any time though it
must, nevertheless, honor any stock options previously granted pursuant to the plans.

Additional information regarding our stock option plans and plan activity for fiscal 2005,
2004 and 2003 is provided in our consolidated financial statements in this Annual Report in “Notes
to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 8 — Employee Benefit Plans” and in our 2006 Proxy
Statement under the heading “Equity Compensation Plan Information.”

Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities

On March 8, 2005, we authorized the repurchase of up to $2 billion of the Company’s common
stock with no expiration date. During fiscal 2005, we repurchased and retired 27,083,000 shares of
our common stock for $953 million. In connection with this stock repurchase program, we have two
put options outstanding at September 25, 2005, with expiration dates of December 7, 2005 and March
21, 2006, that may require us to repurchase 11,500,000
shares for $411 million (net of the option premiums received). At September 25, 2005, $636
million remained authorized for repurchases under our stock repurchase program.

Prior to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004, we recorded royalty revenues from certain
licensees based on our estimates of royalties during the period they were earned. Starting in
the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004, we began recognizing royalty revenues solely based on
royalties reported by licensees during the quarter. The change in the timing of recognizing
royalty revenue was made prospectively and had the initial one-time effect of reducing royalty
revenues recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004. See Item 7, Management’s Discussion
and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in this Annual Report for more
information.



Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

In addition to historical information, the following discussion contains forward-looking
statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ substantially
from those referred to herein due to a number of factors, including but not limited to risks
described in the section entitled Risk Factors and elsewhere in this Annual Report.

Overview

Recent Highlights

Revenues for fiscal 2005 were $5.67 billion, with net income of $2.14 billion. The following
recent developments occurred with respect to key elements of our business or our industry:

Our Business and Operating Segments

We design, manufacture and market digital wireless telecommunications products and services
based on our CDMA technology and other technologies. We derive revenue principally from sales of
integrated circuit products, from license fees and royalties for use of our intellectual property,
from services and related hardware sales and from software development and licensing and related
services. Operating expenses primarily consist of cost of equipment and services, research and
development and selling, general and administrative expenses.



We conduct business primarily through four reportable segments. These segments are: QUALCOMM
CDMA Technologies, or QCT; QUALCOMM Technology Licensing, or QTL; QUALCOMM Wireless & Internet, or
QWI; and QUALCOMM Strategic Initiatives, or QSI.

QCT is a leading developer and supplier of integrated circuits and system software for
wireless voice and data communications, multimedia functions and global positioning. QCT’s
integrated circuit products and software are used in wireless phones, data cards and infrastructure
equipment. The wireless phone integrated circuits include the Mobile Station Modem (MSM), Radio
Frequency (RF) and Power Management (PM) devices. The wireless phone integrated circuits and
software perform voice and data communication, multimedia and global positioning functions, radio
conversion between radio and baseband signals, and power management. The infrastructure equipment
integrated circuits provide the core baseband CDMA modem functionality in the operator’s equipment.
QCT software products are the operating systems that control the phone and the functionality
imbedded in our integrated circuit products. QCT revenues comprised 58%, 64% and 63% of total
consolidated revenues in fiscal 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.

QTL grants licenses to use portions of our intellectual property portfolio, which includes
certain patent rights essential to and/or useful in the manufacture and sale of CDMA products,
including, without limitation, products implementing cdmaOne, CDMA2000, WCDMA and/or the CDMA TDD
standards and their derivatives. QTL receives license fees as well as ongoing royalties based on
worldwide sales by licensees of products incorporating our intellectual property. QTL revenues
comprised 32%, 27% and 26% of total consolidated revenues in fiscal 2005, 2004 and 2003,
respectively.

QWI, which includes QUALCOMM Wireless Business Solutions (QWBS), QUALCOMM Internet Services
(QIS) and QUALCOMM Government Technologies (QGOV), generates revenue primarily through mobile
communication products and services, software and software development aimed at support and
delivery of wireless applications. QWBS provides satellite and terrestrial-based two-way data
messaging, position reporting and wireless application services to transportation companies,
private fleets, construction equipment fleets and other enterprise companies. QIS provides BREW
(Binary Runtime Environment for Wireless) products and services, including the uiOne customizable
user-interface product and the deliveryOne content distribution system, for the development and
over-the-air deployment of data services on wireless devices. QIS also provides QChat and QPoint
products and services. QChat enables virtually instantaneous push-to-chat functionality on
CDMA-based wireless devices while QPoint enables operators to offer E-911 and location-based
applications and services. The QGOV division provides development, hardware and analytical
expertise to United States government agencies involving wireless communications technologies. QWI
revenues comprised 11%, 12% and 13% of total consolidated revenues in fiscal 2005, 2004 and 2003,
respectively.

QSI makes strategic investments to promote the worldwide adoption of CDMA products and
services. Our strategy is to invest in CDMA operators, licensed device manufacturers and start-up
companies that we believe open new markets for CDMA technology, support the design and introduction
of new CDMA-based products or possess unique capabilities or technology. Effective as of the
beginning of fiscal 2005, we present the operating results of our wireless multimedia operator,
MediaFLO USA, Inc. (MediaFLO USA), in the QSI segment. Our MediaFLO USA subsidiary expects to offer
a nationwide mediacast network based on our FLO (Forward Link Only) technology and MediaFLO Media
Distribution System (MDS), initially targeting 100 top domestic markets, with the eventual
capability for broader nationwide coverage. This network is expected to be utilized as a shared
resource for wireless operators and their customers within the United States starting in latter
2006. FLO is a multicast technology specifically designed for markets where dedicated spectrum is
available and where regulations permit high-power transmission, thereby reducing the number of
towers and related infrastructure required to provide market coverage. MediaFLO USA plans to use
nationwide 700 MHz spectrum for which we hold licenses and will be procuring and distributing
content which we will make available wholesale to our wireless operator customers.
Distribution, marketing, billing and customer relationships are expected to remain services
provided by our wireless operator customers. We are evaluating a number of corporate structuring
options, including distributing our ownership interest in MediaFLO USA to our stockholders in a
spin-off transaction.

Nonreportable segments include the QUALCOMM Wireless Systems division, which sells products
that operate on the Globalstar low-Earth-orbit satellite communications system and provides related
services, the QUALCOMM MEMS Technologies division, comprised of the Iridigm business, a display
technology company that we acquired in the first quarter of fiscal 2005, and other product
initiatives.



Looking Forward

We expect continued growth in demand for CDMA2000 and WCDMA products and services in markets
around the world:

We are dependent upon the commercial deployment of 3G wireless communications equipment,
products and services based on our CDMA technology to increase our revenues and market share. We
continue to face significant competition from non-CDMA technologies, as well as competition from
companies offering other CDMA-based products. Recent reports suggest that inflation could have
adverse effects on the global economy and the capital markets. You should also refer to the Risk
Factors included in this Annual Report for further discussion of these and other risks related to
our business.

Revenue Concentrations

Revenues from customers in South Korea, Japan and the United States comprised 37%, 21% and
18%, respectively, of total consolidated revenues in fiscal 2005 as compared to 43%, 18% and 21%,
respectively, in fiscal 2004, and 45%, 15% and 23%, respectively, in fiscal 2003. We distinguish
revenue from external customers by geographic areas based on customer location. Revenues from
customers in Japan increased as a percentage of total revenues, from 15% in fiscal 2003 to 18% in
fiscal 2004 and 21% in fiscal 2005, due primarily to increased royalties reported by licensees in
Japan resulting from the growth of CDMA2000 and WCDMA in Japan as well as their success in
exporting products worldwide. Combined revenues from customers in South Korea and the United States
decreased as a percentage of total revenues, from 68% in fiscal 2003 to 64% in fiscal 2004 and 55%
in fiscal 2005, due primarily to increases in revenues from manufacturers of CDMA and WDCMA
products in other regions such as China, Japan and Western Europe.



Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

Our discussion and analysis of our results of operations and liquidity and capital resources
are based on our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial
statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets,
liabilities, revenues and expenses, and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an
ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and judgments, including those related to revenue
recognition, valuation of intangible assets and investments, income taxes, and litigation. We base
our estimates on historical and anticipated results and trends and on various other assumptions
that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, including assumptions as to future events.
These estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and
liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. By their nature, estimates are
subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty. Actual results that differ from our estimates could
have a significant adverse effect on our operating results and financial position. We believe that
the following significant accounting policies and assumptions may involve a higher degree of
judgment and complexity than others.

Revenue Recognition.

We derive revenue principally from sales of integrated circuit products,
from royalties and license fees for our intellectual property, from messaging and other services
and related hardware sales and from software development and licensing and related services. The
timing of revenue recognition and the amount of revenue actually recognized in each case depends
upon a variety of factors, including the specific terms of each arrangement and the nature of our
deliverables and obligations. Determination of the appropriate amount of revenue recognized
involves judgments and estimates that we believe are reasonable, but it is possible that actual
results may differ from our estimates.

We license rights to use portions of our intellectual property portfolio, which includes
certain patent rights essential to and/or useful in the manufacture and sale of CDMA products,
including, without limitation, products implementing cdmaOne, CDMA2000, WCDMA and/or the CDMA TDD
standards and their derivatives. Licensees typically pay a license fee in one or more installments
and ongoing royalties based on their sales of products incorporating or using our licensed
intellectual property. License fees are recognized over the estimated period of future benefit to
the average licensee, typically five to seven years. We earn royalties on such licensed CDMA
products sold worldwide by our licensees at the time that the licensees’ sales occur. Our
licensees, however, do not report and pay royalties owed for sales in any given quarter until after
the conclusion of that quarter, and, in some instances, although royalties are reported quarterly,
payment is on a semi-annual basis. During the periods preceding the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004,
we estimated and recorded the royalty revenues earned for sales by certain licensees (the Estimated
Licensees) in the quarter in which such sales occurred, but only when reasonable estimates of such
amounts could be made. Not all royalties earned were recorded based on estimates.

In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004, we determined that, due to escalating and changing
business trends, we no longer had the ability to reliably estimate royalty revenues from the
Estimated Licensees. These escalating and changing trends included the commercial launches and
global expansion of WCDMA networks, changes in market share among licensees due to increased global
competition, and increased variability in the integrated circuit and finished product inventories
of licensees. Starting in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004, we began recognizing royalty revenues
solely based on royalties reported by licensees during the quarter. The change in the timing of
recognizing royalty revenue was made prospectively and had the initial one-time effect of reducing
royalty revenues recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004.

Valuation of Intangible Assets and Investments.

Our business acquisitions typically result in
the recording of goodwill and other intangible assets, and the recorded values of those assets may
become impaired in the future. As of September 25, 2005, our goodwill and intangible assets, net of
accumulated amortization, were $571 million and $237 million, respectively. The determination of
the value of such intangible assets requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect our consolidated financial statements. We assess potential impairments to intangible assets
when there is evidence that events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of
an asset may not be recovered. Our judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators and
future cash flows related to intangible assets are based on operational performance of our acquired
businesses, market conditions and other factors. Although there are inherent uncertainties in this
assessment process, the estimates and assumptions we use are consistent with our internal planning.
If these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future, we may be required to record
an impairment charge on all or a portion of our goodwill and intangible assets. Furthermore, we
cannot predict the occurrence of future impairment-triggering events nor the impact such events
might have on our reported asset values. Future events could cause us to conclude that
impairment indicators exist and that goodwill or other intangible assets associated with our
acquired businesses is impaired. Any resulting impairment loss could have an adverse impact on our
results of operations.



We hold minority investments in publicly-traded companies whose share prices may be highly
volatile. These investments, which are recorded at fair value with increases or decreases generally
recorded through stockholders’ equity as other comprehensive income or loss, totaled $1.16 billion
at September 25, 2005. We record impairment charges when we believe an investment has experienced a
decline that is other than temporary. The determination that a decline is other than temporary is
subjective and influenced by many factors. Future adverse changes in market conditions or poor
operating results of investees could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value
of the investments, thereby possibly requiring impairment charges in the future. When assessing a
publicly-traded investment for an other-than-temporary decline in value, we consider such factors
as, among other things, how significant the decline in value is as a percentage of the original
cost, how long the market value of the investment has been less than its original cost, the
performance of the investee’s stock price in relation to the stock price of its competitors within
the industry and the market in general and analyst recommendations. We also review the financial
statements of the investee to determine if the investee is experiencing financial difficulties. In
the event our judgments change as to other-than-temporary declines in value, we may record an
impairment loss which could have an adverse impact on our results of operations. During fiscal
2005, 2004 and 2003, we recorded $12 million, $12 million and $100 million, respectively, in
other-than-temporary losses on our minority investments in publicly-traded companies.

We hold minority strategic investments in private companies whose values are difficult to
determine. These investments totaled $122 million at September 25, 2005. We record impairment
charges when we believe an investment has experienced a decline that is other than temporary. The
determination that a decline is other than temporary is subjective and influenced by many factors.
Future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of investees could result in
losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the investments, thereby possibly requiring
impairment charges in the future. When assessing investments in private companies for an
other-than-temporary decline in value, we consider such factors as, among other things, the share
price from the investee’s latest financing round, the performance of the investee in relation to
its own operating targets and its business plan, the investee’s revenue and cost trends, the
liquidity and cash position, including its cash burn rate and market acceptance of the investee’s
products and services. From time to time, we may consider third party evaluations, valuation
reports or advice from investment banks. We also consider new products/services that the investee
may have forthcoming, any significant news that has been released specific to the investee or the
investee’s competitors and/or industry and the outlook of the overall industry in which the
investee operates. In the event our judgments change as to other-than temporary declines in value,
we may record an impairment loss which could have an adverse impact on our results of operations.
During fiscal 2005 and 2003, we recorded $1 million and $28 million, respectively, in other than
temporary losses on our investments in private companies. Such losses were not significant in
fiscal 2004.

Income Taxes.

Our income tax returns are based on calculations and assumptions that are
subject to examination by the Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities. While we believe
we have appropriate support for the positions taken on our tax returns, we regularly assess the
potential outcomes of these examinations and any future examinations for the current or prior years
in determining the adequacy of our provision for income taxes. As part of our assessment of
potential adjustments to our tax returns, we increase our current tax liability to the extent an
adjustment would result in a cash tax payment or decrease our deferred tax assets to the extent an
adjustment would not result in a cash tax payment. We continually assess the likelihood and amount
of potential adjustments and adjust the income tax provision, the current tax liability and
deferred taxes in the period in which the facts that give rise to a revision become known. Although
we believe that the estimates and assumptions supporting our assessments are reasonable,
adjustments could be materially different from those which are reflected in historical income tax
provisions and recorded assets and liabilities.

We regularly review our deferred tax assets for recoverability and establish a valuation
allowance based on historical taxable income, projected future taxable income, the expected timing
of the reversals of existing temporary differences and the implementation of tax-planning
strategies. As of September 25, 2005, gross deferred tax assets were $937 million. If we are unable
to generate sufficient future taxable income in certain tax jurisdictions, or if there is a
material change in the actual effective tax rates or time period within which the underlying
temporary differences become taxable or deductible, we could be required to increase our valuation
allowance against our
deferred tax assets which could result in an increase in our effective tax rate and an adverse
impact on operating results.



As of September 25, 2005, we had gross deferred tax assets of $301 million related to capital
loss carry forwards. We can only use capital losses to offset capital gains. Based upon our
assessments of projected future capital gains and losses and related tax planning strategies, we
expect that our future capital gains will not be sufficient to utilize all the capital losses that
we have incurred through fiscal 2005. Therefore, we have provided a valuation allowance in the
amount of $62 million for the portion of capital losses we do not expect to utilize. Adjustments to
our valuation allowance based on changes to our forecast of capital losses and capital gains are
reflected in the period the change is made.

We consider the operating earnings of certain non-United States subsidiaries to be
indefinitely invested outside the United States. No provision has been made for United States
federal and state, or foreign taxes that may result from future remittances of undistributed
earnings of foreign subsidiaries, the cumulative amount of which is approximately $1.2 billion as
of September 25, 2005. Should we repatriate foreign earnings, we would have to adjust the income
tax provision in the period in which the decision to repatriate earnings of foreign subsidiaries is
made. On October 22, 2004, the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (the Jobs Creation Act) was
signed into law. The Jobs Creation Act created a temporary incentive for corporations in the United
States to repatriate accumulated income earned abroad by providing an 85 percent dividends received
deduction for certain dividends from controlled foreign corporations. In the fourth quarter of
fiscal 2005, we repatriated approximately $0.5 billion of foreign earnings qualifying under the
Jobs Creation Act and recorded a related expense of approximately $35 million for federal and state
income tax liabilities. The distribution does not change our intention to indefinitely reinvest
earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries outside the United States.

Litigation.

We are currently involved in certain legal proceedings. Although there can be no
assurance that unfavorable outcomes in any of these matters would not have a material adverse
effect on our operating results, liquidity or financial position, we believe the claims are without
merit and intend to vigorously defend the actions. We estimate the range of liability related to
pending litigation where the amount and range of loss can be estimated. We record our best estimate
of a loss when the loss is considered probable. Where a liability is probable and there is a range
of estimated loss with no best estimate in the range, we record the minimum estimated liability
related to the claim. As additional information becomes available, we assess the potential
liability related to our pending litigation and revise our estimates. We have not recorded any
accrual for contingent liability associated with our legal proceedings based on our belief that a
liability, while possible, is not probable. Further, any possible range of loss cannot be estimated
at this time. Revisions in our estimates of the potential liability could materially impact our
results of operations.

Acquisitions

In October 2004, we completed the acquisitions of Iridigm Display Corporation (Iridigm), a
display technology company, for a total of approximately $160 million in cash and the exchange of
stock options with an estimated aggregate fair value of approximately $17 million, and Trigenix
Limited (Trigenix), a mobile user interface company for approximately $33 million in cash. The
convergence of consumer electronics products, including cameras, MP3 players, camcorders, GPS
receivers and game consoles into wireless devices is driving the increased adoption of 3G CDMA.
Iridigm’s display technology, known as iMoD, enables advanced, high-resolution multimedia
capabilities on all tiers of mobile devices, while providing substantial performance, power
consumption and cost benefits, as compared to other alternative display technologies. Our
acquisition of Iridigm is intended to accelerate the time-to-market for Iridigm’s display
technology, which fits our overall strategy of rapidly increasing the capability of wireless
devices while driving down cost, size and power consumption. In addition to having a better
display, operators and device manufacturers need a secure and modular approach for customizing
their phone user interfaces so they can brand and differentiate their handsets. Our acquisition of
Trigenix complements our BREW offering by adding Trigenix’s user interface development tools,
enhancing the capabilities of our BREW uiOne user interface and accelerating the time-to-market for
new user interface features, such as multi-perspective window display technology.

In August 2005, we completed the acquisition of ELATA, Ltd. (ELATA), a developer of mobile
content delivery and device management software systems, for a total of approximately $57 million
in cash. Our acquisition of ELATA will enable us to offer a unified mobile content delivery system
to operators who desire an enhanced framework for managing, delivering and marketing rich wireless
content. The ELATA single service delivery



framework, which leverages open standards interfaces to ensure interoperability and retain
backward compatibility, is platform-agnostic and will allow operators to consolidate the delivery
of all of their content services without having to change their device portfolio. This acquisition
will also expand our presence in Europe by enabling us to offer European operators a content
delivery system that can be easily integrated with their existing core network and business
systems. The ELATA single service delivery framework has become part of our family of BREW product
offerings and is being marketed under the brand name deliveryOne.

In August 2005, we announced our intention to acquire Flarion Technologies, Inc. (Flarion), a
developer of OFDMA technology. Upon completion of the acquisition, which is anticipated in the
first half of fiscal 2006, pending regulatory approval and other customary closing conditions, we
estimate that we will pay approximately $545 million in consideration, consisting of approximately
$272 million in shares of QUALCOMM stock, $235 million in cash, and the exchange of Flarion’s
existing vested options and warrants with a fair value of approximately $38 million. Upon
achievement of certain agreed upon milestones on or prior to the eighth anniversary of the close of
this transaction, we may issue additional aggregate consideration of $205 million, consisting of
approximately $173 million payable in cash to Flarion stockholders and $32 million in shares of
QUALCOMM stock, which will be issued to Flarion option holders and warrant holders upon or
following the exercise of such options and warrants. Our acquisition of Flarion is intended to
broaden our ability to effectively support operators who may prefer an OFDMA or a hybrid
OFDM/CDMA/WCDMA network alternative for differentiating their services. The addition of Flarion’s
intellectual property and engineering resources will also supplement the resources that we have
already dedicated over the years towards the development of OFDM/OFDMA technologies.

Strategic Investments in our QSI Segment

Our QSI segment makes strategic investments to promote the worldwide adoption of CDMA products
and services. QSI segment assets totaled $442 million at September 25, 2005, compared to $400
million at September 26, 2004. Our MediaFLO USA subsidiary, a wireless multimedia operator, is
expected to begin commercial operations in latter 2006. We also enter into strategic relationships
with CDMA wireless operators and developers of innovative technologies or products for the wireless
communications industry. Due to financial and competitive challenges facing wireless operators, we
cannot assure you that our investments in or loans to these operators will generate financial
returns or that they will result in increased adoption or continued use of CDMA technologies. CDMA
wireless operators to whom we have provided funding have limited operating histories, are faced
with significant capital requirements and are highly leveraged and/or have limited financial
resources. If these CDMA wireless operators are not successful, we may have to write down our
investments in or loans to these operators.

Our QSI segment maintains strategic investments in marketable equity securities classified as
available-for-sale. We strategically invest in companies in the high-technology industry and
typically do not attempt to reduce or eliminate our exposure to market risks in these investments.
The fair values of these strategic investments are subject to substantial quarterly and annual
fluctuations and to significant market price volatility. Our strategic investments in specific
companies and industry segments may vary over time, and changes in concentrations may affect price
volatility. Downward fluctuations and market trends could adversely affect our operating results.
In addition, the realizable value of these securities and derivative instruments is subject to
market and other conditions.

QSI also makes strategic investments in privately held companies, including early stage
companies and venture funds. These investments are comprised of equity investments, recorded at
cost or under the equity method, and warrants that are recorded at fair value or at cost. The
recorded values of these investments may be written down due to changes in the companies’
conditions or prospects. These strategic investments are inherently risky as the market for the
technologies or products the investees are developing may never materialize. As a result, we could
lose all or a portion of our investments in these companies, which could negatively affect our
financial position and operating results. Most of these strategic investments will not become
liquid until more than one year from the date of investment, if at all. To the extent such
investments become liquid and meet strategic and price objectives, we may sell the investments and
recognize the realized gain (loss) in investment income (expense).

We regularly monitor and evaluate the realizable value of our investments in both marketable
and private securities. If events and circumstances indicate that a decline in the value of these
assets has occurred and is other than temporary, we will record a charge to investment income
(expense). In some cases, we make strategic investments that require us to consolidate or record
our equity in the losses of early stage companies. The consolidation of these losses can adversely
affect our financial results until we exit from or reduce our exposure to the investments.



Key developments in our strategic investments during fiscal 2005 included our ongoing
investment in our MediaFLO USA subsidiary, a slow down in the rate of strategic investment,
including our investment in Inquam, and realized gains on certain strategic investments.

Investment in Inquam Limited.

Since October 2000, we and another investor (the Other Investor)
have provided equity and debt funding to Inquam Limited (Inquam). Inquam owns, develops and manages
wireless CDMA-based communications systems, either directly or indirectly, primarily in Romania and
Portugal. We recorded $33 million, $59 million and $99 million in equity in losses of Inquam during
fiscal 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. At September 25, 2005, our equity and debt investments in
Inquam totaled $26 million, net of equity in losses, and we had no remaining funding commitment
under our bridge loan agreement.

During fiscal 2005, Inquam secured new long-term financing (the new facilities). We and the
Other Investor each guaranteed 50% of a portion of the amounts owed under certain of the new
facilities, up to a combined maximum of $54 million. Amounts outstanding under the new facilities
subject to the guarantee totaled $49 million as of September 25, 2005. The guarantee expires and
the new facilities mature on December 25, 2011.

In October 2005, we and the Other Investor agreed to restructure Inquam. Upon close of the
restructuring, which is expected to occur in the first half of fiscal 2006, the Portugal companies
will be spun-off through the exchange of portions of our and the Other Investor’s debt investments
for direct equity interests in the Portugal companies. Inquam, which will continue to own the
Romania companies, will repurchase certain minority equity interests. Immediately after the
restructuring, we will hold an approximate 49.7% equity interest in Inquam and a 23% equity
interest in the Portugal companies, which is expected to be reduced over time as the Other Investor
makes the further investments in the Portugal companies contemplated by the restructuring
agreements. In addition, we and the Other Investor will have a put-call option arrangement. Under
this arrangement, the Other Investor will have the right to buy our equity and debt investments in
Inquam, subject to certain conditions, by exercising its call option, which will expire no later
than May 14, 2008. The minimum purchase price will be approximately $66 million. In the event that
the Other Investor’s call option expires, or in certain other circumstances prior to that date, we
will have the right to sell our equity and debt investments in Inquam to the Other Investor at a
minimum sales price of $66 million. Such right will expire after six months. We do not anticipate
providing any further funding to Inquam or to the Portugal companies.

Fiscal 2005 Compared to Fiscal 2004

Revenues.

Total revenues for fiscal 2005 were $5.67 billion, compared to $4.88 billion for
fiscal 2004. Revenues from LG Electronics, Samsung and Motorola, customers of our QCT, QTL and QWI
segments, comprised an aggregate of 15%, 13% and 11% of total consolidated revenues, respectively,
in fiscal 2005, compared to 15%, 15% and 10% of total consolidated revenues, respectively, in
fiscal 2004.

Revenues from sales of equipment and services for fiscal 2005 were $3.74 billion, compared to
$3.51 billion for fiscal 2004. Revenues from sales of integrated circuits increased $165 million,
resulting primarily from an increase of $396 million related to higher unit shipments of MSM and
accompanying RF integrated circuits, partially offset by a decrease of $241 million related to the
effects of reductions in average sales prices and changes in product mix. Revenues from the sale of
satellite and terrestrial-based two-way data messaging systems and related messaging services
increased $25 million and revenues from the sale of satellite portable phones that operate on the
Globalstar low-Earth-orbit satellite communications system increased $19 million.

Revenues from licensing and royalty fees for fiscal 2005 were $1.93 billion, compared to $1.37
billion for fiscal 2004. During fiscal 2005, the QTL segment recorded royalty revenues solely based
on royalties reported by licensees during the year, as compared to the method used during the first
three quarters of fiscal 2004 of recording royalty revenues from certain licensees based on
estimates of royalty revenues earned by those licensees during the quarter. The increase in royalty
revenue year to year resulted primarily from a $350 million increase in royalties reported to us by
our external licensees and the effect of changing the timing of recognizing royalty revenues in the
fourth quarter of fiscal 2004. Royalty revenues recorded in fiscal 2004 excluded $151 million of
royalties that were reported by external licensees in the first quarter of fiscal 2004, but
estimated and recorded as revenue in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003. Royalties reported to us by
external licensees in fiscal 2005 were $1.64 billion, as compared to $1.29 billion in fiscal 2004.
The increase in royalties reported to us by external licensees was primarily due to an increase in
sales of CDMA products by licensees, resulting from higher worldwide demand for CDMA products at
higher average selling prices due primarily to the growth in sales of
high-end WCDMA products and shifts
in the geographic distribution of sales of CDMA products.



Cost of Equipment and Services.

Cost of equipment and services revenues for fiscal 2005 was
$1.65 billion, compared to $1.48 billion for fiscal 2004. Cost of equipment and services revenues
as a percentage of equipment and services revenues was 44% for fiscal 2005, compared to 42% for
fiscal 2004. The margin percentage decline in fiscal 2005 compared to fiscal 2004 was primarily due
to a 1.3% decrease in QCT margin percentage. Increases in product support costs and the reserves
for excess and obsolete inventory contributed 1.1% and 0.5%, respectively, to the total decrease in
QCT margin percentage. Cost of equipment and services revenues as a percentage of equipment and
services revenues may fluctuate in future quarters depending on the mix of products sold and
services provided, competitive pricing, new product introduction costs and other factors.

Research and Development Expenses.

For fiscal 2005, research and development expenses were
$1.01 billion or 18% of revenues, compared to $720 million or 15% of revenues for fiscal 2004. The
dollar and percentage increases in research and development expenses primarily resulted from a $275
million increase in costs related to integrated circuit products and other initiatives to support
lower cost phones, multimedia applications, high-speed wireless Internet access and multimode,
multiband, multinetwork products and technologies, including CDMA2000 1X/1xEV-DO, WCDMA, HSDPA,
GSM/GPRS/EDGE and OFDMA, and the development of our FLO technology, MediaFLO MDS and iMoD display
products using MEMS technology. We expect that research and development costs will increase in
fiscal 2006 as we continue our active support of CDMA-based technologies, products and network
operations and other product initiatives.

Selling, General and Administrative Expenses.

For fiscal 2005, selling, general and
administrative expenses were $631 million or 11% of revenues, compared to $547 million or 11% of
revenues for fiscal 2004. The dollar increase was primarily due to a $38 million increase in
professional fees, primarily patent administration and outside consultants, a $33 million increase
in employee-related expenses, and a $13 million decrease in other income.

Net Investment Income.

Net investment income was $423 million for fiscal 2005, compared to
$184 million for fiscal 2004. The change was primarily comprised as follows (in millions):

The increase in interest and dividend income on cash and marketable securities held by
corporate and other segments was a result of higher average cash and marketable securities balances
and higher interest rates earned on interest-bearing securities. Net realized gains on corporate
investments increased primarily as a result of an increase in the positive performance of
marketable equity securities as a percentage of total corporate investments in fiscal 2005, as
compared to fiscal 2004. The increase in net realized gains on strategic investments in QSI
resulted primarily from a $48 million gain on our minority investment in a wireless publisher and a
$41 million gain on the sale of our investment in Next

Wave

Telecom Inc. Gains and losses on
derivative instruments in both fiscal 2005 and 2004 related primarily to changes in the fair values
of put options sold in connection with our stock repurchase program. Equity in losses of investees
decreased primarily due to a decrease in losses incurred by Inquam, of which our share was $33
million for fiscal 2005 as compared to $59 million for fiscal 2004.

Income Tax Expense.

Income tax expense from continuing operations was $666 million for fiscal
2005, compared to $588 million for fiscal 2004. The annual effective tax rate for continuing
operations was approximately 24% for fiscal 2005, compared to 25% for fiscal 2004. The annual
effective tax rate from continuing operations for
fiscal 2005 was lower than the annual effective tax rate from continuing operations for fiscal
2004 primarily due to an increase in foreign earnings taxed at less than the United States federal
tax rate.



The annual effective tax rate for fiscal 2005 was 11% lower than the United States federal
statutory rate primarily due to benefits of approximately 10% related to foreign earnings taxed at
less than the United States federal rate, 3% related to an increase in tax benefits resulting from
our increased ability to use our capital loss carryforwards and 2% related to research and
development tax credits, partially offset by state taxes of approximately 4%.

As of September 25, 2005, we had a valuation allowance of approximately $62 million on
previously incurred capital losses due to uncertainty as to our ability to generate sufficient
capital gains to utilize all capital losses. We will continue to assess the realizability of
capital losses. The amount of the valuation allowance on capital losses may be adjusted in the
future as our ability to utilize capital losses changes. A change in the valuation allowance may
impact the provision for income taxes in the period the change occurs.

Fiscal 2004 Compared to Fiscal 2003

Revenues.

Total revenues for fiscal 2004 were $4.88 billion, compared to $3.85 billion for
fiscal 2003. Revenues from Samsung, LG Electronics and Motorola, customers of our QCT, QTL and QWI
segments, comprised an aggregate of 15%, 15% and 10% of total consolidated revenues, respectively,
in fiscal 2004, compared to 17%, 13% and 13% of total consolidated revenues, respectively, in
fiscal 2003.

Revenues from sales of equipment and services for fiscal 2004 were $3.51 billion, compared to
$2.86 billion for fiscal 2003. Revenues from sales of integrated circuits increased $652 million,
resulting primarily from an increase of $994 million related to higher unit shipments of MSM and
accompanying RF integrated circuits, partially offset by a decrease of $331 million related to the
effects of reductions in average sales prices and changes in product mix.

Revenues from licensing and royalty fees for fiscal 2004 were $1.37 billion, compared to $985
million for fiscal 2003. The increase resulted primarily from higher QTL segment royalties,
resulting primarily from an increase in phone and infrastructure equipment sales by our licensees
at higher average selling prices, partially offset by the effect of the change in timing of
recognizing royalties to an “as reported” method during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004. Royalty
revenues recorded in fiscal 2004 excluded $151 million of royalties that were reported by licensees
in the first quarter of fiscal 2004, but estimated and recorded as revenue in the fourth quarter of
fiscal 2003. Royalties reported to us by licensees in fiscal 2004 were $1.29 billion as compared to
$837 million in fiscal 2003.

Cost of Equipment and Services.

Cost of equipment and services revenues for fiscal 2004 was
$1.48 billion, compared to $1.27 billion for fiscal 2003. Cost of equipment and services revenues
as a percentage of equipment and services revenues was 42% for fiscal 2004, compared to 44% for
fiscal 2003. The margin percentage improvement in fiscal 2004 compared to fiscal 2003 was primarily
due to the increase in QCT revenues as a percentage of total equipment and services revenues,
resulting in increased QCT margin relative to the total.

Research and Development Expenses.

For fiscal 2004, research and development expenses were
$720 million or 15% of revenues, compared to $523 million or 14% of revenues for fiscal 2003. The
dollar and percentage increases in research and development expenses primarily resulted from a $187
million increase in costs related to integrated circuit products and other initiatives to support
multimedia applications, high-speed wireless Internet access and multimode, multiband, multinetwork
products and technologies, including CDMA2000 1X/1xEV-DO, WCDMA, HSDPA and GSM/GPRS/EDGE, and the
development of our FLO technology and MediaFLO MDS.

Selling, General and Administrative Expenses.

For fiscal 2004, selling, general and
administrative expenses were $547 million or 11% of revenues, compared to $483 million or 13% of
revenues for fiscal 2003. The dollar increase was primarily due to a $61 million increase in
employee-related expenses, a $21 million increase in professional fees, primarily patent
administration and outside consultants, and a $12 million increase related to a charitable grant to
an educational institution for the primary purpose of furthering the study of engineering and math,
partially offset by the effect of a $34 million impairment loss recorded in fiscal 2003 on our
wireless licenses in Australia due to developments that affected potential strategic alternatives
for using the spectrum. The impairment loss recognized was the difference between the assets’

The increase in interest and dividend income on cash and marketable securities held by
corporate and other segments was a result of higher average cash and marketable securities
balances, partially offset by the impact of lower interest rates earned on interest-bearing
securities, and $6 million in interest income recorded as a result of a refund from the United
States Internal Revenue Service. The decrease in QSI interest income was primarily the result of
the prepayment on the Pegaso debt facility in the first quarter of fiscal 2004. The
other-than-temporary losses on investments during fiscal 2003 primarily related to an $81 million
impairment of our investment in a wireless operator in South Korea and a $16 million impairment of
our investment in a provider of semiconductor packaging, test and distribution services. Equity in
losses of investees decreased primarily due to a decrease in losses incurred by Inquam, of which
our share was $59 million for fiscal 2004 as compared to $99 million for fiscal 2003.

Income Tax Expense.

Income tax expense from continuing operations was $588 million for fiscal
2004, compared to $536 million for fiscal 2003. The annual effective tax rate for continuing
operations was approximately 25% for fiscal 2004, compared to 34% for fiscal 2003. The annual
effective tax rate for continuing operations for fiscal 2004 was lower than the 2003 effective tax
rate for continuing operations primarily due to an increase in foreign earnings taxed at less than
the United States federal tax rate, an increase in tax benefits recorded arising from our increased
ability to use capital loss carryforwards and the reduction of QTL earnings, which are taxed at a
rate that is lower than our effective tax rate, as a percentage of total earnings due to the change
in the timing of recognizing QTL royalties. Foreign earnings taxed at less than the United States
federal rate were higher in fiscal 2004 primarily due to the adjustment of an intercompany royalty
agreement and an increase in foreign earnings. The annual effective tax rate for continuing
operations for fiscal 2004 was 10% lower than the United States federal statutory rate due
primarily to a benefit of approximately 14% related to foreign earnings taxed at less than the
United States federal rate, research and development tax credits and our increased ability to use
capital loss carryforwards, partially offset by state taxes of 4%.

Our Segment Results for Fiscal 2005 Compared to Fiscal 2004

The following should be read in conjunction with the financial results of fiscal 2005 and 2004
for each reporting segment. See “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements — Note 10 — Segment
Information.”

QCT Segment.

QCT revenues for fiscal 2005 were $3.29 billion, compared to $3.11 billion for
fiscal 2004. Equipment and services revenues, primarily from MSM and accompanying RF integrated
circuits, were $3.20 billion for fiscal 2005, compared to $3.04 billion for fiscal 2004. The
increase in integrated circuits revenue was comprised of $396 million related to higher unit
shipments, partially offset by a decrease of $241 million related to the effects of reductions in
average sales prices and changes in product mix. Approximately 151 million MSM integrated circuits
were sold during fiscal 2005, compared to approximately 137 million for fiscal 2004.



QCT’s earnings before taxes for fiscal 2005 were $852 million, compared to $1.05 billion for
fiscal 2004. QCT’s operating income as a percentage of its revenues (operating margin percentage)
was 26% in fiscal 2005, compared to 34% in fiscal 2004. The decline in operating margin percentage
in fiscal 2005 as compared to fiscal 2004 was primarily the result of a 45% increase in research
and development expenses for fiscal 2005 as compared to fiscal 2004, mainly related to increased
investment in new integrated circuit products and technology research and development initiatives
to support lower cost phones, multimedia applications, high-speed wireless Internet access and
multiband, multimode, multinetwork products and technologies, including CDMA2000 1X/1xEV-DO, WCDMA,
HSDPA and GSM/GPRS/EDGE.

QTL Segment.

QTL revenues for fiscal 2005 were $1.84 billion, compared to $1.33 billion for
fiscal 2004. QTL’s earnings before taxes for fiscal 2005 were $1.66 billion, compared to $1.20
billion for fiscal 2004. QTL’s operating margin percentage was 90% during both fiscal 2005 and
2004. The increase in both revenues and earnings before taxes primarily resulted from a $350
million increase in royalties reported to us by our external licensees and the effect of changing
the timing of recognizing royalty revenues in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004. Royalty revenues
recorded in fiscal 2004 excluded $151 million of royalties that were reported by external licensees
in the first quarter of fiscal 2004, but estimated and recorded as revenue in the fourth quarter of
fiscal 2003. Royalties reported to us by external licensees in fiscal 2005 were $1.64 billion, as
compared to $1.29 billion in fiscal 2004. The increase in royalties reported to us by external
licensees was primarily due to an increase in sales of CDMA products by licensees, resulting from
higher worldwide demand for CDMA products at higher average selling prices due primarily to the
growth of higher priced WCDMA sales and shifts in the geographic distribution of sales of CDMA
products. Revenues from license fees were $69 million in fiscal 2005, as compared to $59 million in
fiscal 2004. During fiscal 2005, we recognized $4 million in revenue related to equity received as
license fees, compared to $5 million in fiscal 2004. Other revenues were comprised of intersegment
royalties.

During the periods preceding the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004, we estimated and recorded the
royalty revenues earned for sales by certain licensees (the Estimated Licensees) in the quarter in
which such sales occurred, but only when reasonable estimates of such amounts could be made. Not
all royalties earned were recorded based on estimates. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004, we
determined that, due to escalating and changing business trends, we no longer had the ability to
reliably estimate royalty revenues from the Estimated Licensees. These escalating and changing
trends included the commercial launches and global expansion of WCDMA networks, changes in market
share among licensees due to increased global competition, and increased variability in the
integrated circuit and finished product inventories of licensees. Starting in the fourth quarter of
fiscal 2004, we began recognizing royalty revenues solely based on royalties reported by licensees
during the quarter. The change in the timing of recognizing royalty revenue was made prospectively
and had the initial one-time effect of reducing royalty revenues recorded in the fourth quarter of
fiscal 2004. Accordingly, we did not estimate royalty revenues earned in fiscal 2005.

QWI Segment.

QWI revenues for fiscal 2005 were $644 million, compared to $571 million for
fiscal 2004. Revenues increased primarily due to a $37 million increase in QIS revenue and a $27
million increase in QWBS revenue. The increase in QIS revenue was primarily attributable to a $41
million increase in fees related to our expanded BREW customer base and products. The increase in
QWBS revenue was primarily attributable to a $16 million increase in equipment revenue, net of a
$24 million decrease in amortization of deferred revenues related to historical equipment sales,
and a $10 million increase in related messaging services revenue. QWBS shipped approximately 46,800
satellite-based systems and 62,500 terrestrial-based systems during fiscal 2005, compared to
approximately 43,400 satellite-based systems and 10,000 terrestrial-based systems in fiscal 2004.

QWI’s earnings before taxes for fiscal 2005 were $57 million, compared to $19 million for
fiscal 2004. QWI’s operating margin percentage was 9% in fiscal 2005, compared to 3% in fiscal
2004. The increases in QWI earnings before taxes and operating percentage were primarily due to a
$39 million increase in QIS gross margin largely resulting from the increase in fees related to our
expanded BREW customer base and products.

During fiscal 2005, QWBS completed the process of moving high volume, standard product
manufacturing to Mexico to reduce manufacturing costs. The low volume, prototype and new product
manufacturing activities remains in San Diego. We continue to evaluate other low cost manufacturing
opportunities.

QSI Segment.

QSI’s earnings before taxes from continuing operations for fiscal 2005 were $10
million, compared to losses before taxes from continuing operations of $31 million for fiscal 2004.
During fiscal 2005, QSI recorded $101 million in realized gains on marketable securities and other
investments, compared to $56 million in fiscal 2004. Equity in losses of investees decreased by $43
million primarily due to a decrease in losses incurred by



Inquam during fiscal 2005 as compared to fiscal 2004, of which our share was $33 million for
fiscal 2005 as compared to $59 million for fiscal 2004. These improvements in QSI’s earnings before
taxes from continuing operations were partially offset by a $42 million increase in MediaFLO USA
operating expenses.

Our Segment Results for Fiscal 2004 Compared to Fiscal 2003

The following should be read in conjunction with the financial results of fiscal 2004 and 2003
for each reporting segment. See “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements — Note 10 — Segment
Information.”

QCT Segment.

QCT revenues for fiscal 2004 were $3.11 billion, compared to $2.43 billion for
fiscal 2003. Equipment and services revenues, primarily from MSM and accompanying RF integrated
circuits, were $3.04 billion for fiscal 2004, compared to $2.39 billion for fiscal 2003. The
increase in integrated circuits revenue was comprised of $994 million related to higher unit
shipments, partially offset by a decrease of $331 million related to the effects of reductions in
average sales prices and changes in product mix. Approximately 137 million MSM integrated circuits
were sold during fiscal 2004, compared to approximately 99 million for fiscal 2003.

QCT’s earnings before taxes for fiscal 2004 were $1.05 billion, compared to $805 million for
fiscal 2003. QCT’s operating income as a percentage of its revenues (operating margin percentage)
was 34% in fiscal 2004, compared to 33% in fiscal 2003. The operating margin percentage in fiscal
2004 as compared to fiscal 2003 increased slightly primarily as a result of the increase in gross
margin percentage, partially offset by a 40% increase in research and development and selling,
general and administrative expenses. Research and development and selling, general and
administrative expenses were $153 million higher and $55 million higher, respectively, for fiscal
2004 as compared to fiscal 2003 primarily associated with increased investment in new integrated
circuit products and technology research, development and marketing initiatives to support
multimedia applications, high-speed wireless Internet access and multiband, multimode, multinetwork
products and technologies, including CDMA2000 1X/1xEV-DO, WCDMA, HSDPA and GSM/GPRS/EDGE.

QTL Segment.

QTL revenues for fiscal 2004 were $1.33 billion, compared to $1.00 billion for
fiscal 2003. Royalty revenues from external licensees were $1.14 billion in fiscal 2004, compared
to $838 million in fiscal 2003. QTL’s earnings before taxes for fiscal 2004 were $1.20 billion,
compared to $897 million for fiscal 2003. QTL’s operating margin percentage was 90% in fiscal 2004,
compared to 89% in fiscal 2003. The increase in both revenues and earnings before taxes primarily
resulted from a $455 million increase in royalties reported to us by our external licensees,
partially offset by the change in our ability to estimate royalties. Royalty revenues recorded in
fiscal 2004 excluded $151 million of royalties that were reported by external licensees in the
first quarter of fiscal 2004, but estimated and recorded as revenue in the fourth quarter of fiscal
2003. Royalties reported to us by external licensees in fiscal 2004 were $1.29 billion, as compared
to $837 million in fiscal 2003. The increase in royalties reported to us by external licensees was
primarily due to an increase in sales of CDMA products by licensees, resulting from higher demand
for CDMA products across all major regions of CDMA deployment at higher average selling prices.
Revenues from license fees were $59 million in both fiscal 2004 and 2003. During each of fiscal
2004 and 2003, we recognized $5 million in revenue related to equity received as license fees.
Other revenues were comprised of intersegment royalties.

During the periods preceding the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004, we estimated and recorded the
royalty revenues earned for sales by certain licensees (the Estimated Licensees) in the quarter in
which such sales occurred, but only when reasonable estimates of such amounts could be made. Not
all royalties earned were recorded based on estimates. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004, we
determined that, due to escalating and changing business trends, we no longer had the ability to
reliably estimate royalty revenues from the Estimated Licensees. These escalating and changing
trends included the commercial launches and global expansion of WCDMA networks, changes in market
share among licensees due to increased global competition, and increased variability in the
integrated circuit and finished product inventories of licensees. Starting in the fourth quarter of
fiscal 2004, we began recognizing royalty revenues solely based on royalties reported by licensees
during the quarter. The change in the timing of recognizing royalty revenue was made prospectively
and had the initial one-time effect of reducing royalty revenues recorded in the fourth quarter of
fiscal 2004.

QWI Segment.

QWI revenues for fiscal 2004 were $571 million, compared to $484 million for
fiscal 2003. Revenues increased primarily due to a $58 million increase in QWBS revenue and a $37
million increase in QIS revenue. The increase in QWBS revenue was primarily attributable to a $14
million increase in messaging revenue as a result of a larger installed base and a $44 million
increase in equipment revenue, net of an $19 million decrease in amortization of deferred revenues
related to historical equipment sales. QWBS shipped approximately 43,400



satellite-based systems and 10,000 terrestrial-based systems during fiscal 2004, compared to
approximately 32,200 satellite-based systems and 5,300 terrestrial-based systems in fiscal 2003.
The increase in QIS revenue is primarily attributable to a $53 million increase in fees related to
our expanded BREW customer base and products, partially offset by a $19 million decrease in QChat
revenue resulting from the wind down of development efforts under the licensing agreement with
Nextel.

QWI’s earnings before taxes for fiscal 2004 were $19 million, compared to $15 million for
fiscal 2003. QWI’s operating margin percentage was 3% in both fiscal 2004 and 2003. The increase in
QWI’s earnings before taxes was primarily due to a $31 million increase in QIS gross margin largely
resulting from the increase in fees related to our expanded BREW customer base and products, offset
by a $29 million increase in QWI research and development and selling, general and administrative
expenses. QWI’s operating margin percentage remained flat in fiscal 2004 as compared to fiscal 2003
primarily due to a decline in QWBS gross margin percentage, offset by an improvement in QIS gross
margin percentage. The decline in QWBS gross margin percentage in fiscal 2004 as compared to fiscal
2003 was primarily attributable to a decline in the gross margin percentage on equipment sales,
which are lower than the margins on messaging services, combined with an increase in equipment
sales as a percentage of total QWBS revenue. The improvement in QIS gross margin percentage was
primarily attributable to the increase in fees related to our expanded BREW customer base and
products.

QSI Segment.

QSI’s losses before taxes from continuing operations for fiscal 2004 were $31
million, compared to $168 million for fiscal 2003. Equity in losses of investees decreased by $42
million primarily due to a decrease in losses incurred by Inquam during fiscal 2004 as compared to
fiscal 2003, of which our share was $59 million for fiscal 2004 as compared to $99 million for
fiscal 2003. During fiscal 2004, we recorded $12 million in other-than-temporary losses on
marketable securities and other investments as compared to $127 million for fiscal 2003. During
fiscal 2003, we also recorded a $34 million impairment loss on our wireless licenses in Australia
due to developments that affected strategic alternatives for using the spectrum. These improvements
in QSI’s losses before taxes were partially offset by a $31 million decrease in interest income
resulting from the prepayment of the Pegaso debt facility in the first quarter of fiscal 2004 and
$28 million in MediaFLO USA operating expenses.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities were $8.7 billion at September 25, 2005,
an increase of $1.0 billion from September 26, 2004. The increase was primarily the result of $2.7
billion in cash provided by operating activities and $386 million in net proceeds from the issuance
of common stock under our stock option and employee stock purchase plans, partially offset by $953
million in repurchases of our common stock under our stock repurchase program, $576 million in
capital expenditures, $524 million in dividends paid and $249 million invested in other entities
and acquisitions.

On March 8, 2005, we authorized the repurchase of up to $2 billion of our common stock under a
stock repurchase program with no expiration date. Through November 2, 2005, we repurchased and
retired approximately 27,083,000 shares of our common stock for $953 million. In connection with
this stock repurchase program, we have two put options outstanding, with expiration dates of
December 7, 2005 and March 21, 2006, that may require us to repurchase 11,500,000 shares for $411
million (net of the option premiums received). At November 2, 2005, $636 million remained
authorized for repurchases under our stock repurchase program. We announced dividends totaling $524
million, $307 million and $135 million, or $0.320, $0.190 and $0.085 per share, during fiscal 2005,
2004 and 2003, respectively. On October 10, 2005, we announced a cash dividend of $0.09 per share
on our common stock, payable on January 4, 2006 to stockholders of record as of December 7, 2005.
We intend to continue to pay quarterly dividends subject to capital availability and periodic
determinations that cash dividends are in the best interest of our stockholders.

Accounts receivable decreased by 6% during fiscal 2005. Days sales outstanding, on a
consolidated basis, were 30 days at September 25, 2005, compared to 43 days at September 26, 2004.
The change in days sales outstanding is consistent with the increase in revenue and the decrease in
accounts receivable resulting from cash collections.

We started construction of two facilities in San Diego, California in fiscal 2003, totaling
approximately one million additional square feet, to meet the requirements projected in our
business plan. The remaining cost of these new facilities is expected to be approximately $149
million through fiscal 2007. In fiscal 2005, we announced our plans to expand our backup Network
Management Center in Las Vegas, Nevada, which uses satellite and terrestrial-based technologies to
track freight transportation and shipping nationwide. We expect the remaining cost of this
expansion will be approximately $35 million through fiscal 2008. In fiscal 2005, our MediaFLO USA
subsidiary, a



wireless multimedia operator, began the development of a nationwide mediacast network based on
our FLO technology and MediaFLO MDS. As part of this development, MediaFLO USA has executed a
number of lease agreements at broadcast tower sites and has begun the installation of equipment and
leasehold improvements at some of these sites. The remaining costs for our existing tower sites
under lease, including equipment and leasehold improvements as well as the costs of installation,
are expected to be approximately $18 million through fiscal 2006.

On August 11, 2005, we announced our intention to acquire Flarion, a developer of OFDMA
technology. Upon completion of the acquisition, which is anticipated in the first half of fiscal
2006, pending regulatory approval and other customary closing conditions, we estimate that we will
pay approximately $545 million in consideration, including approximately $235 million in cash. Upon
achievement of certain agreed upon milestones on or prior to the eighth anniversary of the close of
this transaction, we may issue additional aggregate consideration of $205 million, including
approximately $173 million payable in cash, to Flarion stockholders.

We intend to continue our strategic investment activities to promote the worldwide adoption of
CDMA products and the growth of CDMA-based wireless data and wireless Internet products. As part of
these investment activities, we may provide financing or other support to facilitate the marketing
and sale of CDMA equipment by authorized suppliers. In the event additional needs for cash arise,
we may raise additional funds from a combination of sources including potential debt and equity
issuance.

We believe our current cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities and cash generated
from operations will satisfy our expected working and other capital requirements for the
foreseeable future based on current business plans, including acquisitions, investments in other
companies and other assets to support the growth of our business, financing and other commitments,
the payment of dividends and possible additional stock repurchases.

Contractual Obligations / Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

We have no significant contractual obligations not fully recorded on our Consolidated Balance
Sheets or fully disclosed in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements. We have no
material off-balance sheet arrangements as defined in S-K 303(a)(4)(ii).

Financial Statements, Note 4 — Investments in Other Entities and Note 9 — Commitments and
Contingencies.”



Future Accounting Requirements

In December 2004, the FASB revised Statement No. 123 (FAS 123R), “Share-Based Payment,” which
requires companies to expense the estimated fair value of employee stock options and similar
awards. On April 14, 2005, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission adopted a new rule amending
the compliance dates for FAS 123R. In accordance with the new rule, the accounting provisions of
FAS 123R will be effective for us beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2006. We tentatively
expect to adopt the provisions of FAS 123R using a modified prospective application. FAS 123R,
which provides certain changes to the method for valuing share-based compensation among other
changes, will apply to new awards and to awards that are outstanding on the effective date and are
subsequently modified or cancelled. Compensation expense for outstanding awards for which the
requisite service had not been rendered as of the effective date will be recognized over the
remaining service period using the compensation cost calculated for pro forma disclosure purposes
under FAS 123. At September 25, 2005, unamortized compensation expense related to outstanding
unvested options, as determined in accordance with FAS 123, that we expect to record during fiscal
2006 was approximately $394 million before income taxes. We will incur additional expense during
fiscal 2006 related to new awards granted during fiscal 2006 that cannot yet be quantified. We are
in the process of determining how the guidance regarding valuing share-based compensation as
prescribed in FAS 123R will be applied to valuing share-based awards granted after the effective
date and the impact that the recognition of compensation expense related to such awards will have
on our financial statements.

Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

Interest Rate Market Risk.

We invest most of our cash in a number of diversified investment
and non-investment grade fixed and floating rate securities, consisting of cash equivalents and
marketable securities. Changes in the general level of United States interest rates can affect the
principal values and yields of fixed income investments. If interest rates in the general economy
were to rise rapidly in a short period of time, our fixed income investments could lose value. If
the general economy were to weaken significantly, the credit profile of issuers of securities held
in our investment portfolios could deteriorate, and our investments could lose value. We may
implement investment strategies of different types with varying duration and risk/return trade-offs
that do not perform well.

The following table provides information about our financial instruments that are sensitive to
changes in interest rates. For our interest bearing securities, the table presents principal cash
flows, weighted average yield at cost and contractual maturity dates. Additionally, we have assumed
that these securities are similar enough within the specified categories to aggregate these
securities for presentation purposes.

Equity Price Market Risk.

We invest in a number of diversified marketable securities and
mutual fund shares subject to equity price risk. The recorded values of marketable equity
securities increased to $1.16 billion at September 25, 2005 from $765 million at September 26,
2004. The recorded value of equity mutual fund shares decreased to $293 million at September 25,
2005 from $296 million at September 26, 2004. Our diversified investments in specific companies and
industry segments may vary over time, and changes in the concentrations of these investments may
affect the price volatility of our investments. A 10% decrease in the market price of our
marketable equity securities and equity mutual fund shares at September 25, 2005 would cause a
corresponding 10% decrease in the carrying amounts of these securities, or $145 million.

Our strategic investments in other entities consist substantially of investments in private
early stage companies accounted for under the equity and cost methods. Accordingly, we believe that
our exposure to market risk from these investments is not material. Additionally, we do not
anticipate any near-term changes in the nature of our market risk exposures or in management’s
objectives and strategies with respect to managing such exposures. The recorded values of these
strategic investments totaled $121 million at September 25,
2005, as compared to $162 million at September 26, 2004.

We hold warrants to acquire equity interests in certain strategic investees that are subject
to equity price risk. Substantially all of these warrants are recorded at fair value in accordance
with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133, “Accounting for Derivative Instruments
and Hedging Activities.” The recorded values of warrants held at September 25, 2005 totaled $1
million, as compared to $4 million at September 26, 2004.

In connection with our stock repurchase program, we sell put options that may require us to
repurchase shares of our common stock at fixed prices. These written put options subject us to
equity price risk. At September 25, 2005, two put options were outstanding, which expire on
December 7, 2005 and March 21, 2006, that may require us to repurchase 11,500,000 shares of our
common stock upon exercise for $411 million (net of the option premiums received). The put option
liabilities, with a fair value of $7 million at September 25, 2005, were included in other current
liabilities. If the fair value of our common stock at September 25, 2005 decreased by 10%, the put
options would expire unexercised resulting in $7 million in investment income. If the fair value of
our common stock at September 25, 2005 decreased by 25%, the amount required to physically settle
the put options would exceed the fair value of the shares repurchased by approximately $25 million,
net of the $23 million in premiums received.

Additional information regarding our strategic investments is provided in Management’s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Operating Results in this Annual Report.



Foreign Exchange Market Risk.

We manage our exposure to foreign exchange market risks, when
deemed appropriate, through the use of derivative financial instruments, consisting primarily of
foreign currency forward and option contracts. Such derivative financial instruments are viewed as
hedging or risk management tools and are not used for speculative or trading purposes. At September
25, 2005, we had no foreign currency forward contracts outstanding. At September 25, 2005, the
recorded values of our foreign currency option contracts that hedge the foreign currency risk on
royalties earned from certain international licensees on their sales of CDMA and WCDMA products
were $16 million. If our forecasted royalty revenues were to decline by 20% and foreign exchange
rates were to change unfavorably by 20% in each of our hedged foreign currencies, we would incur a
loss of approximately $6 million resulting from a decrease in fair value of the portion of our
hedges that would be rendered ineffective. See “Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements -
The Company and its Significant Accounting Policies” for a description of our foreign currency
accounting policies.

Financial instruments held by consolidated subsidiaries and equity method investees which are
not denominated in the functional currency of those entities are subject to the effects of currency
fluctuations and may affect reported earnings. As a global concern, we face exposure to adverse
movements in foreign currency exchange rates. We may hedge currency exposures associated with
certain assets and liabilities denominated in nonfunctional currencies and certain anticipated
nonfunctional currency transactions. As a result, we could experience unanticipated gains or losses
on anticipated foreign currency cash flows, as well as economic loss with respect to the
recoverability of investments. While we may hedge certain transactions with non-United States
customers, declines in currency values in certain regions may, if not reversed, adversely affect
future product sales because our products may become more expensive to purchase in the countries of
the affected currencies.

Our analysis methods used to assess and mitigate risk discussed above should not be considered
projections of future risks.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of QUALCOMM Incorporated:

We have completed integrated audits of QUALCOMM Incorporated’s 2005 and 2004 consolidated
financial statements and of its internal control over financial reporting as of September 25, 2005
and September 26, 2004 and an audit of its 2003 consolidated financial statements in accordance
with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Our opinions
on QUALCOMM Incorporated’s 2005, 2004 and 2003 consolidated financial statements and of its
internal control over financial reporting as of September 25, 2005, based on our audits, are
presented below.

Consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in the index appearing under Item
15(a)(1) present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of QUALCOMM Incorporated
and its subsidiaries (the Company) as of September 25, 2005 and September 26, 2004, and the results
of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September
25, 2005 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America. In addition, in our opinion, the financial statement schedule listed in the index
appearing under Item 15(a)(2)

presents fairly, in all material respects, the
information set forth therein when read in conjunction with the related consolidated financial
statements. These financial statements and financial statement schedule are the responsibility of
the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements
and financial statement schedule based on our audits. We conducted our audits of these statements
in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about
whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit of financial
statements includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made
by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our
audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Internal control over financial reporting

Also, in our opinion, management’s assessment, included in Management’s Report on Internal
Control Over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A, that the Company maintained effective
internal control over financial reporting as of September 25, 2005 based on criteria established in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
Treadway Commission (COSO), is fairly stated, in all material respects, based on those criteria.
Furthermore, in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal
control over financial reporting as of September 25, 2005, based on criteria established in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework

issued by the COSO. The Company’s management is responsible
for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the
effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express
opinions on management’s assessment and on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over
financial reporting based on our audit. We conducted our audit of internal control over financial
reporting in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United
States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance
about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material
respects. An audit of internal control over financial reporting includes obtaining an understanding
of internal control over financial reporting, evaluating management’s assessment, testing and
evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing such other
procedures as we consider necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a
reasonable basis for our opinions.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide
reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and
procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately
and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide
reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and
expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and
directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance
regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of
the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

F- 1


Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent
or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are
subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that
the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

QUALCOMM Incorporated

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Note 1. The Company and its Significant Accounting Policies

The Company.

QUALCOMM Incorporated (the Company or QUALCOMM), a Delaware corporation,
develops, designs, manufactures and markets digital wireless telecommunications products and
services based on its Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) technology. The Company is a leading
developer and supplier of CDMA-based integrated circuits and system software for wireless voice and
data communications, multimedia functions and global positioning system products to wireless device
and infrastructure manufacturers. The Company grants licenses to use portions of its intellectual
property portfolio, which includes certain patent rights essential to and/or useful in the
manufacture and sale of CDMA products, and receives license fees as well as ongoing royalties based
on sales by licensees of wireless telecommunications equipment products incorporating its CDMA
technologies. The Company provides satellite and terrestrial-based two-way data messaging and
position reporting services for transportation companies, private fleets, construction equipment
fleets and other enterprise companies. The Company provides the BREW (Binary Runtime Environment
for Wireless) product and services to wireless network operators, handset manufacturers and
application developers and support for developing and delivering over-the-air wireless applications
and services. The Company also makes strategic investments to promote the worldwide adoption of
CDMA products and services for wireless voice and Internet data communications.

Principles of Consolidation.

The Company’s consolidated financial statements include the
assets, liabilities and operating results of majority-owned subsidiaries. The ownership of the
other interest holders of consolidated subsidiaries is reflected as minority interest and is not
significant. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. Certain
of the Company’s foreign subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements one
month in arrears to facilitate the timely inclusion of such entities in the Company’s consolidated
financial statements. The Company does not have any investments in entities it believes are
variable interest entities for which the Company is the primary beneficiary.

The Company deconsolidated the Vésper Operating Companies and TowerCo during fiscal 2004 as a
result of their sale (Note 12). Results of operations and cash flows related to the Vésper
Operating Companies and TowerCo are presented as discontinued operations.

Financial Statement Preparation.

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and the disclosure of contingent amounts in the
Company’s financial statements and the accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those
estimates. Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year
presentation.

Fiscal Year.

The Company operates and reports using a 52-53 week fiscal year ending on the
last Sunday in September. The fiscal years ended September 25, 2005, September 26, 2004 and
September 28, 2003 each include 52 weeks.

Revenue Recognition.

The Company derives revenue principally from sales of integrated circuit
products, from royalties for its intellectual property, from messaging and other services and
related hardware sales, from software development and licensing and related services, and from
license fees for intellectual property. The timing of revenue recognition and the amount of revenue
actually recognized in each case depends upon a variety of factors, including the specific terms of
each arrangement and the nature of the Company’s deliverables and obligations. The development
stage of the Company’s customers’ products does not affect the timing or amount of revenue
recognized.

The Company licenses rights to use portions of its intellectual property portfolio, which
includes certain patent rights essential to and/or useful in the manufacture and sale of CDMA
products, including, without limitation, products implementing cdmaOne, CDMA2000, Wideband CDMA
(WCDMA) and/or the CDMA Time Division Duplex (TDD) standards and their derivatives. Licensees
typically pay a license fee in one or more installments and ongoing royalties based on their sales
of products incorporating or using the Company’s licensed intellectual property. License fees are
recognized over the estimated period of future benefit to the average licensee, typically five to
seven years. The Company earns royalties on such licensed CDMA products sold worldwide by its
licensees at the time that the licensees’ sales occur. The Company’s licensees, however, do not
report and pay royalties owed for sales in any given quarter until after the conclusion of that
quarter, and, in some instances, although royalties are

F- 7


QUALCOMM Incorporated

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

reported quarterly, payment is on a semi-annual basis. During the periods preceding the fourth
quarter of fiscal 2004, the Company estimated and recorded the royalty revenues earned for sales by
certain licensees (the Estimated Licensees) in the quarter in which such sales occurred, but only
when reasonable estimates of such amounts could be made. Not all royalties earned were estimated.

Starting in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004, the Company determined that, due to escalating
and changing business trends, the Company no longer had the ability to reliably estimate royalty
revenues from the Estimated Licensees. These escalating and changing trends included the commercial
launches and global expansion of WCDMA networks, changes in market share among licensees due to
increased global competition, and increased variability in the integrated circuit and finished
product inventories of licensees. Starting in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004, the Company began
recognizing royalty revenues for a quarter solely based on royalties reported by licensees during
such quarter. The change in the timing of recognizing royalty revenue was made prospectively and
had the initial one-time effect of reducing royalty revenues recorded in the fourth quarter of
fiscal 2004. Total royalties reported by external licensees for fiscal 2005 and recorded as revenue
for the period were $1.64 billion. Total royalties reported by external licensees for fiscal 2004
and 2003 were $1.29 billion and $837 million, respectively, as compared to $1.14 billion and $838
million, respectively, recorded as royalty revenues from the external licensees for the same
periods.

Revenues from sales of the Company’s CDMA-based integrated circuits are recognized at the time
of shipment, or when title and risk of loss pass to the customer and other criteria for revenue
recognition are met, if later. Revenues from providing services are recorded when earned.

In November 2002, the Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) issued Issue No. 00-21, “Accounting
for Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables” which the Company adopted in the fourth
quarter of fiscal 2003. This issue addresses determination of whether an arrangement involving more
than one deliverable contains more than one unit of accounting and how arrangement consideration
should be measured and allocated to the separate units of accounting. The Company recognized
revenues and expenses from sales of certain satellite and terrestrial-based two-way data messaging
and position reporting hardware and related software products by its QWBS division (Note 10)
ratably over the shorter of the estimated useful life of the hardware product or the expected
messaging service period, which is typically five years, until the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003.
The ratable recognition of these sales had been required because the messaging service was
considered integral to the functionality of the hardware and software. EITF Issue No. 00-21 does
not require the deferral of revenue when an undelivered element is considered integral to the
functionality of a delivered element and otherwise requires separate unit accounting in multiple
element arrangements. Given that the Company meets the criteria stipulated in EITF Issue No. 00-21,
the sale of the hardware is accounted for as a unit of accounting separate from the future service
to be provided by the Company. Accordingly, starting in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003, the
Company began recognizing revenues allocated to the hardware using the residual method and related
expenses from such sales at the time of shipment, or when title and risk of loss pass to the
customer and other criteria for revenue recognition are met, if later, instead of amortizing the
related revenue over future periods. The Company elected to adopt EITF Issue No. 00-21
prospectively for revenue arrangements entered into after the third quarter of fiscal 2003, rather
than reporting the change in accounting as a cumulative-effect adjustment. The amortization of QWBS
equipment revenue that was deferred in the periods prior to the adoption of EITF Issue No. 00-21
will continue with a declining impact through fiscal 2008. QWBS amortized $52 million, $76 million
and $23 million in revenue related to such prior period equipment sales in fiscal 2005 and 2004 and
during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003, respectively. Deferred revenues and expenses related to
the historical QWBS sales that will continue to be amortized in future periods were $54 million and
$34 million, respectively, at September 25, 2005. Gross margin related to these prior sales is
expected to be recognized as follows: $13 million in fiscal 2006, $6 million in fiscal 2007 and $1
million in fiscal 2008.

Revenues from long-term contracts are generally recognized using the percentage-of-completion
efforts-expended method of accounting, based on costs incurred compared with total estimated costs.
The percentage-of-completion method relies on estimates of total contract revenue and costs.
Revenue and profit are subject to revisions as the contract progresses to completion. Revisions in
profit estimates are charged or credited to income in the period in which the facts that give rise
to the revision become known. If actual contract costs are greater than expected, reduction of
contract profit would be required. Billings on uncompleted contracts in excess of incurred cost and
accrued profit are classified as unearned revenue. Estimated contract losses are recognized when
determined. If substantive uncertainty related to customer acceptance exists or the contract’s duration is
relatively short, the Company uses the completed-contract method.

F- 8


QUALCOMM Incorporated

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

The Company provides both perpetual and renewable time-based software licenses. Revenues from
software license fees are recognized when all of the following criteria are met: the written
agreement is executed; the software is delivered; the license fee is fixed and determinable;
collectibility of the license fee is probable; and if applicable, when vendor-specific objective
evidence exists to allocate the total license fee to elements of multiple-element arrangements,
including post-contract customer support. When contracts contain multiple elements wherein
vendor-specific objective evidence exists for all undelivered elements, the Company recognizes
revenue for the delivered elements and defers revenue for the fair value of the undelivered
elements until the remaining obligations have been satisfied. If vendor-specific objective evidence
does not exist for all undelivered elements, revenue for the delivered and undelivered elements is
deferred until remaining obligations have been satisfied, or if the only undelivered element is
post-contract customer support and vendor specific objective evidence of the fair value of
post-contract customer support does not exist, revenue from the entire arrangement is recognized
ratably over the support period. Judgments and estimates are made in connection with the
recognition of software license revenue, which may include assessments of collectibility, the fair
value of deliverable elements and the implied support period. The amount or timing of the Company’s
software license revenue may differ as a result of changes in these judgments or estimates.

The Company records reductions to revenue for customer incentive programs, including special
pricing agreements and other volume-related rebate programs. Such reductions to revenue are
estimates, which are based on a number of factors, including our assumptions related to historical
and projected customer sales volumes and the contractual provisions of the customer agreements.

Unearned revenue consists primarily of fees related to software products, license fees for
intellectual property and hardware products sales with continuing performance obligations.

Concentrations.

A significant portion of the Company’s revenues is concentrated with a limited
number of customers as the worldwide market for wireless telecommunications products is dominated
by a small number of large corporations. Revenues from LG Electronics, Samsung and Motorola,
customers of the Company’s QCT, QTL and QWI segments, comprised 15%, 13% and 11% of total
consolidated revenues, respectively, in fiscal 2005, as compared to 15%, 15% and 10% of total
consolidated revenues in fiscal 2004, respectively, and 13%, 17% and 13%, respectively, in fiscal
2003. Aggregated accounts receivable from Samsung, LG Electronics and Motorola comprised 45% and
51% of gross accounts receivable at September 25, 2005 and September 26, 2004, respectively.

Revenues from international customers were approximately 82%, 79% and 77% of total
consolidated revenues in fiscal 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.

Cost of Equipment and Services Revenues.

Cost of equipment and services revenues is primarily
comprised of the cost of equipment revenues, the cost of messaging services revenues and the cost
of development and other services revenues. Cost of equipment revenues consists of the cost of
equipment sold and sustaining engineering costs, including personnel and related costs. Cost of
messaging services revenues consists principally of satellite transponder costs, network operations
expenses, including personnel and related costs, depreciation, and airtime charges by
telecommunications operators. Cost of development and other services revenues primarily includes
personnel costs and related expenses.

Research and Development.

Costs incurred in research and development activities are expensed
as incurred, except certain software development costs capitalized after technological feasibility
of the software is established.

Shipping and Handling Costs.

Costs incurred for shipping and handling are included in cost of
revenues at the time the related revenue is recognized. Amounts billed to a customer for shipping
and handling are reported as revenue.

Income Taxes.

The asset and liability approach is used to recognize deferred tax assets and
liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying
amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities. Tax law and rate changes are reflected in
income in the period such changes are enacted. The Company records a valuation allowance to reduce
the deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized.

QUALCOMM Incorporated

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

The Company’s income tax returns are based on calculations and assumptions that are subject to
examination by the Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities. While the Company believes
it has appropriate support for the positions taken on its tax returns, the Company regularly
assesses the potential outcomes of these examinations and any future examinations for the current
or prior years in determining the adequacy of its provision for income taxes. As part of its
assessment of potential adjustments to its tax returns, the Company increases its current tax
liability to the extent an adjustment would result in a cash tax payment or decreases its deferred
tax assets to the extent an adjustment would not result in a cash tax payment. The Company
continually assesses the likelihood and amount of potential adjustments and adjusts the income tax
provision, the current tax liability and deferred taxes in the period in which the facts that give
rise to a revision become known.

Cash Equivalents.

The Company considers all highly liquid investments with original maturities
of three months or less to be cash equivalents. Cash equivalents are comprised of money market
funds, certificates of deposit, commercial paper and government agencies’ securities. The carrying
amounts approximate fair value due to the short maturities of these instruments.

Marketable Securities.

Management determines the appropriate classification of marketable
securities at the time of purchase and reevaluates such designation as of each balance sheet date.
Held-to-maturity securities are carried at amortized cost, which approximates fair value.
Available-for-sale securities are stated at fair value as determined by the most recently traded
price of each security at the balance sheet date. The net unrealized gains or losses on
available-for-sale securities are reported as a component of comprehensive income (loss), net of
tax. The specific identification method is used to compute the realized gains and losses on debt
and equity securities.

The Company regularly monitors and evaluates the realizable value of its marketable
securities. When assessing marketable securities for other-than-temporary declines in value, the
Company considers such factors as, among other things, how significant the decline in value is as a
percentage of the original cost, how long the market value of the investment has been less than its
original cost, the performance of the investee’s stock price in relation to the stock price of its
competitors within the industry and the market in general, analyst recommendations, any news that
has been released specific to the investee and the outlook for the overall industry in which the
investee operates. The Company also reviews the financial statements of the investee to determine
if the investee is experiencing financial difficulties and considers new products/services that the
investee may have forthcoming that will improve its operating results. If events and circumstances
indicate that a decline in the value of these assets has occurred and is other than temporary, the
Company records a charge to investment income (expense).

Allowances for Doubtful Accounts.

The Company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for
estimated losses resulting from the inability of the Company’s customers to make required payments.
The Company considers the following factors when determining if collection of a fee is reasonably
assured: customer credit-worthiness, past transaction history with the customer, current economic
industry trends and changes in customer payment terms. If the Company has no previous experience
with the customer, the Company typically obtains reports from various credit organizations to
ensure that the customer has a history of paying its creditors. The Company may also request
financial information, including financial statements or other documents (e.g., bank statements) to
ensure that the customer has the means of making payment. If these factors do not indicate
collection is reasonably assured, revenue is deferred until collection becomes reasonably assured,
which is generally upon receipt of cash. If the financial condition of the Company’s customers were
to deteriorate, adversely affecting their ability to make payments, additional allowances would be
required.

Inventories.

Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market (replacement cost, not to
exceed net realizable value) using the first-in, first-out method. Recoverability of inventory is
assessed based on review of committed purchase orders from customers, as well as purchase
commitment projections provided by customers, among other things.

Property, Plant and Equipment.

Property, plant and equipment are recorded at cost and
depreciated or amortized using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives.
Buildings and building improvements are depreciated over 30 years and 15 years, respectively.
Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of their estimated useful lives or the
remaining term of the related lease. Other property, plant and equipment have useful lives ranging
from 2 to 15 years. Direct external and internal costs of developing software for internal use are
capitalized subsequent to the preliminary stage of development. Maintenance, repairs, and
minor renewals and betterments are charged to expense as incurred.

F-10


QUALCOMM Incorporated

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Upon the retirement or disposition of property, plant and equipment, the related cost and
accumulated depreciation or amortization are removed, and a gain or loss is recorded.

Investments in Other Entities.

The Company makes strategic investments in companies that have
developed or are developing innovative wireless data applications and wireless operators that
promote the worldwide deployment of CDMA systems. Investments in corporate entities with less than
a 20% voting interest are generally accounted for under the cost method. The Company uses the
equity method to account for investments in corporate entities, including limited liability
corporations that do not maintain specific ownership accounts, in which it has a voting interest of
20% to 50% and other than minor to 50% ownership interests in partnerships and limited liability
corporations that do maintain specific ownership accounts, or in which it otherwise has the ability
to exercise significant influence. Under the equity method, the investment is originally recorded
at cost and adjusted to recognize the Company’s share of net earnings or losses of the investee,
limited to the extent of the Company’s investment in and advances to the investee and financial
guarantees on behalf of the investee that create additional basis. The Company’s equity in net
earnings or losses of its investees are recorded one month in arrears to facilitate the timely
inclusion of such equity in net earnings or losses in the Company’s consolidated financial
statements.

The Company regularly monitors and evaluates the realizable value of its investments. When
assessing an investment for an other-than-temporary decline in value, the Company considers such
factors as, among other things, the share price from the investee’s latest financing round, the
performance of the investee in relation to its own operating targets and its business plan, the
investee’s revenue and cost trends, as well as liquidity and cash position, including its cash burn
rate, market acceptance of the investee’s products/services as well as any new products or services
that may be forthcoming, any significant news that has been released specific to the investee or
the investee’s competitors and/or industry, and the outlook for the overall industry in which the
investee operates. From time to time, the Company may consider third party evaluations, valuation
reports or advice from investment banks. If events and circumstances indicate that a decline in the
value of these assets has occurred and is other than temporary, the Company records a charge to
investment income (expense).

Derivatives.

The Company holds warrants to purchase equity interests in certain other
companies related to its strategic investment activities. These warrants are not held for trading
or hedging purposes. Certain of these warrants are recorded at fair value. Changes in fair value
are recorded in investment income (expense) as gains (losses) on derivative instruments. Warrants
that do not have contractual net settlement provisions are recorded at cost. The recorded values of
the warrants in other current assets were $1 million and $4 million at September 25, 2005 and
September 26, 2004, respectively.

The Company may enter into foreign currency forward and option contracts to hedge certain
foreign currency transactions and probable anticipated foreign currency transactions. Gains and
losses arising from foreign currency forward and option contracts that are not designated as
hedging instruments are recorded in investment income (expense) as gains (losses) on derivative
instruments. Gains and losses arising from the effective portion of foreign currency forward and
option contracts that are designated as cash-flow hedging instruments are recorded in accumulated
other comprehensive income as gains (losses) on derivative instruments. The amounts are
subsequently reclassified into revenues in the same period in which the underlying transactions
affect the Company’s earnings. The Company had no outstanding forward contracts at September 25,
2005 and the value of the Company’s foreign currency forward contracts was insignificant at
September 26, 2004. The value of the Company’s foreign currency option contracts recorded in other
current assets was $16 million at September 25, 2005, of which all were designated as cash-flow
hedging instruments. The Company had no foreign currency option contracts outstanding at September
26, 2004.

In connection with its stock repurchase program, the Company may sell put options that require
the Company to repurchase shares of its common stock at fixed prices. In fiscal 2005 and 2004, the
premiums received from put options were recorded as other current liabilities in accordance with
Statement of Financial Standards No. 150 (FAS 150), “Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments
with Characteristics of both Liabilities and Equity.” Changes in the fair value of put options are
recorded in investment income (expense) as gains (losses) on derivative instruments. The value of
the put options recorded in other current liabilities was $7 million at September 25, 2005.
The

F-11


QUALCOMM Incorporated

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Company had no put options outstanding at September 26, 2004. In fiscal 2003, the $7
million in premiums received from put options were recorded as paid-in capital in accordance with
EITF Issue No. 00-19, “Accounting for Derivative Instruments Indexed to, and Potentially Settled
in, a Company’s Own Stock,” which was subsequently amended by FAS 150.

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets.

Goodwill represents the excess of purchase price and
related costs over the value assigned to the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets of
businesses acquired. Goodwill is tested annually for impairment and in interim periods if certain
events occur indicating that the carrying value of goodwill may be impaired. The Company completed
its annual testing for fiscal 2005, 2004 and 2003 and determined that its recorded goodwill was not
impaired.

Software development costs are capitalized when a product’s technological feasibility has been
established through the date a product is available for general release to customers. Software
development costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated economic life of the
software, ranging from less than one year to four years, taking into account such factors as the
effects of obsolescence, technological advances and competition. The weighted-average amortization
period for capitalized software was one year at both September 25, 2005 and September 26, 2004.
Other intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over their useful lives, ranging
from less than one year to 28 years.

Weighted-average amortization periods for finite lived intangible assets, by class, were as
follows:

Changes in the weighted-average amortization periods from fiscal 2004 to 2005 resulted from
additions to intangible assets related to acquisitions (Note 11).

Valuation of Long-Lived and Intangible Assets.

The Company assesses potential impairments to
its long-lived assets when there is evidence that events or changes in circumstances indicate that
the carrying amount of an asset may not be recovered. An impairment loss is recognized when the
carrying amount of the long-lived asset is not recoverable and exceeds its fair value. The carrying
amount of a long-lived asset is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash
flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset. Any required
impairment loss is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of a long-lived asset
exceeds its fair value and is recorded as a reduction in the carrying value of the related asset
and a charge to operating results.

Litigation.

The Company is currently involved in certain legal proceedings. The Company
estimates the range of liability related to pending litigation where the amount and range of loss
can be estimated. The Company records its best estimate of a loss when the loss is considered
probable. Where a liability is probable and there is a range of estimated loss with no best
estimate in the range, the Company records the minimum estimated liability related to the claim. As
additional information becomes available, the Company assesses the potential liability related to
the Company’s pending litigation and revises its estimates.

Share-Based Compensation.

The Company records compensation expense for employee stock options
based upon their intrinsic value on the date of grant pursuant to Accounting Principles Board
Opinion 25 (APB 25), “Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees.” Because the Company establishes
the exercise price based on the fair market value of the Company’s stock at the date of grant, the
stock options have no intrinsic value upon grant, and
therefore no expense is recorded. Each quarter, the Company reports the potential dilutive
impact of share-based payments in its diluted earnings per common share using the treasury-stock
method. Out-of-the-money stock options (i.e., the average stock price during the period is below
the strike price of the stock option) are not included in diluted earnings per common share as
their effect is anti-dilutive.

The Black-Scholes option-pricing model was developed for use in estimating the fair value
of traded options that have no restrictions and are fully transferable and negotiable in a free
trading market. This model does not consider the employment, transfer or vesting restrictions that
are inherent in the Company’s employee stock options or purchase rights granted pursuant to the
Employee Stock Purchase Plans. Use of an option valuation model, as required by FAS 123, includes
highly subjective assumptions based on long-term predictions, including the expected stock price
volatility and average life of each stock option grant. Because the Company’s share-based payments
have characteristics significantly different from those of freely traded options, and because
changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect the Company’s estimate of the
fair values, in the Company’s opinion, existing valuation models may not be reliable single
measures of the fair values of the Company’s share-based payments. The Black-Scholes weighted
average estimated fair values of stock options granted during fiscal 2005, 2004 and 2003 were
$14.80, $13.92 and $9.67 per share, respectively. The Black-Scholes weighted average estimated fair
values of purchase rights granted pursuant to the Employee Stock Purchase Plans during fiscal 2005,
2004 and 2003 were $8.76, $7.53 and $4.80 per share, respectively.

For purposes of pro forma disclosures, the estimated fair value of share-based payments is
assumed to be amortized to expense over their vesting periods. The pro forma effects of recognizing
compensation expense under the fair value method on net income and net earnings per common share
were as follows (in millions, except for earnings per common share):

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Foreign Currency.

Foreign subsidiaries operating in a local currency environment use the
local currency as the functional currency. Assets and liabilities are translated to United States
dollars at the exchange rate in effect at the balance sheet date; revenues, expenses, gains and
losses are translated at rates of exchange that approximate the rates in effect at the transaction
date. Resulting translation gains or losses are recognized as a component of other comprehensive
income. The functional currency of the Company’s foreign investees that do not use local currencies
is the United States dollar. Where the United States dollar is the functional currency, the
monetary assets and liabilities are translated into United States dollars at the exchange rate in
effect at the balance sheet date. Revenues, expenses, gains and losses associated with the monetary
assets and liabilities are translated at the rates of exchange that approximate the rates in effect
at the transaction date. Non-monetary assets and liabilities and related elements of revenues,
expenses, gains and losses are translated at historical rates. Resulting translation gains or
losses of these foreign investees are recognized in the statements of operations.

During fiscal 2005, net foreign currency transaction gains included in the Company’s statement
of operations were $1 million. During fiscal 2004, net foreign currency transaction losses included
in the Company’s statements of operations were $1 million. During fiscal 2003, net foreign currency
transaction gains and losses included in the Company’s statements of operations were insignificant.

Comprehensive Income.

Comprehensive income is defined as the change in equity of a business
enterprise during a period from transactions and other events and circumstances from non-owner
sources, including foreign currency translation adjustments and unrealized gains and losses on
marketable securities. The Company presents comprehensive income in its consolidated statements of
stockholders’ equity.

The reclassification adjustment for other-than-temporary losses on marketable securities
results from the recognition of unrealized losses in the statement of operations due to declines in
the market prices of those securities deemed to be other than temporary. The reclassification
adjustment for net realized gains results from the recognition of the net realized gains in the
statement of operations when the marketable securities are sold.

Components of accumulated other comprehensive income consisted of the following (in millions):

Stock Split.

On July 13, 2004, the Company announced a two-for-one stock split in the
form of a stock dividend. Stock was distributed on August 13, 2004 to stockholders of record as of
July 23, 2004. Stockholders’ equity has been restated to give retroactive recognition to the stock
split for all periods presented by reclassifying the par value of the additional shares arising
from the split from paid-in capital to common stock. All references in the financial statements and
notes to number of shares and per share amounts reflect the stock split.

Earnings Per Common Share.

Basic earnings per common share is computed by dividing net income
by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the reporting period. Diluted
earnings per common share is computed by dividing net income by the combination of dilutive common
share equivalents, comprised of shares issuable under the Company’s share-based compensation plans
and shares subject to written put options, and the weighted average number of common shares
outstanding during the reporting period. The incremental dilutive common share equivalents,
calculated using the treasury stock method, for fiscal 2005, 2004 and 2003 were approximately
56,127,000, 58,686,000 and 56,338,000, respectively.

Employee stock options to purchase approximately 33,660,000, 40,221,000 and 86,540,000 shares
of common stock during fiscal 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively, were outstanding but not included
in the computation of diluted earnings per common share because the option exercise price was
greater than the average market price of the common stock, and therefore, the effect on dilutive
earnings per common share would be anti-dilutive. Put options

QUALCOMM Incorporated

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

outstanding during fiscal 2005 and
2004 to purchase a weighted-average of 13,000,000 and 3,000,000 shares of common stock,
respectively, were not included in the earnings per common share computation for fiscal 2005 and
2004 because the put options’ exercise prices were less than the average market price of the common
stock while they were outstanding, and therefore, the effect on diluted earnings per common share
would be anti-dilutive (Note 7).

Future Accounting Requirements.

In December 2004, the FASB revised Statement No. 123 (FAS
123R), “Share-Based Payment,” which requires companies to expense the estimated fair value of
employee stock options and similar awards. On April 14, 2005, the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission adopted a new rule amending the compliance dates for FAS 123R. In accordance with the
new rule, the accounting provisions of FAS 123R will be effective for the Company beginning in the
first quarter of fiscal 2006. The Company tentatively expects to adopt the provisions of FAS 123R
using a modified prospective application. FAS 123R, which provides certain changes to the method
for valuing share-based compensation among other changes, will apply to new awards and to awards
that are outstanding on the effective date and are subsequently modified or cancelled. Compensation
expense for outstanding awards for which the requisite service had not been rendered as of the
effective date will be recognized over the remaining service period using the compensation cost
calculated for pro forma disclosure purposes under FAS 123. At September 25, 2005, unamortized
compensation expense related to outstanding unvested options, as determined in accordance with FAS
123, that the Company expects to record during fiscal 2006 was approximately $394 million before
income taxes. The Company will incur additional expense during fiscal 2006 related to new awards
granted during 2006 that cannot yet be quantified. The Company is in the process of determining how
the guidance regarding valuing share-based compensation as prescribed in FAS 123R will be applied
to valuing share-based awards granted after the effective date and the impact that the recognition
of compensation expense related to such awards will have on its financial statements.

Investment Grade Debt Securities

.

The Company’s investments in investment grade debt
securities consist primarily of investments in certificates of deposit, U.S. Treasury securities,
government-sponsored enterprise securities, foreign government bonds, mortgage- and asset-backed
securities and corporate bonds and notes. The unrealized losses on the Company’s investments in
investment grade debt securities were caused by interest rate increases. Due to the fact that the
decline in market value is attributable to changes in interest rates and not credit quality, and
because the severity and duration of the unrealized losses were not significant, the Company
considered these unrealized losses to be temporary at September 25, 2005.

Non-Investment Grade Debt Securities.

The Company’s investments in non-investment grade debt
securities consist primarily of investments in corporate bonds. The unrealized losses on the
Company’s investment in non-investment grade debt securities were caused by credit quality and
industry or company specific events. Because the severity and duration of the unrealized losses
were not significant, the Company considered these unrealized losses to be temporary at September
25, 2005.

Marketable Equity Securities.

The Company’s investments in marketable equity securities
consist primarily of investments in common stock of large companies and equity mutual funds. The
unrealized losses on the Company’s investment in marketable equity securities were caused by
overall equity market volatility and industry specific events. The duration and severity of the
unrealized losses in relation to the carrying amounts of the individual investments were consistent
with typical equity market volatility. Current market forecasts support a recovery of fair value up
to (or beyond) the cost of the investment within a reasonable period of time. Accordingly, the
Company considered these unrealized losses to be temporary at September 25, 2005.

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets.

The Company’s reportable segment assets do not include
goodwill (Note 10). The Company allocates goodwill to its reporting units for annual testing
purposes. Goodwill was allocable to reporting units included in the Company’s reportable segments
at September 25, 2005 as follows: $298 million in QUALCOMM CDMA Technologies, $73 million in
QUALCOMM Technology Licensing, $72 million in QUALCOMM Wireless & Internet, and $128 million in
QUALCOMM MEMS Technology (a nonreportable segment included in reconciling items in Note 10). The
increase in goodwill from September 26, 2004 to September 25, 2005 was the result of the Company’s
business acquisitions (Note 11), partially offset by currency translation adjustments.

Wireless licenses increased as a result of the Company’s acquisition of additional 700MHz
spectrum in the United States during fiscal 2005 for its MediaFLO USA business (Note 10). Increases
in other intangible asset categories primarily resulted from acquisitions during fiscal 2005 (Note
11).

All of the Company’s purchased intangible assets other than certain wireless licenses in the
amount of $84 million and goodwill are subject to amortization. Amortization expense from
continuing operations for fiscal 2005, 2004 and 2003 was $19 million, $17 million and $18 million,
respectively. Amortization expense related to these intangible assets is expected to be $22 million
in fiscal 2006, $19 million in fiscal 2007, $16 million in fiscal 2008, $15 million in fiscal 2009
and $14 million in fiscal 2010.

Capitalized software development costs, which are included in other assets, were $43 million
and $44 million at September 25, 2005 and September 26, 2004, respectively. Accumulated
amortization on capitalized software was $42 million and $39 million at September 25, 2005 and
September 26, 2004, respectively. Amortization expense from continuing operations related to
capitalized software for fiscal 2005, 2004 and 2003 was $4 million, $13 million and $12 million,
respectively.

Note 4. Investments in Other Entities

Inquam Limited.

Since October 2000, the Company and another investor (the Other Investor) have
provided equity and debt funding to Inquam Limited (Inquam). Inquam owns, develops and manages
wireless CDMA-based communications systems, either directly or indirectly, primarily in Romania and
Portugal. The Company recorded $33 million in equity in losses of Inquam during fiscal 2005, as
compared to $59 million and $99 million for fiscal 2004 and 2003, respectively. At September 25,
2005 and September 26, 2004, the Company’s equity and debt investments in Inquam
totaled $26 million and $42 million, respectively, net of equity in
losses. The Company had no remaining funding commitment under its
bridge loan agreement at September 25, 2005.

During fiscal 2005, Inquam secured new long-term financing (the new facilities). The Company
and the Other Investor each guaranteed 50% of a portion of the amounts owed under certain of the
new facilities, up to a combined maximum of $54 million. Amounts outstanding under the new
facilities subject to the guarantee totaled $49 million as of September 25, 2005. The guarantee
expires and the new facilities mature on December 25, 2011.

F-19


QUALCOMM Incorporated

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

In October 2005, the Company and the Other Investor agreed to restructure Inquam. Upon close
of the restructuring, which is expected to occur in the first half of fiscal 2006, the Portugal
companies will be spun-off
through the exchange of portions of the Company’s and the Other Investor’s debt investments
for direct equity interests in the Portugal companies. Inquam, which will continue to own the
Romania companies, will repurchase certain minority equity interests. Immediately after the
restructuring, the Company will hold an approximate 49.7% equity interest in Inquam and a 23%
equity interest in the Portugal companies, which is expected to be reduced over time as the Other
Investor makes the further investments in the Portugal companies contemplated by the restructuring
agreements. In addition, the Company and the Other Investor will have a put-call option
arrangement. Under this arrangement, the Other Investor will have the right to buy the Company’s
equity and debt investments in Inquam, subject to certain conditions, by exercising its call
option, which will expire no later than May 14, 2008. The minimum purchase price will be
approximately $66 million. In the event that the Other Investor’s call option expires,
or in certain other circumstances prior to that date, the Company will have the right to sell
our equity and debt investments in Inquam to the Other Investor at a minimum sales price of $66
million. Such right will expire after six months. The Company does not anticipate providing any
further funding to Inquam or to the Portugal companies.

respectively, accounted for using the cost method. Differences between the carrying amounts of
certain other strategic equity method investments and the Company’s underlying equity in the net
assets of those investees were not significant at September 25, 2005 and September 26, 2004. At
September 25, 2005, effective ownership interests in these investees ranged from approximately 7%
to 50%.

Funding commitments related to these investments totaled $13 million at September 25, 2005,
which the Company expects to fund through fiscal 2009. Such commitments are subject to the
investees meeting certain conditions; actual equity funding may be in lesser amounts. An investee’s
failure to successfully develop and provide competitive products and services due to lack of
financing, market demand or an unfavorable economic environment could adversely affect the value of
the Company’s investment in the investee. There can be no assurance that the investees will be
successful in their efforts.

The Company has not provided for United States income taxes and foreign withholding taxes
on a cumulative total of approximately $1.2 billion of undistributed earnings from certain
non-United States subsidiaries indefinitely invested outside the United States. Should the Company
repatriate foreign earnings, the Company would have to adjust the income tax provision in the
period management determined that the Company would repatriate the earnings. On October 22, 2004,
the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (the Jobs Creation Act) was signed into law. The Jobs
Creation Act created a temporary incentive for corporations in the United States to repatriate
accumulated income earned abroad by providing an 85 percent dividends received deduction for
certain dividends from controlled foreign corporations. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005, the
Company repatriated approximately $0.5 billion of foreign earnings qualifying for the special
incentive under the Jobs Creation Act and recorded a related expense of approximately $35 million
for federal and state income tax liabilities. This distribution does not change the Company’s
intention to indefinitely reinvest undistributed earnings of certain of its foreign subsidiaries in
operations outside the United States.

valuation allowance on net capital losses of $62 million. The valuation allowance related to
capital losses reflects the uncertainty surrounding the Company’s ability to generate sufficient
capital gains to utilize all capital losses.

Deferred tax assets, net of valuation allowance, decreased by approximately $142 million from
September 26, 2004 to September 25, 2005 primarily due to the use of tax credits as a result of
continued profitable operations in excess of tax benefits from stock option expense, partially
offset by a decrease in the valuation allowance related to capital loss carryover.

At September 25, 2005 and September 26, 2004, the Company had federal, state and foreign taxes
payable of approximately $69 million and $27 million, respectively, included in other current
liabilities.

At September 25, 2005, the Company had unused federal and state income tax credits of $670
million and $93 million, respectively, generally expiring from 2006 through 2024. The Company does
not expect these credits to expire unused.

Cash amounts paid for income taxes, net of refunds received, were $168 million, $127 million
and $125 million for fiscal 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The income taxes paid primarily
relate to foreign withholding taxes.

Note 7. Capital Stock

Preferred Stock.

The Company has 8,000,000 shares of preferred stock authorized for issuance
in one or more series, at a par value of $0.0001 per share. In conjunction with the distribution of
preferred share purchase rights, 4,000,000 shares of preferred stock are designated as Series A
Junior Participating Preferred Stock and such shares are reserved for issuance upon exercise of the
preferred share purchase rights. At September 25, 2005 and September 26, 2004, no shares of
preferred stock were outstanding.

Preferred Share Purchase Rights Agreement.

The Company has a Preferred Share Purchase Rights
Agreement (Rights Agreement) to protect stockholders’ interests in the event of a proposed takeover
of the Company. Under the original Rights Agreement, adopted on September 26, 1995, the Company
declared a dividend of one preferred share purchase right (a Right) for each share of the Company’s
common stock outstanding. Pursuant to the Rights Agreement, as amended and restated on September
26, 2005, each Right entitles the registered holder to purchase from the Company a one
one-thousandth share of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock, $0.0001 par value per share,
subject to adjustment for subsequent stock splits, at a purchase price of $180. The Rights are
exercisable only if a person or group (an Acquiring Person) acquires beneficial ownership of 15% or
more of the Company’s outstanding shares of common stock without Board approval. Upon exercise,
holders, other than an Acquiring Person, will have the right, subject to termination, to receive
the Company’s common stock or other securities, cash or other assets having a market value, as
defined, equal to twice such purchase price. The Rights, which expire on September 25, 2015, are
redeemable in whole, but not in part, at the Company’s option prior to the time such rights are
triggered for a price of $0.001 per Right.

Stock Repurchase Program.

On March 8, 2005, the Company authorized the repurchase of up to $2
billion of the Company’s common stock under a program with no expiration date. During fiscal 2005,
the Company repurchased and retired 27,083,000 shares of common stock for $953 million and sold put
options under this program. At September 25, 2005, the Company had two outstanding put options,
with expiration dates of December 7, 2005 and March 21, 2006, that may require the Company to
purchase 11,500,000 shares of its common stock upon exercise for $411 million (net of the option
premiums received). Any shares repurchased upon exercise of the put options will be retired. The
recorded values of the put option liabilities totaled $7 million at September 25, 2005. During
fiscal 2005, the Company recognized $16 million in investment income due to decreases in the fair
values of the put options and $15 million in investment income from premiums received on a put
option that expired unexercised. At September 25, 2005, $636 million remained authorized for
repurchases under this program.

On February 10, 2003, the Company had authorized the repurchase of up to $1 billion of the
Company’s common stock over a two-year period. The Company did not repurchase any of the Company’s
common stock under this program during fiscal 2004; however, the Company did sell put options. The
Company repurchased all of the put options during fiscal 2004. The net gain recorded in investment
income during fiscal 2004 related to the put options, including premiums received, was $5 million.

QUALCOMM Incorporated

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

During fiscal 2003, the Company repurchased and retired 9,831,000 shares of common stock for
$166 million and sold put options. The put options expired worthless during fiscal 2003. The $7
million in premiums received from the put options were recorded as paid-in capital.

Dividends.

On March 2, 2004, the Company announced an increase in its quarterly dividend from
$0.035 to $0.050 per share on common stock. On July 13, 2004, the Company announced an increase in
its quarterly dividend
from $0.050 to $0.070 per share on common stock. On March 8, 2005, the Company announced an

Note 8. Employee Benefit Plans

Employee Savings and Retirement Plan.

The Company has a 401(k) plan that allows eligible
employees to contribute up to 50% of their eligible compensation, subject to annual limits. The
Company matches a portion of the employee contributions and may, at its discretion, make additional
contributions based upon earnings. The Company’s contribution expense for fiscal 2005, 2004 and
2003 was $27 million, $21 million and $20 million, respectively.

Stock Option Plans.

The Company may grant options to selected employees, directors and
consultants to the Company to purchase shares of the Company’s common stock at a price not less
than the fair market value of the stock at the date of grant. The 2001 Stock Option Plan (the 2001
Plan) was adopted and replaced the 1991 Stock Option Plan (the 1991 Plan), which expired in August
2001. Options granted under the 1991 Plan remain outstanding until exercised or cancelled. The
shares reserved under the 2001 Plan were equal to the number of shares available for future grant
under the 1991 Plan on the date the 2001 Plan was approved by the Company’s stockholders. At that
date, approximately 101,083,000 shares were available for future grants under the 2001 Plan. In
fiscal 2004, the Company reserved another 64,000,000 shares for future grants under the 2001 Plan.
The Company may terminate the 2001 Plan at any time. The 2001 Plan provides for the grant of both
incentive stock options and non-qualified stock options. Generally, options outstanding vest over
five years and are exercisable for up to 10 years from the grant date. At September 25, 2005,
options for approximately 120,298,000 shares under both plans were exercisable at prices ranging
from $1.93 to $86.19 per share for an aggregate exercise price of $2.6 billion.

The 2001 Non-Employee Directors’ Stock Option Plan (the 2001 Directors’ Plan) was adopted and
replaced the 1998 Non-Employee Directors’ Stock Option Plan (the 1998 Directors’ Plan). Options
granted under the 1998 Directors’ Plan remain outstanding until exercised or cancelled. The shares
reserved under the 2001 Directors’ Plan are equal to the number of shares available for future
grant under the 1998 Directors’ Plan on the date the 2001
Directors’ Plan was approved by the Company’s stockholders. At that date, 4,100,000 shares
were available for future grants under the 2001 Directors’ Plan. The Company may terminate the 2001
Directors’ Plan at any time. This plan provides for non-qualified stock options to be granted to
non-employee directors at fair market value, vesting over periods not exceeding five years and are
exercisable for up to 10 years from the grant date. At September 25, 2005, options for
approximately 3,393,000 shares under both plans were exercisable at prices ranging from $2.91 to
$66.50 per share for an aggregate exercise price of $35 million.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

In fiscal 2005, the Company assumed 723,000 and 42,000 of the outstanding stock options under
the Iridigm Display Corporation 2000 Stock Plan and the Spike Technologies, Inc. 1998 Stock Option
Plan, respectively, related
to those acquisitions (Note 11). Both plans expired on the dates of the acquisitions, and no
additional shares may be granted under those plans. Both incentive stock options and non-qualified
stock options are outstanding under both plans. Generally, options outstanding vest over periods
not exceeding five years and are exercisable for up to 10 years from the grant date. At September
25, 2005, options for approximately 559,000 shares under both plans were exercisable at prices
ranging from $0.09 to $38.48 per share for an aggregate purchase price of $16 million.

Employee Stock Purchase Plans.

The Company has two employee stock purchase plans for all
eligible employees to purchase shares of common stock at 85% of the lower of the fair market value
on the first or the last day of each six-month offering period. Employees may authorize the Company
to withhold up to 15% of their compensation during any offering period, subject to certain
limitations. The 2001 Employee Stock Purchase Plan authorizes up to approximately 24,309,000 shares
to be granted. The 1996 Non-Qualified Employee Stock Purchase Plan authorizes up to 400,000 shares
to be granted. During fiscal 2005, 2004 and 2003, approximately 1,786,000, 2,205,000 and 2,744,000
shares were issued under the plans at an average price of $29.63, $18.60 and $13.20 per share,
respectively. At September 25, 2005, approximately 15,446,000 shares were reserved for future
issuance.

Executive Retirement Plans.

The Company has voluntary retirement plans that allow eligible
executives to defer up to 100% of their income on a pre-tax basis. On a quarterly basis, the
Company matches up to 10% of the participants’ deferral in Company common stock based on the
then-current market price, to be distributed to the participant upon eligible retirement. The
income deferred and the Company match held in trust are unsecured and
subject to the claims of general creditors of the Company. Company contributions begin vesting
based on certain minimum participation or service requirements and are fully vested at age 65.
Participants who terminate employment forfeit their unvested shares. All shares forfeited are used
to reduce the Company’s future matching
contributions. The plans authorize up to 1,600,000 shares to be allocated to participants at
any time. During fiscal 2005, 2004 and 2003, approximately 92,000, 108,000 and 89,000 shares,
respectively, were allocated under the plans. The Company recorded $3 million, $5 million and $2
million in compensation expense during fiscal 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively, related to its net
matching contributions to the plans. At September 25, 2005, approximately 238,000 shares were
reserved for future allocation.

Litigation

Durante, et al v. QUALCOMM

: On February 2, 2000, three former employees filed a putative class
action against the Company, alleging unlawful age discrimination in their selection for layoff in
1999, and seeking monetary damages based thereon. On June 18, 2003, the Court ordered
decertification of the class and dismissed all remaining claims of the plaintiffs. On August 1,
2005, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the judgment in favor of the Company. On June 20,
2003, 76 of the opt-in plaintiffs filed, but did not serve, a new action in the same court,
alleging violations of the Age Discrimination in Employment Act as a result of their layoffs in
1999. All plaintiffs have now dismissed all remaining claims in exchange for the Company’s
agreement not to seek litigation costs against them.

Zoltar Satellite Alarm Systems, Inc. v. QUALCOMM, Inc. and SnapTrack, Inc.

: On March 30, 2001,
Zoltar Satellite Alarm Systems, Inc. filed suit against QUALCOMM and its subsidiary SnapTrack, Inc.
in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California seeking monetary
damages and injunctive relief based on the alleged infringement of three patents. Following a
verdict and finding of no infringement of Zoltar’s patent claims, the Court entered a judgment in
favor of the Company and SnapTrack on Zoltar’s complaint and awarded the Company and SnapTrack
their costs of suit. Zoltar filed a notice of appeal, and the Company and SnapTrack filed a
responsive notice and motion to dismiss. Zoltar’s appeal was dismissed and the issue of reaching a
final judgment on issues aside from non-infringement is pending before the district court.

QUALCOMM Incorporated v. Maxim Integrated Products, Inc.:

On December 2, 2002, the Company
filed an action in the United States District Court for the Southern District of California against
Maxim alleging infringement of three patents and seeking monetary damages and injunctive relief
based thereon. The Company amended the complaint, bringing the total number of patents at issue to
four and adding misappropriation of trade secret and unfair competition claims. Maxim
counterclaimed against the Company, alleging antitrust violations, patent misuse and unfair
competition seeking monetary damages and injunctive relief based thereon. On May 5, 2004, the Court
granted Maxim’s motion that no indirect infringement arose in connection with defendants’ sales of
certain products to certain licensees of the Company. A motion by the Company for preliminary
injunction regarding the alleged trade secret misappropriations by Maxim was heard on January 4,
2005. The Court found that Maxim had acted unlawfully by misappropriating the Company’s trade
secrets and issued an injunction order prohibiting further misappropriation and requiring Maxim to
notify customers of the order. Maxim has sought appellate review of the injunction order.

Whale Telecom Ltd v. QUALCOMM Incorporated:

On November 15, 2004, Whale Telecom Ltd. sued the
Company in the New York State Supreme Court, County of New York, seeking monetary damages based on
the claim that the Company fraudulently induced it to enter into certain infrastructure services
agreements in 1999 and later interfered with their performance of those agreements.

Broadcom Corporation v. QUALCOMM Incorporated:

On May 18, 2005, Broadcom filed two actions in
the United States District Court for the Central District of California against the Company
alleging infringement of ten patents and seeking monetary damages and injunctive relief based
thereon. On the same date, Broadcom also filed a complaint in the United States International Trade
Commission (ITC) alleging infringement of five of the same patents at issue in the Central District
Court cases seeking a determination and relief under Section 337 of the Tariff Act of 1930. On July
1, 2005, Broadcom filed an action in the United States District Court for the District of New
Jersey against the Company alleging violations of state and federal antitrust and unfair
competition laws as well as
common law claims, generally relating to licensing and chip sales activities, seeking monetary
damages and injunctive relief based thereon. Discovery has commenced in the actions.

QUALCOMM Incorporated v. Broadcom Corporation:

On July 11, 2005, the Company filed an action
in the United States District Court for the Southern District of California against Broadcom
alleging infringement of seven patents, each of which is essential to the practice of either the
GSM or 802.11 standards, and seeking monetary
damages and injunctive relief based thereon. On September 23, 2005, Broadcom answered and
counterclaimed, alleging infringement of six patents. Discovery has yet to begin in the action.

QUALCOMM Incorporated v. Broadcom Corporation:

On October 14, 2005, the Company filed an

alleging infringement of two patents, each of which relates to video encoding and decoding for
high-end multimedia processing, and seeking monetary damages and injunctive relief based thereon.
Broadcom has yet to answer.

Other:

The Company has been named, along with many other manufacturers of wireless phones,
wireless operators and industry-related organizations, as a defendant in purported class action
lawsuits, including In re Wireless Telephone Frequency Emissions Products Liability Litigation,
United States District Court for the District of Maryland, and several individually filed actions,
seeking monetary damages arising out of its sale of cellular phones. On March 5, 2003, the Court
granted the defendants’ motions to dismiss five of the consolidated cases (Pinney, Gimpleson,
Gillian, Farina and Naquin) on the grounds that the claims were preempted by federal law. On March
21, 2005, the 4

th

Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the ruling by the District Court and
ordered the cases remanded to state court. All remaining cases filed against the Company allege
personal injury as a result of their use of a wireless telephone. Those cases have been remanded to
the Washington, D.C. Superior Court. The courts that have reviewed similar claims against other
companies to date have held that there was insufficient scientific basis for the plaintiffs’ claims
in those cases.

On October 28, 2005, it was reported that six telecommunications companies (Broadcom, Nokia,
Texas Instruments, NEC, Panasonic and Ericsson) filed complaints with the European Commission,
alleging that the Company violated European Union competition law in its WCDMA licensing practices.
To date, the Company has not been formally served with the complaints.

Although there can be no assurance that unfavorable outcomes in any of the foregoing matters
would not have a material adverse effect on the Company’s operating results, liquidity or financial
position, the Company believes the claims made by other parties are without merit and will
vigorously defend the actions. The Company has not recorded any accrual for contingent liability
associated with the legal proceedings described above based on the Company’s belief that a
liability, while possible, is not probable. Further, any possible range of loss cannot be estimated
at this time. The Company is engaged in numerous other legal actions arising in the ordinary course
of its business and believes that the ultimate outcome of these actions will not have a material
adverse effect on its operating results, liquidity or financial position. In addition, some matters
that have previously been disclosed may no longer be described in this Note because of rulings in
the case, settlements, changes in the Company’s business or other developments rendering them, in
the Company’s judgment, no longer material to the Company’s operating results, liquidity or
financial position.

Long-Term Financing.

The Company agreed to provide certain CDMA customers of
Telefonaktiebolaget LM Ericsson (Ericsson) with long-term interest bearing debt financing for the
purchase of equipment and/or services. At September 25, 2005, the Company had a commitment to
extend up to $118 million in long-term financing to certain CDMA customers of Ericsson. The funding
of this commitment, if it occurs, is not subject to a fixed expiration date and is subject to the
CDMA customers meeting conditions prescribed in the financing arrangement and, in certain cases, to
Ericsson also financing a portion of such sales and services. Financing under this arrangement is
generally collateralized by the related equipment. The commitment represents the maximum amount to
be financed; actual financing may be in lesser amounts.

Operating Leases.

The Company leases certain of its facilities and equipment under
noncancelable operating leases, with terms ranging from less than 1 year to 26 years and with
provisions for cost-of-living increases for certain leases. Rental expense for fiscal 2005, 2004
and 2003 was $39 million, $31 million and $34 million,
respectively. Future minimum lease payments in each of the next five years from fiscal 2006
through 2010 are $67 million, $51 million, $24 million and $16 million, and $13 million
respectively, and $22 million thereafter.

Purchase Obligations.

The Company has agreements with suppliers and other parties to purchase
inventory, other goods and services and long-lived assets and estimates its noncancelable
obligations under these agreements for fiscal 2006 to 2009 to be approximately $750 million, $200
million, $86 million and $6 million, respectively. The Company’s noncancelable obligations are
insignificant in fiscal 2010. Of these amounts, commitments to purchase integrated circuit product
inventories for fiscal 2006 to 2009 comprised $634 million, $177 million, $82 million and $5
million, respectively.

segment presentation.

The Company evaluates the performance of its segments based on earnings (loss) before income
taxes (EBT) from continuing operations, excluding certain impairment and other charges that are not
allocated to the segments for management reporting purposes. EBT includes the allocation of certain
corporate expenses to the segments, including depreciation and amortization expense related to
unallocated corporate assets. Segment data includes intersegment revenues.

Segment assets are comprised of accounts receivable and inventory for QCT, QTL and QWI. The
QSI segment assets include certain marketable securities, accounts receivable, finance receivables,
notes receivable, wireless licenses, other investments and all assets of consolidated investees.
Total segment assets differ from total assets on a consolidated basis as a result of unallocated
corporate assets primarily comprised of cash, cash equivalents, certain marketable securities,
property, plant and equipment, deferred tax assets, goodwill and certain other intangible assets.
The net book value of long-lived assets located outside of the United States was $44 million, $21
million and $117 million at September 25, 2005, September 26, 2004 and September 28, 2003,
respectively. Long-lived assets located outside of the United States were primarily in Brazil at
September 28, 2003 and related to discontinued operations (Note 12). The net book value of
long-lived assets located in the United States was $978 million, $654 million and $505 million at
September 25, 2005, September 26, 2004 and September 28, 2003, respectively.

QSI assets included $89 million, $106 million and $116 million related to investments in
equity method investees at September 25, 2005, September 26, 2004 and September 28, 2003,
respectively.

Generally, revenues between segments are based on prevailing market rates for
substantially similar products and services or an approximation thereof. Certain charges are
allocated to the corporate functional department in the Company’s management reports based on the
decision that those charges should not be used to evaluate the segments’ operating performance.
Unallocated charges include certain investment income and research and development expenses and
marketing expenses related to the development of the CDMA market that were not deemed to be
directly related to the businesses of the segments.

Note 11. Acquisitions

During fiscal 2005, the Company acquired the following four entities for a total cost of $295
million, which was paid primarily in cash:

•

Iridigm Display Corporation (Iridigm), a California-based display technology company.

•

Trigenix Limited, a United Kingdom-based developer of user interfaces for mobile phones.

•

Spike Technologies, Inc., a semiconductor design services company based primarily in India.

•

ELATA, Ltd., a United Kingdom-based developer of mobile content delivery and device management software systems.

An additional $4 million in consideration is payable in cash through November 2006 if certain
performance and other milestones are reached. Goodwill recognized in those transactions amounted to
$216 million, of which $81 million is expected to be deductible for tax purposes. Goodwill was
assigned to the QMT, QIS and QCT segments in the amounts of $128 million, $81 million and $7
million, respectively. Technology-based intangible assets recognized in the amount of $36 million
have a weighted-average useful life of seven years.

On August 11, 2005, the Company announced its intention to acquire all of the outstanding
capital stock of Flarion Technologies, Inc. (Flarion), a privately held developer of Orthogonal
Frequency Division Multiplexing Access (OFDMA) technology. Upon completion of the acquisition,
which is anticipated in the first half of fiscal 2006, pending regulatory approval and other
customary closing conditions, the Company estimates that it will pay approximately $545 million in
consideration, consisting of approximately $272 million in shares of QUALCOMM stock, $235 million
in cash, and the exchange of Flarion’s existing vested options and warrants with a fair value of
approximately $38 million. Upon achievement of certain agreed upon milestones on or prior to the
eighth anniversary of the close of this transaction, the Company may issue additional aggregate
consideration of $205 million, consisting of approximately $173 million payable in cash to Flarion
stockholders and $32 million in shares of QUALCOMM stock, which will be issued to Flarion option
holders and warrant holders upon or following the exercise of such options and warrants. The
acquisition of Flarion is intended to broaden the Company’s ability to effectively support
operators who may prefer an OFDMA or a hybrid OFDM/CDMA/WCDMA network alternative for
differentiating their services. The addition of Flarion’s intellectual property and engineering
resources will also supplement the resources that the Company has already dedicated over the years
towards the development of OFDM/OFDMA technologies.

Note 12. Discontinued Operations in the QSI Segment

On December 2, 2003, Embratel Participações S.A. (Embratel) acquired the Company’s direct and
indirect ownership interests in Vésper São Paulo S.A. and Vésper S.A. (the Vésper Operating
Companies), consolidated subsidiaries of the Company’s QSI segment, (the Embratel sale transaction)
for no consideration. The Vésper

F-32


QUALCOMM Incorporated

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Operating Companies’ existing communication towers and related
interests in tower site property leases (Vésper Towers) were not included in the Embratel sale
transaction, and as such, the Company effectively retained, through a new wholly-owned subsidiary
(TowerCo), ownership and control of the Vésper Towers. The Company realized a net loss of $52
million on the Embratel sale transaction during fiscal 2004, partially offset by a $40 million net
gain which resulted from the subsequent sale of TowerCo. As a result of the disposition of the
remaining operations and assets related to the Vésper Operating Companies, the Company determined that the results of
operations and cash flows related to the Vésper Operating Companies, including the results related
to TowerCo and the gains and losses realized on the Embratel and TowerCo sales transactions, should
be presented as discontinued operations in its consolidated statements of operations and cash
flows. At September 25, 2005, the Company had no remaining assets or liabilities related to the
Vésper Operating Companies or TowerCo recorded on its consolidated balance sheet. Revenues of $36
million and $123 million were reported in the loss from discontinued operations during fiscal 2004
and 2003, respectively.

Note 13. Auction Discount Voucher

The Company was awarded a $125 million Auction Discount Voucher (ADV) by the Federal
Communications Commission (FCC) in June 2000 as the result of a legal ruling. The ADV was fully
transferable and, subject to certain conditions, could be used in whole or in part by any entity in
any FCC spectrum auction over a period of three years, including those in which the Company is not
a participant.

During fiscal 2004, the Company transferred approximately $18 million of the ADV’s value to a
wireless operator for approximately $17 million in cash. As a result of this transfer, the Company
recorded an additional $17 million in other operating income in the QSI segment during fiscal 2004.
During fiscal 2004, the Company also recorded $4 million in other operating income and $4 million
in selling, general and administrative expenses in the QSI segment for cooperative marketing
expenses incurred, with no effect on net income, related to an arrangement under which a portion of
the ADV was transferred to a wireless operator prior to fiscal 2004. The Company recorded $47
million in other income in the QSI segment during fiscal 2003 related to transfers of the ADV’s
value to wireless operators.

The Company also used approximately $30 million of the ADV during fiscal 2004 as final payment
for wireless licenses granted in fiscal 2004 in which the Company was the highest bidder in a FCC
auction held during fiscal 2003. On a cumulative basis, the Company used $38 million of the ADV as
payment for these wireless licenses, for which the Company had no cost basis at September 26, 2004.
The ADV had no remaining value at September 25, 2005.

Revenues, operating income, income from continuing operations and net income are rounded to
millions each quarter. Therefore, the sum of the quarterly amounts may not equal the annual
amounts reported.

(2)

Earnings per share are computed independently for each quarter and the full year based upon
respective average shares outstanding. Therefore, the sum of the quarterly earnings per share
amounts may not equal the annual amounts reported.

(3)

Prior to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004, the Company recorded royalty revenues from
certain licensees based on estimates of royalties during the period they were earned. Starting
in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004, the Company began recognizing royalty revenues solely
based on royalties reported by licensees during the quarter (Note 1). The change in the timing
of recognizing royalty revenue was made prospectively and had the initial one-time effect of
reducing royalty revenues recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004.
