PART I

Item 1.     Business.

Ross Stores, Inc. and its subsidiaries (“we” or the “Company”) operate two chains of off-price retail apparel and home accessories stores. At February 3, 2007, there were 771 Ross Dress for Less

®

(“Ross”) locations in 27 states and Guam and 26 dd’s DISCOUNTS

®

stores in California. Both chains target value-conscious women and men between the ages of 18 and 54. Ross customers are primarily from middle income households, while the dd’s DISCOUNTS target customer is typically from lower income households. The decisions we make, from merchandising, purchasing and pricing, to the locations of our stores, are aimed at these customer bases.

Ross offers first-quality, in-season, name-brand and designer apparel, accessories, footwear and home merchandise for the entire family at everyday savings of 20% to 60% off department and specialty store regular prices. dd’s DISCOUNTS features more moderately-priced assortments of first-quality, in-season, name-brand and fashion apparel, accessories, footwear and home merchandise for the entire family at everyday savings of 20% to 70% off moderate department and discount store regular prices. We believe that both Ross and dd’s DISCOUNTS derive a competitive advantage by offering a wide assortment of product within each of our merchandise categories in organized and easy-to-shop store environments.

Our mission is to offer competitive values to our target customers by focusing on the following key strategic objectives:

Achieve an appropriate level of recognizable brands, labels and fashions at strong discounts throughout the store.

Meet customer needs on a more regional and local basis.

Deliver an in-store shopping experience that reflects the expectations of the off-price customer.

Manage real estate growth to compete effectively across all of our markets.

The original Ross Stores, Inc. was incorporated in California in 1957. In August 1982, the Company was purchased by some of our then and current directors and stockholders. In June 1989, we reincorporated in the state of Delaware. In 2004, we opened our first dd’s DISCOUNTS locations.

We refer to our fiscal years ended February 3, 2007, January 28, 2006 and January 29, 2005 as fiscal 2006, fiscal 2005, and fiscal 2004, respectively.

Merchandising, Purchasing and Pricing

We seek to provide our customers with a wide assortment of first-quality, in-season, brand-name and fashion apparel, accessories, footwear and home merchandise for the entire family at everyday savings of 20% to 60% below regular department and specialty store prices at Ross, and 20% to 70% below moderate department and discount store prices at dd’s DISCOUNTS. We sell recognizable branded merchandise that is current and fashionable in each category. New merchandise typically is received from three to five times per week at both Ross and dd’s DISCOUNTS stores. Our buyers review their merchandise assortments on a weekly basis, enabling them to respond to selling trends and purchasing opportunities in the market. Our Ross merchandising strategy is reflected in our television advertising for our Ross stores, which emphasizes a strong value message -- our customers will find great savings every day on a broad assortment of brand-name
merchandise.

Merchandising.

Our merchandising strategy incorporates a combination of off-price buying techniques to purchase advance-of-season, in-season, and past-season merchandise for both Ross and dd’s DISCOUNTS. We believe nationally recognized name brands sold at compelling discounts will continue to be an important determinant of our success. We generally leave the brand-name label on the merchandise we sell.

We have established merchandise assortments that we believe are attractive to our target customers. Although we offer fewer classifications of merchandise than most department stores, we generally offer a large selection of brand names within each classification with a wide assortment of vendors, labels, prices, colors, styles and fabrics within each size or item. Over the past several years, we have diversified our merchandise offerings by adding new product categories such as maternity, small furniture and furniture accents, educational toys and games, luggage, gourmet food and cookware, watches, sporting goods and, in select Ross stores, fine jewelry. The mix of comparable store sales by department in fiscal 2006 for Ross was approximately as follows: Ladies 33%, Home Accents and Bed and Bath 22%, Men's 15%, Fine Jewelry, Accessories, Lingerie and Fragrances 11%, Shoes 10%, and Children’s 9%.


Purchasing.

We have a combined network of approximately 6,000 vendors and manufacturers for both Ross and dd’s DISCOUNTS and believe we have adequate sources of first-quality merchandise to meet our requirements. We purchase the vast majority of our merchandise directly from manufacturers and have not experienced any difficulty in obtaining sufficient merchandise inventory.

We believe that our ability to effectively execute certain off-price buying strategies is a key factor in our success. Our buyers use a number of methods that enable us to offer our customers brand-name and fashion merchandise at strong everyday discounts relative to department and specialty stores for Ross and moderate department and discount stores for dd’s DISCOUNTS. By purchasing later in the merchandise buying cycle than department and specialty stores, we are able to take advantage of imbalances between retailers’ demand for products and manufacturers’ supply of those products.

Unlike most department and specialty stores, we typically do not require that manufacturers provide promotional and markdown allowances, return privileges, split shipments, drop shipments to stores or delayed deliveries of merchandise. For most orders, only one delivery is made to one of our four distribution centers. These flexible requirements further enable our buyers to obtain significant discounts on in-season purchases.

The vast majority of the merchandise that we offer in all of our stores is acquired through opportunistic purchases created by manufacturer overruns and canceled orders both during and at the end of a season. These buys are referred to as "close-out" and "packaway" purchases. Close-outs can be shipped to stores in-season, allowing us to get in-season goods in our stores at lower prices. Packaway merchandise is purchased with the intent that it will be stored in our warehouses until a later date, which may even be the beginning of the same selling season in the following year. Packaway purchases are an effective method of increasing the percentage of prestige and national brands at competitive savings within our merchandise assortments. Packaway merchandise is mainly fashion basics and, therefore, not usually affected by shifts in fashion trends.

In fiscal 2006, we continued our emphasis on this important sourcing strategy in response to compelling opportunities available in the marketplace. Packaway accounted for approximately 38% of total inventories as of February 3, 2007, compared to 41% at the end of the prior year. We believe the strong discounts we are able to offer on packaway merchandise are a key driver of our business.

We are currently working to improve our analytical capabilities for merchandise planning, buying and allocation through the development of new processes and systems enhancements that are expected over the next few years to address more localized customer preferences. The long-term objective of these investments is to finetune our merchandise offerings at a more local level to improve sales productivity and gross profit margins. Once fully implemented, these new analytical capabilities and systems enhancements are also expected to provide us with the tools to improve, over time, store sales productivity and profitability in both newer and existing regions and markets.

Our buying offices are located in New York City and Los Angeles, the nation's two largest apparel markets. These strategic locations allow our buyers to be in the market on a daily basis, sourcing opportunities and negotiating purchases with vendors and manufacturers. These locations also enable our buyers to strengthen vendor relationships -- a key element in the success of our off-price buying strategies.

We have a total of approximately 300 merchants for Ross and dd’s DISCOUNTS combined, although the two buying organizations are separate and distinct. These buying resources include merchandise management, buyers and assistant buyers. Ross and dd’s DISCOUNTS buyers have an average of about 13 years of experience, including merchandising positions with other retailers such as Bloomingdale's, Burlington Coat Factory, Dayton Hudson, Foot Locker, Kohl’s, Lechters, Lord & Taylor, Macy's, Marshalls, Nordstrom, Robinsons/May, Sterns, T.J. Maxx and Value City. We believe that the investment we have made over the years in our merchandise organization enables our merchants to spend more time in the market developing and nurturing relationships with a wide array of manufacturers and vendors, enhancing our ability to continue to procure the most desirable brands and fashions at competitive discounts.


Our off-price buying strategies and our experienced teams of merchants enable us to purchase Ross merchandise at net prices that are lower than prices paid by department and specialty stores and dd’s DISCOUNTS merchandise at net prices that are lower than prices paid by moderate department and discount stores.

Pricing.

Our policy is to sell brand-name merchandise at Ross that is priced 20% to 60% below most department and specialty store regular prices. At dd’s DISCOUNTS, we sell more moderate brand-name product and fashions that are priced 20% to 70% below most moderate department and discount store regular prices. Our pricing policy is reflected on the price tag displaying our selling price as well as the comparable selling price for that item in department and/or specialty stores for Ross merchandise, or in more moderate department and discount stores for dd’s DISCOUNTS merchandise.

Our pricing strategy at Ross differs from that of a department or specialty store. We purchase our merchandise at lower prices and mark it up less than a department or specialty store. This strategy enables us to offer customers consistently low prices. We review specified departments in the stores weekly for possible markdowns based on the rate of sale as well as at the end of fashion seasons to promote faster turnover of merchandise inventory and to accelerate the flow of fresh merchandise. A similar pricing strategy is in place at dd’s DISCOUNTS where prices are compared to those in moderate department and discount stores.

Stores

At February 3, 2007, we operated a total of

797 stores, of which 771 are Ross stores and 26 are dd’s DISCOUNTS stores. Our stores are conveniently located in predominantly community and neighborhood strip shopping centers in heavily populated urban and suburban areas. Where the size of the market permits, we cluster stores to maximize economies of scale in advertising, distribution and field management.

We believe a key element of our success is our organized, attractive, easy-to-shop, in-store environments at both Ross and dd’s DISCOUNTS, which allow customers to shop at their own pace. Our stores are designed for customer convenience in their merchandise presentation, dressing rooms, checkout and merchandise return areas. Each store's sales area is based on a prototype single floor design with a racetrack aisle layout. A customer can locate desired departments by signs displayed just below the ceiling of each department. We encourage our customers to select among sizes and prices through prominent category and sizing markers, promoting a self-service atmosphere. At most stores, shopping carts, baskets, and/or shopping bags are available at the entrance for customer convenience. All cash registers are centrally located at store entrances for customer ease and efficient staffing.

The Company uses point-of-sale (“POS”) hardware and software systems in all stores, which minimizes transaction time for the customer at the checkout counter by electronically scanning each ticket at the point of sale and authorizing credit for personal checks and credit cards in a matter of seconds. In addition, the POS systems allow us to accept PIN-based debit cards and electronic gift cards from customers. On a combined basis, approximately 55% of payments in fiscal 2006 and 54% of payments in 2005 were made with credit cards and debit cards. We provide cash or credit card refunds on all merchandise returned with a receipt within 30 days. Merchandise returns having a receipt older than 30 days are exchanged or credited with a credit voucher at the price on the receipt.

Operating Costs

Consistent with the other aspects of our business strategy, we strive to keep operating costs as low as possible. Among the factors which have enabled the Company to operate at low costs are:

Labor costs that generally are lower than full-price department and specialty stores due to (i) a store design that creates a self-service retail format and (ii) the utilization of labor saving technologies.

Economies of scale with respect to general and administrative costs as a result of centralized merchandising, marketing and purchasing decisions.

Flexible store layout criteria which facilitates conversion of existing buildings to our format.


Distribution

We have a total of four distribution processing facilities. We lease a 1.3 million square foot distribution center in Perris, California. We own our 1.3 million square foot distribution center in Fort Mill, South Carolina, which we purchased in 2006, our 685,000 square foot distribution center in Moreno Valley, California, which we purchased in 2005, and our 426,000 square foot distribution center located in Carlisle, Pennsylvania. We have plans for future expansion at the Moreno Valley, California, distribution center. See additional discussion in Management’s Discussion and Analysis.

In addition, we lease three separate warehouse facilities for packaway storage, two of which are located in Carlisle, Pennsylvania, totaling approximately 239,000 and 246,000 square feet, and the third in Fort Mill, South Carolina, totaling 253,000 square feet. We utilize other third-party facilities as needed for storage of packaway inventory.

In fiscal 2007 we plan to continue to invest in our distribution network by spending approximately $90 million, mainly for the expansion of our Moreno Valley facility to increase our distribution and packaway storage capacity.

We also utilize third-party cross docks to distribute merchandise to stores on a regional basis. Shipments are made by contract carriers to the stores from three to five times per week depending on location.

We believe that our existing distribution centers with their expansion capabilities will provide adequate processing capacity to support store growth into fiscal year 2008.

Information Systems

In fiscal 2006, we continued to invest in new systems and technology to provide a platform for growth over the next several years. Recent initiatives include the following:

We implemented additional enhancements to our Core Merchandising applications in order to support our continued growth. We are now in the process of implementing capabilities which we will use to enhance our new store opening process, pre-season planning, and in-season trending. We plan to roll out these enhancements over the next few years.

We introduced a new store-level Task Management System, which allows us to improve store staff productivity, better monitor and address problems and improve two-way communications between corporate personnel and personnel in the field.

We began a chain level update to our store network in order to increase communication bandwidth while decreasing monthly recurring costs. We plan to complete this network upgrade in fiscal 2007. This improvement will open the opportunity to deploy additional capabilities in the stores, to streamline internal processes and to improve operational efficiencies.

We implemented enhancements to our Transportation Management System. These improvements provided increased supply chain visibility and improved freight routing capabilities.

We implemented additional enhancements to our Warehouse Management System at all distribution centers. These improvements provided increased operational and inventory control, as well as improved transaction accountability.

Advertising

We rely primarily on television advertising to communicate the Ross value proposition -- brand-name merchandise at low everyday prices. This strategy reflects our belief that television is the most efficient and cost-effective medium for communicating everyday savings on a wide selection of brand-name bargains for both the family and home. Advertising for dd’s DISCOUNTS is primarily focused on new store grand openings.

Trademarks

have been registered with the United States Patent and Trademark Office.


Employees

As of February 3, 2007, we had approximately 35,800 total employees, including an estimated 22,500 part-time employees. Additionally, we hire temporary employees -- especially during the peak seasons. Our employees are non-union. Management considers the relationship between the Company and our employees to be good.

Competition

We believe the principal competitive factors in the off-price retail apparel and home accessories industry are offering significant discounts on brand-name merchandise, offering a well-balanced assortment appealing to our target customer, and consistently providing store environments that are convenient and easy to shop. To execute this concept, we have invested in our buying organization and developed a merchandise allocation system to distribute product based on regional factors, as well as other systems and procedures to maximize cost efficiencies and leverage expenses in an effort to mitigate competitive pressures on gross margin. We believe that we are well positioned to compete on the basis of each of these factors.

Nevertheless, the national retail apparel market is highly fragmented and competitive. We face intense competition for business from department stores, specialty stores, discount stores, warehouse stores, other off-price retailers and manufacturer-owned outlet stores, many of which are units of large national or regional chains that have substantially greater resources than we do. We also compete to some degree with retailers that sell apparel and home accessories through catalogs or over the internet. The retail apparel business may become even more competitive in the future.

dd’s DISCOUNTS

As of February 3, 2007, we operated 26 dd’s DISCOUNTS

stores. This newer off-price concept targets the needs of lower income households, which we believe to be one of the fastest growing demographic markets in the country. dd’s DISCOUNTS features a moderately-priced assortment of first-quality, in-season, name-brand and fashion apparel, accessories, footwear and home merchandise at everyday savings of 20% to 70% off moderate department and discount store regular prices. We opened ten initial locations in California during the second half of 2004, another ten stores in 2005, and six stores during fiscal 2006. This business generally has similar merchandise departments and categories to those of Ross, but features a different mix of brands, consisting mostly of moderate department store and discount store labels at lower average price points. The average dd’s
DISCOUNTS store is approximately 27,000 gross square feet and is located in an established strip shopping center in a densely populated urban or suburban neighborhood. The merchant, store and distribution organizations for dd’s DISCOUNTS and Ross are separate and distinct; however, dd’s DISCOUNTS shares certain other corporate and support services with Ross.

Item 1A.     Risk Factors.

Our Annual Report on Form 10-K for fiscal 2006, and information we provide in our Annual Report to Stockholders, press releases, telephonic reports and other investor communications, including those on our website, may contain a number of forward-looking statements with respect to anticipated future events and our projected financial performance, operations and competitive position that are subject to risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those forward-looking statements and our prior expectations and projections. Refer to Management’s Discussion and Analysis for a more complete identification and discussion of “Forward-Looking Statements.”

Our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and the performance of our common stock may be adversely affected by a number of risk factors. Risks and uncertainties that apply to both Ross and dd’s DISCOUNTS include, without limitation, the following:


We are subject to the economic and industry risks that affect large United States retailers.

Our business is exposed to the risks of a large, multi-store retailer, which must continually and efficiently obtain and distribute a supply of fresh merchandise throughout a large and growing network of stores. These risks include a number of factors, including:

An increase in the level of competitive pressures in the retail apparel or home-related merchandise industry.

Potential changes in the level of consumer spending on or preferences for apparel or home-related merchandise, including the potential impact from higher gas prices and/or lower home prices on consumer spending.

Potential changes in geopolitical and/or general economic conditions that could affect the availability of product and/or the level of consumer spending.

Unseasonable weather trends that could affect consumer demand for seasonal apparel and apparel-related products.

A change in the availability, quantity or quality of attractive brand-name merchandise at desirable discounts that could impact our ability to purchase product and continue to offer customers a wide assortment of merchandise at competitive prices.

Potential disruptions in the supply chain that could impact our ability to deliver product to our stores in a timely and cost-effective manner.

A change in the availability, quality or cost of new store real estate locations.

A downturn in the economy or a natural disaster in California or in another region where we have a concentration of stores or a distribution center. Our corporate headquarters, two distribution centers and

28% of our stores are located in California.

Potential pressure on freight costs from higher-than-expected fuel surcharges.

We are subject to operating risks as we attempt to execute our merchandising and growth strategies.

The continued success of our business depends, in part, upon our ability to increase sales at our existing store locations, and to open new stores and to operate stores on a profitable basis. Our existing strategies and store expansion programs may not result in a continuation of our anticipated revenue growth or profit growth. In executing our off-price retail strategies and working to improve our efficiency, expand our store network, and reduce our costs, we face a number of operational risks, including:

Our ability to attract and retain personnel with the retail expertise necessary to execute our strategies.

Our ability to effectively implement and operate our various supply chain, core merchandising and other information systems, including generation of all necessary data and reports for merchants, allocators and other business users in a timely and cost-effective manner.

Our ability to successfully implement new processes and systems enhancements that are expected to improve our merchandising capabilities over the next few years with the goal of being able to plan, buy and allocate product at a more local versus regional level.

Our ability to improve new store sales and profitability, especially in newer regions and markets.

Our ability to achieve and maintain targeted levels of productivity and efficiency in our distribution centers.

Our ability to continue to acquire or lease acceptable new store locations.

Our ability to identify and to successfully enter new geographic markets.

Lower than planned gross margin, including higher than planned markdowns, inventory shortage or freight costs.

Greater than planned operating costs including, among other factors, increases in occupancy costs, advertising costs, and wage and benefit costs, including the impact of changes in labor laws or as a result of class action or other lawsuits relating to wage and hour claims and other labor-related matters.

Our ability to convert certain former Albertsons real estate sites to the Ross and dd’s DISCOUNTS formats in a timely and cost-effective manner and on acceptable terms, and the ability to achieve targeted levels of sales, profits and cash flows from these acquired store locations.


Item 1B.     Unresolved Staff Comments

We have received no written comments regarding our periodic or current reports from the staff of the Securities and Exchange Commission that were issued 180 days or more preceding the end of our 2006 fiscal year and that remain unresolved.

Item 2.     Properties

Stores

From August 1982 to February 3, 2007, we expanded from six Ross locations in California to 771 Ross stores in 27 states and one Ross store in Guam. In addition, we operate 26 dd’s DISCOUNTS locations in California. All stores are leased, with the exception of two locations.

During fiscal 2006, we opened 60 new Ross stores, relocated two stores and closed three existing locations. The average new Ross store in fiscal 2006 was approximately 30,000 gross square feet, yielding about 25,000 square feet of selling space. As of February 3, 2007, our 771 Ross stores generally ranged in size from about 25,000 to 35,000 gross square feet and had an average of 29,900 gross square feet and 24,000 selling square feet.

During fiscal 2006, we opened six new dd’s DISCOUNTS stores. The average new dd’s DISCOUNTS store in fiscal 2006 was approximately 27,000 gross square feet, yielding about 21,600 square feet of selling space. As of February 3, 2007, our 26 dd’s DISCOUNTS stores had an average of 27,000 gross square feet and 20,900 selling square feet. All of our dd’s DISCOUNTS locations are currently in California.

During fiscal 2006, no one store accounted for more than 1% of our sales.

We carry earthquake insurance to mitigate our risk on our corporate headquarters, distribution centers, buying offices, and all of our stores.

Our real estate strategy in 2007 and 2008 is to open additional stores, mainly in existing regions, to increase our market penetration and to reduce overhead and advertising expenses as a percentage of sales in each market. Important considerations in evaluating a new market are the availability of potential sites, demographic characteristics, competition and population density of the market. In addition, we continue to consider opportunistic real estate acquisitions.

In October 2006, we announced an agreement with Albertsons LLC to acquire certain leasehold rights to 46 former Albertsons sites in California, Florida, Texas, Arizona, Colorado and Oklahoma. We plan to incorporate about 40 of these sites into our 2007 expansion program. This real estate opportunity allowed us to acquire a substantial number of store sites in several of our established, top performing markets.


The following table summarizes the locations of our stores by state as of February 3, 2007 and January 28, 2006. California includes 26 and 20 dd’s DISCOUNTS locations at February 3, 2007 and January 28, 2006, respectively.

Where possible, we have obtained sites in buildings requiring minimal alterations. This has allowed us to establish stores in new locations in a relatively short period of time at reasonable costs in a given market. To date, we have been able to secure leases in suitable locations for our stores. At February 3, 2007, the majority of our Ross stores had unexpired original lease terms ranging from three to ten years with three to four renewal options of five years each. The average unexpired original lease term of our leased stores is six years, or 22 years if renewal options are included. At February 3, 2007, the majority of our dd’s DISCOUNTS stores had unexpired original lease terms ranging from eight to ten years with three to four renewal options of five years each. The average unexpired original lease term of our leased stores is nine years, or 28 years if renewal options are included. See Note E of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

See additional discussion under “Stores” in Item 1.

Distribution Centers

We operate two 1.3 million square foot distribution centers -- one in Fort Mill, South Carolina, and the other in Perris, California. The South Carolina facility opened in July 2002 and was originally financed under a synthetic lease. We exercised the option to purchase this property in May 2006. The Perris, California, facility opened in September 2003 and is financed with a ten-year synthetic lease facility that expires in July 2013. We also own a 426,000 square foot distribution center located in Carlisle, Pennsylvania. In addition, we own our 685,000 square foot Moreno Valley, California distribution center, which we purchased in 2005 to increase our distribution and packaway storage capacity. We have plans for future expansion at the Moreno Valley distribution center. See additional discussion in Management’s Discussion and Analysis.


In addition, in November 2001 we entered into a nine-year lease for a 239,000 square foot warehouse and a ten-year lease for a 246,000 square foot warehouse in Carlisle, Pennsylvania. In June 2006, we entered into a two-year lease extension with one one-year option for our 253,000 square foot warehouse in Fort Mill, South Carolina, extending the term to February 2009. All three of these properties are used to store our packaway inventory.

See additional discussion under “Distribution” in Item 1.

Corporate Headquarters

The Company leases approximately 181,000 square feet of office space for our corporate headquarters in Pleasanton, California, under several facility leases. The lease terms for these facilities generally expire between 2010 and 2014 and contain renewal provisions.

Item 3.     Legal Proceedings

We are party to class action lawsuits alleging misclassification of assistant store managers and missed meal and rest break periods, and other litigation incident to our business. We believe that none of these legal proceedings will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations. See Note J to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Item 6.     Selected Financial Data

The following selected financial data is derived from our consolidated financial statements. The data set forth below should be read in conjunction with “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” the section “Forward-Looking Statements” in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K and our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto.


Selected Financial Data


Item 7.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of

Operations

Overview

We are the second largest off-price apparel and home goods retailer in the United States. At the end of fiscal 2006, there were 771 Ross locations in 27 states and Guam, and 26 dd’s DISCOUNTS stores in California. Ross offers first-quality, in-season, name-brand and designer apparel, accessories, footwear and home fashions at everyday savings of 20% to 60% off department and specialty store regular prices. dd’s DISCOUNTS features a more moderately-priced assortment of first-quality, in-season, name-brand apparel, accessories, footwear and home fashions at everyday savings of 20% to 70% off moderate department and discount store regular prices.

Our primary strategy is to pursue and refine our existing off-price business and steadily expand our store base. In establishing growth objectives for our business, we closely monitor market share trends for the off-price industry. Total apparel sales for the off-price sector grew by 8% during 2006, which is faster than total national apparel sales, which grew by 5% vs. 4% last year, according to data from the NPD Group. The NPD Group provides global sales and marketing information on the retail industry. This reflects the ongoing importance of value to consumers. Our strategies are designed to take advantage of these growth trends and continued customer demand for name-brand fashions for the family and the home at competitive everyday discounts.

We refer to our fiscal years ended February 3, 2007, January 28, 2006, and January 29, 2005 as fiscal 2006, fiscal 2005 and fiscal 2004, respectively. Fiscal 2006 was 53 weeks. Fiscal 2005 and 2004 were 52 weeks.

Results of Operations

Reclassifications.

In periods prior to fiscal 2006, stock-based compensation expense related to restricted stock grants and incentive compensation expense were included in selling, general and administrative (“SG&A”) expenses. In accordance with SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin (“SAB”) No. 107, which provides guidance on implementation of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No. 123(R), “Share-Based Payment,” all compensation-related expenses are recorded in a manner similar to other employee payroll costs. Therefore, for periods prior to fiscal 2006, we have reclassified the portion of stock-based compensation and incentive compensation that relates to personnel in the merchandising and distribution organizations from selling, general and administrative expense to cost of goods sold. Beginning in fiscal year 2006, the portion of stock option and employee
stock purchase plan (“ESPP”) expenses included in stock-based compensation expense for personnel in the merchandising and distribution organizations is included in cost of goods sold, and the balance is included in SG&A expenses.


Stores.

Total stores open at the end of 2006, 2005 and 2004 were 797, 734 and 649, respectively. The number of stores at the end of fiscal 2006, 2005 and 2004 increased by 9%, 13% and 14% from the respective prior years. Our operating strategy is to open additional stores based on local market penetration, local demographic characteristics including population, competition, and the ability to leverage overhead expenses. We continually evaluate opportunistic real estate acquisitions and opportunities for potential new store locations. We also evaluate our current store locations and determine store closures based on similar criteria.

Sales.

Sales for 2006 increased $626.0 million, or 12.7%, compared to the prior year due to the opening of 63 net new stores during 2006, and a 4% increase in sales from “comparable” stores (defined as stores that have been open for more than 14 complete months). Sales for fiscal 2005 increased $704.2 million, or 16.6%, compared to the same period in the prior year due to the opening of 85 net new stores during 2005, and a 6% increase in sales from comparable stores.

We expect to address the competitive climate for off-price apparel and home goods by pursuing and refining our existing strategies and by continuing to strengthen our organization, to diversify the merchandise mix, and to more fully develop the organization and systems to strengthen regional and local merchandise offerings. Although our strategies and store expansion program contributed to sales gains in fiscal 2006, 2005 and 2004, we cannot be sure that they will result in a continuation of sales growth or an increase in net earnings.

Stock-based compensation.

Effective in fiscal 2006, we adopted SFAS No. 123(R) and elected to adopt the standard using the modified prospective transition method. This new accounting standard requires recognition of compensation expense based on the grant date fair value of all stock-based awards, typically amortized over the vesting period. The impact on results for fiscal 2006 was to decrease earnings before taxes by approximately $13.2 million, and net income by approximately $8.0 million.

See Notes A and C in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on our stock-based compensation plans and implementation of SFAS No. 123(R).

Cost of goods sold.

Cost of goods sold in fiscal 2006 increased $464.9 million compared to the prior year mainly due to increased sales from the opening of 63 net new stores during the year, a 4% increase in sales from comparable stores, and additional stock compensation expenses recognized pursuant to SFAS No. 123(R).

Cost of goods sold as a percentage of sales for fiscal 2006 decreased approximately 40 basis points from the prior year. This improvement was driven mainly by a 40 basis point improvement in merchandise margin primarily due to lower markdowns and shortage as a percent of sales, and a 35 basis point improvement in distribution costs. These gains were partially offset by an approximate 25 basis point increase in freight costs and a 10 basis point increase in expenses related to SFAS No. 123(R).


Cost of goods sold in fiscal 2005 increased $566.0 million compared to the same period in the prior year mainly due to increased sales from the opening of 85 net new stores during the year, a 6% increase in sales from comparable stores, and increased distribution and logistics costs.

Cost of goods sold as a percentage of sales for fiscal 2005 increased approximately 40 basis points compared with the same period in the prior year. This increase was driven by a 40 basis point decrease in merchandise gross margin, mainly due to higher shortage, a 20 basis point increase in freight expense and a 25 basis point increase in incentive plan costs as a percent of sales. These increases in total cost of goods sold were partially offset by about a 25 basis point decrease in store occupancy costs and a 20 basis point decline in buying expenses, both of which benefited from leverage on the 6% increase in same store sales.

We cannot be sure that the gross profit margins realized in fiscal 2006, 2005 and 2004 will continue in future years.

Selling, general and administrative expenses.

For fiscal 2006, selling, general and administrative expenses increased $96.9 million compared to the prior year, mainly due to increased store operating costs reflecting the opening of 63 net new stores during the year.

SG&A as a percentage of sales for fiscal 2006 was unchanged compared to the same period in the prior year. An approximately 15 basis point increase in expense related to SFAS No. 123(R) and a 5 basis point increase in store related expenses were offset by a 20 basis point decrease in other general and administrative costs related to lower worker’s compensation costs and leverage on the 53

rd

week of operations in fiscal 2006.

For fiscal 2005, SG&A increased $108.5 million compared to the same period in the prior year, mainly due to increased store operating costs reflecting the opening of 85 net new stores during the period, and to higher incentive plan costs.

For fiscal 2005, SG&A as a percentage of sales was unchanged compared to the same period in the prior year. An approximate 35 basis point increase relating to higher incentive plan costs, information technology costs and related depreciation was offset by a 35 basis point decrease in store operating and advertising costs, both of which benefited from leverage on the 6% increase in sales from comparable stores.

The largest component of SG&A is payroll. The total number of employees, including both full and part-time, as of fiscal year end 2006, 2005, and 2004 was approximately 35,800, 33,200 and 30,100, respectively.

Interest.

In fiscal 2006, interest expense decreased $1.2 million and interest income increased $4.5 million compared to the prior year. As a percentage of sales, net interest income in fiscal 2006 increased pre-tax earnings by approximately 10 basis points compared to the same period in the prior year. The increase was due to higher cash and investment balances. The table below shows interest expense and income for fiscal 2006, 2005 and 2004:

Impairment of long-lived assets.

During fiscal 2004, we relocated our corporate headquarters from Newark, California, to Pleasanton, California, and sold the facility for net proceeds of approximately $17.4 million. We recognized a net impairment charge of approximately $15.8 million related to this disposal.

Taxes on earnings.

Our effective tax rate for fiscal 2006, 2005 and 2004 was approximately

39%, which represents the applicable combined federal and state statutory rates reduced by the federal benefit of state taxes deductible on federal returns. The effective rate is affected by changes in law, location of new stores, level of earnings and the result of tax audits. We anticipate that our effective tax rate for fiscal 2007 will be in the range of 38% to 40%.


Net earnings.

Net earnings as a percentage of sales for fiscal 2006 were higher compared to fiscal 2005 primarily due to lower cost of goods sold and higher interest income as a percentage of sales, while SG&A expenses as a percentage of sales remained unchanged. Net earnings as a percentage of sales remained unchanged in fiscal 2005 compared to fiscal 2004 primarily due to increased cost of goods sold and SG&A expenses as a percentage of sales, partially offset by the absence of an impairment charge and increased interest income as a percentage of sales.

Earnings per share.

Diluted earnings per share in fiscal 2006 was $1.70, compared to $1.36 in fiscal 2005. This 25% increase in diluted earnings per share is attributable to an approximate 21% increase in net earnings and a 3% reduction in weighted average diluted shares outstanding, largely due to the repurchase of common stock under our stock repurchase program. Diluted earnings per share in fiscal 2005 was $1.36, compared to $1.13 in fiscal 2004, inclusive of the $.06 impairment charge related to the sale of our Newark Facility and $.01 related to lease accounting adjustments attributable to the prior fiscal year. This increase in diluted earnings per share is due to an approximate 17% increase in net earnings and a 3% reduction in weighted average diluted shares outstanding.

Financial Condition

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Our primary sources of funds for our business activities are cash flows from operations and short-term trade credit. Our primary ongoing cash requirements are for seasonal and new store merchandise inventory purchases, capital expenditures in connection with opening new stores, and investments in distribution centers, information systems and infrastructure. In fiscal 2006 we also used cash to repay debt, repurchase stock under our stock repurchase program and to pay dividends.

Operating Activities

Net cash provided by operating activities was $506.9 million, $375.2 million and $298.2 million in fiscal 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The primary source of cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2006, 2005 and 2004 was net earnings plus non-cash expenses for depreciation and amortization, partially offset by cash used to finance merchandise inventory. The increase in accounts payable in 2006 over 2005 of $221.6 million was primarily driven by timing associated with the additional 53

rd

week in fiscal 2006.

Working capital (defined as current assets less current liabilities) was $431.7 million at the end of fiscal 2006, compared to $349.9 million at the end of fiscal 2005, and $416.4 million at the end of fiscal 2004. The increase in working capital in fiscal 2006 compared to fiscal 2005 is primarily a result of higher cash and investments. The decrease in working capital in 2005 compared to 2004 is primarily due to the inclusion of a $50.0 million term loan in current liabilities due to its near-term maturity.

Our primary source of liquidity is the sale of our merchandise inventory. We regularly review the age and condition of our merchandise and are able to maintain current merchandise inventory in our stores through replenishment processes and liquidation of slower-moving merchandise through clearance markdowns.


Investing Activities

In fiscal 2006, 2005 and 2004, we spent approximately $223.9 million, $175.9 million and $149.5 million, respectively, for capital expenditures (excluding leased equipment) for fixtures and leasehold improvements to open new stores, implement information technology systems, install and implement materials handling equipment and related distribution center systems, and various other expenditures related to our stores, buying and corporate offices. Fiscal 2006 included the purchase of distribution center assets under a lease of $87.3 million. We opened 66, 86 and 84 new stores, and we relocated, remodeled or expanded 2, 2 and 3 stores in fiscal 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively.

In fiscal 2006 we had purchases of investments of $71.9 million and sales of investments of $59.3 million. In fiscal 2005 we had purchases of investments of $313.6 million and sales of investments of $357.0 million. In fiscal 2004 we had purchases of $165.1 million and sales of investments of $97.7 million. We also received approximately $17.4 million in net proceeds from the sale of the Newark Facility.

We are forecasting approximately $290 million in capital requirements in 2007 to fund expenditures for fixtures and leasehold improvements to open both new Ross and dd’s DISCOUNTS stores, the relocation, or upgrade of existing stores, and investments in store and merchandising systems, distribution center land, buildings, equipment and systems, and various buying and corporate office expenditures. We expect to fund these expenditures out of cash flows from operations and existing credit facilities.

Financing Activities

During fiscal 2006, 2005 and 2004, our liquidity and capital requirements were provided by cash flows from operations, bank credit facilities, trade credit, and issuance of senior notes. Substantially all of our store locations, our buying offices, our corporate headquarters, and one distribution center are leased and, except for certain leasehold improvements and equipment, do not represent long-term capital investments. We own three distribution centers in Carlisle, Pennsylvania, Moreno Valley, California, and Fort Mill, South Carolina.

In November 2005, we announced that our Board of Directors authorized a new two-year stock repurchase program of up to $400 million for 2006 and 2007. We repurchased 7.1 million shares of common stock for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $200 million in 2006. In January 2004, our Board of Directors authorized a stock repurchase program of up to $350 million for 2004 and 2005. We repurchased 6.4 million and 6.5 million shares of common stock for aggregate purchase prices of approximately $175 million in both 2005 and 2004, respectively. These repurchases were funded by cash flows from operations.

In March 2006, we repaid our $50.0 million term debt in full. In October 2006, we entered into a Note Purchase Agreement with various institutional investors for $150.0 million of unsecured, senior notes. See “Senior Notes” below for more information.

In January 2007, the Company’s Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend payment of $.075 per common share, payable on or about March 30, 2007. Our Board of Directors declared quarterly cash dividends of $.06 per common share in January, May, August and November 2006, $.06 per common share in November 2005, and cash dividends of $.05 per common share in January, May and August 2005.


Short-term trade credit represents a significant source of financing for investments in merchandise inventory. Trade credit arises from customary payment terms and trade practices with our vendors. We regularly review the adequacy of credit available to us from all sources and expect to be able to maintain adequate trade, bank and other credit lines to meet our capital and liquidity requirements, including lease payment obligations in 2007.

We estimate that cash flows from operations, bank credit lines and trade credit are adequate to meet operating cash needs, fund our planned capital investments, repurchase common stock and make quarterly dividend payments for at least the next twelve months.

Contractual Obligations

The table below presents our significant contractual obligations as of February 3, 2007:

Senior Notes.

In October 2006, we entered into a Note Purchase Agreement with various institutional investors for $150.0 million of unsecured, senior notes. The notes were issued in two series and funding occurred in December 2006. Series A notes were issued for an aggregate of $85.0 million, are due in December 2018, and bear interest at a rate of 6.38%. Series B notes were issued for an aggregate of $65.0 million, are due in December 2021, and bear interest at a rate of 6.53%. Interest on these notes is included in Interest payment obligations in the table above.

Borrowings under these notes are subject to certain operating and financial covenants including maintaining certain interest coverage and leverage ratios. As of February 3, 2007, we were in compliance with these covenants.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

Operating leases.

Substantially all of our store sites, one of our distribution centers, and our buying offices and corporate headquarters are leased and, except for certain leasehold improvements and equipment, do not represent long-term capital investments.

We have lease arrangements for certain equipment in our stores for our point-of-sale (“POS”) hardware and software systems. These leases are accounted for as operating leases for financial reporting purposes. The initial terms of these leases are two years, and we typically have options to renew the leases for two to three one-year periods. Alternatively, we may purchase or return the equipment at the end of the initial or each renewal term. We have guaranteed the value of the equipment, of $9.6 million, at the end of the respective initial lease terms, which is included in other synthetic lease obligations in the table above.


In January 2004, we commenced the lease on our corporate headquarters in Pleasanton, California. The lease has an initial term of 10.5 years with three five-year renewal options.

We lease a 1.3 million square foot distribution center in Perris, California. The land and building for this distribution center is financed under a $70.0 million ten-year synthetic lease that expires in July 2013. Rent expense on this center is payable monthly at a fixed annual rate of 5.8% on the lease balance of $70.0 million. At the end of the lease term, we have the option to either refinance the $70.0 million synthetic lease facility, purchase the distribution center at the amount of the then-outstanding lease obligation, or arrange a sale of the distribution center to a third party. If the distribution center is sold to a third party for less than $70.0 million, we have agreed under a residual value guarantee to pay the lessor any shortfall amount up to $56.0 million. Our contractual obligation of $56.0 million is included in other synthetic lease obligations in the above table.

In accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Interpretation (“FIN”) No. 45, “Guarantor’s Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others,” we have recognized a liability and corresponding asset for the fair value of the residual value guarantee in the amount of $8.3 million for the Perris, California distribution center and $2.1 million for the POS leases. These residual value guarantees are being amortized on a straight-line basis over the original terms of the leases. The current portion of the related asset and liability is recorded in prepaid expenses and accrued expenses, respectively, and the long-term portion of the related assets and liabilities is recorded in other long-term assets and other long-term liabilities, respectively, in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.

In addition, we lease two separate warehouse facilities for packaway storage in Carlisle, Pennsylvania under operating leases expiring through 2011. In June 2006, we entered into a two-year lease extension with a one-year option for our warehouse facility in Fort Mill, South Carolina, extending the term to February 2009. These three leased facilities are being used primarily to store packaway merchandise.

The synthetic lease facilities described above, as well as our revolving credit facility and senior notes, have covenant restrictions requiring us to maintain certain interest coverage and leverage ratios. In addition, the interest rates under these agreements may vary depending on actual interest coverage ratios achieved. As of February 3, 2007, we were in compliance with these covenants.

Purchase obligations.

As of February 3, 2007 we had purchase obligations of $841.8 million. These purchase obligations primarily consist of merchandise inventory purchase orders, commitments related to store fixtures and supplies, and information technology service and maintenance contracts. Merchandise inventory purchase orders of $788.1 million represent purchase obligations of less than one year as of February 3, 2007.

Revolving credit facility.

We have available a $600.0 million revolving credit facility with our banks, which contains a $300.0 million sublimit for issuance of standby letters of credit, of which $233.6 million was available at February 3, 2007. In July 2006, we amended this facility to extend the expiration date to July 2011 and change the letter of credit sublimit and interest pricing. Interest is LIBOR-based plus an applicable margin (currently 45 basis points) and is payable upon borrowing maturity but no less than quarterly. Our borrowing ability under this credit facility is subject to our maintaining certain interest coverage and leverage ratios. As of February 3, 2007 we had no borrowings outstanding under this facility and were in compliance with the covenants.


Standby letters of credit.

We use standby letters of credit to collateralize certain obligations related to our self-insured workers’ compensation and general liability claims. We had $66.4 million and $61.7 million in standby letters of credit outstanding at February 3, 2007 and January 28, 2006, respectively.

Trade letters of credit.

We had $26.0 million and $16.5 million in trade letters of credit outstanding at February 3, 2007 and January 28, 2006, respectively.

Other Activities

Albertsons real estate transaction.

In October 2006, we announced an agreement with Albertsons LLC to acquire certain leasehold rights to 46 former Albertsons sites in California, Florida, Texas, Arizona, Colorado and Oklahoma. We plan to incorporate about 40 of these sites into our 2007 expansion program. This real estate opportunity allowed us to acquire a substantial number of store sites in several of our established, top performing markets. We expect to realize incremental contributions to earnings and cash flow from these additional locations beginning in fiscal year 2007. We expect these leases will be finalized over the next several months.

Distribution center purchase.

In May 2006, we exercised our option to purchase our Fort Mill, South Carolina distribution center and paid cash in the amount of $87.3 million to acquire the facility from the lessor. We estimated the fair value of the components of the facility and the related equipment using various valuation techniques, including appraisals, market prices, and cost data. The amounts we recorded for each component were based on these fair value estimates.

Critical Accounting Policies

The preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts. These estimates and assumptions are evaluated on an ongoing basis and are based on historical experience and on various other factors that management believes to be reasonable. We believe the following critical accounting policies describe the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.

Merchandise inventory.

Our merchandise inventory is stated at the lower of cost or market, with cost determined on a weighted average cost basis. We purchase manufacturer overruns and canceled orders both during and at the end of a season which are referred to as "packaway" inventory. Packaway inventory is purchased with the intent that it will be stored in our warehouses until a later date, which may even be the beginning of the same selling season in the following year.

Included in the carrying value of our merchandise inventory is a provision for shortage. The shortage reserve is based on historical shortage rates as evaluated through our periodic physical merchandise inventory counts and cycle counts. If actual market conditions, markdowns, or shortage are less favorable than those projected by us, or if sales of the merchandise inventory are more difficult than anticipated, additional merchandise inventory write-downs may be required.

Long-lived assets.

We record a long-lived asset impairment charge when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a long-lived asset may not be recoverable based on estimated future cash flows. An impairment loss would be recognized if analysis of the undiscounted cash flow of an asset group was less than the carrying value of the asset group. If our actual results differ materially from projected results, an impairment charge may be required in the future. During 2004, we recognized an impairment charge of $15.8 million before taxes to write-down the carrying value of our Newark Facility. In the course of performing our annual analysis, we determined that no other long-lived asset impairment charge was required for fiscal 2006, 2005, or 2004.

Depreciation and amortization expense.

Property and equipment are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the asset, typically ranging from five to twelve years for equipment and 20 to 40 years for real property. The cost of leasehold improvements is amortized over the lesser of the useful life of the asset or the applicable lease term.


Lease accounting.

Beginning in the first quarter of 2006, we implemented prospectively FASB Staff Position (“FSP”) 13-1, “Accounting for Rental Costs Incurred During a Construction Period,” which requires that rental costs incurred during a construction period be expensed, not capitalized. Implementation of this new standard did not have a significant impact on our financial results for the year ended February 3, 2007. When a lease contains “rent holidays” or requires fixed escalations of the minimum lease payments, we record rental expense on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease and the difference between the average rental amount charged to expense and the amount payable under the lease is recorded as deferred rent. We amortize deferred rent on a straight-line basis over the lease term commencing on the possession date. Tenant improvement allowances are included in other
long-term liabilities and are amortized over the lease term. Tenant improvement allowances are included as a component of operating cash flows in the consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.

Self-insurance.

We self insure certain of our workers’ compensation and general liability risks as well as certain coverages under our health plans. Our self-insurance liability is determined actuarially, based on claims filed and an estimate of claims incurred but not reported. Should a greater amount of claims occur compared to what is estimated or the costs of medical care increase beyond what was anticipated, our recorded reserves may not be sufficient and additional charges could be required.

Stock-based compensation.

We account for stock-based compensation under the provisions of SFAS No. 123(R). Under this provision compensation expense is recognized for the grant date fair value of new awards granted in fiscal 2006 and later, and for the unvested portion of prior year awards that were outstanding as of January 28, 2006. Stock-based awards are valued using the Black-Scholes option pricing model, consistent with our prior pro forma disclosures under SFAS No. 123. Compensation expense for awards outstanding at the effective date is recognized over the remaining vesting period using the compensation cost calculated for purposes of the prior pro forma disclosures. For awards granted after the adoption date, we recognize expense equal to the fair value of the award on a straight-line basis over the applicable vesting term.

The determination of the fair value of stock options and Employee Stock Purchase Plan (“ESPP”) shares, using the Black-Scholes model, is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions as to our expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards, actual and projected employee stock option exercise behavior, the risk-free interest rate and expected dividends.

SFAS No. 123(R) requires companies to estimate future expected forfeitures at the date of grant and revise those estimates in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. In previous fiscal years, we had recognized the impact of forfeitures as they occurred. Starting in fiscal 2006, we use historical data to estimate pre-vesting forfeitures and to recognize stock-based compensation expense. All stock-based compensation awards are amortized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service periods of the awards.

These critical accounting policies noted above are not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of our accounting policies. In many cases, the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“GAAP”), with no need for management’s judgment in their application. There are also areas in which management’s judgment in selecting one alternative accounting principle over another would not produce a materially different result. See our audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto under Item 8 in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, which contain accounting policies and other disclosures required by GAAP.

Effects of inflation or deflation.

We do not consider the effects of inflation or deflation to be material to our financial position and results of operations.

New Accounting Pronouncements

In June 2006, the FASB ratified Emerging Issues Task Force (“EITF”) Issue 06-2, “Accounting for Sabbatical Leave and Other Similar Benefits Pursuant to FASB No. 43, Accounting for Compensated Absences” (“EITF No. 06-2”), effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006. Under EITF No. 06-2 compensation cost associated with a sabbatical or other similar benefit programs should be accrued over the requisite service period. We do not believe the adoption of EITF No. 06-2 will have a material impact on our operating results or financial position.

In June 2006, the FASB issued Interpretation Number 48, “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes” (“FIN No. 48”), effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006. FIN No. 48 establishes a new basis for how companies should recognize, measure, present and disclose uncertain income tax positions that have been or expect to be taken in tax returns. The Company is required to apply the provisions of FIN No. 48 to all tax positions upon initial adoption with the cumulative effect to be recognized as an adjustment to beginning retained earnings. Upon adoption, the Company estimates that a cumulative effect of $6.0 to $8.0 million will be charged to retained earnings to increase reserves for uncertain tax positions.


In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, “Fair Value Measurements” (“SFAS No. 157”), effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. SFAS No. 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. We do not believe the adoption of SFAS No. 157 will have a material impact on our operating results or financial position.

In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 158, “Employers’ Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans” (“SFAS No. 158”), effective for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2006. This statement requires recognition of the overfunded or underfunded status of defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans as an asset or liability in the balance sheet. SFAS No. 158 does not change the amount of expense that is recorded related to these plans. Adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on our operating results or financial position.

Forward-Looking Statements

Our Annual Report on Form 10-K for fiscal 2006, and information we provide in our Annual Report to Stockholders, press releases, telephonic reports and other investor communications including on our website, may contain a number of forward-looking statements regarding, without limitation, planned store growth, new markets, expected sales, projected earnings levels, capital expenditures and other matters. These forward-looking statements reflect our then current beliefs, projections and estimates with respect to future events and our projected financial performance, operations and competitive position. The words “plan,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “estimate,” “believe,” “forecast,” “projected,” “guidance,” “looking ahead” and similar expressions identify forward-looking statements.

Future economic and industry trends that could potentially impact revenue, profitability, and growth remain difficult to predict. As a result, our forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties which could cause our actual results to differ materially from those forward-looking statements and our previous expectations and projections. Refer to Item 1A in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a more complete discussion of risk factors for Ross and dd’s DISCOUNTS. The factors underlying our forecasts are dynamic and subject to change. As a result, any forecasts or forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are given and do not necessarily reflect our outlook at any other point in time. We disclaim any obligation to update or revise these forward-looking statements.


ITEM 7A.     QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

We are exposed to market risks, which primarily include changes in interest rates. We do not engage in financial transactions for trading or speculative purposes.

We occasionally use forward contracts to hedge against fluctuations in foreign currency prices. We had no outstanding forward contracts as of February 3, 2007.

Interest that is payable on our revolving credit facilities is based on variable interest rates and is, therefore, affected by changes in market interest rates. In addition, lease payments under certain of our synthetic lease agreements are determined based on variable interest rates and are, therefore, affected by changes in market interest rates. As of February 3, 2007, we had no borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facilities. In addition, the Company issued notes to institutional investors in two series; Series A for $85.0 million accrues interest at 6.38% and Series B for $65.0 million accrues interest at 6.53%. The amount outstanding under these notes as of February 3, 2007 is $150.0 million.

A hypothetical 100 basis point increase in prevailing market interest rates would not have materially impacted our consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows as of and for the year ended February 3, 2007. We do not consider the potential losses in future earnings and cash flows from reasonably possible, near term changes in interest rates to be material.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Note A: Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Business.

Ross Stores, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the “Company”) is an off-price retailer of first-quality, branded apparel, shoes and accessories for the entire family, as well as gift items, linens and other home-related merchandise. At the end of fiscal 2006, there were 771 Ross Dress for Less

®

(“Ross”) locations in 27 states and Guam and 26 dd’s DISCOUNTS

®

stores in California, which are supported by four distribution centers. The Company’s headquarters, two distribution centers and 28% of its stores are located in California.

Basis of presentation and fiscal year.

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries, all of which are wholly-owned. Intercompany transactions and accounts have been eliminated. The Company follows the National Retail Federation fiscal calendar and utilizes a 52-53 week fiscal year whereby the fiscal year ends on the Saturday nearest to January 31. The fiscal years ended February 3, 2007, January 28, 2006 and January 29, 2005 are referred to as fiscal 2006, fiscal 2005 and fiscal 2004, respectively. Fiscal 2006 was 53 weeks. Fiscal 2005 and 2004 were 52 weeks.

Reclassifications.

In periods prior to fiscal 2006, stock-based compensation expense and incentive compensation expense were included in selling, general and administrative expenses. In accordance with SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin (“SAB”) No. 107, which provides guidance on implementation of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No. 123(R), “Share-Based Payment,” all compensation-related expenses are recorded in a manner similar to other employee payroll costs. Therefore, for periods prior to fiscal 2006, the Company has reclassified the portion of stock-based compensation and incentive compensation that relates to personnel in the merchandising and distribution organizations from selling, general and administrative expense to cost of goods sold. Beginning in fiscal 2006, the portion of stock option and employee stock purchase plan (“ESPP”) expenses included
in stock-based compensation expense for personnel in the merchandising and distribution organizations is included in cost of goods sold.

Under the provisions of SFAS No. 123(R), “Share-Based Payment,” deferred compensation previously reported as a contra-equity amount and representing the amount of unamortized value of restricted stock issued is no longer reported separately. Accordingly, deferred compensation of $29.4 million as of January 28, 2006 was reclassified to additional paid-in capital. In addition, amortization of deferred compensation related to restricted stock was reclassified as stock-based compensation in the accompanying statements of cash flows, rather than as depreciation and amortization.

See Note C for more information on the Company’s stock-based compensation and implementation of SFAS No. 123(R) during fiscal 2006.

Use of accounting estimates.

The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in the United States of America (“GAAP”) requires the Company to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The Company’s significant accounting estimates include valuation of merchandise inventory and long-lived assets, and accruals for self-insurance.

Purchase obligations.

As of February 3, 2007, the Company had purchase obligations of $841.8 million. These purchase obligations primarily consist of merchandise inventory purchase orders, commitments related to store fixtures and supplies, and information technology service and maintenance contracts. Merchandise inventory purchase orders of $788.1 million represent purchase obligations of less than one year as of February 3, 2007.

Cash and cash equivalents.

Cash and cash equivalents are highly liquid, fixed income instruments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less.


Investments.

The Company’s investments are comprised of various debt and equity investment securities. At February 3, 2007 and January 28, 2006, these investments were classified as available-for-sale and are stated at fair value, which approximates cost. Investments are classified as either short-term or long-term based on their original maturities. Investments with an original maturity of less than one year are classified as short-term. See Note B for additional information.

Merchandise inventory.

Merchandise inventory is stated at the lower of cost (determined using a weighted average basis) or net realizable value. The Company purchases manufacturer overruns and canceled orders both during and at the end of a season which are referred to as "packaway" inventory. Packaway inventory is purchased with the intent that it will be stored in the Company's warehouses until a later date, which may even be the beginning of the same selling season in the following year. Packaway inventory accounted for approximately 38% of total inventories as of February 3, 2007 and 41% at January 28, 2006. The cost of the Company’s merchandise inventory is reduced by valuation reserves for shortage based on historical shortage experience from the Company’s physical merchandise inventory counts and cycle counts.

Cost of goods sold.

In addition to

product costs, the Company includes in cost of goods sold its buying, distribution and freight expenses as well as occupancy costs, and depreciation and amortization related to the Company’s retail stores, buying and distribution facilities. Buying expenses include costs to procure merchandise inventories. Distribution expenses include the cost of operating the Company’s distribution centers and freight expense related to transporting merchandise.

Property and equipment.

Property and equipment are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the asset, typically ranging from five to twelve years for equipment and 20 to 40 years for real property. Depreciation and amortization expense on property and equipment was $107.8 million, $93.7 million and $80.0 million for fiscal 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The cost of leasehold improvements is amortized over the useful life of the asset or the applicable lease term, whichever is less. Computer hardware and software costs, net of amortization, of $147.9 million and $134.4 million at February 3, 2007 and January 28, 2006, respectively, are included in fixtures and equipment and are amortized over their estimated useful life generally ranging from five to seven years.

In May 2006, the Company exercised its option to purchase its Fort Mill, South Carolina distribution center and paid cash in the amount of $87.3 million to acquire the facility from the lessor. The Company estimated the fair value of the components of the facility and the related equipment using various valuation techniques, including appraisals, market prices, and cost data. Amounts recorded for each component were based on these fair value estimates.

Other long-term assets.

Other long-term assets as of February 3, 2007 and January 28, 2006 consist of the following:

Intangible assets

are principally comprised of lease rights, which are payments made to acquire store leases. An impairment loss would be recognized if the undiscounted cash flow of an asset group was less than the carrying value of the asset group.

Lease rights are amortized over the remaining life of the lease. Amortization expense related to these intangible assets was $0.3 million, $0.5 million and $0.6 million for fiscal 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively.


Other long-term assets and certain identifiable intangibles that are subject to amortization are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Intangible assets that are not subject to amortization, including goodwill, are tested for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset may be impaired. Based on the Company’s review as of February 3, 2007 and January 28, 2006, no adjustments were recognized to the carrying value of intangible assets.

During fiscal 2004, the Company relocated its corporate headquarters from Newark, California to Pleasanton, California and sold the Newark Facility for net proceeds of approximately $17.4 million. The Company recognized a net impairment charge of approximately $15.8 million related to this disposal.

Store closures.

The Company continually reviews the operating performance of individual stores. For stores that are to be closed, the Company records a liability for future minimum lease payments and related ancillary costs at the time the liability is incurred. Operating costs, including depreciation, of stores to be closed are expensed during the period they remain in use.

Accounts payable.

Accounts payable represents amounts owed to third parties at the end of the period. Accounts payable includes book cash overdrafts, which are checks issued under zero balance accounts not yet presented for payment, in excess of cash balances of such accounts of approximately $165.0 million and $55.5 million at February 3, 2007 and January 28, 2006, respectively. The Company includes the changes in book cash overdrafts in operating cash flows.

Self-insurance.

The Company is self-insured for workers’ compensation, general liability costs and certain medical plans. The self-insurance liability is determined actuarially, based on claims filed and an estimate of claims incurred but not yet reported. Self-insurance reserves as of February 3, 2007 and January 28, 2006 consist of the following:

Workers’ compensation and self-insured medical liabilities are included in accrued payroll and benefits and accruals for general liability are included in accrued expenses and other in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.

Lease accounting.

Upon adoption in the first quarter of fiscal 2006, the Company implemented prospectively the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Staff Position (“FSP”) 13-1, “Accounting for Rental Costs Incurred During a Construction Period,” which requires that rental costs incurred during a construction period be expensed, not capitalized. Implementation of this new standard did not have a significant impact on the Company’s financial results in fiscal year 2006.


When a lease contains “rent holidays” or requires fixed escalations of the minimum lease payments, the Company records rental expense on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease and the difference between the average rental amount charged to expense and the amount payable under the lease is recorded as deferred rent. The Company amortizes deferred rent on a straight-line basis over the lease term commencing on the possession date. As of February 3, 2007 and January 28, 2006, the balance of deferred rent was $49.8 million and $47.1 million, respectively, and is included in other long-term liabilities. Tenant improvement allowances are included in other long-term liabilities and are amortized over the lease term. Changes in tenant improvement allowances are included as a component of operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows.

Other long-term liabilities.

Other long-term liabilities as of February 3, 2007 and January 28, 2006 consist of the following:

Revenue recognition.

The Company recognizes revenue at the point of sale, net of actual returns, and maintains an allowance for estimated future returns. Sales of gift certificates and gift cards are deferred until they are redeemed for the purchase of Company merchandise. Sales tax collected is not recognized as revenue and is included in accrued expenses and other.

Allowance for sales returns.

An allowance for the gross margin loss on estimated sales returns is included in accrued expenses and other in the consolidated balance sheets. The allowance for sales returns consists of the following:

Advertising.

Advertising costs are expensed in the period incurred. Advertising expenses for fiscal 2006, 2005 and 2004 were $45.5 million, $44.2 million and $41.5 million, respectively.

Stock-based compensation.

Effective in fiscal year 2006, the Company adopted SFAS No. 123(R) and elected to adopt the standard using the modified prospective transition method. SFAS No. 123(R) replaces SFAS No. 123, “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation,” and supersedes Accounting Principles Board (“APB”) Opinion No. 25, “Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees.” This new accounting standard requires recognition of compensation expense based upon the grant date fair value of all stock-based awards, typically over the vesting period. See Note C for more information on the Company’s stock-based compensation plans and implementation of SFAS No. 123(R).


Taxes on earnings.

SFAS No. 109, “Accounting for Income Taxes,” requires income taxes to be accounted for under an asset and liability approach that requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the Company's consolidated financial statements or tax returns. In estimating future tax consequences, the Company generally considers all expected future events other than changes in the tax law or tax rates.

Treasury stock.

The Company records treasury stock at cost. Treasury stock includes shares purchased from employees for tax withholding purposes related to vesting of restricted stock grants.

Earnings per share

(“EPS”).

SFAS No. 128, “Earnings Per Share,” requires earnings per share to be computed and reported as both basic EPS and diluted EPS. Basic EPS is computed by dividing net earnings by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted EPS is computed by dividing net earnings by the sum of the weighted average number of common shares and dilutive common stock equivalents outstanding during the period. Diluted EPS reflects the potential dilution that could occur if stock options were exercised for shares of common stock.

In fiscal 2006, 2005 and 2004 there were 3,114,000, 2,778,000, and 999,000 weighted average shares, respectively, that could potentially dilute basic EPS in the future that were excluded from the calculation of diluted EPS because their effect would have been anti-dilutive (option exercise price exceeds average stock price) in the periods presented.

The following is a reconciliation of the number of shares (denominator) used in the basic and diluted EPS computations (shares in thousands):

Segment reporting.

The Company has one reportable operating segment. The Company’s operations include only activities related to off-price retailing in stores throughout the United States and, therefore, comprise only one segment.

Comprehensive income.

Comprehensive income consists of net earnings and other comprehensive income, principally unrealized investment gains and losses. Components of comprehensive income are presented in the consolidated statements of stockholders’ equity.

Derivative instruments and hedging activities.

SFAS No. 133, “Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities,” as amended, requires the Company to record all derivatives as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet and to measure those instruments at fair value. The Company had no derivative instruments as of February 3, 2007 or January 28, 2006.


New accounting pronouncements.

In June 2006, the FASB ratified Emerging Issues Task Force (“EITF”) Issue 06-2, “Accounting for Sabbatical Leave and Other Similar Benefits Pursuant to FASB No. 43, Accounting for Compensated Absences” (“EITF No. 06-2”), effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006. Under EITF No. 06-2, compensation cost associated with a sabbatical or other similar benefit programs should be accrued over the requisite service period. The Company does not believe the adoption of EITF No. 06-2 will have a material impact on the Company’s operating results or financial position.

In June 2006, the FASB issued Interpretation Number 48, “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes” (“FIN No. 48”), effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006. FIN No. 48 establishes a new basis for how companies should recognize, measure, present and disclose uncertain income tax positions that have been or expect to be taken in tax returns. The Company is required to apply the provisions of FIN No. 48 to all tax positions upon initial adoption with the cumulative effect to be recognized as an adjustment to beginning retained earnings. Upon adoption, the Company estimates that a cumulative effect of $6.0 to $8.0 million will be charged to retained earnings to increase reserves for uncertain tax positions.

In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, “Fair Value Measurements” (“SFAS No. 157”), effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. SFAS No. 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. The Company does not believe the adoption of SFAS No. 157 will have a material impact on the Company’s operating results or financial position.

In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 158, “Employers’ Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans” (“SFAS No. 158”), effective for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2006. This statement requires recognition of the overfunded or underfunded status of defined benefit pension and other post-retirement benefit plans as an asset or liability in the balance sheet. SFAS No. 158 does not change the amount of expense that is recorded related to these plans.

Note C: Stock-based compensation

The Company adopted the provisions of SFAS No. 123(R) on January 29, 2006, the beginning of fiscal 2006, using the modified prospective method. Under SFAS No. 123(R), compensation expense is recognized based on the grant date fair value of stock-based compensation awards granted in fiscal 2006 and later, and based on the unvested portion of awards from prior year grants that were outstanding as of January 28, 2006. Stock-based awards are valued using the Black-Scholes option pricing model, consistent with the Company’s prior pro forma disclosures under SFAS No. 123. Compensation expense for unvested awards outstanding at the date of adoption is recognized over the remaining vesting period using the compensation cost calculated for purposes of the prior pro forma disclosures. For awards granted after the adoption date, the Company recognizes expense based on the fair value of the award on a straight-line basis over the applicable vesting period.


For fiscal 2006, 2005 and 2004 the Company recognized stock-based compensation expense as follows (in $000):

Capitalized stock-based compensation cost was not significant.

The determination of the fair value of stock options and ESPP shares, using the Black-Scholes model, is affected by the Company’s stock price as well as assumptions as to the Company’s expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards, actual and projected employee stock option exercise behavior, the risk-free interest rate, and expected dividends.

The Company estimates the expected term of options granted taking into account historical and expected future exercise, cancellation and forfeiture behavior. The Company estimates the volatility of the common stock by using historical volatility over a period equal to the award’s expected term. The risk-free interest rates that are used in the valuation models are based upon yields of U.S. Treasury issues with remaining terms similar to the expected term on the options. Dividend yield has been estimated based on the Company’s expectation as to future dividend payouts.

SFAS No. 123(R) requires companies to estimate future expected forfeitures at the date of grant and revise those estimates in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. In previous fiscal years, the Company had recognized the impact of forfeitures as they occurred. Now, the Company uses historical data to estimate pre-vesting forfeiture rates in determining the amount of stock-based compensation expense to recognize. All stock-based compensation awards are amortized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service periods of the awards.

At February 3, 2007, the Company had two stock-based compensation plans, which are further described in Note H. The fair value of stock options and ESPP rights granted during the respective periods under these plans were estimated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model and the following weighted average assumptions:

Prior to fiscal 2006, the Company had accounted for share-based compensation costs in accordance with APB No. 25, as permitted by SFAS No. 123. Had compensation costs for the Company's stock option plans been determined based on the fair value at the grant dates for awards under those plans consistent with the methods of SFAS No. 123, the Company’s net earnings and earnings per share would have been reduced to the pro forma amounts indicated below:

The weighted average fair values per share of stock options granted during fiscal 2006, 2005 and 2004 were $8.52, $7.85 and $7.49, respectively. The weighted average fair values of the fiscal 2006, 2005 and 2004 employee stock purchase awards were $7.72, $7.97 and $7.30 per share, respectively.

Note D: Debt

Bank credit facilities.

In July 2006, the Company amended its existing $600.0 million revolving credit facility with its banks, extending the expiration date to July 2011, extending the standby letter of credit sublimit to 50% of the revolving credit, and changing the interest rate to LIBOR plus 45 basis points. This facility contains a $300.0 million sublimit for issuance of standby letters of credit, of which $233.6 million was available at February 3, 2007. Interest is payable upon borrowing maturity but no less than quarterly. Borrowing under this credit facility is subject to the Company maintaining certain interest coverage and leverage ratios. The Company had no borrowings outstanding under this facility as of February 3, 2007 and was in compliance with the covenants.


Term debt.

In March 2006, the Company repaid its $50.0 million term debt in full. The borrowing was made in 2002 to finance equipment and information systems for the Company’s Perris, California distribution center.

Senior Notes.

In October 2006, the Company entered into a Note Purchase Agreement with various institutional investors for $150.0 million of unsecured senior notes. The notes were issued in two series and funding occurred in December 2006. Series A notes were issued, for an aggregate of $85.0 million, are due in December 2018 and bear interest at a rate of 6.38%. Series B notes were issued, for an aggregate of $65.0 million, are due in December 2021 and bear interest at a rate of 6.53%. Borrowings under these notes are subject to certain operating and financial covenants including maintaining certain interest coverage and leverage ratios. As of February 3, 2007, the Company was in compliance with these covenants.

Letters of credit.

The Company uses standby letters of credit to collateralize certain obligations related to its self-insured workers’ compensation and general liability programs. The Company had $66.4 million and $61.7 million in standby letters of credit and $26.0 million and $16.5 million in trade letters of credit outstanding at February 3, 2007 and January 28, 2006, respectively.

Note E: Leases

The Company leases substantially all of its store sites, selected computer and other related equipment under operating leases with original, non-cancelable terms that in general range from three to ten years, expiring through 2018. Store leases typically contain provisions for three to four renewal options of five years each. Most store leases also provide for minimum annual rentals and for payment of certain expenses. In addition, some store leases also have provisions for additional rent based on a percentage of sales.

The Company has lease arrangements for certain equipment in its stores for its point-of-sale (“POS”) hardware and software systems. These leases are accounted for as operating leases for financial reporting purposes. The initial terms of these leases are three years and the Company typically has options to renew the leases for two to three one-year periods. Alternatively, the Company may purchase or return the equipment at the end of the initial or each renewal term. The Company’s obligation under the residual value guarantee at the end of the respective initial lease terms is $9.6 million.

The Company also leases a 1.3 million square foot distribution center in Perris, California. This distribution center is being financed under a $70 million ten-year synthetic lease facility that expires in July 2013. Rent expense on this distribution center is payable monthly at a fixed annual rate of 5.8% on the lease balance of $70 million. At the end of the lease term, the Company must either refinance the $70 million synthetic lease facility, purchase the distribution center at the amount of the then-outstanding lease balance, or arrange a sale of the distribution center to a third party. If the distribution center is sold to a third party for less than $70 million, the Company has agreed under a residual value guarantee to pay the lessor any shortfall amount up to $56 million. The Company’s obligation under this residual value guarantee is $56 million.

In accordance with FIN No. 45, “Guarantor’s Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others,” the Company has recognized a liability and corresponding asset for the fair value of the residual value guarantee in the amount of $8.3 million for the Perris, California distribution center and $2.1 million for the POS leases. These residual value guarantees are being amortized on a straight-line basis over the original terms of the leases. The current portion of the related asset and liability is recorded in “Prepaid expenses and other” and “Accrued expenses and other,” respectively, and the long-term portion of the related assets and liabilities is recorded in “Other long-term assets” and “Other long-term liabilities,” respectively, in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.

In addition, the Company leases two separate warehouse facilities for packaway storage in Carlisle, Pennsylvania with operating leases expiring through 2011. In January 2004, the Company entered into a two-year lease with two one-year options for a warehouse facility in Fort Mill, South Carolina, the second option of which has been exercised, and also modified, extending the term to February 1, 2009. These three leased facilities are being used primarily to store packaway merchandise.


The synthetic lease facilities described above, as well as the Company’s revolving credit facility and senior notes, have covenant restrictions requiring the Company to maintain certain interest coverage and leverage ratios. In addition, the interest rates under these agreements may vary depending on the Company’s actual interest coverage ratios. As of February 3, 2007, the Company was in compliance with these covenants.

The Company leases approximately 181,000 square feet of office space for its corporate headquarters in Pleasanton, California, under various facility leases. The lease terms for these facilities generally expire between 2010 and 2014 and contain renewal provisions.

In October 2004, the Company entered into a lease arrangement to use a portion of the Newark Facility to support distribution activities for dd’s DISCOUNTS for an initial lease term of two years with three one-year renewal options, a minor part of its remaining useful life. At the end of the original lease term on September 30, 2006, the lease was not renewed and the Company ceased using this facility.

Note G: Employee Benefit Plans

The Company has a defined contribution plan that is available to certain employees. Under the plan, employee and Company contributions and accumulated plan earnings qualify for favorable tax treatment under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code. This plan permits employees to make contributions up to the maximum limits allowable under the Internal Revenue Code. The Company matches up to 4% of the employee’s salary up to the plan limits. Company matching contributions to the 401(k) plan were $6.1 million, $5.1 million and $4.6 million in fiscal 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively.

The Company also has an Incentive Compensation Plan, which provides cash awards to key management employees based on the Company's and the individual's performance. The Company also makes available to management a Non-qualified Deferred Compensation Plan which allows management to make payroll contributions on a pre-tax basis in addition to the 401(k) plan. Other long-term assets include $47.0 million and $43.4 million at February 3, 2007 and January 28, 2006, respectively, of long-term investments, at market value, set aside or designated for the Non-qualified Deferred Compensation Plan. Plan investments are designated by the participants, and investment returns are not guaranteed by the Company.

In addition, the Company has certain individuals who receive or will receive post-employment benefits. The estimated liability for these benefits of $2.5 million is included in accrued liabilities and other in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of February 3, 2007.

2004 Equity Incentive Plan.

The Company has one equity incentive compensation plan, the 2004 Equity Incentive Plan (the “2004 Plan”). The 2004 Plan provides for various types of incentive awards, which may potentially include the grant of non-qualified and incentive stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock purchase rights, restricted stock shares, restricted stock units, performance shares, performance units and deferred stock units. The 2004 Plan also provides for the automatic grant of stock options to each non-employee director at pre-established times and at a predetermined value. To date, the Company has granted stock options and restricted stock shares under the 2004 Plan. Stock options are granted at exercise prices not less than the fair market value on the date the option is granted, expire not more than ten years from the date of grant, and normally vest over a period not
exceeding five years from the date of grant. Restricted shares are granted to officers and key employees. The fair value of these shares at the date of grant is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period of generally two to four years.

As of February 3, 2007, there were 11.4 million shares that remained available for grant under the 2004 Plan. A summary of the stock option activity under the 2004 Plan and Prior Plans for fiscal 2006, 2005 and 2004 is presented below.

During fiscal 2006, 2005 and 2004, shares purchased for tax withholding totaled 133,400, 233,300 and 306,400 shares, respectively, and are considered treasury shares which are available for reissuance. As of February 3, 2007 and January 28, 2006, total shares subject to repurchase related to unvested restricted stock were 2.0 million and 2.2 million shares respectively. A total of 3,278,000, 3,846,000 and 4,740,000 shares were available for
new restricted stock awards under the 2004 Plan and the Prior Plans at the end of fiscal 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively.


Employee Stock Purchase Plan.

Under the Employee Stock Purchase Plan, eligible full-time employees participating in the annual offering period can choose to have up to the lesser of 10% or $21,250 of their annual base earnings withheld to purchase the Company’s common stock. The purchase price of the stock is the lower of 85% of the market price at the beginning of the offering period, or end of the offering period. During fiscal 2006, 2005 and 2004, employees purchased approximately 183,000, 190,000 and 198,000 shares, respectively, of the Company’s common stock under the plan at weighted average per share prices of $24.86, $23.59 and $22.23, respectively. Through February 3, 2007, approximately 8,525,000 shares had been issued under this plan and 1,475,000 shares remained available for future issuance.

Note I: Related Party Transactions

The Company maintains consulting and benefits agreements with its Chairman of the Board of Directors under which the Company currently pays annual consulting fee of $1.1 million in monthly installments through January 2009. In addition, these agreements also provide for administrative support and health and other benefits for the individual and his dependents which totaled approximately $0.2 million in fiscal 2006.

The Company also maintains a consulting agreement with its Chairman Emeritus under which it pays an annual consulting fee of $0.1 million through March 2008 and provides administrative support and health benefits for the individual and his spouse which totaled approximately $0.1 million in fiscal 2006.

Note J: Provision for Litigation Expense and Other Legal Proceedings

Like many California retailers, the Company has been named in class action lawsuits regarding misclassification of assistant store managers. In February 2007 the Orange County Superior Court approved a settlement of the cases involving whether the Company’s assistant store managers in California are correctly classified as exempt under California Wage Orders. The approved settlement obligation is included in accrued expenses and other in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of February 3, 2007.

Other class action litigation involving allegations that hourly associates have missed meal and/or rest break periods remains pending as of February 3, 2007. Resolution of these cases is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition or result of operations.

The Company is a party in various other legal proceedings arising in the normal course of business. Actions filed against the Company include commercial, customer, and labor and employment-related claims, including lawsuits in which plaintiffs allege that the Company violated state and/or federal wage and hour and related laws. Actions against the Company are in various procedural stages. Many of these proceedings raise factual and legal issues and are subject to uncertainties. In the opinion of management, resolution of these matters is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition or results of operations.

Therefore, for periods prior to fiscal 2006, the Company has reclassified the portion of stock-based compensation and incentive compensation that relates to personnel in the merchandising and distribution organizations from selling, general and administrative expense to cost of goods sold.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

Board of Directors and Stockholders

Ross Stores, Inc.

Pleasanton, California

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Ross Stores, Inc. and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of February 3, 2007 and January 28, 2006, and the related consolidated statements of earnings, stockholders' equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended February 3, 2007. We also have audited management's assessment, included in the accompanying “Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting,” that the Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of February 3, 2007, based on criteria established in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. The Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over
financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements, an opinion on management's assessment, and an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit of financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, evaluating management's assessment, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing such other
procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.

A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the company's principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the company's board of directors, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts
and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.


In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Ross Stores, Inc. and subsidiaries as of February 3, 2007 and January 28, 2006, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended February 3, 2007, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also, in our opinion, management's assessment that the Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of February 3, 2007, is fairly stated, in all material respects, based on the criteria established in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Furthermore, in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal
control over financial reporting as of February 3, 2007, based on the criteria established in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission

.

As discussed in Notes A and C to the consolidated financial statements, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123(R), “Share Based Payments,” effective January 29, 2006.

ITEM 9A.     CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES.

Disclosure Controls and Procedures

Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our “disclosure controls and procedures” (as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(e)) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by this report.

It should be noted that any system of controls, however well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, and not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the system will be met. In addition, the design of any control system is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events.

Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f). Our internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of consolidated financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.

Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework established by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) as set forth in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework

. Based on our evaluation under the framework in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework

, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of February 3, 2007.

Our management’s assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of February 3, 2007 has been audited by Deloitte & Touche LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which is included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. It should be noted that any system of controls, however well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, and not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the system will be met. In addition, the design of any control system is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Quarterly Evaluation of Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, also conducted an evaluation of our internal control over financial reporting to determine whether any change occurred during the fourth fiscal quarter of 2006 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. Based on that evaluation, our management concluded that there was no such change during the fourth fiscal quarter.
