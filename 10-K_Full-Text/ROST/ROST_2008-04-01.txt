PART I

Item 1.    
Business.

Ross Stores, Inc. and its
subsidiaries (“we” or the “Company”) operate two chains of off-price retail
apparel and home accessories

stores. At February 2, 2008, we operated
a total of 890 stores, of which 838 are Ross Dress for Less

®

(“Ross”)
locations in 27 states and Guam and 52 are dd’s DISCOUNTS

®

stores
in four states. Both chains target value-conscious women and men between
the ages of 18 and 54. Ross target customers are primarily from middle income
households, while the dd’s DISCOUNTS target customer is typically from more
moderate income households. The decisions we make, from merchandising,
purchasing and pricing, to the locations of our stores, are aimed at these
customer bases.

Ross offers first-quality,
in-season, name-brand and designer apparel, accessories, footwear and home
merchandise for the entire family at everyday savings of 20% to 60% off
department and specialty store regular prices. dd’s DISCOUNTS features more
moderately-priced assortments of first-quality, in-season, name-brand and
fashion apparel, accessories, footwear and home merchandise for the entire
family at everyday savings of 20% to 70% off moderate department and discount
store regular prices. We believe that both Ross and dd’s DISCOUNTS derive a
competitive advantage by offering a wide assortment of product within each of
our merchandise categories in organized and easy-to-shop store environments.

Our mission is to offer
competitive values to our target customers by focusing on the following key
strategic objectives:

Achieve an appropriate level of recognizable
  brands, labels and fashions at strong discounts throughout the store.

Meet customer needs on a more local
  basis.

Deliver an in-store shopping experience that
  reflects the expectations of the off-price customer.

Manage real estate growth to compete
  effectively across all our markets.

The original Ross Stores, Inc. was
incorporated in California in 1957. In August 1982, the Company was purchased by
some of our then and current directors and stockholders. In June 1989, we
reincorporated in the state of Delaware. In 2004, we opened our first dd’s
DISCOUNTS locations.

We refer to our fiscal years ended
February 2, 2008, February 3, 2007, and January 28, 2006 as fiscal 2007, fiscal
2006, and fiscal 2005, respectively.

Merchandising, Purchasing and
Pricing

We seek to provide our customers
with a wide assortment of first-quality, in-season, brand-name and fashion
apparel, accessories, footwear and home merchandise for the entire family at
everyday savings of 20% to 60% below department and specialty store regular
prices at Ross, and 20% to 70% below moderate department and discount store
regular prices at dd’s DISCOUNTS. We sell recognizable brand-name merchandise
that is current and fashionable in each category. New merchandise typically is
received from three to six times per week at both Ross and dd’s DISCOUNTS
stores. Our buyers review their merchandise assortments on a weekly basis,
enabling them to respond to selling trends and purchasing opportunities in the
market. Our Ross merchandising strategy is reflected in our television
advertising for our Ross stores, which emphasizes a strong value message -- our
customers will find great savings every day on a broad assortment of brand-name
merchandise.

Merchandising.

Our merchandising strategy incorporates a combination of
off-price buying techniques to purchase advance-of-season, in-season, and
past-season merchandise for both Ross and dd’s DISCOUNTS. We believe nationally
recognized name brands sold at compelling discounts will continue to be an
important determinant of our success. We generally leave the brand-name label on
the merchandise we sell.


We have established merchandise
assortments that we believe are attractive to our target customers. Although we
offer fewer classifications of merchandise than most department stores, we
generally offer a large selection of brand names within each classification with
a wide assortment of vendors, labels, prices, colors, styles and fabrics within
each size or item. The mix of comparable store sales by department in fiscal
2007 for Ross was approximately as follows: Ladies 32%, Home Accents and Bed and
Bath 23%, Men's 15%, Fine Jewelry, Accessories, Lingerie and Fragrances 11%,
Shoes 10%, and Children’s 9%. Our merchandise offerings also include product
categories such as small furniture and furniture accents, educational toys and
games, luggage, gourmet food and cookware, watches, sporting goods and, in
select Ross stores, fine jewelry.

Purchasing.

We have a combined network of approximately 6,400
merchandise vendors and manufacturers for both Ross and dd’s DISCOUNTS and
believe we have adequate sources of first-quality merchandise to meet our
requirements. We purchase the vast majority of our merchandise directly from
manufacturers, and we have not experienced any difficulty in obtaining
sufficient merchandise inventory.

We believe that our ability to
effectively execute certain off-price buying strategies is a key factor in our
success. Our buyers use a number of methods that enable us to offer our
customers brand-name and fashion merchandise at strong everyday discounts
relative to department and specialty stores for Ross and moderate department and
discount stores for dd’s DISCOUNTS. By purchasing later in the merchandise
buying cycle than department and specialty stores, we are able to take advantage
of imbalances between retailers’ demand for products and manufacturers’ supply
of those products.

Unlike most department and
specialty stores, we typically do not require that manufacturers provide
promotional allowances, co-op advertising allowances, return privileges, split
shipments, drop shipments to stores or delayed deliveries of merchandise. For
most orders, only one delivery is made to one of our four distribution centers.
These flexible requirements further enable our buyers to obtain significant
discounts on in-season purchases.

The vast majority of the
merchandise that we offer in all of our stores is acquired through opportunistic
purchases created by manufacturer overruns and canceled orders both during and
at the end of a season. These buys are referred to as "close-out" and "packaway"
purchases. Close-outs can be shipped to stores in-season, allowing us to get
in-season goods into our stores at lower prices. Packaway merchandise is
purchased with the intent that it will be stored in our warehouses until a later
date, which may even be the beginning of the same selling season in the
following year. Packaway purchases are an effective method of increasing the
percentage of prestige and national brands at competitive savings within our
merchandise assortments. Packaway merchandise is mainly fashion basics and,
therefore, not usually affected by shifts in fashion trends.

In fiscal 2007, we continued our
emphasis on this important sourcing strategy in response to compelling
opportunities available in the marketplace. Packaway accounted for approximately
38% of total inventories as of February 2, 2008 and February 3, 2007. We believe
the strong discounts we are able to offer on packaway merchandise are one of the
key drivers of our business results.

We are currently working to
develop and roll-out additional information system enhancements and process
changes to improve our merchandising capabilities. These new tools are designed
to strengthen our ability to plan, buy and allocate at a more local versus
regional level. The long-term objective of these investments is to be able to
fine tune our merchandise offerings to address more localized customer
preferences and thereby gradually increase sales productivity and gross profit
margins in both newer and existing regions and markets.

Our buying offices are located in
New York City and Los Angeles, the nation's two largest apparel markets. These
strategic locations allow our buyers to be in the market on a daily basis,
sourcing opportunities and negotiating purchases with vendors and manufacturers.
These locations also enable our buyers to strengthen vendor relationships -- a
key element in the success of our off-price buying strategies.


We have a total of approximately
330 merchants for Ross and dd’s DISCOUNTS combined, although the two buying
organizations are separate and distinct. These buying resources include
merchandise management, buyers and assistant buyers. Ross and dd’s DISCOUNTS
buyers have an average of about 14 years of experience, including merchandising
positions with other retailers such as Ann Taylor, Bloomingdale's, Burlington
Coat Factory, Foot Locker, Kohl’s, Loehmann’s, Lord & Taylor, Macy's,
Marshalls, Nordstrom, Saks, T.J. Maxx and Value City. We believe that the
investment we have made over the years in our merchandise organization enables
our merchants to spend more time in the market developing and nurturing
relationships with a wide array of manufacturers and vendors, enhancing our
ability to continue to procure the most desirable brands and fashions at
competitive discounts.

Our off-price buying strategies
and our experienced merchants enable us to purchase Ross merchandise at net
prices that are lower than prices paid by department and specialty stores and
dd’s DISCOUNTS merchandise at net prices that are lower than prices paid by
moderate department and discount stores.

Pricing.

Our policy is to sell brand-name merchandise at Ross
that is priced 20% to 60% below most department and specialty store regular
prices. At dd’s DISCOUNTS, we sell more moderate brand-name product and fashions
that are priced 20% to 70% below most moderate department and discount store
regular prices. Our pricing policy is reflected on the price tag displaying our
selling price as well as the comparable selling price for that item in
department and/or specialty stores for Ross merchandise, or in more moderate
department and discount stores for dd’s DISCOUNTS merchandise.

Our pricing strategy at Ross
differs from that of a department or specialty store. We purchase our
merchandise at lower prices and mark it up less than a department or specialty
store. This strategy enables us to offer customers consistently low prices. We
review specified departments in the stores weekly for possible markdowns based
on the rate of sale as well as at the end of fashion seasons to promote faster
turnover of merchandise inventory and to accelerate the flow of fresh product. A
similar pricing strategy is in place at dd’s DISCOUNTS where prices are compared
to those in moderate department and discount stores.

Stores

At February 2, 2008, we operated a
total of

890 stores comprised of 838 Ross stores and 52 dd’s DISCOUNTS stores. Our
stores are conveniently located in predominantly community and neighborhood
shopping centers in heavily populated urban and suburban areas. Where the size
of the market permits, we cluster stores to benefit from economies of scale in
advertising, distribution and field management.

We believe a key element of our
success is our organized, attractive, easy-to-shop, in-store environments at
both Ross and dd’s DISCOUNTS, which allow customers to shop at their own pace.
Our stores are designed for customer convenience in their merchandise
presentation, dressing rooms, checkout and merchandise return areas. Each
store's sales area is based on a prototype single floor design with a racetrack
aisle layout. A customer can locate desired departments by signs displayed just
below the ceiling of each department. We encourage our customers to select among
sizes and prices through prominent category and sizing markers, promoting a
self-service atmosphere. At most stores, shopping carts are available at the
entrance for customer convenience. All cash registers are centrally located at
store entrances for customer ease and efficient staffing.

We use point-of-sale (“POS”)
hardware and software systems in all stores, which minimizes transaction time
for the customer at the checkout counter by electronically scanning each ticket
at the point of sale and authorizing credit for personal checks and credit cards
in a matter of seconds. In addition, the POS systems allow us to accept
PIN-based debit cards and electronic gift cards from customers. For Ross and
dd’s DISCOUNTS combined, approximately 56% of payments in fiscal 2007 and 55% of
payments in 2006 were made with credit cards and debit cards. We provide cash or
credit card refunds on all merchandise returned with a receipt within 30 days.
Merchandise returns having a receipt older than 30 days are exchanged or
credited with a credit voucher at the price on the receipt.


Operating Costs

Consistent with the other aspects
of our business strategy, we strive to keep operating costs as low as possible.
Among the factors which have enabled us to keep operating costs low are:

Labor costs that generally are lower than
  full-price department and specialty stores due to (i) a store design that
  creates a self-service retail format and (ii) the utilization of labor saving
  technologies.

Economies of scale with respect to general
  and administrative costs as a result of centralized merchandising, marketing
  and purchasing decisions.

Flexible store layout criteria which
  facilitates conversion of existing buildings to our format.

Distribution

We have a total of four
distribution processing facilities. We lease a 1.3 million square foot
distribution center in Perris, California. We own our 1.3 million square foot
distribution center in Fort Mill, South Carolina, our 685,000 square foot
distribution center in Moreno Valley, California, and our 450,000 square foot
distribution center located in Carlisle, Pennsylvania. We currently have under
construction a 610,000 square foot expansion of our Moreno Valley, California,
distribution center scheduled for completion in 2009. See additional discussion
in Management’s Discussion and Analysis.

In addition, we lease four
separate warehouse facilities for packaway storage, two of which are located in
Carlisle, Pennsylvania, totaling approximately 239,000 and 246,000 square feet,
and two of which are located in Fort Mill, South Carolina, totaling 253,000 and
423,000 square feet, respectively. We utilize other third-party facilities as
needed for storage of packaway inventory. We also lease a 10-acre parcel which
we currently have under construction for future trailer parking adjacent to our
Perris distribution center.

We utilize third-party cross docks
to distribute merchandise to stores on a regional basis. Shipments are made by
contract carriers to the stores from three to six times per week depending on
location.

We believe that our existing
distribution centers with their current expansion capabilities will provide
adequate processing capacity to support store growth over the next several
years.


Information
Systems

In fiscal 2007, we continued to
invest in new systems and technology to provide a platform for growth over the
next several years. Recent initiatives include the following:

We introduced a chain level update to our
  store network to increase communication bandwidth while decreasing monthly
  recurring costs. This improvement allowed us to deploy additional capabilities
  in the stores and to improve operational efficiencies.

We completed the majority of the development
  efforts related to testing and piloting new demand forecasting software and
  related process changes that are designed to strengthen our merchandising
  capabilities. The projected benefit from these new tools is more effective
  merchandise planning and trending processes for both sales and inventory. We
  believe this initiative will lead to gradual increases in store sales
  productivity and profitability across the chain by improving our ability to
  plan, buy and allocate product at a more local or even store level. We plan to
  gradually roll out these capabilities over the next few years.

We began developing new capabilities to
  better support the continued growth of our import businesses. These
  improvements are designed to give our merchants greater visibility into item
  cost components and inbound movement of import products. We plan to roll out
  these new capabilities in fiscal 2008.

We implemented additional enhancements to our
  supply chain systems in order to decrease monthly recurring costs, and to
  support expansion of processing and storage facilities. These improvements
  provided increased supply chain visibility and improved freight routing
  capabilities.

We implemented enhancements to our POS
  systems in order to reduce customer transaction and wait times.

We upgraded our Loss Prevention software to
  allow for additional analysis and reporting while also connecting a number of
  our store video surveillance systems to provide corporate remote
  access.

Advertising

We rely primarily on television
advertising to communicate the Ross value proposition -- brand-name merchandise
at low everyday prices. This strategy reflects our belief that television is the
most efficient and cost-effective medium for communicating everyday savings on a
wide selection of brand-name bargains for both the family and home. Advertising
for dd’s DISCOUNTS is primarily focused on new store grand openings and local
community initiatives.

Trademarks

The trademarks for Ross Dress For
Less

®

and dd’s DISCOUNTS

have been registered with the
United States Patent and Trademark Office.

Employees

As of February 2, 2008, we had
approximately 39,100 total employees, including an estimated 25,300 part-time
employees. Additionally, we hire temporary employees -- especially during the
peak seasons. Our employees are non-union. Management considers the relationship
between the Company and our employees to be good.


Competition

We believe the principal
competitive factors in the off-price retail apparel and home accessories
industry are offering significant discounts on brand-name merchandise, offering
a well-balanced assortment appealing to our target customer, and consistently
providing store environments that are convenient and easy to shop. To execute
this concept, we have invested in our buying organization and developed a
merchandise allocation system to distribute product based on regional factors,
as well as other systems and procedures to maximize cost efficiencies and
leverage expenses in an effort to mitigate competitive pressures on gross
margin. As discussed under Information Systems, we are also in the process of
rolling out over the next few years additional enhancements to our merchandise
planning system to strengthen our ability to plan, buy, and allocate product
based on more local versus regional trends. We believe that we are well
positioned to compete on the basis of each of these factors.

Nevertheless, the retail apparel
market is highly fragmented and competitive. We face intense competition for
business from department stores, specialty stores, discount stores, warehouse
stores, other off-price retailers and manufacturer-owned outlet stores, many of
which are units of large national or regional chains that have substantially
greater resources than we do. We also compete to some degree with retailers that
sell apparel and home accessories through catalogs or over the internet. The
retail apparel business may become even more competitive in the future.

dd’s DISCOUNTS

As of February 2, 2008, we
operated 52 dd’s DISCOUNTS

stores in four states. This newer
off-price concept targets the needs of households with more moderate incomes. We
believe this is one of the fastest growing demographic markets in the country.
dd’s DISCOUNTS features a moderately-priced assortment of first-quality,
in-season, name-brand and fashion apparel, accessories, footwear and home
merchandise at everyday savings of 20% to 70% off moderate department and
discount store regular prices. We opened ten initial locations in California
during the second half of 2004, another ten stores in 2005, six stores during
fiscal 2006, and 26 stores during fiscal 2007. This business generally has
similar merchandise departments and categories to those of Ross, but features a
different mix of brands, consisting mostly of moderate department store and
discount store labels at lower average price points. The typical dd’s DISCOUNTS
store is located in an established shopping center in a densely populated urban
or suburban neighborhood. The merchant, store and distribution organizations for
dd’s DISCOUNTS and Ross are separate and distinct; however, dd’s DISCOUNTS
shares certain other corporate and support services with Ross.

Item
1A.     Risk Factors.

Our Annual Report on Form 10-K for
fiscal 2007, and information we provide in our Annual Report to Stockholders,
press releases, telephonic reports and other investor communications, including
those on our website, may contain a number of forward-looking statements with
respect to anticipated future events and our projected financial performance,
operations and competitive position that are subject to risk factors that could
cause our actual results to differ materially from those forward-looking
statements and our prior expectations and projections. Refer to Management’s
Discussion and Analysis for a more complete identification and discussion of
“Forward-Looking Statements.”


Our financial condition, results
of operations, cash flows and the performance of our common stock may be
adversely affected by a number of risk factors. Risks and uncertainties that
apply to both Ross and dd’s DISCOUNTS include, without limitation, the
following:

We are subject to the economic
and industry risks that affect large retailers operating in the United States.

Our business is exposed to the
risks of a large, multi-store retailer, which must continually and efficiently
obtain and distribute a supply of fresh merchandise throughout a large and
growing network of stores. These risks factors include:

An increase in the level of competitive
  pressures in the retail apparel or home-related merchandise industry.

Potential changes in the level of consumer
  spending on or preferences for apparel or home-related merchandise, including
  the potential impact from uncertainty in mortgage credit markets and higher
  gas prices.

Potential changes in geopolitical and/or
  general economic conditions that could affect the availability of product
  and/or the level of consumer spending.

Unseasonable weather trends that could affect
  consumer demand for seasonal apparel and apparel-related products.

A change in the availability, quantity or
  quality of attractive brand-name merchandise at desirable discounts that could
  impact our ability to purchase product and continue to offer customers a wide
  assortment of merchandise at competitive prices.

Potential disruptions in the supply chain
  that could impact our ability to deliver product to our stores in a timely and
  cost-effective manner.

A change in the availability, quality or cost
  of new store real estate locations.

A downturn in the economy or a natural
  disaster in California or in another region where we have a concentration of
  stores or a distribution center. Our corporate headquarters, two distribution
  centers and

26% of our stores are located
  in California.

Higher than planned freight costs from
  higher-than-expected fuel surcharges.

We are subject to operating
risks as we attempt to execute on our merchandising and growth strategies.

The continued success of our
business depends, in part, upon our ability to increase sales at our existing
store locations, and to open new stores and to operate stores on a profitable
basis. Our existing strategies and store expansion programs may not result in a
continuation of our anticipated revenue or profit growth. In executing our
off-price retail strategies and working to improve efficiencies, expand our
store network, and reduce our costs, we face a number of operational risks,
including:

Our ability to attract and retain personnel
  with the retail talent necessary to execute our strategies.

Our ability to effectively operate our
  various supply chain, core merchandising and other information systems.

Our ability to improve our merchandising
  capabilities through the development and implementation of new processes and
  systems enhancements.

Our ability to improve new store sales and
  profitability, especially in newer regions and markets.

Our ability to achieve and maintain targeted
  levels of productivity and efficiency in our distribution centers.

Our ability to lease or acquire acceptable
  new store sites with favorable demographics and long term financial returns.

Our ability to identify and to successfully
  enter new geographic markets.

Our ability to achieve planned gross margins,
  by effectively managing inventories, markdowns, and shrink.

Our ability to effectively manage all
  operating costs of the business, the largest of which are payroll and benefit
  costs for stores and distribution centers.

Properties.

Stores

From August 1982 to February 2,
2008, we expanded from six Ross locations in California to 838 Ross stores in 27
states and Guam. In addition, we operate 52 dd’s DISCOUNTS locations in four
states. All stores are leased, with the exception of two locations which we own.

During fiscal 2007, we opened 71
new Ross stores, relocated one store and closed four existing locations. The
average new Ross store in fiscal 2007 was approximately 30,000 gross square
feet, yielding about 24,000 square feet of selling space. As of February 2,
2008, our 838 Ross stores generally ranged in size from about 25,000 to 35,000
gross square feet and had an average of 29,900 gross square feet and 23,700
selling square feet.

During fiscal 2007, we opened 26
new dd’s DISCOUNTS stores. The average new dd’s DISCOUNTS store in fiscal 2007
was approximately 23,000 gross square feet, yielding about 19,100 square feet of
selling space. As of February 2, 2008, our 52 dd’s DISCOUNTS stores had an
average of 25,000 gross square feet and 20,000 selling square feet. Our dd’s
DISCOUNTS stores are currently located in California, Florida, Texas, and
Arizona.

During fiscal 2007, no one store
accounted for more than 1% of our sales.

We carry earthquake insurance for
business interruption, inventory and personal property to mitigate our risk on
our corporate headquarters, distribution centers, buying offices, and all of our
stores.

Our real estate strategy in 2008
and 2009 is to open additional stores in existing states to increase our market
penetration and to reduce overhead and advertising expenses as a percentage of
sales in each market. Important considerations in evaluating a new store
location are the availability and quality of potential sites, demographic
characteristics, competition, and population density of the local trade area. In
addition, we continue to consider opportunistic real estate acquisitions.


The following table summarizes the
locations of our stores by state as of February 2, 2008 and February 3, 2007. At
February 2, 2008, we had 36 dd’s DISCOUNTS stores in California, 9 in Florida, 5
in Texas, and 2 in Arizona. At February 3, 2007, all 26 dd’s DISCOUNTS stores
were in California.

Where possible, we have obtained
sites in buildings requiring minimal alterations. This has allowed us to
establish stores in new locations in a relatively short period of time at
reasonable costs in a given market. To date, we have been able to secure leases
in suitable locations for our stores. At February 2, 2008, the majority of our
Ross stores had unexpired original lease terms ranging from three to ten years
with three to four renewal options of five years each. The average unexpired
original lease term of our leased stores is five years, or 22 years if renewal
options are included. At February 2, 2008, the majority of our dd’s DISCOUNTS
stores had unexpired original lease terms ranging from eight to ten years with
three to four renewal options of five years each. The average unexpired original
lease term of our dd’s DISCOUNTS stores is nine years, or 28 years if renewal
options are included. See Note E of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

See additional discussion under
“Stores” in Item 1.


Distribution Centers

We operate two 1.3 million square
foot distribution centers -- one in Fort Mill, South Carolina, and the other in
Perris, California. The South Carolina facility opened in July 2002 and was
originally financed under a synthetic lease. We exercised the option to purchase
this property in May 2006. The Perris, California facility opened in September
2003 and is financed with a ten-year synthetic lease facility that expires in
July 2013. We also own a 450,000 square foot distribution center located in
Carlisle, Pennsylvania. In addition, we own our 685,000 square foot Moreno
Valley, California distribution center, which we purchased in 2005 to increase
our distribution and packaway storage capacity. We are in the process of
expanding our Moreno Valley, California distribution center to 1.3 million
square feet. See additional discussion in Management’s Discussion and
Analysis.

In November 2001 we entered into a
nine-year lease for a 239,000 square foot warehouse and a ten-year lease for a
246,000 square foot warehouse in Carlisle, Pennsylvania. In June 2006, we
entered into a two-year lease extension with one one-year option for a 253,000
square foot warehouse in Fort Mill, South Carolina, extending the term to
February 2009. In March 2008, we amended the term of this lease to February 2010
and obtained three three-year options. In August 2007, we entered into a
five-year lease for a 423,000 square foot warehouse also in Fort Mill, South
Carolina. All four of these properties are used to store our packaway inventory.
We also lease a 10-acre parcel which we currently have under construction for
future trailer parking adjacent to our Perris distribution center.

See additional discussion under
“Distribution” in Item 1.

Other Leased Facilities

We lease approximately 181,000
square feet of office space for our corporate headquarters in Pleasanton,
California, under several leases. The terms for these leases expire between 2010
and 2014 and contain renewal provisions.

We lease approximately 138,000 and
15,000 square feet of office space for our New York and Los Angeles buying
offices, respectively. The terms for these leases expire in 2015 and 2011,
respectively. The lease term for the New York office contains a renewal
provision.

Item 3.    
Legal Proceedings.

We are party to various litigation
matters related to customers, vendors, and employees, including class action
lawsuits alleging misclassification of assistant store managers and missed meal
and rest break periods, and other litigation incident to our business. We
believe that none of these legal proceedings will have a material adverse effect
on our financial condition or results of operations. See Note J to Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements.

Selected Financial Data.

The following selected financial
data is derived from our consolidated financial statements. The data set forth
below should be read in conjunction with “Management’s Discussion and Analysis
of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” the section “Forward-Looking
Statements” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and our consolidated financial
statements and notes thereto.


Selected Financial Data


Item 7.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
      Results of Operations.

Overview

We are the second largest
off-price apparel and home goods retailer in the United States. At the end of
fiscal 2007, there were 838 Ross Dress for Less (“Ross”) locations in 27 states
and Guam, and 52 dd’s DISCOUNTS stores in four states. Ross offers
first-quality, in-season, name-brand and designer apparel, accessories, footwear
and home fashions at everyday savings of 20% to 60% off department and specialty
store regular prices. dd’s DISCOUNTS features a more moderately-priced
assortment of first-quality, in-season, name-brand apparel, accessories,
footwear and home fashions at everyday savings of 20% to 70% off moderate
department and discount store regular prices.

Our primary objective is to pursue
and refine our existing off-price strategies to drive gains in profitability and
improved financial returns over the long term. In establishing appropriate
growth targets for our business, we closely monitor market share trends for the
off-price industry. Total aggregate sales for the five largest off-price
retailers in the United States grew 6% during 2007 on top of an 8% increase in
2006. We believe this solid growth reflects the ongoing importance of value to
consumers. Our strategies are designed to take advantage of the expanding market
share of our off-price industry as well as continued customer demand for
name-brand fashions for the family and home at compelling everyday
discounts.

We refer to our fiscal years ended
February 2, 2008, February 3, 2007, and January 28, 2006 as fiscal 2007, fiscal
2006, and fiscal 2005, respectively. Fiscal 2006 was 53 weeks. Fiscal 2007 and
2005 were 52 weeks.

Results of Operations

The following table summarizes the
financial results for fiscal years ended February 2, 2008, February 3, 2007, and
January 28, 2006.


Stores.

Total stores open at the end of 2007, 2006 and 2005 were
890, 797 and 734, respectively. The number of stores at the end of fiscal 2007,
2006 and 2005 increased by 12%, 9% and 13% from the respective prior years. Our
expansion strategy is to open additional stores based on market penetration,
local demographic characteristics, competition, and the ability to leverage
overhead expenses. We continually evaluate opportunistic real estate
acquisitions and opportunities for potential new store locations. We also
evaluate our current store locations and determine store closures based on
similar criteria.

Sales.

Sales for fiscal 2007 increased $405.0 million, or 7.3%,
compared to the prior year due to the opening of 93 net new stores during 2007,
and a 1% increase in sales from “comparable” stores (defined as stores that have
been open for more than 14 complete months). Sales for fiscal 2006 increased
$626.0 million, or 12.7%, compared to the same period in the prior year due to
the opening of 63 net new stores during 2006, and a 4% increase in sales from
comparable stores.

We expect to address the
competitive climate for off-price apparel and home goods by pursuing and
refining our existing strategies and by continuing to strengthen our
organization, to diversify the merchandise mix, and to more fully develop the
organization and systems to improve regional and local merchandise offerings.
Although our strategies and store expansion program contributed to sales gains
in fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005, we cannot be sure that they will result in a
continuation of sales growth or an increase in net earnings.

Stock-based compensation.

Effective in fiscal 2006, we adopted
SFAS No. 123(R) and elected to adopt the standard using the modified prospective
transition method. This new accounting standard requires recognition of
compensation expense based on the grant date fair value of all stock-based
awards, typically amortized over the vesting period. The impact on results for
fiscal 2006 was to decrease earnings before taxes by approximately $13.2
million, and net income by approximately $8.0 million.

See Notes A and C in the Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on our stock-based
compensation plans and implementation of SFAS No. 123(R).


Cost of goods sold.

Cost of goods sold in fiscal 2007
increased $300.7 million compared to the prior year mainly due to increased
sales from the opening of 93 net new stores during the year, and a 1% increase
in sales from comparable stores.

Cost of goods sold as a percentage
of sales for fiscal 2007 decreased approximately 20 basis points from the prior
year. This improvement was mainly the result of a 20 basis point improvement in
merchandise margin primarily due to lower markdowns and shortage as a percent of
sales.

Cost of goods sold in fiscal 2006
increased $464.9 million compared to the same period in the prior year mainly
due to increased sales from the opening of 63 net new stores during the year, a
4% increase in sales from comparable stores, and additional stock compensation
expenses recognized pursuant to SFAS No. 123(R).

Cost of goods sold as a percentage
of sales for fiscal 2006 decreased approximately 40 basis points compared with
the same period in the prior year. This improvement was driven mainly by a 40
basis point improvement in merchandise gross margin, primarily due to lower
markdowns and shortage as a percent of sales, and a 35 basis point improvement
in distribution costs. These gains were partially offset by an approximate 25
basis point increase in freight costs and a 10 basis point increase in expenses
related to SFAS No. 123(R).

We cannot be sure that the gross
profit margins realized in fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005 will continue in future
years.

Selling, general and
administrative expenses.

For fiscal
2007, selling, general and administrative expenses (“SG&A”) increased $72.9
million compared to the prior year, mainly due to increased store operating
costs reflecting the opening of 93 net new stores during the year.

SG&A as a percentage of sales
for fiscal 2007 grew by approximately 15 basis points over the prior year. This
increase was mainly driven by a 40 basis point rise in store operating expenses
compared to fiscal 2006, which benefited from leverage related to the

rd

week. Store operating costs in 2007 were also impacted by
minimum wage increases and the de-leveraging effect of the 1% gain in comparable
store sales. These cost pressures were partially offset by a 25 basis point
decline in other general and administrative costs.

For fiscal 2006, SG&A
increased $96.9 million compared to the same period in the prior year, mainly
due to increased store operating costs reflecting the opening of 63 net new
stores during the year.

For fiscal 2006, SG&A as a
percentage of sales was unchanged compared to the same period in the prior year.
An approximately 15 basis point increase in expense related to SFAS No. 123(R)
and a 5 basis point increase in store related expenses were offset by a 20 basis
point decrease in other general and administrative costs related to lower
workers’ compensation costs and leverage on the 53

rd

week of
operations in fiscal 2006.

The largest component of SG&A
is payroll. The total number of employees, including both full and part-time, as
of fiscal year end 2007, 2006, and 2005 was approximately 39,100, 35,800, and
33,200, respectively.


Interest.

In fiscal 2007, interest expense increased $6.9 million
due to higher average borrowings as compared to the prior year, and interest
income increased $2.3 million due to higher cash and investment balances as
compared to the prior year. As a percentage of sales, the reduction in net
interest income in fiscal 2007 decreased pre-tax earnings by approximately 10
basis points compared to the same period in the prior year. The table below
shows interest expense and income for fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005:

      millions)

Taxes on earnings.

Our effective tax rate for fiscal 2007,
2006 and 2005 was approximately

39%, which represents the applicable
combined federal and state statutory rates reduced by the federal benefit of
state taxes deductible on federal returns. The effective rate is affected by
changes in law, location of new stores, level of earnings and the result of tax
audits. We anticipate that our effective tax rate for fiscal 2008 will be in the
range of 38% to 40%.

Net earnings.

Net earnings as a percentage of sales for fiscal 2007
were higher compared to fiscal 2006 primarily due to lower cost of goods sold as
a percentage of sales, partially offset by higher SG&A expenses as a
percentage of sales. Net earnings as a percentage of sales for fiscal 2006 were
higher compared to fiscal 2005 primarily due to lower cost of goods sold and
higher interest income as a percentage of sales while SG&A expenses as a
percentage of sales remained unchanged.

Earnings per share.

Diluted earnings per share in fiscal
2007 were $1.90, compared to $1.70 in fiscal 2006 on a 53-week basis. This 12%
increase in diluted earnings per share is attributable to an approximate 8%
increase in net earnings and a 3% reduction in weighted average diluted shares
outstanding, largely due to the repurchase of common stock under our stock
repurchase program. Diluted earnings per share in fiscal 2006 were $1.70,
compared to $1.36 in fiscal 2005. This 25% increase in diluted earnings per
share is attributable to an approximate 21% increase in net earnings and a 3%
reduction in weighted average diluted shares outstanding largely due to the
repurchase of common stock under our stock repurchase program.


Financial Condition

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Our primary sources of funds for
our business activities are cash flows from operations and short-term trade
credit. Our primary ongoing cash requirements are for seasonal and new store
merchandise inventory purchases, capital expenditures in connection with opening
new stores, and investments in distribution centers, information systems and
infrastructure. We also use cash to repurchase stock under our stock repurchase
program and to pay dividends.

Operating Activities

Net cash provided by operating
activities was $353.6 million, $506.9 million and $375.2 million in fiscal 2007,
2006 and 2005, respectively. The primary source of cash provided by operating
activities in fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005 was net earnings plus non-cash expenses
for depreciation and amortization, partially offset by cash used to finance
merchandise inventory. The increase in cash flow from operating activities
resulted from an increase in accounts payable in 2006 over 2005 of $221.6
million primarily driven by timing associated with the additional

rd

week in fiscal 2006.

Working capital (defined as
current assets less current liabilities) was $387.4 million at the end of fiscal
2007, compared to $431.7 million at the end of fiscal 2006, and $349.9 million
at the end of fiscal 2005. The decrease in working capital in fiscal 2007
compared to fiscal 2006 is primarily due to lower cash and investments and
timing associated with the additional 53

rd

week in fiscal 2006. The
increase in working capital in fiscal 2006 compared to fiscal 2005 is primarily
due to higher cash and investments.

Our primary source of liquidity is
the sale of our merchandise inventory. We regularly review the age and condition
of our merchandise and are able to maintain current merchandise inventory in our
stores through replenishment processes and liquidation of slower-moving
merchandise through clearance markdowns.


Investing Activities

In fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005, our
capital expenditures (excluding leased equipment) were approximately $236.1
million, $223.9 million and $175.9 million, respectively, for fixtures and
leasehold improvements to open new stores, implement information technology
systems, build distribution centers and implement material handling equipment
and related distribution center systems, and various other expenditures related
to our stores, buying and corporate offices. Fiscal 2006 included the purchase
of distribution center assets under a lease of $87.3 million. We opened 97, 66
and 86 new stores and relocated one, two, and two stores in fiscal 2007, 2006
and 2005, respectively.

In fiscal 2007 we had purchases of
investments of $146.1 million and sales of investments of $137.1 million. In
fiscal 2006 we had purchases of investments of $71.9 million and sales of
investments of $59.3 million. In fiscal 2005 we had purchases of $313.6 million
and sales of investments of $357.0 million.

We are forecasting approximately
$250 million in capital requirements in 2008 to fund expenditures for fixtures
and leasehold improvements to open both new Ross and dd’s DISCOUNTS stores, the
relocation, or upgrade of existing stores, and investments in store and
merchandising systems, distribution center land, buildings, equipment and
systems, and various buying and corporate office expenditures. We expect to fund
these expenditures with cash flows from operations and existing credit
facilities.

Our capital expenditures over the
last three years are set forth in the table below:

Financing Activities

During fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005,
our liquidity and capital requirements were provided by cash flows from
operations, trade credit, and issuance of senior notes. All but two of our store
locations, our buying offices, our corporate headquarters, and one distribution
center are leased and, except for certain leasehold improvements and equipment,
do not represent long-term capital investments. We own three distribution
centers in Carlisle, Pennsylvania, Moreno Valley, California, and Fort Mill,
South Carolina.

In November 2005, we announced
that our Board of Directors authorized a two-year stock repurchase program of up
to $400 million for 2006 and 2007. We repurchased 6.9 million and 7.1 million
shares of common stock for aggregate purchase prices of approximately $200
million in both 2007 and 2006. These repurchases were funded by cash flows from
operations.

In March 2006, we repaid our $50
million term debt in full. In October 2006, we entered into a Note Purchase
Agreement with various institutional investors for $150 million of unsecured,
senior notes. See “Senior Notes” below for more information.


In January 2008, our Board of
Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend payment of $.095 per common share,
payable on or about March 31, 2008. Our Board of Directors declared quarterly
cash dividends of $.075 per common share in January, May, August and November
2007, and cash dividends of $.06 per common share in January, May, August, and
November 2006. Also in January 2008 our Board of Directors approved a new
two-year $600 million stock repurchase program for fiscal 2008 and 2009.

Short-term trade credit represents
a significant source of financing for investments in merchandise inventory.
Trade credit arises from customary payment terms and trade practices with our
vendors. We regularly review the adequacy of credit available to us from all
sources and expect to be able to maintain adequate trade, bank and other credit
lines to meet our capital and liquidity requirements, including lease payment
obligations in 2008.

We estimate that cash flows from
operations, bank credit lines and trade credit are adequate to meet operating
cash needs, fund our planned capital investments, repurchase common stock and
make quarterly dividend payments for at least the next twelve months.

Pursuant to the guidelines of FIN 48, a $23.2
      million reserve for unrecognized tax benefits is included in other
      long-term liabilities on the Company’s consolidated balance sheet. These
      obligations are excluded from the schedule above as the timing of payments
      cannot be reasonably estimated.

Senior Notes.

In October 2006, we entered into a Note Purchase
Agreement with various institutional investors for $150 million of unsecured,
senior notes. The notes were issued in two series and funding occurred in
December 2006. Series A notes were issued for an aggregate of $85 million, are
due in December 2018, and bear interest at a rate of 6.38%. Series B notes were
issued for an aggregate of $65 million, are due in December 2021, and bear
interest at a rate of 6.53%. Interest on these notes is included in Interest
payment obligations in the table above.

Borrowings under these notes are
subject to certain operating and financial covenants including maintaining
certain interest coverage and leverage ratios. As of February 2, 2008, we were
in compliance with these covenants.

Off-Balance Sheet
Arrangements

Operating leases.

All but two of our store sites, one of
our distribution centers, and our buying offices and corporate headquarters are
leased and, except for certain leasehold improvements and equipment, do not
represent long-term capital investments.


We have lease arrangements for
certain equipment in our stores for our point-of-sale (“POS”) hardware and
software systems. These leases are accounted for as operating leases for
financial reporting purposes. The initial terms of these leases are two years,
and we typically have options to renew the leases for two to three one-year
periods. Alternatively, we may purchase or return the equipment at the end of
the initial or each renewal term. We have guaranteed the value of the equipment
of $6.1 million, at the end of the respective initial lease terms, which is
included in Other synthetic lease obligations in the table above.

We lease approximately 181,000
square feet of office space for our corporate headquarters in Pleasanton,
California, under several facility leases. The terms for these leases expire
between 2010 and 2014 and contain renewal provisions.

The Company leases approximately
138,000 and 15,000 square feet of office space for our New York and Los Angeles
buying offices, respectively. The lease terms for these facilities expire in
2015 and 2011, respectively. The lease term for the New York office contains a
renewal provision.

We lease a 1.3 million square foot
distribution center in Perris, California. The land and building for this
distribution center are financed under a $70 million ten-year synthetic lease
that expires in July 2013. Rent expense on this center is payable monthly at a
fixed annual rate of 5.8% on the lease balance of $70 million. At the end of the
lease term, we have the option to either refinance the $70 million synthetic
lease facility, purchase the distribution center at the amount of the
then-outstanding lease obligation, or arrange a sale of the distribution center
to a third party. If the distribution center is sold to a third party for less
than $70 million, we have agreed under a residual value guarantee to pay the
lessor any shortfall amount up to $56 million. Our contractual obligation of $56
million is included in Other synthetic lease obligations in the above table.

In accordance with Financial
Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Interpretation (“FIN”) No. 45, “Guarantor’s
Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect
Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others,” we have recognized a liability and
corresponding asset for the fair value of the residual value guarantee in the
amount of $8.3 million for the Perris, California distribution center and $0.6
million for the POS leases. These residual value guarantees are being amortized
on a straight-line basis over the original terms of the leases. The current
portion of the related asset and liability is recorded in prepaid expenses and
accrued expenses, respectively, and the long-term portion of the related assets
and liabilities is recorded in other long-term assets and other long-term
liabilities, respectively, in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.

In November 2001 we entered into a
nine-year lease for a 239,000 square foot warehouse and a ten-year lease for a
246,000 square foot warehouse in Carlisle, Pennsylvania. In June 2006, we
entered into a two-year lease extension with one one-year option for a 253,000
square foot warehouse in Fort Mill, South Carolina, extending the term to
February 2009. In March 2008, we amended the term of this lease to February 2010
and obtained three three-year options. In August 2007, we entered into a
five-year lease for a 423,000 square foot warehouse also in Fort Mill, South
Carolina. All four of these properties are used to store our packaway inventory.
We also lease a 10-acre parcel which we currently have under construction for
future trailer parking adjacent to our Perris distribution center.

The synthetic lease facilities
described above, as well as our revolving credit facility and senior notes, have
covenant restrictions requiring us to maintain certain interest coverage and
leverage ratios. In addition, the interest rates under these agreements may vary
depending on actual interest coverage ratios achieved. As of February 2, 2008,
we were in compliance with these covenants.

Purchase obligations.

As of February 2, 2008 we had purchase
obligations of $771.1 million. These purchase obligations primarily consist of
merchandise inventory purchase orders, commitments related to store fixtures and
supplies, and information technology service and maintenance contracts.
Merchandise inventory purchase orders of $692.9 million represent purchase
obligations of less than one year as of February 2, 2008.

Revolving credit
facility.

We have available a $600
million revolving credit facility with our banks, which contains a $300 million
sublimit for issuance of standby letters of credit, of which $238.9 million was
available at February 2, 2008. In July 2006, we amended this facility to extend
the expiration date to July 2011 and change the letter of credit sublimit and
interest pricing. Interest is LIBOR-based plus an applicable margin (currently
45 basis points) and is payable upon borrowing maturity but no less than
quarterly. Our borrowing ability under this credit facility is subject to our
maintaining certain interest coverage and leverage ratios. As of February 2,
2008 we had no borrowings outstanding under this facility and were in compliance
with the covenants.

Standby letters of credit.

We use standby letters of credit to
collateralize certain obligations related to our self-insured workers’
compensation and general liability claims. We had $61.1 million and $66.4
million in standby letters of credit outstanding at February 2, 2008 and
February 3, 2007, respectively.

Trade letters of credit.

We had $20.8 million and $26.0 million
in trade letters of credit outstanding at February 2, 2008 and February 3, 2007,
respectively.

Other Activities

Distribution center purchase.

In May 2006, we exercised our option to
purchase our Fort Mill, South Carolina distribution center and paid cash in the
amount of $87.3 million to acquire the facility from the lessor. We estimated
the fair value of the components of the facility and the related equipment using
various valuation techniques, including appraisals, market prices, and cost
data. The amounts we recorded for each component were based on these fair value
estimates.

Critical Accounting Policies

The preparation of our
consolidated financial statements requires our management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts. These estimates and assumptions
are evaluated on an ongoing basis and are based on historical experience and on
various other factors that management believes to be reasonable. We believe the
following critical accounting policies describe the more significant judgments
and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.

Merchandise
inventory.

Our merchandise inventory is
stated at the lower of cost or market, with cost determined on a weighted
average cost basis. We purchase manufacturer overruns and canceled orders both
during and at the end of a season which are referred to as "packaway" inventory.
Packaway inventory is purchased with the intent that it will be stored in our
warehouses until a later date, which may even be the beginning of the same
selling season in the following year.


Included in the carrying value of
our merchandise inventory is a provision for shortage. The shortage reserve is
based on historical shortage rates as evaluated through our periodic physical
merchandise inventory counts and cycle counts. If actual market conditions,
markdowns, or shortage are less favorable than those projected by us, or if
sales of the merchandise inventory are more difficult than anticipated,
additional merchandise inventory write-downs may be required.

Long-lived assets.

We record a long-lived asset impairment
charge when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount
of a long-lived asset may not be recoverable based on estimated future cash
flows. An impairment loss would be recognized if analysis of the undiscounted
cash flow of an asset group was less than the carrying value of the asset group.
If our actual results differ materially from projected results, an impairment
charge may be required in the future. In the course of performing our annual
analysis, we determined that no long-lived asset impairment charge was required
for fiscal 2007, 2006, or 2005.

Depreciation and amortization
expense.

Property and equipment are
stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation is
calculated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the
asset, typically ranging from five to twelve years for equipment and 20 to 40
years for real property. The cost of leasehold improvements is amortized over
the lesser of the useful life of the asset or the applicable lease
term.

Lease accounting.

When a lease contains “rent holidays” or
requires fixed escalations of the minimum lease payments, we record rental
expense on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease and the difference
between the average rental amount charged to expense and the amount payable
under the lease is recorded as deferred rent. We amortize deferred rent on a
straight-line basis over the lease term commencing on the possession date.
Tenant improvement allowances are included in other long-term liabilities and
are amortized over the lease term. Tenant improvement allowances are included as
a component of operating cash flows in the consolidated Statements of Cash
Flows.

Self-insurance.

We self insure certain of our workers’ compensation and
general liability risks as well as certain coverages under our health plans. Our
self-insurance liability is determined actuarially, based on claims filed and an
estimate of claims incurred but not reported. Should a greater amount of claims
occur compared to what is estimated or the costs of medical care increase beyond
what was anticipated, our recorded reserves may not be sufficient and additional
charges could be required.

Stock-based compensation.

We account for stock-based compensation
under the provisions of SFAS No. 123(R).

The determination of the fair
value of stock options and Employee Stock Purchase Plan (“ESPP”) shares, using
the Black-Scholes model, is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions
as to our expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards, actual
and projected employee stock option exercise behavior, the risk-free interest
rate and expected dividends.

SFAS No. 123(R) requires companies
to estimate future expected forfeitures at the date of grant and revise those
estimates in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those
estimates. In previous fiscal years, we had recognized the impact of forfeitures
as they occurred. Starting in fiscal 2006, we use historical data to estimate
pre-vesting forfeitures and to recognize stock-based compensation expense. All
stock-based compensation awards are amortized on a straight-line basis over the
requisite service periods of the awards.

Income Taxes.

We adopted FASB Interpretation No. 48, “Accounting for
Uncertainty in Income Taxes” (FIN 48), which supplements SFAS No. 109
“Accounting for Income Taxes” (SFAS No. 109) effective February 4, 2007. FIN 48
clarifies the criteria that an individual tax position must satisfy for some or
all of the benefits of that position to be recognized in a company’s
consolidated financial statements. FIN 48 prescribes a recognition threshold of
more-likely-than-not, and a measurement standard for all tax positions taken or
expected to be taken on a tax return, in order for those tax positions to be
recognized in the consolidated financial statements.


The critical accounting policies
noted above are not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of our accounting
policies. In many cases, the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is
specifically dictated by Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“GAAP”), with
no need for management’s judgment in their application. There are also areas in
which management’s judgment in selecting one alternative accounting principle
over another would not produce a materially different result. See our audited
consolidated financial statements and notes thereto under Item 8 in this Annual
Report on Form 10-K, which contain accounting policies and other disclosures
required by GAAP.

Effects of inflation or
deflation.

We do not consider the
effects of inflation or deflation to be material to our financial position and
results of operations.

New Accounting
Pronouncements

SFAS No. 157, “Fair Value
Measurements” (“SFAS No. 157”), is effective for fiscal years beginning after
November 15, 2007. SFAS No. 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for
measuring fair value and expands required disclosures about fair value
measurements. We do not believe the adoption of SFAS No. 157 will have a
material impact on our operating results or financial position.

SFAS No. 159, “The Fair Value
Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities” (“SFAS No. 159”) is
effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. SFAS No. 159
establishes a fair value option under which entities can elect to report certain
financial assets and liabilities at fair value, with changes in fair value
recognized in earnings. We do not believe the adoption of SFAS No. 159 will have
a material impact on our operating results or financial position.

Forward-Looking Statements

Our Annual Report on Form 10-K for
fiscal 2007, and information we provide in our Annual Report to Stockholders,
press releases, telephonic reports and other investor communications including
on our website, may contain a number of forward-looking statements regarding,
without limitation, planned store growth, new markets, expected sales, projected
earnings levels, capital expenditures and other matters. These forward-looking
statements reflect our then current beliefs, projections and estimates with
respect to future events and our projected financial performance, operations and
competitive position. The words “plan,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “estimate,”
“believe,” “forecast,” “projected,” “guidance,” “looking ahead” and similar
expressions identify forward-looking statements.

Future economic and industry
trends that could potentially impact revenue, profitability, and growth remain
difficult to predict. As a result, our forward-looking statements are subject to
risks and uncertainties which could cause our actual results to differ
materially from those forward-looking statements and our previous expectations
and projections. Refer to Item 1A in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a more
complete discussion of risk factors for Ross and dd’s DISCOUNTS. The factors
underlying our forecasts are dynamic and subject to change. As a result, any
forecasts or forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are given
and do not necessarily reflect our outlook at any other point in time. We do not
undertake to update or revise these forward-looking statements.


ITEM
7A.     QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT
MARKET RISK.

We are exposed to market risks,
which primarily include changes in interest rates. We do not engage in financial
transactions for trading or speculative purposes.

We occasionally use forward
contracts to hedge against fluctuations in foreign currency prices. We had no
outstanding forward contracts as of February 2, 2008.

Interest that is payable on our
revolving credit facilities is based on variable interest rates and is,
therefore, affected by changes in market interest rates. In addition, lease
payments under certain of our synthetic lease agreements are determined based on
variable interest rates and are, therefore, affected by changes in market
interest rates. As of February 2, 2008, we had no borrowings outstanding under
our revolving credit facilities. In addition, we issued notes to institutional
investors in two series: Series A for $85.0 million accrues interest at 6.38%
and Series B for $65.0 million accrues interest at 6.53%. The amount outstanding
under these notes as of February 2, 2008 is $150.0 million.

A hypothetical 100 basis point
increase in prevailing market interest rates would not have materially impacted
our consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows as of
and for the year ended February 2, 2008. We do not consider the potential losses
in future earnings and cash flows from reasonably possible, near term changes in
interest rates to be material.

Note A: Summary of Significant
Accounting Policies

Business.

Ross Stores, Inc.
and its subsidiaries (the “Company”) is an off-price retailer of first-quality,
name brand apparel, shoes and accessories for the entire family, as well as gift
items, linens and other home-related merchandise. At the end of fiscal 2007,
there were 838 Ross Dress for Less

®

(“Ross”) locations in 27 states
and Guam and 52 dd’s DISCOUNTS

®

stores in four states, which are
supported by four distribution centers. The Company’s headquarters, two
distribution centers and 26% of its stores are located in California.

Basis of presentation and
fiscal year.

The consolidated financial
statements include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries, all of
which are wholly-owned. Intercompany transactions and accounts have been
eliminated. The Company follows the National Retail Federation fiscal calendar
and utilizes a 52-53 week fiscal year whereby the fiscal year ends on the
Saturday nearest to January 31. The fiscal years ended February 2, 2008,
February 3, 2007 and January 28, 2006 are referred to as fiscal 2007, fiscal
2006 and fiscal 2005, respectively. Fiscal 2006 was 53 weeks. Fiscal 2007 and
2005 were 52 weeks.

Use of accounting estimates.

The preparation of consolidated
financial statements in conformity with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles
in the United States of America (“GAAP”) requires the Company to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities and
disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated
financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the
reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The
Company’s significant accounting estimates include valuation of merchandise
inventory and long-lived assets, and accruals for self-insurance.

Purchase obligations.

As of February 2, 2008, the Company had
purchase obligations of $771.1 million. These purchase obligations primarily
consist of merchandise inventory purchase orders, commitments related to store
fixtures and supplies, and information technology service and maintenance
contracts. Merchandise inventory purchase orders of $692.9 million represent
purchase obligations of less than one year as of February 2, 2008.

Cash and cash equivalents.

Cash and cash equivalents are highly
liquid, fixed income instruments purchased with an original maturity of three
months or less.

Investments.

The Company’s investments are comprised of various debt
and equity investment securities. At February 2, 2008 and February 3, 2007,
these investments were classified as available-for-sale and are stated at fair
value. Investments are classified as either short-term or long-term based on
their original maturities. Investments with an original maturity of less than
one year are classified as short-term. See Note B for additional
information.

Merchandise inventory.

Merchandise inventory is stated at the
lower of cost (determined using a weighted average basis) or net realizable
value. The Company purchases manufacturer overruns and canceled orders both
during and at the end of a season which are referred to as "packaway" inventory.
Packaway inventory is purchased with the intent that it will be stored in the
Company's warehouses until a later date, which may even be the beginning of the
same selling season in the following year. Packaway inventory accounted for
approximately 38% of total inventories as of February 2, 2008 and February 3,
2007. The cost of the Company’s merchandise inventory is reduced by valuation
reserves for shortage based on historical shortage experience from the Company’s
physical merchandise inventory counts and cycle counts.

Cost of goods sold.

In addition to

product costs,
the Company includes in cost of goods sold its buying, distribution and freight
expenses as well as occupancy costs, and depreciation and amortization related
to the Company’s retail stores, buying and distribution facilities. Buying
expenses include costs to procure merchandise inventories. Distribution expenses
include the cost of operating the Company’s distribution centers. Beginning in
fiscal 2006, the portion of stock option and employee stock purchase plan
(“ESPP”) expenses included in stock-based compensation expense for personnel in
the merchandising and distribution organizations is included in cost of goods
sold.


Property and equipment.

Property and equipment are stated at
cost, less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation is calculated
using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the asset,
typically ranging from five to twelve years for equipment and 20 to 40 years for
real property. Depreciation and amortization expense on property and equipment
was $120.7 million, $107.8 million and $93.7 million for fiscal 2007, 2006 and
2005, respectively. The cost of leasehold improvements is amortized over the
useful life of the asset or the applicable lease term, whichever is less.
Computer hardware and software costs, net of amortization, of $136.4 million and
$147.9 million at February 2, 2008 and February 3, 2007, respectively, are
included in fixtures and equipment and are amortized over their estimated useful
life generally ranging from five to seven years. The Company capitalizes
interest during the construction period. Interest capitalized was $0.9 million
and $0.0 million in fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2006, respectively.

In May 2006, the Company exercised
its option to purchase its Fort Mill, South Carolina distribution center and
paid cash in the amount of $87.3 million to acquire the facility from the
lessor. The Company estimated the fair value of the components of the facility
and the related equipment using various valuation techniques, including
appraisals, market prices, and cost data. Amounts recorded for each component
were based on these fair value estimates.

Other long-term
assets.

Other long-term assets as of
February 2, 2008 and February 3, 2007 consist of the following:

Intangible assets

are principally
comprised of lease rights, which are payments made to acquire store leases. An
impairment loss would be recognized if the undiscounted cash flow of an asset
group was less than the carrying value of the asset group.

Lease rights are
amortized over the remaining life of the lease. Amortization expense related to
these intangible assets was $0.0 million, $0.3 million and $0.5 million for
fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.

Other long-term assets and certain
identifiable intangibles that are subject to amortization are reviewed for
impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the
carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Intangible assets that are
not subject to amortization, including goodwill, are tested for impairment
annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that
the asset may be impaired. Based on the Company’s evaluation as of February 2,
2008 and February 3, 2007, no adjustments were required to reduce the carrying
value of intangible assets to fair value.

Store closures.

The Company continually reviews the operating
performance of individual stores. For stores that are to be closed, the Company
records a liability for future minimum lease payments and related ancillary
costs at the time the liability is incurred. Operating costs, including
depreciation, of stores to be closed are expensed during the period they remain
in use.

Accounts payable.

Accounts payable represents amounts owed
to third parties at the end of the period. Accounts payable includes book cash
overdrafts (checks issued under zero balance accounts not yet presented for
payment) in excess of cash balances in such accounts of approximately $102.0
million and $165.0 million at February 2, 2008 and February 3, 2007,
respectively. The Company includes the change in book cash overdrafts in
operating cash flows.


Self-insurance.

The Company is self-insured for workers’ compensation,
general liability insurance costs and costs of certain medical plans. The
self-insurance liability is determined actuarially, based on claims filed and an
estimate of claims incurred but not yet reported. Self-insurance reserves as of
February 2, 2008 and February 3, 2007 consist of the following:

Lease
accounting.

When a lease contains “rent
holidays” or requires fixed escalations of the minimum lease payments, the
Company records rental expense on a straight-line basis over the term of the
lease and the difference between the average rental amount charged to expense
and the amount payable under the lease is recorded as deferred rent. The Company
amortizes deferred rent on a straight-line basis over the lease term commencing
on the possession date. As of February 2, 2008 and February 3, 2007, the balance
of deferred rent was $55.7 million and $47.2 million, respectively, and is
included in other long-term liabilities. Tenant improvement allowances are
included in other long-term liabilities and are amortized over the lease term.
Changes in tenant improvement allowances are included as a component of
operating activities in the consolidated statement of cash flows.

Other long-term liabilities.

recognition.

The Company recognizes
revenue at the point of sale, net of actual returns, and maintains an allowance
for estimated future returns. Sales of gift cards are deferred until they are
redeemed for the purchase of Company merchandise. Sales tax collected is not
recognized as revenue and is included in accrued expenses and other.


Allowance for sales returns.

An allowance for the gross margin loss

Store pre-opening costs are expensed in
the period incurred.

Advertising.

Advertising costs are expensed in the period incurred.
Advertising costs for fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005 were $50.2 million, $45.5
million and $44.2 million, respectively.

Stock-based compensation.

Effective in fiscal 2006, the Company
adopted SFAS No. 123(R) and elected to adopt the standard using the modified
prospective transition method. SFAS No. 123(R) replaces SFAS No. 123,
“Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation,” and supersedes Accounting Principles
Board (“APB”) Opinion No. 25, “Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees.” This
accounting standard requires recognition of compensation expense based upon the
grant date fair value of all stock-based awards, typically over the vesting
period. See Note C for more information on the Company’s stock-based
compensation plans.

Taxes on earnings.

SFAS No. 109, “Accounting for Income
Taxes,” requires income taxes to be accounted for under an asset and liability
approach that requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities
for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in
the Company's consolidated financial statements or tax returns. In estimating
future tax consequences, the Company generally considers all expected future
events other than changes in the tax law or tax rates.

The Company adopted FASB
Interpretation No. 48, “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes” (FIN 48),
which supplements SFAS No. 109 “Accounting for Income Taxes” (SFAS No. 109)
effective February 4, 2007. FIN 48 clarifies the criteria that an individual tax
position must satisfy for some or all of the benefits of that position to be
recognized in a company’s consolidated financial statements. FIN 48 prescribes a
recognition threshold of more-likely-than-not, and a measurement standard for
all tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return, in order for
those tax positions to be recognized in the consolidated financial statements.

Treasury stock.

The Company records treasury stock at
cost. Treasury stock includes shares purchased from employees for tax
withholding purposes related to vesting of restricted stock
grants.

Earnings per
share

(“EPS”).

SFAS No. 128, “Earnings
Per Share,” requires earnings per share to be computed and reported as both
basic EPS and diluted EPS. Basic EPS is computed by dividing net earnings by the
weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted EPS
is computed by dividing net earnings by the sum of the weighted average number
of common shares and dilutive common stock equivalents outstanding during the
period. Diluted EPS reflects the total potential dilution that could occur from
outstanding equity plan awards, including unexercised stock options and unvested
shares of both performance and non-performance based awards of restricted
stock.

In fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005
there were 1,277,000, 3,114,000, and 2,778,000 weighted average shares,
respectively, that could potentially dilute basic EPS in the future that were
excluded from the calculation of diluted EPS because their effect would have
been anti-dilutive (option exercise price exceeds average stock price) in the
periods presented.


The following is a reconciliation
of the number of shares (denominator) used in the basic and diluted EPS
computations:

Segment reporting.

The Company has one reportable operating
segment. The Company’s operations include only activities related to off-price
retailing in stores throughout the United States and, therefore, comprise only
one segment.

Comprehensive
income.

Comprehensive income consists of
net earnings and other comprehensive income, principally unrealized investment
gains and losses. Components of comprehensive income are presented in the
consolidated statements of stockholders’ equity.

Derivative instruments and
hedging activities.

SFAS No. 133,
“Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities,” as amended,
requires the Company to record all derivatives as either assets or liabilities
on the balance sheet and to measure those instruments at fair value. The Company
had no derivative instruments as of February 2, 2008 or February 3, 2007.

New accounting pronouncements.

SFAS No. 157, “Fair Value
Measurements” (“SFAS No. 157”), is effective for fiscal years beginning after
November 15, 2007. SFAS No. 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for
measuring fair value and expands required disclosures about fair value
measurements. The Company does not believe the adoption of SFAS No. 157 will
have a material impact on the Company’s operating results or financial position.

SFAS No. 159, “The Fair Value
Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities” (“SFAS No. 159”) is
effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. SFAS No. 159
establishes a fair value option under which entities can elect to report certain
financial assets and liabilities at fair value, with changes in fair value
recognized in earnings. The Company does not believe the adoption of SFAS No.
159 will have a material impact on the Company’s operating results or financial
position.

At February 2, 2008, one $150,000
security with a gross unrealized loss of $5,000 had been in a continuous
unrealized loss position for more than 12 months. Investments of $6.4 million
with gross unrealized losses of $200,000 had been in a continuous unrealized
loss position for less than 12 months. The unrealized losses on our investments
were caused primarily by the decline in the residential mortgage investment
sector of the market and were not due to the credit quality of the issuers. We
do not consider these investments to be other than temporarily impaired at
February 2, 2008.

Note C: Stock-based
compensation

The Company adopted the provisions
of SFAS No. 123(R) on January 29, 2006, the beginning of fiscal 2006, using the
modified prospective method. Under SFAS No. 123(R), compensation expense is
recognized based on the grant date fair value of stock-based compensation awards
granted in fiscal 2006 and later, and based on the unvested portion of awards
from prior year grants that were outstanding as of January 28, 2006. Stock-based
awards are valued using the Black-Scholes option pricing model, consistent with
the Company’s prior pro forma disclosures under SFAS No. 123. Compensation
expense for unvested awards outstanding at the date of adoption is recognized
over the remaining vesting period using the compensation cost calculated for
purposes of the prior pro forma disclosures. For awards granted after the
adoption date, the Company recognizes expense based on the fair value of the
award on a straight-line basis over the applicable vesting period.

For fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005 the
Company recognized stock-based compensation expense as follows:

($000)

Capitalized stock-based
compensation cost was not significant in any year.

The determination of the fair
value of stock options and ESPP purchase rights, using the Black-Scholes model,
is affected by the Company’s stock price as well as assumptions as to the
Company’s expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards, actual
and projected employee stock option exercise behavior, the risk-free interest
rate, and expected dividends.

The Company estimates the expected
term of options granted taking into account historical and expected future
exercise, cancellation and forfeiture behavior. The Company estimates the
volatility of the common stock by using historical volatility over a period
equal to the award’s expected term. The risk-free interest rates that are used
in the valuation models are based upon yields of U.S. Treasury issues with
remaining terms similar to the expected term on the options. Dividend yield has
been estimated based on the Company’s expectation as to future dividend
payouts.


SFAS No. 123(R) requires companies
to estimate future expected forfeitures at the date of grant and revise those
estimates in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those
estimates. In previous fiscal years, the Company had recognized the impact of
forfeitures as they occurred. Now, the Company uses historical data to estimate
pre-vesting forfeiture rates in determining the amount of stock-based
compensation expense to recognize. All stock-based compensation awards are
amortized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service periods of the
awards.

At February 2, 2008, the Company
had two stock-based compensation plans, which are further described in Note H.
The fair value of stock options and ESPP rights granted during the respective
periods under these plans were estimated using the Black-Scholes option pricing
model and the following weighted average assumptions:

Prior to fiscal 2006, the Company
had accounted for share-based compensation costs in accordance with APB No. 25,
as permitted by SFAS No. 123. Had compensation costs for the Company's stock
option plans been determined based on the fair value at the grant dates for
awards under those plans consistent with the methods of SFAS No. 123, the
Company’s net earnings and earnings per share would have been reduced to the pro
forma amounts indicated below:

The weighted average fair values
per share of stock options granted during fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005 were $9.12,
$8.52 and $7.85, respectively. The weighted average fair values per share of
employee stock purchase awards for fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005 were $8.02, $7.72
and $7.97, respectively.

Note D: Debt

Bank credit
facilities.

In July 2006, the Company
amended its existing $600 million revolving credit facility with its banks,
extending the expiration date to July 2011, extending the standby letter of
credit sublimit to 50% of the revolving credit, and changing the interest rate
to LIBOR plus 45 basis points. This facility contains a $300 million sublimit
for issuance of standby letters of credit, of which $238.9 million was available
at February 2, 2008. Interest is payable upon borrowing maturity but no less
than quarterly. Borrowing under this credit facility is subject to the Company
maintaining certain interest coverage and leverage ratios. The Company had no
borrowings outstanding under this facility as of February 2, 2008 and was in
compliance with the covenants.

Term debt.

In March 2006, the Company repaid its $50 million term
debt in full. The borrowing was made in 2002 to finance equipment and
information systems for the Company’s Perris, California distribution center.

Senior Notes.

In October 2006, the Company entered into a Note
Purchase Agreement with various institutional investors for $150 million of
unsecured senior notes. The notes were issued in two series and funding occurred
in December 2006. Series A notes were issued, for an aggregate of $85 million,
are due in December 2018 and bear interest at a rate of 6.38%. Series B notes
were issued, for an aggregate of $65 million, are due in December 2021 and bear
interest at a rate of 6.53%. The fair value of these notes as of February 2,
2008 of approximately $147 million is estimated by obtaining market quotes.
Borrowings under these notes are subject to certain operating and financial
covenants including maintaining certain interest coverage and leverage ratios.
As of February 2, 2008, the Company was in compliance with these covenants.


Letters of credit.

The Company uses standby letters of
credit to collateralize certain obligations related to its self-insured workers’
compensation and general liability programs. The Company had $61.1 million and
$66.4 million in standby letters of credit and $20.8 million and $26.0 million
in trade letters of credit outstanding at February 2, 2008 and February 3, 2007,
respectively.

Note E: Leases

The Company leases all but two of
its store sites with original, non-cancelable terms that in general range from
three to ten years. In addition, the Company leases selected computer and other
related equipment under operating leases, expiring through 2020. Store leases
typically contain provisions for three to four renewal options of five years
each. Most store leases also provide for minimum annual rentals and for payment
of certain expenses. In addition, some store leases also have provisions for
additional rent based on a percentage of sales.

The Company has lease arrangements
for certain equipment in its stores for its point-of-sale (“POS”) hardware and
software systems. These leases are accounted for as operating leases for
financial reporting purposes. The initial terms of these leases are three years
and the Company typically has options to renew the leases for two to three
one-year periods. Alternatively, the Company may purchase or return the
equipment at the end of the initial or each renewal term. The Company’s
obligation under the residual value guarantee at the end of the respective lease
terms is $6.1 million.

The Company also leases a 1.3
million square foot distribution center in Perris, California. This distribution
center is being financed under a $70 million ten-year synthetic lease facility
that expires in July 2013. Rent expense on this distribution center is payable
monthly at a fixed annual rate of 5.8% on the lease balance of $70 million. At
the end of the lease term, the Company must either refinance the $70 million
synthetic lease facility, purchase the distribution center at the amount of the
then-outstanding lease balance, or arrange a sale of the distribution center to
a third party. If the distribution center is sold to a third party for less than
$70 million, the Company has agreed under a residual value guarantee to pay the
lessor any shortfall amount up to $56 million.

In accordance with FIN No. 45,
“Guarantor’s Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including
Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others,” the Company has recognized a
liability and corresponding asset for the fair value of the residual value
guarantee in the amount of $8.3 million for the Perris, California distribution
center and $0.6 million for the POS leases. These residual value guarantees are
being amortized on a straight-line basis over the original terms of the leases.
The current portion of the related asset and liability is recorded in “Prepaid
expenses and other” and “Accrued expenses and other,” respectively, and the
long-term portion of the related assets and liabilities is recorded in “Other
long-term assets” and “Other long-term liabilities,” respectively, in the
accompanying consolidated balance sheets.

In November 2001, the Company
entered into a nine-year lease for a 239,000 square foot warehouse and a
ten-year lease for a 246,000 square foot warehouse in Carlisle, Pennsylvania. In
June 2006, the Company entered into a two-year lease extension with one one-year
option for a 253,000 square foot warehouse in Fort Mill, South Carolina,
extending the term to February 2009. In March 2008, the Company amended the term
of this lease to February 2010 and obtained three three-year options. In August
2007, the Company entered into a five-year lease for a 423,000 square foot
warehouse also in Fort Mill, South Carolina. All four of these properties are
used to store the Company’s packaway inventory. The Company also leases a
10-acre parcel which it currently has under construction for future trailer
parking adjacent to its Perris distribution center.

The synthetic lease facilities
described above, as well as the Company’s revolving credit facility and senior
notes, have covenant restrictions requiring the Company to maintain certain
interest coverage and leverage ratios. In addition, the interest rates under
these agreements may vary depending on the Company’s actual interest coverage
ratios. As of February 2, 2008, the Company was in compliance with these
covenants.


The Company leases approximately
181,000 square feet of office space for its corporate headquarters in
Pleasanton, California, under several facility leases. The lease terms for these
facilities expire between 2010 and 2014 and contain renewal
provisions.

The Company leases approximately
138,000 and 15,000 square feet of office space for its New York and Los Angeles
buying offices, respectively. The terms for these leases expire in 2015 and
2011, respectively. The lease term for the New York office contains a renewal
provision.

annual lease payments under leases in effect at February 2, 2008 are as follows:

In June 2006, the FASB issued FIN
48. This statement clarifies the criteria that an individual tax position must
satisfy for some or all of the benefits of that position to be recognized in a
company’s consolidated financial statements. FIN 48 prescribes a recognition
threshold of more-likely–than-not, and a measurement standard for all tax
positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return, in order for those tax
positions to be recognized in the consolidated financial statements.


Effective February 4, 2007, the Company adopted the
provisions of FIN 48. As a result, the Company established a $26.3 million
reserve for unrecognized tax benefits, inclusive of $6.0 million of related
interest. The reserve is classified as a long-term liability and included in
other long-term liabilities on the Company’s condensed consolidated balance
sheet. Upon adoption of FIN 48, the Company also recognized a reduction in
retained earnings of $7.4 million and certain other deferred income tax assets
and liabilities were reclassified. The change in amount of unrecognized tax
benefit since adoption of FIN 48 is as follows:

Unrecognized tax benefit as of February 2, 2008

$ 50,053


Pursuant to FIN 48, paragraph 21, the
      amounts in the table above represent the gross amount of unrecognized tax
      benefit on the dates shown.

As of February 2, 2008, the
reserve for unrecognized tax benefits is $23.2 million inclusive of $5.6 million
of related interest. The Company adopted a new tax method of accounting which
reduced its reserve during the year. The Company accounts for interest related
to unrecognized tax benefits as a part of its provision for taxes on earnings.
If recognized, $16.4 million would impact the Company’s effective tax rate. The
difference between the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits and the amounts
that would impact the effective tax rate relates to amounts attributable to
deferred income tax assets and liabilities. These amounts are net of federal and
state income taxes.

During the next twelve months, it
is reasonably possible that the statute of limitations may lapse pertaining to
positions taken by the Company in prior year tax returns. As a result, the total
amount of unrecognized tax benefits may decrease, which would reduce the
provision for taxes on earnings by up to $3.0 million, net of federal tax
benefits.

The Company is currently open to
audit by the Internal Revenue Service under the statute of limitations for
fiscal years 2005 through 2007. The Company’s state income tax returns are open
to audit under the statute of limitations for fiscal years 2003 through 2007.
Certain state tax returns are currently under audit by state tax authorities.
The Company does not expect the result of these audits to have a material impact
on the consolidated financial statements.

Note G: Employee Benefit Plans

The Company has a defined
contribution plan that is available to certain employees. Under the plan,
employee and Company contributions and accumulated plan earnings qualify for
favorable tax treatment under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code. This
plan permits employees to make contributions up to the maximum limits allowable
under the Internal Revenue Code. The Company matches up to 4% of the employee’s
salary up to the plan limits. Company matching contributions to the 401(k) plan
were $6.8 million, $6.1 million and $5.1 million in fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005,
respectively.


The Company also has an Incentive
Compensation Plan, which provides cash awards to key management employees based
on the Company's and the individual's performance. The Company also makes
available to management a Non-qualified Deferred Compensation Plan which allows
management to make payroll contributions on a pre-tax basis in addition to the
401(k) plan. Other long-term assets include $48.2 million and $47.0 million at
February 2, 2008 and February 3, 2007, respectively, of long-term investments,
at market value, set aside or designated for the Non-qualified Deferred
Compensation Plan. Plan investments are designated by the participants, and
investment returns are not guaranteed by the Company. The Company has a
corresponding liability to participants of $48.2 million and $47.0 million at
February 2, 2008 and February 3, 2007, respectively.

In addition, the Company has
certain individuals who receive or will receive post-employment benefits. The
estimated liability for these benefits of $3.2 million and $2.4 million is
included in accrued liabilities and other in the accompanying consolidated
balance sheets as of February 2, 2008 and February 3, 2007, respectively.

Note H: Stockholders' Equity

Preferred stock.

The Company has four million shares of
preferred stock authorized, with a par value of $.01 per share. No preferred
stock is issued or outstanding.

Common stock.

In November 2005, the Company’s Board of Directors
authorized a two-year stock repurchase program of up to $400 million for fiscal
2006 and 2007. In January 2004, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized a
stock repurchase program of up to $350 million for 2004 and 2005. The following
table summarizes the Company’s stock repurchase activity in fiscal 2007, 2006

declared a quarterly cash dividend of $.095 per common share, payable on or
about March 31, 2008. The Company’s Board of Directors declared quarterly cash
dividends of $.075 per common share in January, May, August and November 2007, a
cash dividend of $.06 per common share in January, May, August and November
2006, a cash dividend of $.06 per common share in November 2005, and cash
dividends of $.05 per common share in January, May, and August 2005.

2004 Equity Incentive Plan.

The Company has one equity incentive
compensation plan, the 2004 Equity Incentive Plan (the “2004 Plan”). The 2004
Plan provides for various types of incentive awards, which may potentially
include the grant of non-qualified and incentive stock options, stock
appreciation rights, restricted stock purchase rights, restricted stock shares,
restricted stock units, performance shares, performance units and deferred stock
units. The 2004 Plan also provides for the automatic grant of stock options to
each non-employee director at pre-established times and at a predetermined
value. To date, the Company has granted stock options, restricted stock shares,
and performance awards under the 2004 Plan. Stock options are granted at
exercise prices not less than the fair market value on the date the option is
granted, expire not more than ten years from the date of grant, and normally
vest over a period not exceeding five years from the date of grant. Restricted
shares are granted to officers and key employees. The fair value of these at the
date of grant is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period of
generally three to four years. Beginning in fiscal 2007 performance awards were
also issued to executive officers.


As of February 2, 2008, there were 10.6 million
shares that remained available for grant under the 2004 Plan. A summary of the
stock option activity for fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005 is presented
below.

During fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005,
restricted stock awards totaling 568,000, 569,000 and 892,000 shares,
respectively, were issued under the 2004 Plan, and 43,000, 149,000 and 200,000
shares were forfeited during each respective year. The market value of these
shares at the date of grant is amortized to expense ratably over the vesting
period of generally three to four years. The unamortized compensation expense at
February 2, 2008 and February 3, 2007 was $29.6 million and $27.4 million,
respectively. During fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005, shares purchased by the Company
for tax withholding totaled 125,000, 133,400 and 233,300 shares, respectively,
and are considered treasury shares which are available for reissuance. At
February 2, 2008, the Company held 965,000 shares of treasury stock. As of
February 2, 2008 and February 3, 2007, shares of unvested restricted stock
subject to repurchase totaled 2.0 million and 2.0 million shares respectively. A
total of 2,709,000, 3,278,000 and 3,846,000 shares were available for new
restricted stock awards at the end of fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005,
respectively.


Performance share
awards.

Beginning in fiscal 2007, the
Company initiated a performance share award program for senior executives. A
performance share award represents a right to receive shares of common stock on
a specified settlement date based on the Company’s attainment of a
profitability-based performance goal during a performance period. If attained,
the common stock then granted vests over a specified remaining service period,
generally two years. The Company recognized $0.6 million of expense related to
performance share awards in fiscal 2007.

Employee Stock Purchase Plan.

Under the Employee Stock Purchase Plan,
eligible full-time employees participating in the annual offering period can
choose to have up to the lesser of 10% or $21,250 of their annual base earnings
withheld to purchase the Company’s common stock. The purchase price of the stock
is the lower of 85% of the market price at the beginning of the offering period,
or end of the offering period. During fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005, employees
purchased approximately 214,000, 183,000 and 190,000 shares, respectively, of
the Company’s common stock under the plan at weighted average per share prices
of $21.73, $24.86 and $23.59, respectively. Through February 2, 2008,
approximately 8,739,000 shares had been issued under this plan and 1,261,000
shares remained available for future issuance.

Note I: Related Party
Transactions

The Company has an agreement with
its Chairman of the Board of Directors under which the Company pays an annual
consulting fee of $1.1 million in monthly installments through January 2009 and
provides for administrative support and health and other benefits for the
individual and his dependents which totaled approximately $0.2 million in fiscal
2007. Subsequent to year-end, the term of this agreement was extended through
January 2012.

The Company also has an agreement
with its Chairman Emeritus under which it pays an annual consulting fee of $0.1
million through March 2008 and provides for administrative support and health
benefits for the individual and his spouse which totaled approximately $0.1
million in fiscal 2007. Subsequent to year-end, the Company agreed to release
its interest in a split dollar life insurance policy to its Chairman
Emeritus, including the policy’s residual value of approximately $0.3 million.

Note J: Provision for
Litigation Expense and Other Legal Proceedings

Like many California retailers,
the Company has been named in class action lawsuits regarding wage and hour
claims. In February 2007 the Orange County Superior Court approved a settlement
of the cases involving whether the Company’s assistant store managers in
California were correctly classified as exempt under California Wage Orders. The
approved settlement obligation was paid during the quarter ended May 5,
2007.

Other class action litigation
involving allegations that hourly associates have missed meal and/or rest break
periods, as well as allegations of unpaid overtime wages to assistant store
managers at all Company stores under federal law, remains pending as of February
2, 2008.

The Company is also party in
various other legal proceedings arising in the normal course of business.
Actions filed against the Company include commercial, customer, and labor and
employment-related claims, including lawsuits in which plaintiffs allege that
the Company violated state and/or federal wage and hour and related laws.
Actions against the Company are in various procedural stages. Many of these
proceedings raise factual and legal issues and are subject to
uncertainties.

In the opinion of management,
resolution of the class action litigation and other legal proceedings is not
expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition
or results of operations.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT
REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

Board of Directors and
Stockholders

Ross Stores, Inc.

Pleasanton, California

We have audited the accompanying
consolidated balance sheets of Ross Stores, Inc. and subsidiaries (the
"Company") as of February 2, 2008 and February 3, 2007, and the related
consolidated statements of earnings, stockholders' equity, and cash flows for
each of the three years in the period ended February 2, 2008. We also have
audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of February
2, 2008, based on criteria established in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission. The Company's management is responsible for these consolidated
financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial
reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over
financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Annual Report on
Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these consolidated financial statements and an opinion on the
Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in
accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
(United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of
material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial
reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the financial
statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts
and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles
used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial
reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial
reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and
evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on
the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as
we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide
a reasonable basis for our opinions.

A company's internal control over
financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the
company's principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons
performing similar functions, and effected by the company's board of directors,
management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements
for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those
policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in
reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and
dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that
transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that
receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with
authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a
material effect on the financial statements.

Because of the inherent
limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the
possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material
misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely
basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal
control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that
the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the
degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may
deteriorate.


In our opinion, the consolidated
financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects,
the financial position of Ross Stores, Inc. and subsidiaries as of February 2,
2008 and February 3, 2007, and the results of their operations and their cash
flows for each of the three years in the period ended February 2, 2008, in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America. Also, in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects,
effective internal control over financial reporting as of February 2, 2008,
based on the criteria established in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission.

As discussed in Note F to the
consolidated financial statements, the Company adopted Financial Accounting
Standards Board Interpretation No. 48,

Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes- an interpretation of FASB
Statement No.109

, effective February 4,
2007. As discussed in Notes A and C to the consolidated financial statements,
the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123(R),

effective January 29, 2006.

ITEM
9A.     CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES.

Disclosure Controls and
Procedures

Our management, with the
participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer,
conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our “disclosure controls and
procedures” (as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(e)) as of the end of the
period covered by this report. Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive
Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and
procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by this
report.

It should be noted that any system
of controls, however well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable,
and not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the system will be met. In
addition, the design of any control system is based in part upon certain
assumptions about the likelihood of future events.

Management’s Annual Report on
Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

Our management is responsible for
establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting,
as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f). Our internal control over financial
reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability
of financial reporting and the preparation of consolidated financial statements
for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles.

Under the supervision and with the
participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief
Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our
internal control over financial reporting based on the framework established by
the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) as
set forth in

Internal Control —
Integrated Framework

. Based on our
evaluation under the framework in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework

, our management concluded that our internal control over financial
reporting was effective as of February 2, 2008.

Our internal control over
financial reporting as of February 2, 2008 has also been audited by Deloitte
& Touche LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, and their
opinion as to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting
is stated in their report, dated March 27, 2008, which is included in Item 8 in
this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Because of its inherent
limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect
misstatements. It should be noted that any system of controls, however well
designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, and not absolute, assurance
that the objectives of the system will be met. In addition, the design of any
control system is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of
future events. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of
changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or
procedures may deteriorate.

Quarterly Evaluation of Changes
in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

Our management, with the
participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, also
conducted an evaluation of our internal control over financial reporting to
determine whether any change occurred during the fourth fiscal quarter of 2007
that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our
internal control over financial reporting. Based on that evaluation, our
management concluded that there was no such change during the fourth fiscal
quarter.
