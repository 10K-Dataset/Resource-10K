PART I

ITEM 1.  BUSINESS

Ross Stores, Inc. (“Ross”
  or “the Company”) operates a chain of off-price retail apparel and
  home accessories stores, which target value conscious men and women between
  the ages of 25 and 54 primarily in middle-income households. The decisions of
  the Company, from merchandising, purchasing and pricing, to the location of
  its stores, are aimed at this customer base. The Company offers brand-name and
  designer merchandise at low everyday prices, generally 20% to 60% below regular
  prices of most department and specialty stores. The Company believes it derives
  a competitive advantage by offering a wide assortment of quality brand-name
  merchandise within each of its merchandise categories in an attractive easy-to-shop
  environment.

Ross’ mission is to
  offer competitive values to its target customer by focusing on the following
  key strategic objectives:

Achieve an appropriate
    level of recognizable brands and labels at strong discounts throughout the
    store;

Meet customer needs on
    a more regional basis;

Deliver an in-store shopping
    experience that reflects the expectations of the off-price customer; and

Manage real estate growth
    to increase market share in major markets.

The original Ross Stores,
  Inc. was incorporated in California in 1957. In August 1982, the Company was
  purchased by some of its then and current directors and stockholders. The six
  stores acquired were completely refurbished in the Company's off-price format
  and stocked with new merchandise. In June 1989 the Company reincorporated in
  the state of Delaware.

Merchandising, Purchasing
  and Pricing

Ross seeks to provide its
  customers with a wide assortment of first quality, in-season, brand-name apparel,
  accessories and footwear for the entire family at everyday savings of 20% to
  60% from regular department and specialty store prices, as well as similar savings
  on fragrances, items for the home, bed and bath merchandise and accessories.
  The Company sells recognizable branded merchandise that is current and fashionable
  in each category. New merchandise typically is received from three to five times
  each week at the Company’s stores. The Company’s buyers review their
  merchandise assortments on a weekly basis, enabling them to respond to merchandise
  trends and purchasing opportunities in the market. The Company's merchandising
  strategy is reflected in its advertising, which emphasizes a strong value message—Ross'
  customers will find great savings everyday on a broad assortment of name-brand
  merchandise.

Merchandising.

The
  Ross merchandising strategy incorporates a combination of off-price buying techniques
  to purchase both in-season and past-season merchandise. The Company's emphasis
  on nationally recognized name brands reflects management's conviction that brand-name
  merchandise sold at compelling discounts will continue to be an important determinant
  of its success. Ross generally leaves the brand-name label on the merchandise
  it sells.

The Company has established
  a merchandise assortment that it believes is attractive to its target customer
  group. Although Ross offers fewer classifications of merchandise than most department
  stores, the Company generally offers a large selection of brand names within
  each classification with a wide assortment of vendors, labels, prices, colors,
  styles and fabrics within each size or item. Over the past sever-


al years, the
  Company has diversified its merchandise offerings by adding new product categories
  such as maternity, small furnishings, educational toys and games, luggage, gourmet
  food and cookware, and fine jewelry in select stores. The respective departments
  accounted for total sales in fiscal 2002 approximately as follows: Ladies’
  34%, Home Accents and Bed and Bath 19%, Men's 18%, Fine Jewelry, Accessories,
  Lingerie and Fragrances 12%, Children’s 9% and Shoes 8%.

Purchasing.

The Company continues to expand its network of over 4,000 vendors and manufacturers
  and believes it has adequate sources of first quality merchandise to meet its
  requirements. The Company purchases the vast majority of its merchandise directly
  from manufacturers and has not experienced any difficulty in obtaining sufficient
  inventory.

The Company
  believes that its ability to effectively execute certain off-price buying strategies
  is a key factor in its success. Ross buyers use a number of methods that enable
  the Company to offer its customers brand-name merchandise at strong everyday
  discounts relative to department and specialty stores. By purchasing later in
  the merchandise buying cycle than department and specialty stores, Ross is able
  to take advantage of imbalances between retailers’ demand for products
  and manufacturers’ supply of those products.

Unlike most
  department and specialty stores, Ross does not typically require that manufacturers
  provide promotional and markdown allowances, return privileges, split shipments,
  drop shipments to stores or delayed deliveries of merchandise. For most orders,
  only one delivery is made to one of the Company's three distribution centers.
  These flexible requirements further enable the Company's buyers to obtain significant
  discounts on in-season purchases.

The vast majority
  of the merchandise that the Company offers in its stores is acquired through
  opportunistic purchases created by manufacturer overruns and canceled orders
  both during and at the end of a season. These buys are referred to as "closeout"
  and "packaway" purchases. Closeouts can be shipped to stores in season allowing
  the Company to get in season goods in its stores at lower prices. Packaway merchandise
  is purchased with the intent that it will be stored in the Company's warehouses
  until a later date, which may even be the beginning of the same selling season
  in the following year. Packaway purchases are an effective method of increasing
  the percentage of prestige and national brands at competitive savings within
  the merchandise assortments. Packaway merchandise is mainly fashion basics and,
  therefore, not usually affected by shifts in fashion trends.

Throughout the
  past decade, Ross gradually increased the amount of packaway inventories. In
  2002, the Company continued its emphasis on these important resources in response
  to compelling opportunities available in the marketplace. Packaway accounted
  for approximately 44% of total inventories as of February 1, 2003, compared
  to 43% at the end of the prior year. It is management’s belief that the
  strong discounts the Company is able to offer on packaway merchandise are a
  key driver of Ross’ business. In-store inventories at the end of fiscal
  2002 were up about 1% from the prior year on a comparable store basis, and total
  consolidated inventories were up about 15% mainly due to a greater number of
  stores in operation compared to the prior year.

During 2001
  and 2000, the Company implemented enhanced analytical processes for regionalized
  merchandise buying and allocation. The goal is to fine tune the merchandise
  mix and raise gross profit margins and sales productivity, especially in markets
  that are performing below the Company average. These analytical processes also
  provide the Company with the tools to maximize new store productivity in new
  markets. At the end of 2002, all merchandise departments were planned utilizing
  these analytical processes, with the exception of fine jewelry which is planned
  on a store specific basis.

Ross’ buying
  offices are located in New York City and Los Angeles, the nation's two largest
  apparel markets. These strategic locations allow buyers to be in the market
  on a daily basis, sourcing opportunities and


negotiating purchases with
  vendors and manufacturers. These locations also enable the Company's buyers
  to strengthen vendor relationships—a key determinant in the success of
  its off-price buying strategies.

The Company's buyers have
  an average of 15 years of experience, including merchandising positions with
  other retailers such as Bloomingdale's, Burlington Coat Factory, Dayton Hudson,
  Foot Locker, Lechters, Lord & Taylor, Macy's, Marshalls, Nordstrom, Robinsons/May,
  Sterns, T.J. Maxx and Value City. In keeping with its strategy, over the past
  decade the Company’s merchandising staff has grown almost four-fold. Management
  believes that this increase enables its merchants to spend even more time in
  the market which, in turn, should strengthen the Company's ability to procure
  the most desirable brands at competitive discounts.

This combination of off-price
  buying strategies enables the Company to purchase merchandise at net prices
  that are lower than prices paid by department and specialty stores.

Pricing.

The Company's
  policy is to sell brand-name merchandise that can generally be priced at 20%
  to 60% less than most department and specialty store regular prices. The Ross
  pricing policy is to affix a ticket displaying the Company's selling price as
  well as the estimated comparable selling price for that item in department and/or
  specialty stores.

The Ross pricing strategy
  differs from that of a department or specialty store. Ross purchases its merchandise
  at lower prices and marks it up less than a department or specialty store. This
  strategy enables Ross to offer customers consistently low prices. Specified
  departments in the store are reviewed weekly for possible markdowns based on
  the rate of sale and the end of fashion seasons to promote faster turnover of
  inventory and accelerate the flow of fresh merchandise.

The Ross Store

As of February 1, 2003, the
  Company operated 507 stores. They are conveniently located in predominantly
  community and neighborhood strip shopping centers in heavily populated urban
  and suburban areas. Where the size of the market permits, the Company clusters
  stores to maximize economies of scale in advertising, distribution and field
  management.

The Company believes a key
  element of its success is its organized, attractive, easy-to-shop in-store environment,
  which allows customers to shop at their own pace. The Ross store is designed
  for customer convenience in its merchandise presentation, dressing rooms, checkout
  and merchandise return areas. The Ross store's sales area is based on a prototype
  single floor design with a racetrack aisle layout. A customer can locate desired
  departments by signs displayed just below the ceiling of each department. Ross
  encourages its customers to select among sizes and prices through prominent
  category and sizing markers, promoting a self-service atmosphere. At most stores,
  shopping carts, baskets and/or shopping bags are available at the entrance for
  customer convenience. All cash registers are centrally located at store entrances
  for customer ease and efficient staffing.

The Company minimizes transaction
  time for the customer at the checkout counter by using electronic systems for
  scanning each ticket at the point of sale and authorizing credit for personal
  checks and credit cards in a matter of seconds. Approximately 46% of payments
  in 2002 were made with credit cards and debit cards. Ross provides cash or credit
  card refunds on all merchandise returned with a receipt within 30 days. Merchandise
  returns having a receipt older than 30 days are exchanged or credited with a
  Ross Credit Voucher at the price on the receipt.

Operating Costs

Consistent with the other
  aspects of its business strategy, Ross strives to keep operating costs as low
  as possible. Among the factors which have enabled the Company to operate at
  low costs are:


Labor costs that generally
    are lower than full-price department and specialty stores due to (i) a store
    design that creates a self-selection retail format and (ii) the utilization
    of labor saving technologies.

Economies of scale with
    respect to general and administrative costs as a result of centralized merchandising,
    marketing and purchasing decisions.

Model store layout criteria
    which facilitate conversion of existing buildings to the Ross format.

Distribution

The Company
  has three distribution centers—one located in Newark, California which
  is also the Company’s corporate headquarters, the second located in Carlisle,
  Pennsylvania and the third located in Fort Mill, South Carolina. Having distribution
  centers strategically located on each coast enhances cost efficiencies and decreases
  turn-around time in getting the merchandise from the vendors to the stores.
  The Company is constructing a new distribution center in Perris, California,
  which is expected to be complete by the third quarter of 2003. This new facility
  will become the primary west coast distribution center (see further discussion
  in Management Discussion and Analysis). The Company utilizes third party cross
  docks to distribute merchandise to stores on a regional basis. Shipments are
  made by contract carriers to the stores from three to five times a week depending
  on location. The Company believes that its three distribution centers can provide
  adequate processing capacity to support store growth until its new distribution
  center located in Perris, California becomes operational during the third quarter
  of 2003.

The Company
  also leases warehouse facilities primarily to store packaway purchases in Newark
  and in Carlisle.

Control
  Systems

During 2002,
  the Company continued to invest in new systems and technology to provide a platform
  for growth over the next several years. Initiatives in 2002 included the following:

Implementation of a new
    financial system that features web-enabled technology and intranet capability
    that has resulted in the automation of many manual processes.

Implementation of a new
    Warehouse Management System in the new South Carolina distribution center,
    which will also be rolled out in the new Southern California distribution
    center as well as the existing Carlisle distribution center.

Development began on a
    new core merchandising system, which is expected to provide more in-depth
    inventory and sales data. This technology should enhance the Company’s
    ability to plan, buy and allocate merchandise more precisely, eventually including
    by store, by color and by size. These new systems are targeted for completion
    during 2004 and over time are eventually expected to also support regional
    markdown capability.

Implementation began on
    new point-of-sale and sales audit systems to provide faster and more efficient
    transaction processing as well as extended multiple tender capabilities. These
    systems are expected to be complete in 2004.

Advertising

The Company
  relies primarily on television advertising to communicate its value proposition,
  brand-name merchandise at low everyday prices. This strategy reflects the Company's
  belief that television is the most efficient and cost effective medium for communicating
  everyday savings on a wide selection of brand-name bargains for both the family
  and home.

Employees

On February 1, 2003, the
  Company had approximately 22,500 employees which includes an estimated 12,200
  part-time employees. Additionally, the Company hires temporary employees—especially
  during the peak seasons. The Company's employees are non-union. Management of
  the Company considers the relationship between the Company and its employees
  to be good.

Competition

The Company believes the
  principal competitive factors in the off-price retail apparel and home accessories
  industry are offering large discounts on brand-name merchandise appealing to
  its target customer and consistently providing a store environment that is convenient
  and easy to shop. To execute this concept, the Company has strengthened its
  buying organization and developed a merchandise allocation system to distribute
  product based on regional factors, as well as other systems and procedures to
  maximize cost efficiencies and leverage expenses in an effort to mitigate competitive
  pressures on gross margin. The Company believes that it is well positioned to
  compete on the basis of each of these factors.

Nevertheless, the national
  apparel retail market is highly fragmented. Ross faces intense competition for
  business from department stores, specialty stores, discount stores, other off-price
  retailers and manufacturer-owned outlet stores, many of which are units of large
  national or regional chains that have substantially greater resources than Ross.
  The Company also competes to some degree with any retailer that sells apparel
  and home accessories through catalogues or over the internet. The retail apparel
  business may become even more competitive in the future.

ITEM 2.  PROPERTIES

Stores

From August 1982 to February
  1, 2003, the Company expanded from six stores in California to 507 stores in
  23 states: Alabama, Arizona, California, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii,
  Idaho, Maryland, Montana, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, North Carolina, Oklahoma,
  Oregon, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Texas, Utah, Virginia, Washington and
  Wyoming. The Company also operates a store in Guam. All stores are leased, with
  the exception of two locations.

During fiscal 2002, the Company
  opened 60 new Ross ‘Dress For Less’ stores and closed five existing
  locations. The average new Ross store in 2002 was approximately 30,000 gross
  square feet, yielding about 24,000 square feet of selling space. As of February
  1, 2003, the Company's 507 stores generally ranged in size from about 25,000
  to 35,000 gross square feet and had an average of 29,400 gross square feet and
  23,400 of selling square feet of space.

During the fiscal year ended
  February 1, 2003, no one store accounted for more than 1% of the Company's sales.
  The Company carries earthquake insurance on its corporate headquarters, distribution
  centers and all of its stores.


The Company's
  real estate strategy is to open additional stores mainly in existing market
  areas, to increase its market penetration and reduce overhead and advertising
  expenses as a percentage of sales in each market. Important considerations in
  evaluating a new market are the availability of potential sites, demographic
  characteristics, competition and population density of the market. In fiscal
  2002, the Company entered Alabama, a new state, while also continuing to open
  stores in its existing markets. In addition, management continues to consider
  opportunistic real estate acquisitions.

The following
  table summarizes the locations of the Company’s stores by state as of February
  1, 2003 and February 2, 2002.

Where possible,
  the Company has obtained sites in existing buildings requiring minimal alterations.
  This has allowed Ross to establish stores in new locations in a relatively short
  period of time at reasonable costs in a given market. To date, the Company has
  been able to secure leases in suitable locations for its stores. At February
  1, 2003, the majority of the Company's stores had unexpired original lease terms
  ranging from three to ten years with three to four renewal options of five years
  each. The average unexpired original lease term of its leased stores is five
  years, or 20 years if renewal options are included. (See Note C of Notes to
  Consolidated Financial Statements.)

See additional
  discussion under “The Ross Store” paragraph in Item 1.


Distribution Centers

The Company owns its Newark,
  California distribution center, which is also the Company’s corporate headquarters,
  and has a total of approximately 536,000 square feet. The Company also owns
  its distribution center in Carlisle, Pennsylvania, which is approximately 426,000
  square feet.

In September 1997, the Company
  entered into a five-year lease, which was subsequently extended through November
  2003, for an approximate 214,000 square foot warehouse in Newark, California.
  In November 1998, the Company entered into a five-year lease for an approximate
  97,000 square foot warehouse in Newark, California. In November 2001, the Company
  entered into a nine-year lease for an approximate 239,000 square foot warehouse
  in Carlisle, Pennsylvania. In November 2001, the Company leased an approximate
  246,000 square foot warehouse in Carlisle, Pennsylvania, for a ten-year term.
  All of these properties store the Company’s packaway inventory. In July
  2002, the Company began operating a 1.3 million square foot distribution center
  in Fort Mill, South Carolina, which is being financed under a synthetic lease
  through May 2006. In August 1999, Ross leased for a 50-month term an approximate
  32,000 square foot warehouse on ten acres in Newark, California. This location
  is primarily used for the storage of certain supplies, equipment, and trailers.

In April 2002, the Company
  began construction on another new 1.3 million square foot distribution center
  in Perris, California, which is expected to be complete by the third quarter
  of 2003. The land and building portion of this new distribution center is being
  financed under an $80 million synthetic lease facility, and the equipment and
  systems are being financed under a $50 million term debt facility. (See further
  discussion in Management Discussion and Analysis.)

ITEM 6.

SELECTED FINANCIAL DATA



ITEM 7.

MANAGEMENT’S
      DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION

AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

The
  fiscal years ended February 1, 2003, February 2, 2002 and February 3, 2001 are
  referred to as 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. Fiscal years 2002 and 2001
  are 52 weeks. Fiscal year 2000 is 53 weeks.

In fiscal 2002,
  the Company reclassified buying and distribution costs that were previously
  included with “general, selling and administrative” expenses to “cost
  of goods sold.” In addition, cost of goods sold also includes occupancy
  costs as well as depreciation and amortization related to the Company’s
  retail stores, buying and distribution operations. Included in general, selling
  and administrative expenses are costs related to store operating expenses as
  well as general and administrative expenses including related depreciation and
  occupancy costs. Fiscal 2001 and 2000 have been reclassified to conform to the
  fiscal 2002 presentation

.

Stores.

Total stores open at the end of 2002, 2001 and 2000 were 507, 452 and 409,
  respectively. Selling square footage at the end of 2002, 2001 and 2000 increased
  by 13%, 12% and 9%, respectively. The increased rate of growth in 2002 and 2001
  compared to prior years reflected the Company’s entry into new markets.

Sales.

The 18% total
  sales increase for 2002 reflects a 7% increase in sales from “comparable”
  stores (stores that have been open for more than 14 complete months), the opening
  of 55 net new stores in 2002, and the full year impact of 2001 store openings.
  The 10% total sales increase for 2001 reflects a 3% increase in sales from comparable
  stores, the opening of 43 net new stores in 2001, and the full year impact of
  2000 store openings. The 10% total sales increase in 2000 reflects a 1% increase
  in comparable store sales, the opening of 31 net new stores, and the full year
  impact of 1999 store openings.


The Company’s sales mix
  as shown below reflects the growth in home businesses which was a key contributor
  to comparable store sales growth in 2002 and 2001:

Management expects to address
  the competitive climate for apparel and off-price retailers by pursuing and
  refining the Company’s existing strategies and by continuing to strengthen
  the merchandise organization, diversifying the merchandise mix, and more fully
  developing the organization and systems to strengthen regional merchandise offerings.
  Although the Company’s existing strategies and store expansion program
  contributed to sales and earnings gains in 2002, 2001 and 2000, there can be
  no assurance that these strategies will result in a continuation of revenue
  and profit growth.

Cost of Goods Sold.

The decrease in the cost of goods sold ratio in 2002 compared to 2001 resulted
  in part from higher leverage on buying, distribution, occupancy and depreciation
  costs in 2002 when compared to 2001. Buying and distribution costs as a percentage
  of sales decreased by approximately 30 basis points from 2001, which is largely
  attributable to improved leverage resulting from a 7% comparable store sales
  increase and distribution processing efficiencies. The 7% increase in comparable
  store sales also resulted in an approximate 25 basis point reduction in store
  occupancy and depreciation as a percentage of sales when compared to 2001. In
  addition, the Company realized about 15 basis points of improvement in merchandise
  margins in 2002 as compared to 2001 due primarily to lower markdowns and improved
  shortage results, partially offset by higher freight costs and a reduction in
  initial markup due to our sharper pricing strategy.

The increase in the cost
  of goods sold ratio in 2001 compared to 2000 resulted in part from higher distribution
  center expenses and reduced leverage on occupancy and buying costs in 2001 when
  compared to 2000. Buying and distribution costs as a percentage of sales increased
  by approximately 40 basis points in 2001 mainly as a result of higher third
  party distribution processing costs. Store occupancy and depreciation as a percentage
  of sales increased by approximately 10 basis points when compared to 2000 due
  primarily to an 11% increase in new store openings as compared to an 8% gain
  in the prior year. In addition, the Company realized about 10 basis points in
  lower merchandise margins in 2001 as compared to 2000 due primarily to a reduction
  on initial markup due to an improved mix of brand-name merchandise.

There can be no assurance
  that the gross profit margins realized in 2002, 2001 and 2000 will continue
  in future years.

General, Selling and
  Administrative Expenses.

Total general, selling and administrative expenses
  (“GS&A”) were $572.3 million in 2002, an $86.9 million increase
  from 2001. During 2002, GS&A as a percentage of sales decreased slightly
  due primarily to higher leverage on store payroll, benefit costs and operating
  costs, partially offset by an increase in incentive compensation costs. Store
  operating costs as a percentage of sales decreased by approximately 20 basis
  points from 2001, due primarily to improved leverage resulting from a 7% comparable
  store sales increase. General and administrative costs as a percentage of sales
  grew by approximately 15 basis points in 2002 due mainly to an increase in incentive
  compensation costs, partially offset by improved leverage.


Total GS&A
  was $485.5 million in 2001, a $47.0 million increase from 2000. During 2001,
  GS&A as a percentage of sales rose primarily due to higher store payroll
  and operating costs as compared to 2000. Store operating costs as a percentage
  of sales increased by approximately 25 basis points from 2000, due mainly to
  higher payroll and benefit costs as compared to the prior year. General and
  administrative costs as a percentage of sales decreased by approximately 20
  basis points primarily due to improved leverage.

The largest
  component of GS&A is payroll. The total number of employees, including both
  full- and part-time, at year-end 2002, 2001 and 2000 was approximately 22,500,
  21,000 and 19,800, respectively.

Interest
  Expense.

The decrease in interest expense in 2002 as compared to 2001 and
  2000 as a percentage of sales is mainly due to lower average borrowings.

Taxes on
  Earnings.

The Company's effective tax rate for 2002, 2001 and 2000 was approximately
  39%, which represents the applicable federal and state statutory rates reduced
  by the federal benefit received for state taxes. During 2003, the Company expects
  its effective tax rate to remain at approximately 39%.

Net Earnings.

The increase in net earnings as a percentage of sales in 2002 as compared
  to 2001 is primarily due to improved leverage realized from the increase in
  comparable store sales growth on store expenses and on buying, distribution,
  occupancy, and depreciation costs in 2002 when compared to 2001, combined with
  slightly higher merchandise margins, which was partially offset by higher incentive
  compensation costs. Diluted earnings per share in 2002 increased by 32% to $2.52
  from $1.91 in 2001. This increase is attributable to the 30% increase in net
  earnings and a 2% reduction in weighted average diluted shares outstanding.
  The decrease in net earnings as a percentage of sales in 2001 as compared to
  2000 is primarily due to higher distribution, payroll and benefit costs, partially
  offset by improved leverage on fixed expenses. Diluted earnings per share in
  2001 increased by 5% to $1.91 from $1.82 in 2000. This increase is attributable
  to the 2% increase in net earnings and a 3% reduction in weighted average diluted
  shares outstanding.

Financial
  Condition

Liquidity
  and Capital Resources.

Operating
  Activities

Net cash provided
  by operating activities was $332.4 million, $242.9 million and $143.3 million
  in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. The primary source of cash from operations
  in 2002, 2001 and 2000 is related to net earnings excluding non-cash expenses
  for depreciation and amortization, higher accounts payable and other accrued
  expense balances, partially offset by cash used to finance an increase in merchandise
  inventories. Working capital was $296 million at the end of 2002, compared to
  $225 million at the end of 2001 and $197 million at the end of 2000. The Company
  had a current ratio of 1.5:1 in 2002, 2001 and 2000. The Company's primary source
  of liquidity is the sale of its merchandise inventory. Management regularly
  reviews the age and condition of the merchandise and is able to maintain current
  inventory in its stores through the replenishment processes and liquidation
  of non-current merchandise through clearance markdowns.


Investing Activities

In 2002, 2001 and 2000, the
  Company spent approximately $133.2 million, $86.0 million and $82.1 million,
  respectively, for capital expenditures (net of leased equipment) related primarily
  to fixtures and leasehold improvements to open new stores; relocate, remodel
  or expand existing stores; update management information systems; and various
  other expenditures for existing stores, distribution centers and the central
  office. The Company opened 60, 45 and 34 new stores and relocated, remodeled
  or expanded 1, 14 and 21 stores in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively.

The Company is forecasting
  approximately $150 million in capital expenditures for fiscal 2003 to fund fixtures
  and leasehold improvements to open about 66 new stores, relocate, remodel or
  expand existing stores, and to make investments in store and merchandising systems,
  distribution center equipment and systems and various central office expenditures.

Financing Activities

During 2002, 2001 and 2000,
  liquidity and capital requirements were provided by cash flows from operations,
  bank credit facilities and trade credit. Substantially all of the Company's
  store sites, certain warehouses and buying offices are leased and, except for
  certain leasehold improvements and equipment, do not represent long-term capital
  investments. The Company owns its distribution center and corporate headquarters
  in Newark, California, and its distribution center in Carlisle, Pennsylvania.
  Short-term trade credit represents a significant source of financing for investments
  in merchandise inventory. Trade credit arises from customary payment terms and
  trade practices with the Company's vendors. Management regularly reviews the
  adequacy of credit available to the Company from all sources and has been able
  to maintain adequate lines to meet the capital and liquidity requirements of
  the Company.

The table below presents
  significant contractual payment obligations of the Company at year-end 2002.

Contractual Obligations

Long-Term Debt.

In
  June 2002, the Company entered into a new $50 million senior unsecured term
  loan agreement to finance the equipment and information systems for the new
  Southern California distribution center currently under construction. The Company
  borrowed $25 million under this term loan in September 2002 and made the final
  draw of $25 million under this term loan in February 2003. Interest is payable
  no less than quarterly at the bank’s applicable prime rate or at LIBOR
  plus an applicable margin (currently 150 basis points) which resulted in an
  effective interest rate of 2.8% at February 1, 2003. All amounts outstanding
  under the term loan will be due and payable in December 2006. Borrowings under
  this term loan are subject to certain operating and financial covenants including
  maintaining certain interest rate coverage and leverage ratios. As of February
  1, 2003, $25 million was outstanding under this term loan.


Off-Balance
  Sheet Arrangements.

Operating
  Leases.

Substantially all of the Company’s store sites, certain warehouses
  and buying offices are leased. The Company owns its distribution center and
  corporate headquarters in Newark, California, and its distribution center in
  Carlisle, Pennsylvania.

Distribution
  Center Financings.

The Company leases a new 1.3 million square foot distribution
  center in Fort Mill, South Carolina, which was completed in July 2002. This
  center, including equipment and systems, is being financed under an $87.3 million,
  five-year operating lease, commonly referred to as a synthetic lease, which
  expires in May 2006. Monthly rent expense is currently payable at 75 basis points
  over 30-day LIBOR. At the end of the lease term, the Company must refinance
  the $87.3 million synthetic lease facility, purchase the distribution center
  at cost, or arrange a sale of the distribution center to a third party. The
  Company has agreed under a residual value guarantee to pay the lessor up to
  85% of the amount financed. The Company’s potential estimated purchase
  obligation of $87.3 million is included in Other synthetic lease obligations
  in the table above.

In April 2002,
  construction began on another 1.3 million square foot distribution center, which
  is expected to be complete in the third quarter of 2003. This new center is
  located in Perris, California approximately 70 miles southeast of Los Angeles,
  a desirable location for both sourcing and shipping of product. More than 25%
  of the Company’s store base is in the southwest region of the country,
  and the majority of its west coast merchandise receipts originate in Southern
  California. The Perris distribution center will feature the same warehouse management
  systems and technology installed in the new South Carolina center. The Company
  believes the new Perris center should improve supply chain logistics and efficiencies,
  and result in higher distribution center productivity and improved freight costs.
  As a result, the Company plans to transfer its primary west coast distribution
  capabilities from its current 19 year-old Newark distribution center to the
  new Perris center during the third quarter of 2003.

The land and
  building portion of the new Perris center is being financed under an $80 million,
  five-year synthetic lease facility, which expires in December 2006. Upon completion,
  rent expense on this center will be payable monthly at the applicable margin
  (currently 71 basis points) over the applicable commercial paper rate or 30-day
  LIBOR. At the end of the lease term, the Company must refinance the $80 million
  synthetic lease facility, purchase the distribution center at cost, or arrange
  a sale of the distribution center to a third party. If the distribution center
  is sold to a third party for less than the amount financed by the lessor, or
  $80 million, the Company has agreed under a residual value guarantee to pay
  the lessor up to 87% of the amount financed. The Company’s potential estimated
  purchase obligation of $80 million is included in Other synthetic lease obligations
  in the table above. The equipment and systems for the Perris, California center
  were financed with the $50 million, five-year senior unsecured term debt facility,
  which is included in Long-term debt in the table above.

The two synthetic
  lease facilities described above have covenant restrictions requiring maintaining
  certain interest rate coverage and leverage ratios. In addition, the interest
  rates under these agreements may vary depending on the Company’s actual
  interest coverage ratios.

These synthetic
  lease facilities are not included in the Company’s consolidated balance
  sheet as of February 1, 2003. The Financial Accounting Standards Board has recently
  issued authoritative guidance which could require the Company to consolidate
  the underlying assets and liabilities of one or both of these synthetic lease
  facilities in our consolidated balance sheet. See further discussion under “New
  Accounting Pronouncements.”


The table below presents significant
  commercial credit facilities available to the Company at year-end 2002.

*

Contains
      a $75 million sublimit for issuances of letters of credit, $46.8 million
      of which is available as of February 1, 2003. For additional information
      relating to these credit facilities, refer to Note B of Notes to the Consolidated
      Financial Statements.

Revolving Credit Facility.

In August 2001, the Company entered into a new three-year, $350 million
  revolving credit facility with its banks, which contains a $75 million sublimit
  for issuances of letters of credit, replacing its prior $160 million bank credit
  agreement, $30 million letter of credit facility, and $35 million uncommitted
  bank line arrangement. Interest is LIBOR-based plus an applicable margin (currently
  88 basis points) and is payable upon borrowing maturity but no less than quarterly.
  Borrowing under this credit facility is subject to the Company maintaining certain
  interest rate coverage and leverage ratios. As of February 1, 2003, the Company
  had no borrowings outstanding under this facility.

Standby Letters of Credit.

The Company had $74.3 million and $28.8 million in standby letters of credit
  outstanding at year-end 2002 and 2001, respectively.

Trade Letters of Credit.

The Company had $14.3 million and $9.7 million in trade letters of credit
  outstanding at year-end 2002 and 2001, respectively.

Dividends.

In January
  2003, a quarterly cash dividend payment of $.0575 per common share was declared
  by the Company’s Board of Directors, payable on or about April 1, 2003.
  The Board of Directors declared quarterly cash dividends of $.0475 per common
  share in January, May, August and November 2002 and $.0425 per common share
  in January, May, August and November 2001.

Stock Repurchase Program.

In January 2002, the Company announced that the Board of Directors authorized
  a new stock repurchase program of up to $300 million over two years. The Company
  repurchased a total of $150 million of common stock during 2002 under this program
  and expects to complete the remaining $150 million authorization in 2003. The
  Company repurchased a total of $131 million of common stock during 2001 under
  a prior program.

The Company estimates that
  cash flows from operations, existing bank credit lines and trade credit are
  adequate to meet operating cash needs, fund the aforementioned planned capital
  investments, repurchase common stock and make quarterly dividend payments for
  at least the next twelve months.

New Accounting Pronouncements

In June 2002, the Financial
  Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Statement of Financial
  Accounting Standard (“SFAS”) No. 146, “Accounting for Costs Associated
  with Exit or Disposal Activities,” which addresses accounting for restructuring
  and similar costs. SFAS No. 146 supersedes previous accounting guidance, principally
  Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 94-3 and is effective for restructuring
  activities, if any, initiated after December 31, 2002. SFAS No. 146 requires
  that the liability for costs associated with an exit or disposal activity be
  recognized when the liability is incurred. Under Issue No. 94-3, a liability
  for an exit cost was recognized at the date of the Company's commitment to an
  exit plan. SFAS No. 146 also establishes that the liability should initially
  be measured and recorded at


its fair value.
  Accordingly, SFAS No. 146 may affect the timing of recognizing future restructuring
  costs, if any, as well as the amounts recognized, but will have no impact on
  exit liabilities recorded by the Company prior to December 31, 2002.

In December
  2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 148, “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation—Transition
  and Disclosure—an amendment of FASB Statement No. 123.” This statement
  amends FASB SFAS No. 123, “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation,”
  to provide alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair
  value based method of accounting for stock-based employee compensation. In addition,
  SFAS No. 148 amends the disclosure requirements of SFAS No. 123, “Accounting
  for Stock-Based Compensation,” to require prominent disclosures in both
  annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock-based
  employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results.
  The adoption of SFAS No. 148 did not have a material impact on the Company’s
  financial position or results of operations.

In November
  2002, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation (“FIN”) No. 45, “Guarantor’s
  Accounting and Disclosure requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees
  of Indebtedness of Others.” FIN 45 elaborates on the disclosures to be
  made by the guarantor in its interim and annual financial statements about its
  obligations under certain guarantees that it has issued. It also requires that
  a guarantor recognize, at the inception of a guarantee, a liability for the
  fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing the guarantee. The initial
  recognition and measurement provisions of this interpretation are applicable
  on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after December 31, 2002;
  while, the provisions of the disclosure requirements are effective for financial
  statements of interim or annual periods ending after December 15, 2002. The
  adoption of FIN 45 did not have a material impact on our financial position
  or results of operations.

On January 17,
  2003, the FASB issued FIN 46, “Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities,”
  which addresses consolidation by business enterprises of entities that are not
  controllable through voting interests or in which the equity investors do not
  bear the residual economic risks and rewards. These entities have been commonly
  referred to as "special purpose entities." The underlying principle behind FIN
  46 is that if a business enterprise has the majority financial interest in an
  entity, defined in the guidance as a variable interest entity, the assets, liabilities,
  and results of the activities of the variable interest entity should be included
  in consolidated financial statements with those of the business enterprise.
  FIN 46 explains how to identify variable interest entities and how an enterprise
  should assess its interest in an entity to decide whether to consolidate that
  entity. The Company will apply the provisions of FIN 46 prospectively for all
  variable interest entities created after January 31, 2003. For variable interest
  entities created before January 31, 2003, the Company will be required to consolidate
  all entities in which it was deemed to be the primary beneficiary beginning
  in the third quarter of 2003.

As of February
  1, 2003, the Company was party to an agreement with a variable interest entity
  to finance and lease the Perris, California distribution center as further described
  in Note C of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Under existing accounting
  guidance, neither the project assets nor related obligations are currently included
  in the Company's balance sheets. As the variable interest entity is currently
  structured, the Company would be considered the primary beneficiary under FIN
  46 and would be required to consolidate the entity beginning in the third quarter
  of 2003. FIN 46 requires that the Company consolidate the assets, liabilities,
  and noncontrolling interests of the variable interest entities at their carrying
  amounts as if FIN 46 had been effective when the enterprise first met the conditions
  to be the primary beneficiary. Based upon the project costs incurred through
  February 1, 2003, consolidation of the variable interest entities would result
  in an additional $40 million in property and related debt as of February 1,
  2003. The Company expects to spend a total of approximately $80 million upon
  completion of the Perris distribution center, which would result in an $80 million
  increase in property and


related debt and approximately
  $2.3 million of annual depreciation if the Company were to consolidate this
  variable interest entity. The Company may consider other financing structures
  for these projects in the future which may result in non-consolidation under
  FIN 46. The Company does not anticipate the changes in accounting requirements
  to impact planned levels of financing or its credit ratings.

The Company was also a party
  to an $87 million synthetic lease facility for its South Carolina distribution
  center as further described in Note C of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
  The Company believes that consolidation of this synthetic lease will not be
  required under FIN 46 because the lessor/owner of the distribution center is
  not a variable interest entity. Further guidance or clarification related to
  FIN 46 may be issued by the FASB, Securities and Exchange Commission, or other
  authoritative bodies which could impact the accounting for this synthetic lease.

Critical Accounting
  Policies

The preparation of the Company’s
  consolidated financial statements requires the Company to make estimates and
  assumptions that affect the reported amounts. The estimates and assumptions
  are evaluated on an on-going basis and are based on historical experience and
  on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable. The Company believes
  the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments
  and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements:

Inventory

. The Company’s
  merchandise inventory is carried at the lower of cost or market with cost determined
  on a weighted average cost method. If actual market conditions are less favorable
  than those projected by management, or if sales of the inventory are more difficult
  than anticipated, additional inventory write-downs may be required.

Long-lived Assets

.
  The Company records a long-lived asset impairment charge when events or changes
  in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a long-lived asset may
  not be recoverable based on estimated future cash flows. In the course of performing
  this analysis, management determined that no long-lived asset impairment charge
  was required for years ended February 1, 2003, February 2, 2002 and February
  3, 2001. Should actual results differ materially from projected results, an
  impairment charge may be required in the future.

Self Insurance

.
  The Company self insures certain of its workers’ compensation and general
  liability risks as well as certain of its health insurance plans. The Company’s
  self-insurance liability is determined actuarially, based on claims filed and
  an estimate of claims incurred but not reported. Should a greater amount of
  claims occur compared to what is estimated or the costs of the medical profession
  and state statutory requirements increase beyond what was anticipated, reserves
  recorded may not be sufficient and additional charges could be required.

The above listing is not
  intended to be a comprehensive list of all of the Company’s accounting
  policies. In many cases, the accounting treatment of a particular transaction
  is specifically dictated by generally accepted accounting principles, with no
  need for management’s judgment in their application. There are also areas
  in which management’s judgment in selecting any available alternative would
  not produce a materially different result. See the audited consolidated financial
  statements and notes thereto, which contain accounting policies and other disclosures
  required by generally accepted accounting principles.

Forward-Looking Statements
  and Factors Affecting Future Performance

This report includes a number
  of forward-looking statements, which reflect the Company’s current beliefs
  and estimates with respect to future events and the Company’s future financial
  performance, operations and competitive position. The words “expect,”
  “anticipate,” “estimate,” “believe,” “looking
  ahead,” “forecast,” “plan” and similar expressions
  identify forward-looking statements.


The Company’s
  continued success depends, in part, upon its ability to increase sales at existing
  locations, to open new stores and to operate stores on a profitable basis. There
  can be no assurance that the Company’s existing strategies and store expansion
  program will result in a continuation of revenue and profit growth. Future economic
  and industry trends that could potentially impact revenue and profitability
  remain difficult to predict.

The forward-looking
  statements that are contained in this report are subject to risks and uncertainties
  that could cause the Company’s actual results to differ materially from
  historical results or current expectations. These factors include, without limitation,
  a general deterioration in economic trends, changes in geopolitical conditions,
  ongoing competitive pressures in the apparel industry, the Company’s ability
  to obtain acceptable store locations, the Company’s ability to continue
  to purchase attractive brand-name merchandise at desirable discounts, the Company’s
  ability to successfully open its distribution center in Southern California
  in a timely and cost-effective manner, the Company’s ability to successfully
  extend its geographic reach into new markets, unseasonable weather trends, changes
  in the level of consumer spending on or preferences in apparel or home-related
  merchandise, the Company’s ability to attract and retain personnel with
  the retail talent necessary to execute its strategies, the Company’s ability
  to implement and integrate various new systems and technologies, and greater
  than planned costs. In addition, the Company’s corporate headquarters,
  one of its distribution centers and 35% of its stores are located in California.
  Therefore, a downturn in the California economy or a major natural disaster
  there could significantly affect the Company’s operating results and financial
  condition.

ITEM 7A.
   QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

The Company
  is exposed to market risks, which primarily includes changes in interest rates.
  The Company does not engage in financial transactions for trading or speculative
  purposes. Interest that is payable on the Company’s credit facilities is
  based on variable interest rates and is, therefore, affected by changes in market
  interest rates. In addition, lease payments under the Company’s synthetic
  lease agreements are determined based on variable interest rates and are, therefore,
  affected by changes in market interest rates. Lease payments on the Southern
  California distribution center will begin upon completion of construction. As
  of February 1, 2003, the Company had $25 million of long-term debt outstanding
  which accrues interest at LIBOR plus 150 basis points. The Company does not
  consider the potential losses in future earnings and cash flows from reasonably
  possible near term changes in interest rates to be material. The Company does
  not currently use derivative financial instruments in its investment portfolio.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED
  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Note A: Summary of Significant
  Accounting Policies

Business.

Ross Stores,
  Inc. (“Ross” or the “Company”) is an off-price retailer
  of first-quality, branded apparel, shoes and accessories for the entire family,
  as well as gift items, linens and other home-related merchandise. At February
  1, 2003, the Company operated 507 stores in 23 states and Guam, supported by
  three distribution centers. The Company’s headquarters, one distribution
  center, three warehouses and 35% of its stores are located in California.

Basis of Presentation
  and Fiscal Year.

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts
  of the Company and its subsidiaries, all of which are wholly-owned. Intercompany
  transactions and accounts have been eliminated. The Company utilizes a 52-53
  week fiscal year whereby the fiscal year ends on the Saturday nearest to January
  31. The fiscal years ended February 1, 2003, February 2, 2002 and February 3,
  2001 are referred to as 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. Fiscal years 2002
  and 2001 are 52 weeks. Fiscal year 2000 is 53 weeks.

Reclassifications.

Certain
  reclassifications have been made in the 2001 and 2000 financial statements to
  conform to the 2002 presentation. The Company reclassified buying and distribution
  costs that were previously included with “general, selling and administrative”
  expenses to “cost of goods sold.” In addition, cost of goods sold
  also now includes occupancy costs as well as depreciation and amortization related
  to the Company’s retail stores, buying and distribution operations. Included
  in general, selling and administrative expenses are costs related to store operating
  expenses as well as general and administrative expenses including related depreciation
  and occupancy costs.

Use of Accounting Estimates.

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted
  accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions
  that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities and disclosures of contingent
  assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported
  amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results
  could differ from those estimates. The Company’s significant accounting
  estimates include inventory, long-lived assets and the review of their impairment,
  and self insurance reserves.

Cash Equivalents.

Cash
  equivalents are highly liquid, fixed income instruments purchased with a maturity
  of three months or less. As of February 1, 2003, cash and cash equivalents included
  $10 million of restricted cash that is collateralizing a Standby Letter of Credit
  that guarantees future workers’ compensation and general liability obligations.

Merchandise Inventory.

Merchandise inventory is stated at the lower of cost (determined using a
  weighted average basis) or net realizable value. The Company purchases manufacturer
  overruns and canceled orders both during and at the end of a season which are
  referred to as "packaway" inventory. Packaway inventory is purchased with the
  intent that it will be stored in the Company's warehouses until a later date,
  which may even be the beginning of the same selling season in the following
  year. Packaway inventory accounted for approximately 44% and 43% of total inventories
  as of February 1, 2003 and February 2, 2002, respectively.

Cost of Goods Sold.

In addition to the product cost of merchandise sold, the Company includes
  its buying and distribution expenses as well as occupancy costs related to the
  Company’s retail stores, buying and distribution facilities in its cost
  of goods sold. Buying expenses include costs to procure merchandise inventories.
  Distribution expenses include the cost of operating the Company’s distribution
  centers and freight expense related to transporting merchandise.

Property and Equipment.

Property and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation is calculated using
  the


straight-line
  method over the estimated useful life of the asset, typically ranging from five
  to twelve years for equipment and 20 to 40 years for real property. The cost
  of leasehold improvements is amortized over the useful life of the asset or
  the applicable lease term, whichever is less. Computer hardware and software
  costs are included in fixtures and equipment and are amortized over their estimated
  useful life generally ranging from five to seven years. Reviews for impairment
  are performed whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying value of
  an asset may not be recoverable.

Intangible
  Assets.

Intangible assets are principally comprised of lease rights, which
  are payments made to acquire store leases. Lease rights are included in other
  long-term assets and are amortized over the remaining life of the lease.

Long-Lived
  Assets.

Long-lived assets and certain identifiable intangibles that are
  subject to amortization are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes
  in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable.
  Intangible assets that are not subject to amortization, including goodwill,
  are tested for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in
  circumstances indicate that the asset may be impaired. Based on the Company’s
  review as of February 1, 2003 and February 2, 2002, no adjustments were recognized
  to the carrying value of such assets.

Store Closures.

The Company continually reviews the operating performance of individual
  stores. For stores that are to be closed, the Company records a liability for
  future minimum lease payments and related ancillary costs from the date of closure
  to the end of the remaining lease term, net of estimated cost recoveries that
  may be achieved through sublease income or favorable lease terminations. Beginning
  January 1, 2003, the Company adopted the provisions of Statement of Financial
  Accounting Standard (“SFAS”) No. 146, “Accounting for Costs Associated
  with Exit or Disposal Activities,” and accordingly any such liability is
  now recorded at the time the liability is incurred. Operating costs, including
  depreciation, of stores to be closed are expensed during the period they remain
  in use.

Accounts
  Payable.

Accounts payable represents amounts owed to third parties at the
  end of the period. The Company included outstanding checks in accounts payable
  of approximately $61.3 million and $65.4 million at year-end 2002 and 2001,
  respectively.

Self Insurance.

The Company is self insured for workers’ compensation, general liability
  costs and certain health insurance plans. The self-insurance liability is determined
  actuarially, based on claims filed and an estimate of claims incurred but not
  yet reported.

Deferred
  Rent.

When a lease requires fixed escalations of the minimum lease payments,
  rental expense is recorded on a straight-line basis and the difference between
  the average rental amount charged to expense and the amount payable under the
  lease is recorded as deferred rent. At the end of 2002 and 2001, the balance
  of deferred rent was $16.0 million and $15.3 million, respectively, and is included
  in long-term liabilities.

Estimated
  Fair Value of Financial Instruments.

The carrying value of cash and cash
  equivalents, accounts receivable, and accounts payable approximates their estimated
  fair value. The Company’s long-term debt represents amounts outstanding
  under the Company’s $50 million senior unsecured term loan agreement. The
  interest rate fluctuates monthly based on LIBOR. Due to the floating interest
  rates on the debt, the carrying value approximates its estimated fair value.

Effects
  of Inflation or Deflation.

The Company does not consider the effects of
  inflation or deflation to be material to the Company’s financial position
  and results of operations.

Revenue
  Recognition.

The Company recognizes revenue at the point of sale, net of
  actual returns, and maintains a provision for estimated future returns. Sales
  of gift certificates are deferred until they are redeemed for the purchase of
  the Company’s merchandise.


Store Pre-Opening

.
  Store pre-opening costs are expensed in the period incurred.

Advertising.

Advertising
  costs are expensed in the period incurred. Advertising expenses for the fiscal
  years ended 2002, 2001 and 2000 were $37.5 million, $33.1 million and $29.6
  million, respectively.

Taxes on Earnings.

SFAS
  No. 109, “Accounting for Income Taxes,” requires income taxes to be
  accounted for under an asset and liability approach that requires the recognition
  of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences
  of events that have been recognized in the Company's financial statements or
  tax returns. In estimating future tax consequences, the Company generally considers
  all expected future events other than changes in the tax law or rates.

Stock-Based Compensation.

The Company accounts for stock-based awards to employees using the intrinsic
  value method prescribed by Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, “Accounting
  for Stock Issued to Employees.” Because the Company grants stock option
  awards at market value, there is no compensation expense recorded, except for
  restructuring related expense for modifications of options. Compensation expense
  for restricted stock awards is based on the market value of the shares awarded
  at the date of grant and is amortized on a straight-line basis over the vesting
  period. The disclosure requirements of SFAS No. 123, “Accounting for Stock-Based
  Compensation,” and SFAS No. 148, “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation—Transition
  and Disclosure—an amendment of FASB Statement No. 123” are set forth
  below.

Had compensation costs for
  the Company's stock option and stock purchase plans been determined based on
  the fair value at the grant dates for awards under those plans consistent with
  the methods of SFAS No. 123, the Company’s net earnings and earnings per
  share would have been reduced to the pro forma amounts indicated below:

At February
  1, 2003, the Company had five stock-based compensation plans, which are further
  described in Note F. SFAS No. 123 establishes a fair value method of accounting
  for stock options and other equity instruments. For determining pro forma earnings
  per share, the fair value of the stock options and employees’ purchase
  rights were estimated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model using the
  following assumptions:


The weighted
  average fair values per share of stock options granted during 2002, 2001 and
  2000 were $13.70, $8.62 and $8.19, respectively. The weighted average fair values
  of the 2002, 2001 and 2000 employee stock purchase awards were $9.94, $5.59
  and $7.48 per share, respectively.

Earnings
  Per Share (EPS).

SFAS No. 128, “Earnings Per Share,” requires
  earnings per share to be computed and reported as both basic EPS and diluted
  EPS. Basic EPS is computed by dividing net earnings by the weighted average
  number of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted EPS is computed
  by dividing net earnings by the weighted average number of common shares and
  dilutive common stock equivalents outstanding during the period. Dilutive EPS
  reflects the potential dilution that could occur if options to issue common
  stock were exercised into common stock. In 2002, 2001 and 2000 there were 55,601,
  54,451 and 3,724,615 shares, respectively, that could potentially dilute basic
  EPS in the future that were excluded from the calculation of diluted EPS because
  their effect would have been anti-dilutive (option exercise price exceeds average
  stock price) in the periods presented.

The following
  is a reconciliation of the number of shares (denominator) used in the basic
  and diluted EPS computations (shares in thousands):

Segment
  Reporting.

The Company accounts for its operations as one operating segment.
  The Company’s operations include only activities related to off-price retailing
  in similar stores throughout the United States and, therefore, comprise only
  one segment.

Comprehensive
  Income.

Comprehensive income equals net earnings for all periods presented.


Derivative Instruments
  and Hedging Activities.

SFAS No. 133, “Accounting for Derivative Instruments
  and Hedging Activities,” as amended, requires the Company to record all
  derivatives as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet and to measure
  those instruments at fair value. The Company did not hold or trade any derivative
  instruments in 2002, 2001 or 2000.

New Accounting Pronouncements.

In June 2002, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”)
  issued SFAS No. 146, “Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal
  Activities,” which addresses accounting for restructuring and similar costs.
  SFAS No. 146 supersedes previous accounting guidance, principally Emerging Issues
  Task Force Issue No. 94-3. The Company will adopt the provisions of SFAS No.
  146 for restructuring activities, if any, initiated after December 31, 2002.
  SFAS No. 146 requires that the liability for costs associated with an exit or
  disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred. Under Issue
  94-3, a liability for an exit cost was recognized at the date of the Company's
  commitment to an exit plan. SFAS No. 146 also establishes that the liability
  should initially be measured and recorded at its fair value. Accordingly, SFAS
  No. 146 may affect the timing of recognizing future restructuring costs, if
  any, as well as the amounts recognized, but will have no impact on exit liabilities
  recorded by the Company prior to December 31, 2002.

In December 2002, the FASB
  issued SFAS No. 148, “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation—Transition
  and Disclosure—an amendment of FASB Statement No. 123.” This statement
  amends SFAS No. 123, “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation,” to
  provide alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair
  value based method of accounting for stock-based employee compensation. In addition,
  SFAS No. 148 amends the disclosure requirements of SFAS No. 123 to require prominent
  disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements about the method
  of accounting for stock-based employee compensation and the effect of the method
  used on reported results. The adoption of SFAS No. 148 did not have a material
  impact on the Company’s financial position or results of operations.

In November 2002, the FASB
  issued FASB Interpretation (“FIN”) No. 45, “Guarantor’s
  Accounting and Disclosure requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees
  of Indebtedness of Others.” FIN 45 elaborates on the disclosures to be
  made by the guarantor in its interim and annual financial statements about its
  obligations under certain guarantees that it has issued. It also requires that
  a guarantor recognize, at the inception of a guarantee, a liability for the
  fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing the guarantee. The initial
  recognition and measurement provisions of this interpretation are applicable
  on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after December 31, 2002;
  while, the provisions of the disclosure requirements are effective for financial
  statements of interim or annual periods ending after December 15, 2002. The
  adoption of FIN 45 did not have a material impact on the Company’s financial
  position or results of operations.

On January 17, 2003, the
  FASB issued FIN 46, “Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities,”
  which addresses consolidation by business enterprises of entities that are not
  controllable through voting interests or in which the equity investors do not
  bear the residual economic risks and rewards. These entities have been commonly
  referred to as "special purpose entities." The underlying principle behind FIN
  46 is that if a business enterprise has the majority financial interest in an
  entity, defined in the guidance as a variable interest entity, the assets, liabilities,
  and results of the activities of the variable interest entity should be included
  in consolidated financial statements with those of the business enterprise.
  FIN 46 explains how to identify variable interest entities and how an enterprise
  should assess its interest in an entity to decide whether to consolidate that
  entity. The Company will apply the provisions of FIN 46 prospectively for all
  variable interest entities created after January 31, 2003. For variable interest
  entities created before January 31, 2003, the Company will be required to consolidate
  all entities in which it was deemed to be the primary beneficiary beginning
  in the third quarter of 2003.

As of February 1, 2003, the
  Company was party to an agreement with a variable interest entity to finance


and lease the
  Perris, California distribution center as further described in Note C. Under
  existing accounting guidance, neither the project assets nor related obligations
  are currently included in the Company's balance sheets. As the variable interest
  entity is currently structured, the Company would be considered the primary
  beneficiary under FIN 46 and would be required to consolidate the entity beginning
  in the third quarter of 2003. FIN 46 requires that the Company consolidate the
  assets, liabilities, and noncontrolling interests of the variable interest entities
  at their carrying amounts as if FIN 46 had been effective when the enterprise
  first met the conditions to be the primary beneficiary. Based upon the project
  costs incurred through February 1, 2003, consolidation of the variable interest
  entities would result in an additional $40 million in property and related debt.
  The Company may consider other financing structures for these projects in the
  future which may result in non-consolidation under FIN 46. The Company does
  not anticipate the changes in accounting requirements to impact planned levels
  of financing or its credit ratings.

The Company
  was also a party to an $87 million synthetic lease facility for its South Carolina
  distribution center as further described in Note C. The Company believes that
  consolidation of this synthetic lease will not be required under FIN 46 because
  the lessor/owner of the distribution center is not a variable interest entity.
  Further guidance or clarification related to FIN 46 may be issued by the FASB,
  Securities and Exchange Commission, or other authoritative bodies which could
  impact the accounting for this synthetic lease.

Note B:
  Long-Term Debt

The Company
  had $25 million of debt classified as long-term as of February 1, 2003, and
  no debt outstanding as of February 2, 2002. The weighted average interest rates
  on borrowings during 2002 and 2001 were 3.1% and 4.7%, respectively.

Bank Credit
  Facilities.

The Company has a $350 million revolving credit facility, which
  contains a $75 million sublimit for issuances of letters of credit of which
  $46.8 million was available as of February 1, 2003, that expires in August 2004.
  Interest is LIBOR based and is payable upon borrowing maturity but no less than
  quarterly. Borrowing under this credit facility is subject to the Company maintaining
  certain interest rate coverage and leverage ratios. As of February 1, 2003 and
  February 2, 2002, the Company had no borrowings outstanding under this revolving
  credit facility.

Term Debt.

In June 2002, the Company entered into a new $50 million senior unsecured
  term loan agreement to finance the equipment and information systems for the
  new Southern California distribution center currently under construction. The
  Company borrowed $25 million under this term loan in September 2002 and made
  the final draw of $25 million under this term loan in February 2003. Interest
  is payable no less than quarterly at the bank’s applicable prime rate or
  at LIBOR plus an applicable margin (currently 150 basis points) which resulted
  in an effective interest rate of 2.8% at February 1, 2003. Interest costs incurred
  during the period the equipment and information systems are being developed
  for their intended use are being capitalized. All amounts outstanding under
  the term loan are due and payable in December 2006. Borrowing under this term
  loan is subject to certain operating and financial covenants including maintaining
  certain interest rate coverage and leverage ratios. As of February 1, 2003,
  $25 million was outstanding under this term loan.

Letters
  of Credit.

The Company had $74.3 million and $28.8 million in standby letters
  of credit and $14.3 million and $9.7 million in trade letters of credit outstanding
  at year-end 2002 and 2001, respectively.

Note C:
  Leases

The Company
  leases five separate warehouse facilities in Newark, California, and Carlisle,
  Pennsylvania with operating leases expiring in various years through 2011, with
  one or two renewal options of up to


fours years each. These five
  leased facilities are being used primarily to store packaway merchandise. In
  addition, the Company leases substantially all of its store sites, selected
  computer and related equipment, and certain distribution center equipment under
  operating leases with original, non-cancelable terms that in general range from
  three to 15 years, expiring through 2015. Store leases typically contain provisions
  for three to four renewal options of five years each. Most store leases also
  provide for minimum annual rentals and for payment of certain expenses. In addition,
  some store leases also have provisions for additional rent based on percentage
  of sales.

The Company also leases a
  new 1.3 million square foot distribution center in Fort Mill, South Carolina,
  which became fully operational in July 2002. This center is being financed under
  an $87.3 million, five-year operating lease, commonly referred to as a synthetic
  lease, which expires in May 2006, and monthly rent expense is currently payable
  at 75 basis points over 30-day LIBOR (2.1% at February 1, 2003). At the end
  of the lease term, the Company must refinance the $87.3 million synthetic lease
  facility, purchase the distribution center at cost, or arrange a sale of the
  distribution center to a third party. The Company has agreed under a residual
  value guarantee to pay the lessor up to 85% of the amount financed.

In April 2002, construction
  began on another 1.3 million square foot distribution center in Perris, California,
  which is expected to be complete in the third quarter of 2003. The Perris distribution
  center will utilize the same warehouse management systems and technology as
  that in the new South Carolina center. The land and building portion of the
  new Perris center is being financed under an $80 million, five-year synthetic
  lease facility, which expires in December 2006. Upon completion, rent expense
  on this center will be payable monthly at the applicable margin (currently 71
  basis points) over the applicable commercial paper or 30-day LIBOR (2.1% at
  February 1, 2003). At the end of the lease term, the Company must refinance
  the $80 million synthetic lease facility, purchase the distribution center at
  cost, or arrange a sale of the distribution center to a third party. If the
  distribution center is sold to a third party for less than the amount financed
  by the lessor, or $80 million, the Company has agreed under a residual value
  guarantee to pay the lessor up to 87% of the amount financed. The two synthetic
  lease facilities described above have covenant restrictions requiring maintaining
  certain interest rate coverage and leverage ratios. In addition, the interest
  rates under these agreements may vary depending on the Company’s actual
  interest coverage ratios.

The aggregate future minimum
  annual lease payments under leases in effect at year-end 2002 are as follows:


Note D: Taxes on Earnings

The provision for taxes consists
  of the following:

In 2002, 2001
  and 2000, the Company realized tax benefits of $16.6 million, $12.1 million
  and $4.8 million, respectively, related to stock options exercised and the vesting
  of restricted stock that were credited to additional paid-in capital.

The provision
  for taxes for financial reporting purposes is different from the tax provision
  computed by applying the statutory federal income tax rate. The differences
  are reconciled as follows:

The components
  of the net deferred tax liabilities at year-end are as follows:


Note E: Employee Benefit
  Plans

The Company has available
  to certain employees a profit sharing retirement plan. Under the plan, employee
  and Company contributions and accumulated plan earnings qualify for favorable
  tax treatment under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code. This plan permits
  employees to make contributions up to the maximum limits allowable under the
  Internal Revenue Code. In January 2002, the Company increased its matching to
  4% of the employee’s salary up to the plan limits. Prior to January 2002,
  the Company matched up to 3% of the employee’s salary up to plan limits.
  Company matching contributions to the retirement plan were $4.2 million, $3.0
  million and $2.7 million in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. The Company has
  in place an Incentive Compensation Plan, which provides cash awards to key management
  employees based on the Company's and the individual's performance. The Company
  makes available to management a Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Plan which
  allows management to make payroll contributions on a pre-tax basis in addition
  to the 401(k) Plan. This plan does not qualify under Section 401(k) of the Internal
  Revenue Code. Other long-term assets and other long-term liabilities include
  $24.6 million and $23.5 million in 2002 and 2001, respectively, related to the
  Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Plan.

Note F: Stockholders'
  Equity

Preferred Stock.

The
  Company has four million shares of preferred stock authorized, with a par value
  of $.01 per share. No preferred stock has been issued or outstanding during
  the past three years.

Common Stock.

In
  January 2002, the Company’s Board of Directors approved a $300 million
  two-year stock repurchase program, under which $150 million of common stock
  was repurchased during 2002. In January 2000, the Company’s Board of Directors
  approved a $300 million two-year stock repurchase program, under which $131
  million and $169 million of common stock was repurchased during 2001 and 2000,
  respectively. The January 2000 program was completed. The following table summarizes
  the Company’s stock repurchase activity:

1992 Stock Option Plan
  and 2000 Equity Incentive Plan.

The Company's 1992 Stock Option Plan and
  2000 Equity Incentive Plan allow for the granting of nonqualified stock options.
  Incentive stock options can also be granted under the 1992 Stock Option Plan.
  Stock options are to be granted at prices not less than the fair market value
  of the common shares on the date the option is granted, expire ten years from
  the date of grant and normally vest over a period not exceeding four years from
  the date of grant. Options granted prior to March 2000 under the plans are exercisable
  upon grant, subject to the Company’s conditional right to repurchase unvested
  shares. Options granted since March 2000 are exercisable only as to vested shares.

Outside Directors Stock
  Option Plan.

The Company’s Outside Directors Stock Option Plan provides
  for the automatic grant of stock options at pre-established times and for fixed
  numbers of shares to each non-employee director. Stock options are to be granted
  at exercise prices equal to the fair market value of the common shares on the
  date the option is granted, expire ten years from the date of grant and vest
  over a period not exceeding three years from the date of the grant.


A summary of the activity
  under the Company’s three option plans for 2002, 2001 and 2000 is presented
  below:

At year-end
  2002, 2001 and 2000, there were 4.0 million, 5.2 million and 6.6 million shares,
  respectively, available for future issuance under these plans.

The following
  table summarizes information about the weighted average remaining contractual
  life (in years) and the weighted average exercise prices for stock options both
  outstanding and exercisable as of February 1, 2003 (options in thousands):

Employee
  Stock Purchase Plan.

Under the Employee Stock Purchase Plan, eligible full-time
  employees can choose to have up to 10% of their annual base earnings withheld
  to purchase the Company’s common stock. The purchase price of the stock
  is 85% of the lower of the beginning of the offering period or end of the offering
  period market price. During 2002, 2001 and 2000, employees purchased approximately
  119,000, 194,000 and 195,000 shares, respectively, of the Company’s common
  stock under the plan at weighted average per-share prices of $28.16, $14.44
  and $14.35, respectively. Through February 1, 2003, approximately 3,874,000
  shares had been issued under this plan and 1,126,000 shares remained available
  for future issuance.

Restricted
  Stock Plan.

The Company’s Restricted Stock Plan provides for stock
  awards to officers and certain key employees. All awards under the plan entitle
  the participant to full dividend and voting rights. Unvested shares are restricted
  as to disposition and subject to forfeiture under certain circumstances. The
  market value of these shares at date of grant is amortized to expense ratably
  over the vesting period


of generally two to five
  years. At year-end 2002, 2001 and 2000, the unamortized compensation expense
  was $26.9 million, $18.4 million and $18.4 million, respectively. A summary
  of restricted stock award activity follows:

Note G: Related Party
  Transactions

In 2000 the Company made
  an interest-free relocation loan of $2.5 million to an executive officer, secured
  by a deed of trust on his principal residence. All outstanding principal under
  the loan is due and payable on the earliest to occur of (i) July 31, 2008, (ii)
  120 days following any termination of employment with the Company, or (iii)
  any sale, transfer or hypothecation of all or any part of the property referenced
  in the deed of trust.

The Company maintains consulting
  and benefits agreements with its Chairman of the Board under which an annual
  consulting fee of $1.1 million is paid in monthly installments and health and

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’
  REPORT

Board of Directors and Stockholders

Ross Stores, Inc.

Newark, California

We have audited the accompanying
  consolidated balance sheets of Ross Stores, Inc. and subsidiaries as of February
  1, 2003 and February 2, 2002, and the related consolidated statements of earnings,
  stockholders' equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period
  ended February 1, 2003. These financial statements are the responsibility of
  the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on
  these financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in
  accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of
  America. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
  reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
  misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
  the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
  assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management,
  as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe
  that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, such consolidated
  financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial
  position of Ross Stores, Inc. and subsidiaries as of February 1, 2003 and February
  2, 2002, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of
  the three years in the period ended February 1, 2003 in conformity with accounting
  principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
