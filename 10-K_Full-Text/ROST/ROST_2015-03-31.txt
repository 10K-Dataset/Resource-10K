PART I

ITEM 1. BUSINESS

Ross Stores, Inc. and its subsidiaries (“we” or the “Company”) operate two brands of off-price retail apparel and home fashion

stores—Ross Dress for Less

®

(“Ross”) and dd’s DISCOUNTS

®

.

Ross is the largest off-price apparel and home fashion chain in the United States, with

1,210

locations in

33 states, the District of Columbia and Guam

, as of

January 31, 2015

. Ross offers first-quality, in-season, name brand and designer apparel, accessories, footwear, and home fashions for the entire family at savings of 20% to 60% off department and specialty store regular prices every day. Ross' target customers are primarily from middle income households.

We also operate


dd’s DISCOUNTS stores in

15 states

as of

January 31, 2015

. dd's DISCOUNTS features more moderately-priced first-quality, in-season, name brand apparel, accessories, footwear, and home fashions for the entire family at savings of 20% to 70% off moderate department and discount store regular prices every day. The typical dd’s DISCOUNTS store is located in an established shopping center in a densely populated urban or suburban neighborhood and its target customers typically come from households with more moderate incomes than Ross customers.

The merchant, store, and distribution organizations for Ross and dd’s DISCOUNTS are separate and distinct. The two chains share certain other corporate and support services.

Both our Ross and dd's DISCOUNTS brands target value-conscious women and men between the ages of 18 and 54. The decisions we make, from merchandising, purchasing, and pricing, to the locations of our stores, are based on these customer profiles. We believe that both brands derive a competitive advantage by offering a wide assortment of product within each of our merchandise categories in organized and easy-to-shop store environments.

Our mission is to offer competitive values to our target customers by focusing on the following key strategic objectives:

•

Maintain an appropriate level of recognizable brands, labels, and fashions at strong discounts throughout the store.

•

Meet customer needs on a local basis.

•

Deliver an in-store shopping experience that reflects the expectations of the off-price customer.

•

Manage real estate growth to compete effectively across all our markets.

We refer to our fiscal years ended

January 31, 2015

,

February 1, 2014

, and

February 2, 2013

as fiscal


, fiscal


, and fiscal


, respectively. Fiscal


and


were each 52-week years. Fiscal


was a 53-week year.

Merchandising, Purchasing, and Pricing

We seek to provide our customers with a wide assortment of first-quality, in-season, brand name and designer apparel, accessories, footwear, and home merchandise for the entire family at savings of 20% to 60% below department and specialty store regular prices every day at Ross, and 20% to 70% below moderate department and discount store regular prices at dd’s DISCOUNTS. We sell recognizable brand name merchandise that is current and fashionable in each category. New merchandise typically is received from three to six times per week at both Ross and dd’s DISCOUNTS stores. Our buyers review their merchandise assortments on a weekly basis, enabling them to respond to selling trends and purchasing opportunities in the market. Our merchandising strategy is reflected in our advertising, which emphasizes a strong value message. Our stores offer a treasure-hunt shopping experience where customers can find great savings every day on a broad assortment of brand name bargains for the family and the home.

Merchandising.

Our merchandising strategy incorporates a combination of off-price buying techniques to purchase advance-of-season, in-season, and past-season merchandise for both Ross and dd’s DISCOUNTS. We believe nationally recognized name brands sold at compelling discounts will continue to be an important determinant of our success. We generally leave the brand name label on the merchandise we sell.

We have established merchandise assortments that we believe are attractive to our target customers. Although we offer fewer classifications of merchandise than most department stores, we generally offer a large selection within each classification with a wide assortment of vendors, labels, prices, colors, styles, and fabrics within each size or item. The mix of comparable store sales by department in fiscal


was approximately as follows:

Ladies

29%

,

Home Accents and Bed and Bath

24%

,

Accessories, Lingerie, Fine Jewelry, and Fragrances

13%

,

Men's

13%

,

Shoes


13%

, and

Children's

8%

. These merchandise offerings include, but are not limited to, small furniture and furniture accents, educational toys and games, luggage, gourmet food and cookware, watches, and sporting goods.

Purchasing.

We have a combined network of approximately

8,200

merchandise vendors and manufacturers for both Ross and dd’s DISCOUNTS and believe we have adequate sources of first-quality merchandise to meet our requirements. We purchase the vast majority of our merchandise directly from manufacturers, and we have not experienced any difficulty in obtaining sufficient merchandise inventory.

We believe that our ability to effectively execute certain off-price buying strategies is a key factor in our success. Our buyers use a number of methods that enable us to offer our customers brand name and designer merchandise at strong discounts every day relative to department and specialty stores for Ross and moderate department and discount stores for dd’s DISCOUNTS. By purchasing later in the merchandise buying cycle than department, specialty, and discount stores, we are able to take advantage of imbalances between retailers’ demand for products and manufacturers’ supply of those products.

Unlike most department and specialty stores, we typically do not require that manufacturers provide promotional allowances, co-op advertising allowances, return privileges, split shipments, drop shipments to stores, or delayed deliveries of merchandise. For most orders, only one delivery is made to one of our five distribution centers. These flexible requirements further enable our buyers to obtain significant discounts on in-season purchases.

The majority of the apparel and apparel-related merchandise that we offer in all of our stores is acquired through opportunistic purchases created by manufacturer overruns and canceled orders both during and at the end of a season. These buys are referred to as "close-out" and "packaway" purchases. Close-outs can be shipped to stores in-season, allowing us to get in-season goods into our stores at lower prices. Packaway merchandise is purchased with the intent that it will be stored in our warehouses until a later date, which may even be the beginning of the same selling season in the following year. Packaway purchases are an effective method of increasing the percentage of prestige and national brands at competitive savings within our merchandise assortments. Packaway merchandise is mainly fashion basics and, therefore, not usually affected by shifts in fashion trends.

In fiscal


, we continued our emphasis on this important sourcing strategy in response to compelling opportunities available in the marketplace. Packaway accounted for approximately

45%

and

49%

of total inventories as of

January 31, 2015

and

February 1, 2014

, respectively, and reflects our merchants’ continued ability to take advantage of a large amount of close-out opportunities in the marketplace. We believe the strong discounts we are able to offer on packaway merchandise are one of the key drivers of our business results.

Our primary buying offices are located in New York City and Los Angeles, the nation's two largest apparel markets. These strategic locations allow our buyers to be in the market on a daily basis, sourcing opportunities and negotiating purchases with vendors and manufacturers. These locations also enable our buyers to strengthen vendor relationships—a key element to the success of our off-price buying strategies.

Over the past year, we continued to make strategic investments in our merchandising organization to further enhance our ability to deliver name brand bargains to our customers. At the end of fiscal


, we had approximately


merchants for Ross and dd’s DISCOUNTS combined. The Ross and dd’s DISCOUNTS buying organizations are separate and distinct, and each includes merchandise management, buyers, and assistant buyers. Ross and dd’s DISCOUNTS buyers have on average

eight

years of experience, including merchandising positions with other retailers such as Bloomingdale's, Burlington Stores, Foot Locker, Kohl’s, Loehmann’s, Lord & Taylor, Macy's, Nordstrom, Saks, and TJX. We expect to continue to make additional targeted investments in new merchants to further develop our relationships with an expanding number of manufacturers and vendors. Our ongoing objective is to strengthen our ability to procure the most desirable brands and fashions at competitive discounts.

The off-price buying strategies utilized by our experienced team of merchants enable us to purchase Ross merchandise at net prices that are lower than prices paid by department and specialty stores, and to purchase dd’s DISCOUNTS merchandise at net prices that are lower than prices paid by moderate department and discount stores.

Pricing.

Our policy is to sell brand name merchandise at Ross that is priced 20% to 60% below most department and specialty store regular prices. At dd’s DISCOUNTS, we sell more moderate brand name product and fashions that are priced 20% to 70% below most moderate department and discount store regular prices. Our pricing policy is reflected on the price tag displaying our selling price as well as the comparable selling price for that item in department and


specialty stores for Ross merchandise, or in more moderate department and discount stores for dd’s DISCOUNTS merchandise.

Our pricing strategy at Ross differs from that of a department or specialty store. We purchase our merchandise at lower prices and mark it up less than a department or specialty store. This strategy enables us to offer customers consistently low prices and compelling value. On a weekly basis our buyers review specified departments in our stores for possible markdowns based on the rate of sale as well as at the end of fashion seasons to promote faster turnover of merchandise inventory and to accelerate the flow of fresh product. A similar pricing strategy is in place at dd’s DISCOUNTS where prices are compared to those in moderate department and discount stores.

Stores

As of

January 31, 2015

, we operated a total of

1,362

stores comprised of

1,210

Ross stores and


dd’s DISCOUNTS stores. Our stores are located predominantly in community and neighborhood shopping centers in heavily populated urban and suburban areas. Where the size of the market and real estate opportunities permit, we cluster Ross stores to benefit from economies of scale in advertising, distribution, and field management. We do the same for dd’s DISCOUNTS stores.

We believe a key element of our success at both Ross and dd’s DISCOUNTS, is our organized, attractive, easy-to-shop, in-store environments which allow customers to shop at their own pace. While our stores promote a self-service, treasure hunt shopping experience, the layouts are designed to enhance customer convenience in their merchandise presentation, dressing rooms, checkout, and merchandise return areas. Our store's sales area is based on a prototype single floor design with a racetrack aisle layout. A customer can locate desired departments by signs displayed just below the ceiling of each department. We enable our customers to select among sizes and prices through prominent category and sizing markers. At most stores, shopping carts and / or baskets are available at the entrance for customer convenience. Cash registers are primarily located at store exits for customer ease and efficient staffing.

We accept a variety of payment methods. We provide refunds on all merchandise (not used, worn, or altered) returned with a receipt within 30 days. Merchandise returns having a receipt older than 30 days are exchanged or refunded with store credit.

Operating Costs

Consistent with the other aspects of our business strategy, we strive to keep operating costs as low as possible. Among the factors which have enabled us to do this are: labor costs that are generally lower than full-price department and specialty stores due to a store design that creates a self-service retail format and due to the utilization of labor saving technologies; economies of scale with respect to general and administrative costs resulting from centralized merchandising, marketing, and purchasing decisions; and flexible store layout criteria which facilitate conversion of existing buildings to our formats.

Information Systems

We continue to invest in new information systems and technology to provide a platform for growth over the next several years. Recent initiatives include enhancements to our merchandise planning, core merchandising, allocation management, and store point-of-sale and store labor management systems. These initiatives support our expansion in both new and existing markets and our assortment execution and plan achievement, while also supporting future growth.

Distribution

We own and operate five

distribution processing facilities – two in California, one in Pennsylvania, and two in South Carolina. We ship all of our merchandise to our stores through these distribution centers, which are large, highly automated, and built to suit our specific off-price business model. An additional distribution center in Shafter, California is currently under construction and expected to open in 2015.


Currently we own

four

and lease

three

other warehouse facilities for packaway storage. We also use other third-party facilities as needed for storage of packaway inventory.

We also utilize third-party cross dock facilities to distribute merchandise to stores on a regional basis. Shipments are made by contract carriers to the stores three to six times per week depending on location.

We believe that our distribution centers with their current expansion capabilities will provide adequate processing capacity to support our current store growth. Information on the size and locations of our distribution centers and warehouse facilities is found under “Properties” in Item 2.

Advertising

Advertising for Ross Dress for Less relies primarily on television to communicate the Ross value proposition— savings off the same brands carried at leading department stores every day. This strategy reflects our belief that television is the most efficient and cost effective medium for communicating our brand position. While television is our primary advertising medium, we continue to utilize additional channels to communicate our brand position. Advertising for dd’s DISCOUNTS is primarily focused on new store grand openings and local media initiatives.

Trademarks

The trademarks for Ross Dress For Less

and dd’s DISCOUNTS

Employees

As of

January 31, 2015

, we had approximately

71,400

total employees, which includes both full and part-time employees. Additionally, we hire temporary employees especially during the peak seasons. Our employees are non-union. Management considers the relationship between the Company and our employees to be good.

Competition

We believe the principal competitive factors in the off-price retail apparel and home fashion industry are offering significant discounts on brand name merchandise, offering a well-balanced assortment that appeals to our target customers, and consistently providing store environments that are convenient and easy to shop. To execute this concept, we continue to make strategic investments in our merchandising organization. We also continue to make improvements to our core merchandising system to strengthen our ability to plan, buy, and allocate product based on more local versus regional trends. We believe that we are well-positioned to compete based on each of these factors.

Nevertheless, the retail apparel market is highly fragmented and competitive. We face a challenging macro-economic and retail environment that creates intense competition for business from department stores, specialty stores, discount stores, warehouse stores, other off-price retailers, and manufacturer-owned outlet stores, many of which are units of large national or regional chains that have substantially greater resources. We also compete to some degree with retailers that sell apparel and home fashions through catalogs or online. The retail apparel and home-related businesses may become even more competitive in the future.

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS

Our Annual Report on Form 10-K for fiscal


, and information we provide in our Annual Report to Stockholders, press releases, and other investor communications, including those on our corporate website, may contain forward-looking statements with respect to anticipated future events and our projected growth, financial performance, operations, and competitive position that are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those forward-looking statements and our prior expectations and projections. Refer to Management’s Discussion and Analysis for a more complete identification and discussion of “Forward-Looking Statements.”

Our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and the performance of our common stock may be adversely affected by a number of risk factors. Risks and uncertainties that apply to both Ross and dd's DISCOUNTS include, without limitation, the following:

We are subject to the economic and industry risks that affect large retailers operating in the United States.

Our business is exposed to the risks of a large, multi-store retailer, which must continually and efficiently obtain and distribute a supply of fresh merchandise throughout a large and growing network of stores and distribution centers. These risk factors include:

•

An increase in the level of competitive pressures in the apparel or home-related merchandise retailing industry.

•

Changes in the level of consumer spending on or preferences for apparel or home-related merchandise.

•

The impacts from the macro-economic environment and financial and credit markets that affect consumer disposable income and consumer confidence, including but not limited to interest rates, recession, inflation, deflation, energy costs, tax rates and policy, unemployment trends, and fluctuating commodity costs.

•

Changes in geopolitical and geoeconomic conditions.

•

Unseasonable weather trends that could affect consumer demand for seasonal apparel and apparel-related products.

•

Changes in the availability, quantity, or quality of attractive brand name merchandise at desirable discounts that could impact our ability to purchase product and continue to offer customers a wide assortment of merchandise at competitive prices.

•

Potential disruptions in the supply chain or in information systems that could impact our ability to deliver product to our stores in a timely and cost-effective manner.

•

A change in the availability, quality, or cost of new store real estate locations.

•

A downturn in the economy or a natural disaster in California or in another region where we have a concentration of stores or a distribution center. Our corporate headquarters, Los Angeles buying office, two operating distribution centers, two warehouses, and

25%

of our stores are located in California.

We are subject to operating risks as we attempt to execute on our merchandising and growth strategies.

The continued success of our business depends in part upon our ability to increase sales at our existing store locations, to open new stores, and to operate stores on a profitable basis. Our existing strategies and store and distribution center expansion programs may not result in a continuation of our anticipated revenue or profit growth. In executing our off-price retail strategies and working to improve efficiencies, expand our store network, and reduce our costs, we face a number of operational risks, including our ability to:

•

Attract, train, and retain associates with the retail talent necessary to execute our strategies.

•

Effectively operate and continually upgrade our various supply chain, store, core merchandising, and other information systems.

•

Improve our merchandising and transaction processing capabilities, and the reliability and security of our data communication systems, through implementation of new processes and systems enhancements.

•

Protect against security breaches, including cyber-attacks on our transaction processing and computer information systems, that could result in the theft, transfer or unauthorized disclosure of customer, credit card, employee or other private and valuable information that we collect and process in the ordinary course of our business, and avoid resulting damage to our reputation, loss of customer confidence, exposure to litigation and regulatory action, unanticipated costs and disruption of our operations.

•

Improve new store sales and profitability, especially in newer regions and markets.

•

Add capacity to our existing distribution centers, find new distribution center sites, and build out planned additional distribution centers timely and cost effectively.


•

Achieve and maintain targeted levels of productivity and efficiency in our existing and new distribution centers.

•

Lease or acquire acceptable new store sites with favorable demographics and long-term financial returns.

•

Identify and successfully enter new geographic markets.

•

Achieve planned gross margins by effectively managing inventories, markdowns, and inventory shortage.

•

Effectively manage all operating costs of the business, the largest of which are payroll and benefit costs for store and distribution center employees.

We carry earthquake insurance to help mitigate the risk of financial loss due to an earthquake.

Our real estate strategy in


is to open stores in states where we currently operate, to increase our market penetration and reduce overhead and advertising expenses as a percentage of sales in each market. We also expect to continue our store expansion in newer markets in


. Important considerations in evaluating a new store location in both newer and more established markets are the availability and quality of potential sites, demographic characteristics, competition, and population density of the local trade area. In addition, we continue to consider opportunistic real estate acquisitions.


The following table summarizes the locations of our stores by state/territory as of

January 31, 2015

and

February 1, 2014

.

Where possible, we obtain sites in buildings requiring minimal alterations, allowing us to establish stores in new locations in a relatively short period of time at reasonable costs in a given market. At

January 31, 2015

, the majority of our stores had unexpired original lease terms ranging from

three to ten years

with

three to four

renewal options of five years each. The average unexpired original lease term of our leased stores is

five years or 21 years

if renewal options are included. See Note E of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

See additional discussion under “Stores” in Item 1.


The following table summarizes the location and approximate sizes of our distribution centers, warehouses, and office locations as of

January 31, 2015

¹We are currently in the process of completing the infrastructure build-out of this distribution center site with an estimated occupancy of 2015.

See additional discussion under “Distribution” in Item 1.

ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

Like many California retailers, we have been named in class action lawsuits alleging violation of wage and hour and other employment laws. Class action litigation remains pending as of

January 31, 2015

.

We are also party to various other legal and regulatory proceedings arising in the normal course of business. Actions filed against us include commercial, product and product safety, customer, intellectual property, and labor and employment-related claims, including lawsuits in which private plaintiffs or governmental agencies allege that we violated federal, state, and / or local laws. Actions against us are in various procedural stages. Many of these proceedings raise factual and legal issues and are subject to uncertainties.

We believe that the resolution of our pending class action litigation and other currently pending legal and regulatory proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.

Selected Financial Data


ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Overview

Ross Stores, Inc. operates two brands of off-price retail apparel and home fashion stores—Ross Dress for Less

®

(“Ross”) and dd’s DISCOUNTS

®

. Ross is the largest off-price apparel and home fashion chain in the United States with

1,210

locations in

33 states, the District of Columbia and Guam

as of

January 31, 2015

. Ross offers first-quality, in-season, name brand and designer apparel, accessories, footwear, and home fashions for the entire family at savings of 20% to 60% off department and specialty store regular prices every day. We also operate


dd’s DISCOUNTS stores in

15 states

as of

January 31, 2015

that feature a more moderately-priced assortment of first-quality, in-season, name brand apparel, accessories, footwear, and home fashions for the entire family at savings of 20% to 70% off moderate department and discount store regular prices every day.

Our primary objective is to pursue and refine our existing off-price strategies to maintain and improve both profitability and financial returns over the long term. In establishing appropriate growth targets for our business, we closely monitor market share trends for the off-price industry and believe our share gains over the past few years were driven mainly by continued focus on value by consumers. Our sales and earnings gains in


continued to benefit from efficient execution of our off-price model throughout all areas of our business. Our merchandise and operational strategies are designed to take advantage of the expanding market share of the off-price industry as well as the ongoing customer demand for name brand fashions for the family and home at compelling discounts every day.

We refer to our fiscal years ended

January 31, 2015

,

February 1, 2014

, and

February 2, 2013

as fiscal


, fiscal


, and fiscal


, respectively. Fiscal


and


were 52-week years. Fiscal


was a 53-week year.

Results of Operations

The following table summarizes the financial results for fiscal


,


, and


:

¹

Fiscal 2012 was a 53-week year; all other fiscal years presented were 52 weeks.


Stores.

Total stores open at the end of fiscal


,


, and


were

1,362

,

1,276

, and

1,199

, respectively. The number of stores at the end of fiscal


,


, and


increased by

7%

,

6%

, and

7%

from the respective prior years. Our expansion strategy is to open additional stores based on market penetration, local demographic characteristics, competition, expected store profitability, and the ability to leverage overhead expenses. We continually evaluate opportunistic real estate acquisitions and opportunities for potential new store locations. We also evaluate our current store locations and determine store closures based on similar criteria.

Sales.

Sales for fiscal


increased

$0.8 billion

, or

7.9%

, compared to the

prior year

due to the opening of


net new stores during


and a

3%

increase in comparable store sales (defined as stores that have been open for more than 14 complete months). Sales for fiscal


increased

$0.5 billion

, or

5.2%

, compared to the prior year due to the opening of


net new stores during


and a

3%

increase in sales from comparable stores.

Our sales mix is shown below for fiscal


,


, and


:

We intend to address the competitive climate for off-price apparel and home goods by pursuing and refining our existing strategies and by continuing to strengthen our organization, diversify our merchandise mix, and more fully develop our systems to improve regional and local merchandise offerings. Although our strategies and store expansion program contributed to sales gains in fiscal


,


, and


, we cannot be sure that they will result in a continuation of sales growth or in an increase in net earnings.

Cost of goods sold.

Cost of goods sold in fiscal


increased

$577.0 million

compared to the prior year mainly due to increased sales from the opening of


net new stores during the year and a

3%

increase in sales from comparable stores.

Cost of goods sold as a percentage of sales for fiscal


decreased approximately 5 basis points from the prior year primarily due to a 20 basis point increase in merchandise gross margin. This improvement was partially offset by a 15 basis point increase in buying costs.

Cost of goods sold in fiscal


increased

$349.5 million

compared to the prior year mainly due to increased sales from the opening of


net new stores during the year and a

3%

increase in sales from comparable stores.

Cost of goods sold as a percentage of sales for fiscal


decreased approximately 15 basis points from the prior year. This improvement was due primarily to a 45 basis point increase in merchandise gross margin, which was partially offset by increases in occupancy of about 20 basis points and increases in distribution and buying expenses of about 5 basis points each.

We cannot be sure that the gross profit margins realized in fiscal


,


, and


will continue in future years.


Selling, general and administrative expenses.

For fiscal


, selling, general and administrative expenses (“SG&A”) increased

$89.0 million

compared to the prior year, mainly due to increased store operating costs reflecting the opening of


net new stores during the year. SG&A as a percentage of sales for fiscal


decreased by approximately 30 basis points compared to the prior year primarily due to tight expense control.

For fiscal


, SG&A increased

$88.5 million

compared to the prior year, mainly due to increased store operating costs reflecting the opening of


net new stores during the year. SG&A as a percentage of sales for fiscal


increased by approximately 15 basis points compared to the prior year primarily due to higher costs related to the relocation of our data center.

The largest component of SG&A is payroll. The total number of employees, including both full and part-time, as of fiscal year end


,


, and


was approximately

71,400

,

66,300

, and

57,500

, respectively.

Interest expense (income), net.

In fiscal


, net interest expense increased by

$3.2 million

primarily due to the issuance of our unsecured

3.375%

Senior Notes due

September 2024

. As a percentage of sales, net interest expense in fiscal


increased by approximately five basis points compared to the same period in the prior year. The table below shows the components of interest expense and income for fiscal


,


, and


:

Taxes on earnings.

Our effective tax rate for fiscal


,


and


was approximately

38%

in each year, which represents the applicable combined federal and state statutory rates reduced by the federal benefit of state taxes deductible on federal returns. The effective rate is impacted by changes in laws, location of new stores, level of earnings, and the resolution of tax positions with various taxing authorities. We anticipate that our effective tax rate for fiscal


will be between 37% and 38%.

Net earnings.

Net earnings as a percentage of sales for fiscal


were higher than fiscal


primarily due to both lower cost of goods sold and lower SG&A expenses. Net earnings as a percentage of sales for fiscal


were higher compared to fiscal


primarily due to lower cost of goods sold partially offset by higher SG&A expenses.

Earnings per share

. Diluted earnings per share in fiscal


was

$4.42

compared to

$3.88

in the prior year period. The

14%

increase in diluted earnings per share is attributable to an approximate

10%

increase in net earnings and a 4% reduction in weighted average diluted shares outstanding, largely due to the repurchase of common stock under our stock repurchase program. Diluted earnings per share in fiscal


was

$3.88

compared to

$3.53

in fiscal


. The

10%

increase in diluted earnings per share is attributable to an approximate

6%

increase in net earnings and a 4% reduction in weighted average diluted shares outstanding, largely due to the repurchase of common stock under our stock repurchase program.

Financial Condition

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Our primary sources of funds for our business activities are cash flows from operations and short-term trade credit. Our primary ongoing cash requirements are for merchandise inventory purchases, payroll, rent, taxes, and capital expenditures in connection with new and existing stores, and investments in distribution centers, information systems, and buying and corporate offices. We also use cash to repurchase stock under our stock repurchase program and to pay dividends.


Operating Activities

Net cash provided by operating activities was $1,372.8 million,

$1,022.0 million

, and

$979.6 million

in fiscal


,


, and


respectively, and was primarily driven by net earnings excluding non-cash expenses for depreciation and amortization. Our primary source of operating cash flow is the sale of our merchandise inventory. We regularly review the age and condition of our merchandise and are able to maintain current merchandise inventory in our stores through replenishment processes and liquidation of slower-moving merchandise through clearance markdowns.

Net cash from operations increased in


compared to


primarily due to higher net earnings and an increase in accounts payable leverage (defined as accounts payable divided by merchandise inventory). The change in accounts payable net of the change in merchandise inventory, resulted in a source of cash of approximately

$89 million

in fiscal


compared to a use of cash of approximately

$52 million

and

$39 million

for fiscal


and


, respectively.

Accounts payable leverage was

73%

,

62%

, and

67%

as of

January 31, 2015

,

February 1, 2014

, and

February 2, 2013

, respectively. Changes in accounts payable leverage are primarily driven by the levels and timing of inventory receipts and payments. Accounts payable leverage at the end of fiscal 2013 was also impacted due to the timing shift of the dividend declaration from January 2014 to February 2014.

As a regular part of our business, packaway inventory levels will vary over time based on availability of compelling opportunities in the marketplace. Packaway merchandise is purchased with the intent that it will be stored in our warehouses until a later date. The timing of the release of packaway inventory to our stores is principally driven by the product mix and seasonality of the merchandise, and its relation to our store merchandise assortment plans. As such, the aging of packaway varies by merchandise category and seasonality of purchase, but typically packaway remains in storage less than six months. We expect to continue to take advantage of packaway inventory opportunities to maximize our ability to deliver bargains to our customers.

Changes in packaway inventory levels impact our operating cash flow. At the end of fiscal


, packaway inventory was

45%

of total inventory compared to

49%

and

47%

at the end of fiscal


and


, respectively.

Investing Activities

Net cash used in investing activities was

$639.0 million

,

$563.8 million

, and

$425.7 million

in fiscal


,


, and


, respectively. The increases in cash used for investing activities in fiscal


,


, and


were primarily due to increases in our capital expenditures.

In fiscal


,


, and


, our capital expenditures were

$646.7 million

,

$550.5 million

, and

$424.4 million

, respectively. Our capital expenditures include costs to build or expand distribution centers, open new stores and improve existing stores, and for various other expenditures related to our information technology systems, buying, and corporate offices. We opened


,


, and


new stores in fiscal


,


, and


, respectively. In September 2014 we completed the purchase of the office building where our New York buying office is located for $222 million.


Our capital expenditures over the last three years are set forth in the table below:

We are forecasting approximately

$450 million

in capital expenditures for fiscal year


to fund costs for fixtures and leasehold improvements to open new Ross and dd’s DISCOUNTS stores, the upgrade or relocation of existing stores, investments in information technology systems, and for various other expenditures related to our stores, distribution centers, buying and corporate offices. We expect to primarily fund capital expenditures with available cash and cash flows from operations.

We had no purchases of investments in fiscal


and purchases of

$12.0 million

and

$5.4 million

in fiscal


and fiscal


, respectively. We had proceeds from investments of

$12.0 million

,

$1.6 million

, and

$6.2 million

in fiscal


,


, and


, respectively.

Financing Activities

Net cash used in financing activities was

$460.4 million

,

$681.8 million

, and

$557.0 million

in fiscal


,


, and


, respectively. During fiscal


,


, and


, our liquidity and capital requirements were provided by available cash and cash flows from operations and in fiscal 2014, the issuance of our unsecured 3.375% Senior Notes due September 2024 ("2024 Notes").

In September 2014, we issued $250 million of unsecured 2024 Notes and used most of the net proceeds of approximately $246 million to purchase our New York buying office building for $222 million and the remaining $24 million for other general corporate purposes.

We repurchased

7.4 million

,

8.2 million

, and

7.5 million

shares of common stock for aggregate purchase prices of approximately

$550 million

,

$550 million

, and

$450 million

in fiscal


,


, and


, respectively. We also acquired

0.5 million

shares in each of fiscal


,


, and


of treasury stock from our employee stock equity compensation programs, for aggregate purchase prices of approximately

$39.0 million

,

$29.9 million

, and

$29.4 million

during fiscal


,


, and


, respectively. In February 2015, our Board of Directors approved a new two-year $1.4 billion stock repurchase program for fiscal 2015 and 2016.

In

February 2015

, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of

$0.235

per common share, payable on

March 31, 2015

. Our Board of Directors declared cash dividends of

$0.20

per common share in February, May, August, and November


, cash dividends of

$0.17

per common share in January, May, August, and November


, and cash dividends of

$0.14

per common share in January, May, August, and November


.

During fiscal


,


, and


, we paid dividends of

$168.5 million

,

$147.9 million

, and

$125.7 million

, respectively.

In March 2015, our Board of Directors approved a two-for-one stock split in the form of a 100 percent stock dividend, to be paid on June 11, 2015 to stockholders of record as of April 22, 2015. The stock split will not have an impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. Share and per share amounts have not been restated to reflect the pending stock split.

Short-term trade credit represents a significant source of financing for merchandise inventory. Trade credit arises from customary payment terms and trade practices with our vendors. We regularly review the adequacy of credit available to us from all sources and expect to be able to maintain adequate trade credit, bank lines, and other credit sources to meet our capital and liquidity requirements, including lease payment obligations, in


.

Our existing $600 million unsecured revolving credit facility expires in June 2017 and contains a $300 million sublimit for issuance of standby letters of credit. Interest on this facility is based on LIBOR plus an applicable margin (currently


100 basis points) and is payable quarterly and upon maturity. As of

January 31, 2015

, we had no borrowings or standby letters of credit outstanding on this facility and our $600 million credit facility remains in place and available.

We estimate that existing cash balances, cash flows from operations, bank credit lines, and trade credit are adequate to meet our operating cash needs and to fund our planned capital investments, common stock repurchases, and quarterly dividend payments for at least the next twelve months.

Contractual Obligations

The table below presents our significant contractual obligations as of

January 31, 2015

:


We have a

$101.7 million

liability for unrecognized tax benefits that is included in Other long-term liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. This liability is excluded from the schedule above as the timing of payments cannot be reasonably estimated.

²Our New York buying office building is subject to a 99-year ground lease.

Senior notes.

In September 2014, we issued unsecured 2024 Notes with an aggregate principal amount of $250 million. The 2024 Notes were issued at a price equal to 99.329% of the principal amount. Interest on the 2024 Notes is payable semi-annually beginning March 2015.

As of

January 31, 2015

, we also had outstanding two series of unsecured senior notes in the aggregate principal amount of $150 million, held by various institutional investors. The Series A notes totaling $85 million are due in December 2018 and bear interest at a rate of 6.38%. The Series B notes totaling $65 million are due in December 2021 and bear interest at a rate of 6.53%. Borrowings under these senior notes are subject to certain financial covenants, including interest coverage and other financial ratios. As of

January 31, 2015

, we were in compliance with those covenants.

The 2024 Notes, Series A, and Series B senior notes are all subject to prepayment penalties for early payment of principal.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

Operating leases

. We currently lease all but three of our store locations, three warehouse facilities, and a buying office. In addition, we have a ground lease related to our New York buying office. Except for certain leasehold improvements and equipment, these leased locations do not represent long-term capital investments.

Two of the warehouses are in Carlisle, Pennsylvania with leases expiring in


and


. The third warehouse is in Fort Mill, South Carolina, with a lease expiring in 2019. The leases for the two Carlisle, Pennsylvania warehouses contain renewal provisions.

We currently lease approximately

68,000

square feet of office space for our Los Angeles buying office. The lease term for this facility expires in


and contains renewal provisions.

Purchase obligations.

As of

January 31, 2015

we had purchase obligations of approximately

$1,953 million

. These purchase obligations primarily consist of merchandise inventory purchase orders, commitments related to construction projects, store fixtures and supplies, and information technology service, transportation, and maintenance contracts.


Commercial Credit Facilities

The table below presents our significant available commercial credit facilities at

January 31, 2015

:

Revolving credit facility.

Our existing $600 million unsecured revolving credit facility expires in June 2017 and contains a $300 million sublimit for issuance of standby letters of credit. Interest on this facility is based on LIBOR plus an applicable margin (currently 100 basis points) and is payable quarterly and upon maturity. As of

January 31, 2015

we had no borrowings outstanding or standby letters of credit issued under this facility.

Our revolving credit facility has covenant restrictions requiring us to maintain certain interest coverage and other financial ratios. In addition, the interest rates under the revolving credit facility may vary depending on actual interest coverage ratios achieved. As of

January 31, 2015

we were in compliance with these covenants.

Standby letters of credit and collateral trust.

We use standby letters of credit outside of our revolving credit facility in addition to a funded trust to collateralize our insurance obligations. As of

January 31, 2015

and

February 1, 2014

, we had

$19.5 million

and

$24.3 million

, respectively, in standby letters of credit outstanding and

$56.3 million

and

$47.2 million

, respectively, in a collateral trust. The standby letters of credit are collateralized by restricted cash and the collateral trust consists of restricted cash, cash equivalents, and investments.

Trade letters of credit.

We had

$32.8 million

and

$31.6 million

in trade letters of credit outstanding at

January 31, 2015

and

February 1, 2014

, respectively.

Effects of inflation or deflation.

We do not consider the effects of inflation or deflation to be material to our financial position and results of operations.

Other

Critical Accounting Policies

The preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts. These estimates and assumptions are evaluated on an ongoing basis and are based on historical experience and on various other factors that management believes to be reasonable. We believe the following critical accounting policies describe the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.

Merchandise inventory.

Our merchandise inventory is stated at the lower of cost (determined using a weighted average basis) or net realizable value. We purchase manufacturer overruns and canceled orders both during and at the end of a season which are referred to as "packaway" inventory. Packaway inventory is purchased with the intent that it will be stored in our warehouses until a later date. The timing of the release of packaway inventory to our stores is principally driven by the product mix and seasonality of the merchandise, and its relation to the Company’s store merchandise assortment plans. As such, the aging of packaway varies by merchandise category and seasonality of purchase, but typically packaway remains in storage less than six months. Packaway inventory accounted for approximately

45%

,

49%

, and

47%

of total inventories as of

January 31, 2015

,

February 1, 2014

, and

February 2, 2013

, respectively. Merchandise inventory includes acquisition, processing, and storage costs related to packaway inventory.

Included in the carrying value of our merchandise inventory is a provision for shortage. The shortage reserve is based on historical shortage rates as evaluated through our annual physical merchandise inventory counts and cycle counts. If actual market conditions, markdowns, or shortage are less favorable than those projected by us, or if sales of the


merchandise inventory are more difficult than anticipated, additional merchandise inventory write-downs may be required.

Long-lived assets.

We review for a long-lived asset impairment charge when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a long-lived asset may not be recoverable based on estimated future cash flows. If analysis of the undiscounted cash flow of an asset group was less than the carrying value of the asset group, an impairment loss would be recognized to write the asset group down to its fair value. If our actual results differ materially from projected results, an impairment charge may be required in the future. In the course of performing our annual analysis, we determined that no long-lived asset impairment charge was required for fiscal


,


, or


.

Depreciation and amortization expense.

Property and equipment are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the asset, typically ranging from three to 12 years for equipment and 20 to 40 years for land improvements and buildings. The cost of leasehold improvements is amortized over the lesser of the useful life of the asset or the applicable lease term.

Lease accounting.

When a lease contains “rent holidays” or requires fixed escalations of the minimum lease payments, we record rental expense on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease and the difference between the average rental amount charged to expense and the amount payable under the lease is recorded as deferred rent. We begin recording rent expense on the lease possession date. Tenant improvement allowances are included in Other long-term liabilities and are amortized over the lease term. Changes in tenant improvement allowances are included as a component of operating activities in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.

Insurance obligations.

We use a combination of insurance and self-insurance for a number of risk management activities, including workers’ compensation, general liability, and employee-related health care benefits. Our self-insurance and deductible liability is determined actuarially, based on claims filed and an estimate of claims incurred but not reported. Should a greater amount of claims occur compared to what is estimated or the costs of medical care increase beyond what was anticipated, our recorded reserves may not be sufficient and additional charges could be required.

Stock-based compensation.

We recognize compensation expense based upon the grant date fair value of all stock-based awards. We use historical data to estimate pre-vesting forfeitures and to recognize stock-based compensation expense. All stock-based compensation awards are expensed over the service or performance periods of the awards.

Income taxes.

We account for our uncertain tax positions in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 740. We are required to make assumptions and judgments regarding our income tax exposures. Our policy is to recognize interest and/or penalties related to all tax positions in income tax expense. To the extent that accrued interest and penalties do not ultimately become payable, amounts accrued will be reduced and reflected as a reduction of the overall income tax provision in the period that such determination is made.

The critical accounting policies noted above are not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of our accounting policies. In many cases, the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“GAAP”), with no need for management’s judgment in their application. There are also areas in which management’s judgment in selecting one alternative accounting principle over another would not produce a materially different result. See our audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto under Item 8 in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, which contain accounting policies and other disclosures required by GAAP.

Recently issued accounting standards.

In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2014-09,

Revenue from Contracts with Customers

.

The guidance provides a five-step analysis of transactions to determine when and how revenue is recognized. The core principle of the guidance is that a company should recognize revenue when the customer obtains control of promised goods or services in an amount that reflects the consideration which the company expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. ASU 2014-09 is effective for our annual and interim reporting periods beginning in fiscal 2017. We are currently evaluating the effect adoption of this new guidance will have on our consolidated financial statements.


Forward-Looking Statements

Our Annual Report on Form 10-K for fiscal


, and information we provide in our Annual Report to Stockholders, press releases, and other investor communications including those on our corporate website, may contain a number of forward-looking statements regarding, without limitation, planned store growth, new markets, expected sales, projected earnings levels, capital expenditures, and other matters. These forward-looking statements reflect our then current beliefs, projections, and estimates with respect to future events and our projected financial performance, operations, and competitive position. The words “plan,” “expect,” “target,” “anticipate,” “estimate,” “believe,” “forecast,” “projected,” “guidance,” “looking ahead” and similar expressions identify forward-looking statements.

Future economic and industry trends that could potentially impact revenue, profitability, and growth remain difficult to predict. As a result, our forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties which could cause our actual results to differ materially from those forward-looking statements and our previous expectations and projections. Refer to Item 1A in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a more complete discussion of risk factors for Ross and dd's DISCOUNTS. The factors underlying our forecasts are dynamic and subject to change. As a result, any forecasts or forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are given and do not necessarily reflect our outlook at any other point in time. We disclaim any obligation to update or revise these forward-looking statements.

ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

We are exposed to market risks, which primarily include changes in interest rates. We do not engage in financial transactions for trading or speculative purposes.

We occasionally use forward contracts to hedge against fluctuations in foreign currency prices. We had no outstanding forward contracts as of

January 31, 2015

.

Interest that is payable on our revolving credit facility is based on variable interest rates and is, therefore, affected by changes in market interest rates. As of

January 31, 2015

, we had no borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility.

We have two outstanding series of unsecured notes held by institutional investors: Series A Senior Notes due December 2018 for $85 million accrues interest at 6.38% and Series B Senior Notes due December 2021 for $65 million accrues interest at 6.53%. The amount outstanding under these notes as of

January 31, 2015

was $150 million. We also have unsecured 3.375% Senior Notes due September 2024 with an aggregate principal amount of $250 million. Interest that is payable on our senior notes is based on fixed interest rates and is therefore, unaffected by changes in market interest rates.

Interest is receivable on our short- and long-term investments. Changes in interest rates may impact interest income recognized in the future, or the fair value of our investment portfolio.

A hypothetical 100 basis point increase or decrease in prevailing market interest rates would not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations, cash flows, or the fair values of our short- and long-term investments as of and for the year ended

January 31, 2015

. We do not consider the potential losses in future earnings and cash flows from reasonably possible, near-term changes in interest rates to be material.

Ross Stores, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the “Company”) is an off-price retailer of first-quality, in-season, name brand and designer apparel, accessories, footwear, and home fashions for the entire family. At the end of fiscal


, the Company operated

1,210

Ross Dress for Less

®

(“Ross”) locations in

33 states, the District of Columbia and Guam

, and


dd’s DISCOUNTS

®

stores in

15 states

. The Ross and dd's DISCOUNTS stores are supported by five distribution centers. The Company’s headquarters, one buying office, two operating distribution centers, two warehouses, and

25%

of its stores are located in California.

Segment reporting.

The Company has one reportable segment. The Company’s operations include only activities related to off-price retailing in stores throughout the United States.

Basis of presentation and fiscal year.

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries, all of which are wholly-owned. Intercompany transactions and accounts have been eliminated. The Company follows the National Retail Federation fiscal calendar and utilizes a 52-53 week fiscal year whereby the fiscal year ends on the Saturday nearest to January 31. The fiscal years ended

January 31, 2015

,

February 1, 2014

and

February 2, 2013

are referred to as fiscal


, fiscal


, and fiscal


, respectively. Fiscal


and


were each 52-week years. Fiscal


was a 53-week year.

Use of accounting estimates.

The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in the United States of America (“GAAP”) requires the Company to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The Company’s significant accounting estimates include valuation reserves for inventory shortage, packaway inventory costs, useful lives of fixed assets, insurance reserves, and reserves for uncertain tax positions.

Purchase obligations.

As of

January 31, 2015

, the Company had purchase obligations of approximately

$1,953 million

. These purchase obligations primarily consist of merchandise inventory purchase orders, commitments related to construction projects, store fixtures and supplies, and information technology service, transportation, and maintenance contracts.

Cash and cash equivalents.

Cash equivalents consist of highly liquid, fixed income instruments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less.

Restricted cash, cash equivalents, and investments.

The Company has restricted cash, cash equivalents, and investments that serve as collateral for certain insurance obligations of the Company. These restricted funds are invested in bank deposits, money market mutual funds, U.S. Government and agency securities, and corporate securities and cannot be withdrawn from the Company’s account without the prior written consent of the secured parties. The following table summarizes total restricted cash, cash equivalents, and investments which were included in Prepaid expenses and other and Other long-term assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of

January 31, 2015

and

February 1, 2014

:

The classification between current and long-term is based on the timing of expected payments of the insurance obligations.

Estimated fair value of financial instruments.

The carrying value of cash and cash equivalents, short- and long-term investments, restricted cash and cash equivalents, restricted investments, accounts receivable, other long-term assets, accounts payable, and other long-term liabilities approximates their estimated fair value. See Note B and Note D for additional fair value information.


Cash and cash equivalents were

$696.6 million

and

$423.2 million

, at

January 31, 2015

and

February 1, 2014

, respectively, and include bank deposits and money market funds for which the fair value was determined using quoted prices for identical assets in active markets, which are considered to be Level 1 inputs under the fair value measurements and disclosures guidance.

Investments.

The Company’s investments are comprised of various debt securities. At

January 31, 2015

and

February 1, 2014

, these investments were classified as available-for-sale and are stated at fair value. Investments are classified as either short- or long-term based on their original maturities and the Company’s intent. Investments with an original maturity of less than one year are classified as short-term. See Note B for additional information.

Merchandise inventory.

Merchandise inventory is stated at the lower of cost (determined using a weighted average basis) or net realizable value. The Company purchases manufacturer overruns and canceled orders both during and at the end of a season which are referred to as "packaway" inventory. Packaway inventory is purchased with the intent that it will be stored in the Company's warehouses until a later date. The timing of the release of packaway inventory to the stores is principally driven by the product mix and seasonality of the merchandise, and its relation to the Company’s store merchandise assortment plans. As such, the aging of packaway varies by merchandise category and seasonality of purchase, but typically packaway remains in storage less than

six months

. Merchandise inventory includes acquisition, processing, and storage costs related to packaway inventory. The cost of the Company’s merchandise inventory is reduced by valuation reserves for shortage based on historical shortage experience from the Company’s physical merchandise inventory counts and cycle counts.

Cost of goods sold.

In addition to

product costs, the Company includes in cost of goods sold its buying, distribution and freight expenses as well as occupancy costs, and depreciation and amortization related to the Company’s retail stores, buying, and distribution facilities. Buying expenses include costs to procure merchandise inventories. Distribution expenses include the cost of operating the Company’s distribution centers and warehouse facilities.

Prepaid expenses and other.

Prepaid expenses and other as of

January 31, 2015

and

February 1, 2014

consisted of the following:

Property and equipment.

Property and equipment are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the asset, typically ranging from three to 12 years for equipment and 20 to 40 years for land improvements and buildings. Depreciation and amortization expense on property and equipment was

$233.0 million

,

$206.1 million

, and

$185.5 million

for fiscal


,


, and


, respectively. The cost of leasehold improvements is amortized over the useful life of the asset or the applicable lease term, whichever is less. The Company capitalizes interest during the construction period. Interest capitalized was

$10.8 million

,

$10.8 million

, and

$3.9 million

in fiscal


, fiscal


, and fiscal


, respectively. As of

January 31, 2015

,

February 1, 2014

, and

February 2, 2013

the Company had

$58.6 million

,

$61.3 million

, and

$23.7 million

, respectively, of property and equipment purchased but not yet paid. These purchases are included in Property and Equipment and in Accounts payable and Accrued expenses and other in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.

In September 2014, the Company completed the purchase of its previously leased New York buying office for

$222 million

.


Other long-term assets.

Other long-term assets as of

January 31, 2015

and

February 1, 2014

consisted of the following:

Property and other long-term assets that are subject to amortization are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Intangible assets that are not subject to amortization, including goodwill, are tested for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset may be impaired. Based on the Company’s evaluation during fiscal


,


, and


, no impairment charges were recorded.

Store closures.

The Company continually reviews the operating performance of individual stores. For stores that are closed, the Company records a liability for future minimum lease payments net of estimated sublease recoveries and related ancillary costs at the time the liability is incurred. In


, the Company closed

nine

stores. In


, the Company closed


stores. The lease loss liability was

$2.7 million

and

$6.3 million

, as of

January 31, 2015

and

February 1, 2014

, respectively. Operating costs, including depreciation, of stores to be closed are expensed during the period they remain in use.

Accounts payable.

Accounts payable represents amounts owed to third parties at the end of the period. Accounts payable includes book cash overdrafts (checks issued under zero balance accounts not yet presented for payment) in excess of cash balances in such accounts of approximately

$123.8 million

and

$75.7 million

at

January 31, 2015

and

February 1, 2014

, respectively. The Company includes the change in book cash overdrafts in operating cash flows.

Insurance obligations.

The Company uses a combination of insurance and self-insurance for a number of risk management activities, including workers’ compensation, general liability, and employee-related health care benefits. The self-insurance and deductible liability is determined actuarially, based on claims filed and an estimate of claims incurred but not yet reported. Self-insurance and deductible reserves as of

January 31, 2015

and

February 1, 2014

consisted of the following:

Workers’ compensation and self-insured medical plan liabilities are included in Accrued payroll and benefits, and accruals for general liability are included in Accrued expenses and other in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.


Other long-term liabilities.

Other long-term liabilities as of

January 31, 2015

and

February 1, 2014

consisted of the following:

Lease accounting.

When a lease contains “rent holidays” or requires fixed escalations of the minimum lease payments, the Company records rental expense on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease and the difference between the average rental amount charged to expense and the amount payable under the lease is recorded as deferred rent. The Company begins recording rent expense on the lease possession date. Tenant improvement allowances are included in Other long-term liabilities and are amortized over the lease term. Changes in tenant improvement allowances are included as a component of operating activities in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.

Revenue recognition.

The Company recognizes revenue at the point of sale and maintains an allowance for estimated future returns. Sales of stored value cards are deferred until they are redeemed for the purchase of Company merchandise. The Company’s stored value cards do not have expiration dates. Based upon historical redemption rates, a small percentage of stored value cards will never be redeemed, which represents breakage. The Company recognizes income from stored value card breakage as a reduction of operating expenses when redemption by a customer is considered to be remote. Income recognized from breakage was not significant in fiscal


,


, and


.

Sales tax collected is not recognized as revenue and is included in Accrued expenses and other.

Sales mix.

The Company’s sales mix is shown below for fiscal


,


, and


:

Allowance for sales returns.

An allowance for the gross margin loss on estimated sales returns is included in Accrued expenses and other in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The allowance for sales returns consists of the following:

Store pre-opening.

Store pre-opening costs are expensed in the period incurred.


Advertising.

Advertising costs are expensed in the period incurred and are included in Selling, general and administrative expenses. Advertising costs for fiscal


,


, and


were

$72.1 million

,

$70.2 million

, and

$67.7 million

, respectively.

Stock-based compensation.

The Company recognizes compensation expense based upon the grant date fair value of all stock-based awards, typically over the vesting period. See Note C for more information on the Company’s stock-based compensation plans.

Taxes on earnings.

The Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 740, “Accounting for Income Taxes,” which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the Company's consolidated financial statements or tax returns. In estimating future tax consequences, the Company generally considers all expected future events other than changes in the tax law or tax rates. ASC 740 clarifies the criteria that an individual tax position must satisfy for some or all of the benefits of that position to be recognized in a company’s consolidated financial statements. ASC 740 prescribes a recognition threshold of more-likely-than-not, and a measurement standard for all tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return, in order for those tax positions to be recognized in the consolidated financial statements. See Note F.

Treasury stock.

The Company records treasury stock at cost. Treasury stock includes shares purchased from employees for tax withholding purposes related to vesting of restricted stock grants.

Earnings per share

(“EPS”).

The Company computes and reports both basic EPS and diluted EPS. Basic EPS is computed by dividing net earnings by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted EPS is computed by dividing net earnings by the sum of the weighted average number of common shares and dilutive common stock equivalents outstanding during the period. Diluted EPS reflects the total potential dilution that could occur from outstanding equity plan awards, including unexercised stock options and unvested shares of both performance and non-performance based awards of restricted stock and restricted stock units.

In fiscal


,


, and


there were

2,500

,

2,900

, and

53,900

weighted average shares, respectively, that were excluded from the calculation of diluted EPS because their effect would have been anti-dilutive for those years.

The following is a reconciliation of the number of shares (denominator) used in the basic and diluted EPS computations:

Comprehensive income.

Comprehensive income includes net earnings and components of other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax, consisting of unrealized investment gains or losses.

Recently issued accounting standards.

In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2014-09,

Revenue from Contracts with Customers

.

The guidance provides a five-step analysis of transactions to determine when and how revenue is recognized. The core principle of the guidance is that a company should recognize revenue when the customer obtains control of promised goods or services in an amount that reflects the consideration which the company expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. ASU 2014-09 is effective for the Company’s annual and interim reporting periods beginning in fiscal 2017. The Company is currently evaluating the effect that adoption of this new guidance will have on its consolidated financial statements.


Note B: Investments and Restricted Investments

The amortized cost and fair value of the Company’s available-for-sale securities as of

January 31, 2015

were:

The amortized cost and fair value of the Company's available-for-sale securities as of

February 1, 2014

were:

The change in fair value of investment securities for fiscal years


,


, and


was a decrease of

$0.1 million

,

$0.3 million

, and

$0.1 million

, respectively.

Accounting standards pertaining to fair value measurements establish a three-tier fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value. These tiers include: Level 1, defined as observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets; Level 2, defined as inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are either directly or indirectly observable; and Level 3, defined as unobservable inputs in which little or no market data exists, therefore requiring an entity to develop its own assumptions. This fair value hierarchy also requires the Company to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. Corporate, U.S. government and agency, and mortgage-backed securities are classified within Level 1 or Level 2 because these securities are valued using quoted market prices or alternative pricing sources and models utilizing market observable inputs.


Investments and restricted investments measured at fair value at

January 31, 2015

are summarized below:

Investments and restricted investments measured at fair value at

February 1, 2014

The underlying assets in the Company’s non-qualified deferred compensation program as of

January 31, 2015

and

February 1, 2014

(included in Other long-term assets and in Other long-term liabilities) primarily consist of participant-directed money market, stable value, stock, and bond funds. The fair value measurement for funds with quoted market prices in active markets (Level 1) and for funds without quoted market prices in active markets (Level 2) are as follows:

Fair market value for Level 2 funds is considered to be the sum of participant funds invested under a group annuity contract plus accrued interest.

Note C: Stock-Based Compensation

At

January 31, 2015

, the Company also had outstanding two series of unsecured senior notes in the aggregate principal amount of

$150 million

, held by various institutional investors. The Series A notes totaling

$85 million

are due in

December 2018

and bear interest at a rate of

6.38%

. The Series B notes totaling

$65 million

are due in

December 2021

as of

January 31, 2015

and the aggregate fair value of the Series A and Series B notes was

$182 million

as of

February 1, 2014

. The fair value is estimated by obtaining comparable market quotes which are considered to be Level 1 inputs under the fair value measurements and disclosures guidance.

The following table shows scheduled annual principal payments on Long-term debt:

The table below shows the components of interest expense and income for fiscal


,


, and


:

Revolving credit facility.

The Company's

$600 million

unsecured revolving credit facility expires in

June 2017

and contains a

$300 million

sublimit for issuance of standby letters of credit. Interest on this facility is based on LIBOR plus an applicable margin (currently


basis points) and is payable quarterly and upon maturity. As of

January 31, 2015

the Company had

no

borrowings or standby letters of credit outstanding under this facility and the

$600 million

credit facility remains in place and available.

The revolving credit facility is subject to certain financial covenants, including interest coverage and other financial ratios. In addition, the interest rates under the revolving credit facility may vary depending on actual interest coverage ratios achieved. As of

January 31, 2015

, the Company was in compliance with these covenants.

Standby letters of credit and collateral trust.

The Company uses standby letters of credit outside of its revolving credit facility in addition to a funded trust to collateralize its insurance obligations. As of

January 31, 2015

and

February 1, 2014

, the Company had

$19.5 million

and

$24.3 million

, respectively, in standby letters of credit and

$56.3 million

and

$47.2 million

, respectively, in a collateral trust. The standby letters of credit are collateralized by restricted cash and the collateral trust consists of restricted cash, cash equivalents, and investments.

Trade letters of credit.

The Company had

$32.8 million

and

$31.6 million

in trade letters of credit outstanding at

January 31, 2015

and

February 1, 2014

, respectively.


Note E: Leases

The Company currently leases all but

three

of its store locations with original, non-cancelable terms that in general range from

three

to

ten

years. Store leases typically contain provisions for

three

to

four

renewal options of

five

years each. Most store leases also provide for minimum annual rentals and for payment of certain expenses. In addition, some store leases also have provisions for additional rent based on a percentage of sales.

The Company leases

three

warehouses.

Two

of the warehouses are in Carlisle, Pennsylvania with leases expiring in


and


. The third warehouse is in Fort Mill, South Carolina, with a lease expiring in


. The leases for the two Carlisle, Pennsylvania warehouses contain renewal provisions.

The Company leases approximately

68,000

square feet of office space for its Los Angeles buying office. The lease term for this facility expires in


and contains renewal provisions. In addition, the Company has a ground lease related to its New York buying office.

The aggregate future minimum annual lease payments under leases in effect at

January 31, 2015

are as follows:

Total rent expense was

$457.0 million

,

$434.9 million

, and

$406.6 million

in fiscal


,


, and


, respectively.

Note F: Taxes on Earnings

The provision for income taxes consisted of the following:

In fiscal


,


, and


, the Company realized tax benefits of

$29.8 million

,

$27.7 million

and

$30.0 million

, respectively, related to employee equity programs that were recorded in additional paid-in capital.


The provision for taxes for financial reporting purposes is different from the tax provision computed by applying the statutory federal income tax rate. The differences are reconciled below:

The components of deferred income taxes at

January 31, 2015

and

February 1, 2014

are as follows:

At the end of fiscal


and


, the Company's state tax credit carryforwards for income tax purposes were approximately

$12.1 million

and

$11.0 million

, respectively. The state tax credit carryforwards will begin to expire in fiscal


.

The changes in amounts of unrecognized tax benefits (gross of federal tax benefits and excluding interest and penalties) at fiscal


,


, and


are as follows:


At the end of fiscal


,


, and


, the reserves for unrecognized tax benefits were

$101.7 million

,

$104.9 million

, and

$82.5 million

inclusive of

$23.6 million

,

$24.6 million

, and

$16.8 million

of related interest and penalties, respectively. The Company accounts for interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a part of its provision for taxes on earnings. If recognized,

$51.0 million

would impact the Company’s effective tax rate. The difference between the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits and the amounts that would impact the effective tax rate relates to amounts attributable to deferred income tax assets and liabilities. These amounts are net of federal and state income taxes.

During the next twelve months, it is reasonably possible that the statute of limitations may lapse pertaining to positions taken by the Company in prior year tax returns. If this occurs, the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits may decrease, reducing the provision for taxes on earnings by up to

$6.3 million

.

The Company is generally open to audit by the Internal Revenue Service under the statute of limitations for fiscal years


through


. The Company’s state income tax returns are generally open to audit under the various statutes of limitations for fiscal years


through


. Certain state tax returns are currently under audit by state tax authorities. The Company does not expect the results of these audits to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements.

Note G: Employee Benefit Plans

The Company has a defined contribution plan that is available to certain employees. Under the plan, employee and Company contributions and accumulated plan earnings qualify for favorable tax treatment under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code. This plan permits employees to make contributions up to the maximum limits allowable under the Internal Revenue Code. The Company matches up to

4%

of the employee’s salary up to the plan limits. Company matching contributions to the 401(k) plan were

$11.4 million

,

$10.4 million

, and

$9.4 million

in fiscal


,


, and


, respectively.

The Company also has an Incentive Compensation Plan which provides cash awards to key management and employees based on Company and individual performance.

at

January 31, 2015

and

February 1, 2014

, respectively, of long-term plan investments, at market value, set aside or designated for the Non-qualified Deferred Compensation Plan (See Note B).

$94.1 million

and

$88.3 million

at

January 31, 2015

and

February 1, 2014

, respectively, included in Other long-term liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Ross Stores, Inc.:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Ross Stores, Inc. and subsidiaries (the "Company") as of January 31, 2015 and February 1, 2014, and the related consolidated statements of earnings, comprehensive income, stockholders' equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended January 31, 2015. We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of January 31, 2015, based on criteria established in

Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013)

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. The Company's management is responsible for these financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying “Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting.” Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and an opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.

A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the company's principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the company's board of directors, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Ross Stores, Inc. and subsidiaries as of January 31, 2015 and February 1, 2014, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended January 31, 2015, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also, in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of January 31, 2015, based on the criteria established in

Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013)

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission

ITEM 9. CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE

None

ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

Disclosure Controls and Procedures

Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our “disclosure controls and procedures,” (as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(e)), as of the end of the period covered by this report. Our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives. Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at that reasonable assurance level as of the end of the period covered by this report.

It should be noted that any system of controls, however well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, and not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the system will be met. In addition, the design of any control system is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events.

Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f). Our internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of consolidated financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.

Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework established by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) as set forth in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013)

. Based on our evaluation under the framework in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013)

, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of

January 31, 2015

.

Our internal control over financial reporting as of

January 31, 2015

has also been audited by Deloitte & Touche LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, and their opinion as to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting is stated in their report, dated

March 31, 2015

, which is included in Item 8 in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. It should be noted that any system of controls, however well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, and not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the system will be met. In addition, the design of any control system is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Quarterly Evaluation of Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, also conducted an evaluation of our internal control over financial reporting to determine whether any change occurred during the fourth fiscal quarter of


that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. Based on that evaluation, our management concluded that there was no such change during the fourth fiscal quarter.
