                                 PART I


ITEM 1.    BUSINESS

     Ross Stores, Inc. ("Ross" or "company") operates a chain of off-
price retail apparel stores which target value conscious men and women
between the ages of 25 and 54 in white collar, middle-to-upper middle
income households which the company believes to be the largest customer
segment in the retailing industry.  The decisions of the company, from
merchandising, purchasing and pricing, to the location of its stores,
are aimed at this customer base.  The company offers its merchandise at
low everyday prices, generally 20% to 60% below regular prices of most
department and specialty stores.  The company believes it derives a
competitive advantage by offering a wide assortment of quality brand
name merchandise within each of its merchandise categories in an
attractive easy-to-shop environment.

     Ross' mission is to offer competitive values to its target
customers by focusing on the following key strategic objectives:

- -    Achieve an appropriate level of brands and labels at strong
     discounts throughout the store;

- -    Meet customer needs on a more regional basis;

- -    Deliver an in-store shopping experience that reflects the
     expectations of the off-price customer; and

- -    Manage real estate growth to maintain dominance or achieve parity
     with the competition in key markets.

     The original Ross Stores, Inc. was incorporated in California in
1957.  In August 1982, the company was purchased by some of its current
directors and stockholders.  The six stores acquired were completely
refurbished in the company's off-price format and stocked with new
merchandise.  In June 1989 the company reincorporated in the state of
Delaware.

Merchandising, Purchasing and Pricing

     Ross seeks to provide its target customers with a wide assortment
of first quality, in-season, name brand apparel, accessories and
footwear for the entire family at everyday savings of 20% to 60% from
regular department and specialty store prices, as well as similar
savings on fragrances, gift items for the home, bed and bath merchandise
and accessories.  Although not a fashion leader, the company sells
recognizable branded merchandise that is current and fashionable in each
category.  The company reviews its merchandise mix each week, enabling
it to respond to merchandise trends and purchasing opportunities in the
market. The company's merchandising strategy is reflected in its
advertising, which emphasizes its strong value message -- Ross'
customers get great savings on name brand merchandise every day of the
year.

     Merchandising.  The Ross merchandising strategy incorporates a
combination of in-season and past-season apparel, shoes and accessories
for the entire family, as well as fragrances, giftware and linens for
the home.  The company's emphasis on brand names reflects management's
conviction that brand name merchandise sold at compelling discounts will
continue to be an important determinant of its success.  Ross leaves the
brand name label on the merchandise it sells.

     The company has established a merchandise assortment which it
believes is attractive to its target customer group.  Although Ross
offers fewer classifications of merchandise than most department stores,
the company generally offers a large selection of brand names within
each classification with a wide assortment of vendors, prices, colors,
styles and fabrics within each size.  Over the past year, the company
has continued to diversify its merchandise offerings by adding new
product categories such as small sporting goods and exercise equipment,
small electronics, tabletop lamps, small furnishings, educational toys
and games.  Other recent additions include luggage, gourmet food and
cookware.  This diversification will continue in fiscal 1998, with a
test of fine jewelry in approximately 50 stores during the first half of
the year and a potential roll-out to other stores in 1999. For fiscal
1997, the overall merchandise sales mix was approximately 95% first
quality merchandise and 5% irregulars.  The respective departments
accounted for total sales in fiscal 1997 approximately as follows:
Ladies 35%, Men's 22%, Accessories, Hosiery and Lingerie 10%, Shoes 10%,
Children's 9%, and Fragrances, Home Accents and Bed and Bath 14%.



     Purchasing.  During the past three years, no single vendor has
accounted for more than 3% of the company's purchases.  The company
continues to add new vendors and believes it has adequate sources of
first quality merchandise to meet its requirements.  The company
purchases the vast majority of its merchandise directly from
manufacturers and has not experienced any difficulty in obtaining
sufficient inventory.

     The company believes that its ability to effectively execute
certain off-price buying strategies is a key factor in its business.
Ross buyers use a number of methods that enable the company to offer
customers name brand merchandise at strong everyday discounts relative
to department and specialty stores.  By purchasing later in the
merchandise buying cycle than department and specialty stores, Ross is
able to take advantage of imbalances of manufacturer-projected supply of
merchandise.

     Ross, unlike most department and specialty stores, does not require
that manufacturers provide promotional and markdown allowances, return
privileges and delayed deliveries.  In addition, deliveries are made to
one of the company's two distribution centers.  These flexible
requirements further enable the company's buyers to obtain significant
discounts on in-season purchases.

     The company has increased its emphasis in recent years on
opportunistic purchases created by manufacturer overruns and canceled
orders both during and at the end of a season.  These buys are referred
to as "closeout" or "packaway" purchases.  Closeouts can be shipped to
stores in season.  Closeouts allow the company to get in season goods in
its stores at lower prices.  Packaway merchandise is purchased with the
intent that it will be stored in the company's warehouses until the
beginning of the next selling season.  Packaway purchases are an
effective method of increasing the percentage of prestige and national
brands at competitive savings within the merchandise assortments.
Packaway merchandise is mainly fashion basics and, therefore, not
usually affected by seasonal shifts in fashion trends.

     Throughout the 1990s, Ross gradually increased the amount of
packaway inventories.  In  1996 and 1997, the company further increased
these important resources in response to compelling opportunities
available in the marketplace.  It is management's belief that the
stronger discounts the company is able to offer on packaway merchandise
are a key driver of Ross' business.  As a result, while in-store
inventories at the end of fiscal 1997 were down 1% on a comparable store
basis to the prior year, total consolidated inventories were up 12% due
to the investment at year-end in additional packaway goods and inventory
for the new stores.

     The company is developing a new management information system in an
effort to provide more detailed information on how SKUs perform by
region or market.  While in the market, the buyers will utilize laptop
computers to access real-time information on their business.  The goal
is to fine tune the merchandise mix and raise sales productivity in
markets that are performing below the company average.  The new system
is scheduled to begin roll-out in late 1998 and early 1999.

     Ross' buying offices are located in New York City and Los Angeles,
the nation's two largest apparel markets.  These strategic locations
allow buyers to be in the market on a daily basis, sourcing
opportunities and negotiating purchases with vendors and manufacturers.
These locations also enable the company's buyers to strengthen vendor
relationships -- a key determinant in the success of its off-price
buying strategies.

     The company's buyers have an average of 10 years of experience,
including experience with other retailers such as Bloomingdale's,
Burlington Coat Factory, Dayton Hudson, Lord & Taylor, Macy's,
Marshalls, Montgomery Wards, TJ Maxx and Value City.  In keeping with
its strategy, over the past several years, the company has more than
tripled the size of its merchandising staff.  Management believes that
this increase enables its merchants to spend even more time in the
market which, in turn, should strengthen the company's ability to
procure the most desirable brands at competitive discounts.

     The combination of the above off-price buying strategies enables
the company to purchase merchandise at net prices which are lower than
prices paid by department and specialty stores.

     Pricing.  The company's policy is to sell brand name merchandise
which can generally be priced at 20% to 60% less than most department
and specialty store regular prices.  The Ross pricing policy is to affix
a ticket displaying the company's selling price as well as the estimated
comparable selling price of that item at department and specialty
stores.

     The Ross pricing strategy differs from that of a department or
specialty store.  Ross purchases its merchandise at lower prices and
marks it up less than a department or specialty store.  This strategy
enables Ross to offer customers



consistently low prices.  Ticketed prices are not increased and are
reviewed weekly for possible markdowns based on the rate of sales and
the end of fashion seasons to promote faster turnover of inventory and
accelerate the flow of fresh merchandise.

The Ross Store

     As of January 31, 1998, the company operated 325 stores.  They are
conveniently located in predominantly community and neighborhood strip
shopping centers in heavily populated urban and suburban areas.  Where
the size of the market permits, the company clusters stores to maximize
economies of scale in advertising, distribution and management.  During
1997, the average Ross store employed 43 full- and part-time people.

     The company believes a key element of its success is the
attractive, easy-to-shop environment in its stores which allows
customers to shop at their own pace.  The Ross store is designed for
customer convenience in its merchandise presentation, dressing rooms,
checkout and merchandise return areas.  The Ross store's sales area is
based on a prototype single floor design with a racetrack aisle layout.
A customer can locate desired departments by signs displayed just below
the ceiling of each department.  Ross encourages its customers to select
among sizes and prices through prominent category and sizing markers,
promoting a self-service atmosphere.  At most stores, shopping carts are
available at the entrance for customer convenience.  Checkout stations
are located at store entrances for customer ease and efficient employee
assignment.

     It is the company's policy to minimize transaction time for the
customer at the checkout counter by using electronic systems for
scanning each ticket at the point of sale and authorizing credit for
personal checks and credit cards in a matter of seconds.  Approximately
36% of payments are made with credit cards.  Ross provides cash or
credit card refunds on all merchandise returned with a receipt within 30
days.  Merchandise returns having a receipt older than 30 days are
exchanged or credited with a Ross Credit Voucher at the price on the
receipt.

Operating Costs

     Consistent with the other aspects of its business strategy, Ross
strives to keep operating costs as low as possible.  Among the factors
which have enabled the company to operate at low costs are:

- -    Reduced in-store labor costs resulting from (i) a store design that
     creates a self-selection retail format and (ii) the utilization of labor
     saving technologies.

- -    Economies of scale with respect to both general and administrative
     costs as a result of centralized merchandising, marketing and purchasing
     decisions.

- -    Model store layout criteria which facilitate conversion of existing
     buildings to the Ross format.

- -    A fully-integrated, on-line management information system which
     enables the company to respond quickly when making purchasing,
     merchandising and pricing decisions.

Distribution

     The company has two distribution centers -- one located in Newark,
California (approximately 494,000 square feet) and the second located in
Carlisle, Pennsylvania (approximately 424,000 square feet).  Having a
distribution center on each coast enhances cost efficiencies per unit
and decreases turn-around time in getting the merchandise from the
vendors to the stores.  Shipments are made by contract carriers to the
stores about five times a week depending on location.

Control Systems

     The company's management information system fully integrates data
from significant phases of its operations and is a key element in the
company's planning, purchasing, distribution and pricing decisions.  The
system enables Ross to respond to changes in the retail market and to
increase speed and accuracy in its merchandise distribution.



     Data from the current and last fiscal year can be monitored on
levels ranging from merchandise classification units to overall totals
for the company.  Merchandise is tracked by the system from the creation
of its purchase order, through its receipt at the distribution center,
through the distribution planning process, and ultimately to the point
of sale.

Advertising

     The company utilizes extensive advertising which emphasizes
quality, brand name merchandise at low everyday prices.  The company
predominantly uses television advertising.  This reflects the company's
belief that overall television is the best medium for presenting Ross'
everyday low price message.

Trademarks

     The trademark for Ross Dress For Less (R) has been registered with the
United States Patent and Trademark Office.

Employees

     On January 31, 1998, the company had approximately 17,000 employees
which includes an estimated 10,400 part-time employees.  Additionally,
the company hires temporary employees -- especially during the peak
seasons.  The company's employees are non-union.  Management of the
company considers the relationship between the company and its employees
to be excellent.

Competition

     The company believes that the principal competitive factors in the
off-price retail apparel industry are offering large discounts on name
brand merchandise appealing to its target customer and consistently
providing a store environment that is convenient and easy to shop.  To
execute this concept, the company has strengthened its buying organization, 
developed a merchandise allocation system to distribute product based on 
regional factors as well as other systems and procedures to maximize cost 
efficiencies and leverage expenses in an effort to mitigate competitive 
pressures on gross margin.  The company believes that it is well positioned 
to compete on the basis of each of these factors.

     Nevertheless, the national apparel retail market is highly
fragmented.  Ross faces intense competition for business from department
stores, specialty stores, discount stores, other off-price retailers and
manufacturer-owned outlet stores, many of which are units of large
national or regional chains that have substantially greater resources
than Ross.  The retail apparel business may become even more competitive
in the future.


ITEM 2.  PROPERTIES

Stores

     From August 1982 to January 31, 1998, the company expanded from six
stores in California to 325 stores in 17 states: Arizona, California,
Colorado, Florida, Hawaii, Idaho, Maryland, Nevada, New Jersey, New
Mexico, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Texas, Utah, Virginia and
Washington.  All stores are leased, with the exception of one.

     During fiscal 1997, the company opened 17 new Ross 'Dress For Less'
stores, closed 1 existing location and relocated 4 locations.  The
typical new Ross store is approximately 30,187 square feet, yielding
approximately 25,334 square feet of selling space.  As of January 31,
1998, the company's 325 stores generally ranged in size from about
24,000 to 35,000 gross square feet and had an average of 22,000 square
feet of selling space.

     During the fiscal year ended January 31, 1998, no one store
accounted for more than approximately 1% of the company's sales.  The
company carries earthquake insurance on its corporate headquarters, both
distribution centers and on its stores in California.

     The company's real estate strategy is to open additional stores
mainly in existing market areas, to increase its market penetration and
reduce overhead and advertising expenses as a percentage of sales in
each market.  Important considerations in evaluating a new market are
the availability of potential sites, demographic characteristics,
competition and



population density of the market.  In fiscal 1998 and 1999, the company
plans to focus its new store growth primarily in existing markets and
adjacent regions in existing states.  In addition, management continues
to seek opportunistic real estate acquisitions.

     Where possible, the company has obtained sites in existing
buildings requiring minimal alterations.  This has allowed Ross to
establish stores in new locations in a relatively short period of time
at reasonable costs in a given market.  To date, the company has been
able to secure leases in suitable locations for its stores.  At January
31, 1998, the majority of the company's stores had unexpired original
lease terms ranging from three to ten years with two to three renewal
options of five years each.  The average unexpired original lease term
of its leased stores is six years, or 18 years if renewal options are
included.  (See Note C to the Consolidated Financial Statements.)  Most
of the company's store leases contain a provision for percentage rental
payments after a specified sales level has been achieved.

Distribution Centers

     In April 1998, the company purchased its Newark, California
distribution center for $24.6 million.  The Newark facility is also the
company's corporate headquarters.  The company also owns its
distribution center in Carlisle, Pennsylvania.  In August 1996, the
company paid off that facility's outstanding mortgage value of $9.7
million.

     The company's two distribution centers currently have processing
capacity to support store growth through fiscal 1999.  This reflects the
company's recent investment in distribution systems along with the
potential to expand work shifts.  In September 1997, the company entered
into a five year lease for an approximately 214,500 square foot
warehouse in Newark, California.  In February 1998, the company entered
into a three year lease for an approximately 239,000 square foot
warehouse in Carlisle, Pennsylvania.  Both of these buildings will store
the company's packaway inventory and replace third party warehousing
services.


ITEM 3.  LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

     The company is a party to routine litigation incident to its
business.  Management believes that none of these legal proceedings will
have a material adverse effect on the company's consolidated financial
statements taken as a whole or results of operations of the company.
Some of the lawsuits to which the company is a party are covered by
insurance and are being defended by the company's insurance carriers.

ITEM 5.  MARKET FOR REGISTRANT'S COMMON EQUITY AND RELATED STOCKHOLDER
         MATTERS

     General Information.  See the information set forth under the
caption "Quarterly Financial Data (Unaudited)" under Note H to the
Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this document which is
incorporated herein by reference.  The company's stock is traded on the
Nasdaq National Market tier of The Nasdaq Stock MarketSM under the
symbol ROST.  There were 836 stockholders of record as of April 3, 1998.

     Stock Dividend.  On January 30, 1997, the Board of Directors
authorized a two-for-one stock split in the form of a 100% stock
dividend.  The dividend was paid on March 5, 1997 to stockholders of
record on February 11, 1997.

     Cash Dividends.  During fiscal 1996 and 1997, the company paid a
quarterly cash dividend of $0.035 and $0.045, respectively, per common
share.  On January 31, 1998, the Board of Directors increased the
quarterly dividend to $0.055 per common share.





                                                                  
                                                                            


ITEM 7.   MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
          AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

For the fiscal years ended January 31, 1998, February 1, 1997 and
February 3, 1996 (referred to as 1997, 1996 and 1995).  All share and
per share information has been adjusted to reflect the effect of the
company's two-for-one stock split effected in the form of a 100% stock
dividend on March 5, 1997.


                                                                     

     Stores.  Total stores open at the end of 1997, 1996 and 1995 were
325, 309 and 292, respectively.  During 1997, the company opened 17 new
stores and closed one store.  During 1996, the company opened 21 new
stores and closed four stores.  During 1995, the company opened 21 new
stores and closed four stores.

     Sales.  The increases in sales for 1997, 1996 and 1995 were due to
an increase in comparable store sales and a greater number of stores in
operation (and the 53rd week in 1995).  The company anticipates that the
competitive climate for apparel and off-price retailers will continue in
1998.  Management expects to address that challenge by continuing to
strengthen the merchandise organization, diversify the merchandise mix
and purchase goods more opportunistically.  Although the company's
existing strategies and store expansion program contributed to sales and
earnings gains in 1997, 1996 and 1995, there can be no assurance that
these strategies will result in a continuation of revenue and profit
growth.

     Cost of Goods Sold and Occupancy.  The reduction in the cost of
goods sold and occupancy ratio in 1997 resulted primarily from the
higher sales, leverage on occupancy costs and lower markdowns as a
percentage of sales.  The reduction in the cost of goods sold and
occupancy ratio in 1996 resulted primarily from the higher sales, lower
markdowns as a percentage of sales, an increase in the initial mark-up
from purchasing more opportunistically and leverage on occupancy costs.
There can be no assurance that the improvement experienced in 1997 will
continue in future years.

     General, Selling and Administrative Expenses.  During 1997,
general, selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales
declined primarily due to the leverage realized from the significant
increase in comparable store sales combined with continued strong cost
controls.  As a result, even with the investments made in expanding the
merchandise organization over the years, expenses as a percent of sales
each year have decreased from the prior year.

     The largest component of general, selling and administrative
expenses is payroll.  The total number of employees, including both full-
and part-time, at year-end 1997, 1996 and 1995 was approximately 17,000,
14,900 and 11,900, respectively.



     Depreciation and Amortization.  Depreciation and amortization as a
percentage of sales has remained relatively constant over the last three
years, due primarily to the consistent level of fixed assets in each
store.

     Interest.  Due to higher average borrowings during 1997, interest
expense increased from 1996.  The increase in average borrowings in 1997
was due to expenditures of $98.1 million to repurchase three million
shares of common stock, offset partially by the higher earnings levels
and cash flows from issuances of common stock.  Lower average borrowings
in 1996 resulted in a decrease in interest expense from 1995.  The
reduction in borrowings in 1996 was due to higher earnings levels,
higher cash flows from issuances under stock plans and improved
inventory turnover, which more than offset expenditures for the
repurchase of common stock, capital investments and an overall increase
in inventory.

     Taxes on Earnings.  The company's effective rate for 1997, 1996 and
1995 was 40%, which represents the applicable federal and state
statutory rates reduced by the federal benefit received for state taxes.
During 1998, the company expects its effective tax rate to decline to
39%.


Information Systems and the Year 2000

     The year 2000 issue is the result of computer programs being
written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year.
Certain of the company's computer programs may recognize a date using
"00" as the year 1900 rather than the year 2000.  This could result in
system failures or miscalculations causing disruptions of operations,
including, among other things, a temporary inability to process
transactions, or to engage in similar normal business activities.

     As is the case with most other companies using computers in their
operations, the company is in the process of addressing the year 2000
issue.  The company is currently engaged in a comprehensive project to
identify all significant applications that will require modification to
become year 2000 compliant and is utilizing both internal and external
resources to identify, correct, upgrade or replace and test the systems
for year 2000 compliance.  The company is currently evaluating the
financial impact of the systems and programming changes necessary to
address the year 2000 issue and will disclose the expected costs for
these modifications when the evaluation is complete.  Year 2000 related
costs will be expensed as incurred.

     The company expects to implement the changes necessary to address
the year 2000 issue.  The company presently believes that, with
modifications to existing software and conversions to new software, the
year 2000 issue will not pose significant operational problems for the
company's computer systems as so modified and converted.  However, if
unforeseen difficulties arise or such modifications and conversions are
not completed timely, or if the company's vendors' or suppliers' systems
are not modified to become year 2000 compliant, the year 2000 issue may
have a material impact on the operations of the company.


Financial Condition

     Liquidity and Capital Resources.  During 1997, 1996 and 1995,
liquidity and capital requirements were provided by cash flows from
operations, the revolving credit facility and trade credit.  The
company's store sites, central office, West Coast distribution center,
as well as the buying offices are leased and except for certain
leasehold improvements and equipment, do not represent long-term capital
investments.  Commitments related to operating leases are described in
Note C to the Consolidated Financial Statements.  The company's
Carlisle, Pennsylvania, distribution center is owned outright by the
company as the mortgage was paid off on August 30, 1996.  The company
exercised its right to purchase its Newark, California, distribution
center and corporate headquarters for $24.6 million and anticipates
completing this transaction on April 1, 1998.  Short-term trade credit
represents a significant source of financing for investments in
merchandise inventory.  Trade credit arises from customary trade
practices with the company's vendors.  Management regularly reviews the
adequacy of credit available to the company from all sources and has
been able to maintain adequate lines to meet the capital and liquidity
requirements of the company.



     During 1997, the primary uses of cash, other than for operating
expenditures, were for merchandise inventory including a planned
increase in packaway inventory, property and equipment to open 17 new
stores, the relocation or remodeling of six stores, the repurchase in
the open market of $98.1 million of the company's common stock and
quarterly cash dividend payments.  During 1996, the primary uses of
cash, other than for operating expenditures, were for merchandise
inventory, including a planned increase in packaway inventory, property
and equipment to open 21 new stores, the remodeling of seven stores, the
repurchase in the open market of $80.4 million of the company's common
stock and quarterly cash dividend payments.  During 1995, the primary
uses of cash, other than for operating expenditures, were for
merchandise inventory, property and equipment to open 21 new stores, the
remodeling of eight stores, the repurchase in the open market of $12.1
million of the company's common stock and quarterly cash dividend
payments.  In 1997, 1996 and 1995, the company spent approximately $33
million, $37 million and $42 million, respectively, for capital
expenditures, net of leased equipment, that included fixtures and
leasehold improvements to open 17, 21 and 21 stores, respectively,
remodeling or relocation costs for six, seven and eight stores,
respectively, modifications in the buying office, purchase of previously
leased equipment and various expenditures for existing stores and the
central office.

     The company currently anticipates opening 20 to 25 stores annually
in 1998 and 1999.  The company anticipates that this growth will be
financed primarily from cash flows from operating activities and
available credit facilities.

     In January 1998, a 22% increase in the quarterly cash dividend
payment to $.055 per common share was declared by the Board of
Directors, payable on or about April 6, 1998.  The company's Board of
Directors declared quarterly cash dividends of $.045 per common share in
January, May, August and November 1997 and $.035 per common share in
January, May, August and November 1996.  The company uses cash flows
from operating activities and available cash resources to provide for
cash dividends.

     The company repurchased a total of $98.1 million of common stock in
1997.  In January 1998, the company announced that its Board of
Directors authorized a $110 million stock repurchase program.  The
company anticipates funding this new program through cash flows from
operating activities and available credit facilities.

     The company has available under its principal bank credit agreement
a $160 million revolving credit facility and a $30 million credit
facility, the latter solely for the issuance of letters of credit, both
of which expire September 2002, and short-term lines of credit at
January 31, 1998 totaling $45 million.  These facilities are available
until canceled by either party.  At fiscal year-end 1997, 1996 and 1995,
there were no outstanding balances under any revolving credit facility.
For additional information relating to these obligations, refer to Note
B to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

     Working capital was $175 million at the end of 1997, compared to
$135 million at the end of 1996 and $122 million at the end of 1995.  At
year-end 1997, 1996 and 1995, the company's current ratios were 1.5:1,
1.4:1 and 1.6:1, respectively. The percentage of long-term debt to total
capitalization at fiscal year-end 1997, 1996 and 1995 was 0%, 0% and 3%,
respectively.

     The company's primary source of liquidity is the sale of its
merchandise inventory.  Management regularly reviews the age and
condition of the merchandise and is able to maintain current inventory
in its stores through the replenishment processes and liquidation of non-
current merchandise through markdowns and clearances.

     The company realized stronger cash flows in 1997 and 1996 due to
increased earnings, tighter inventory controls with improved in-store
inventory turnover, a strong emphasis on controlling expenses and
increased cash generated by the issuance of common stock related to
stock plans.  These resources enabled the company to pay down all bank
borrowings at each year-end.

     The company estimates that cash flows from operations, bank credit
lines and trade credit are adequate to meet operating cash needs as well
as to provide for the $110 million repurchase of shares, dividend
payments and planned capital additions during the upcoming year.



Forward Looking Statements and Factors Affecting Future Performance

     This report includes a number of forward looking statements, which
reflect the company's current beliefs and estimates with respect to
future events and the company's future financial performance, operations
and competitive strengths. The words "expect," "anticipate," "estimate,"
"believe" and similar expressions identify forward looking statements.

     The company's continued success depends, in part, upon its ability
to increase sales at existing locations, to open new stores and to
operate stores on a profitable basis.  There can be no assurance that
the company's existing strategies and store expansion program will
result in a continuation of revenue and profit growth.  Future economic
and industry trends that could potentially impact revenue and
profitability remain difficult to predict.

     As a result, the forward looking statements that are contained
herein are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause
the company's actual results to differ materially from historical
results or current expectations.  These factors include, without
limitation, ongoing competitive pressures in the apparel industry,
obtaining acceptable store locations, the company's ability to continue
to purchase attractive name brand merchandise at desirable discounts,
unseasonable weather trends, especially in California, changes in the
level of consumer spending on or preferences in apparel or home related
merchandise or currently unknown costs and uncertainties related to the
ability to make the necessary modifications to the company's, or its
major vendors', computer hardware and software systems to enable them to
process information with dates or date ranges spanning the year 2000 and
beyond.  In addition, the company's corporate headquarters, one
distribution center and 45% of its stores are located in California.
Therefore, a downturn in the California economy or a major natural
disaster could significantly impact the company's operating results and
financial condition.

     In addition to the above factors, the apparel industry is highly
seasonal.  The combined sales of the company for the third and fourth
(holiday) fiscal quarters are higher than the combined sales for the
first two fiscal quarters.  The company has realized a significant
portion of its profits in each fiscal year during the fourth quarter.
Intensified price competition, lower than anticipated consumer demand or
other seasonal factors, if they were to occur during the last six
months, and in particular during the fourth quarter, could adversely
affect the company's fiscal year results.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

     For the fiscal years ended January 31, 1998, February 1, 1997
and February 3, 1996 (referred to as 1997, 1996 and 1995).

Note A: Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

     Business.  The company is an off-price retailer of first
quality, branded apparel, shoes and accessories for the entire
family, as well as gift items, linens and other home related
merchandise.  At January 31, 1998, the company operated 325
stores.  The company's headquarters, one distribution center, one
warehouse and 45% of its stores are located in California.

     Principles of Consolidation.  The consolidated financial
statements include the accounts of all subsidiaries. Intercompany
transactions and accounts have been eliminated.  Certain
reclassifications have been made in the 1995 and 1996 financial
statements to conform to the 1997 presentation.  These changes had
no impact on previously reported results of operations or
stockholders' equity.  The 1995 year consisted of 53 weeks while
1997 and 1996 each had 52 weeks.

     Accounting Estimates.  The preparation of financial
statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting
principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions
that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of
the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and
expenses during the reporting period.  Actual results could differ
from those estimates.

     Cash Equivalents.  Cash equivalents are highly liquid, fixed
income instruments purchased with a maturity of three months or
less.

     Merchandise Inventory.  Merchandise inventory is stated at
the lower of cost or market determined under the unit cost method.

     Deferred Store Opening Expenses.  Pre-opening expenses are
deferred until the store's grand opening date, at which time the
deferred costs are expensed.

     Advertising.  Advertising costs are expensed when incurred.
In 1997, 1996 and 1995, advertising expenses were $35 million, $39
million and $37 million, respectively.

     Deferred Rent.  Many of the company's leases signed since
1988 contain fixed escalations of the minimum annual lease
payments during the original term of the lease.  For these leases,
the company recognizes rental expense on a straight-line basis and
records the difference between the average rental amount charged
to expense and the amount payable under the lease as deferred
rent.  At the end of 1997 and 1996, the balance of deferred rent
was $10.6 million and $9.7 million, respectively, and is included
in long-term liabilities.

     Intangible Assets.  Included in other assets are lease rights
and interests, consisting of payments made to acquire store
leases, which are amortized over the remaining applicable life of
the lease.  Also included in other assets is the excess of cost
over the acquired net assets, which is amortized on a straight-
line basis over a period of 40 years.

     Property and Equipment.  Property and equipment are stated at
cost. Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method
over the estimated useful life of the asset, typically ranging
from five to twelve years for equipment and 20 to 40 years for
real property.  The cost of leasehold improvements is amortized
over the useful life of the asset or the applicable lease term,
whichever is less.  Computer hardware and software costs are
included in fixtures and equipment and are amortized over their
estimated useful life of five years.

     Impairment of Long-Lived Assets.  Long-lived assets and
certain identifiable intangibles, including goodwill, held and
used by the company, are reviewed for impairment whenever events
or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying  amount of
an asset may not be recoverable.  Based on the company's review as
of January 31, 1998 and February 1, 1997, no adjustments were
recognized to the carrying value of such assets.

     Estimated Fair Value of Financial Instruments.  The carrying
value of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts
payable and long-term debt approximates their estimated fair
value.

     Stock-Based Compensation.  The company accounts for stock-
based awards to employees using the intrinsic value method
prescribed by "Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25,
Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees."

     Taxes on Earnings.  Income taxes are accounted for under an
asset and liability approach that requires the recognition of
deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax
consequences of events that have been recognized in the company's
financial statements or tax returns.  In estimating future tax
consequences, the company generally considers all expected future
events other than changes in the tax law or rates.

     Stock Dividend.  All share and per share information has been
adjusted to reflect the effect of the company's two-for-one stock
split effected in the form of a 100% stock dividend on March 5,
1997.

     Earnings Per Share.  In 1997, the company adopted the
provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 128
(SFAS 128), "Earnings per Share."  SFAS 128 requires dual
presentation of two earnings per share (EPS) amounts, basic EPS
and diluted EPS, on the face of all income statements instead of
primary and fully diluted EPS.  Basic EPS excludes dilution and is
computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number of
common shares outstanding for the period.  Diluted EPS reflects
the potential dilution that could occur if options to issue common
stock were exercised into common stock.  EPS for all periods
presented have been restated to reflect the adoption of SFAS 128.

The following is a reconciliation of the number of shares
(denominator) used in the basic and diluted EPS computations
(shares in thousands):

                                      Effect of           
                         Basic    Diluted Stock    Diluted
                           EPS          Options        EPS
          Shares        48,928            1,074     50,002
          Amount         $2.40           $(.05)      $2.35
                                                          
          Shares        50,031            1,280     51,311
          Amount         $1.62           $(.04)      $1.58
                                                          
          Shares        49,036              468     49,504
          Amount          $.88           $(.01)       $.87
                                                




Note B: Long-Term Debt

     The company had no outstanding debt at year-end 1997 and 1996.  The
weighted average interest rates on borrowings during 1997, 1996 and 1995
were 5.8%, 8.3% and 7.1%, respectively.  The decrease in 1997 over 1996
reflects the mortgage debt in 1996 on the East Coast distribution center
at an interest rate of 9.5%, contributing to the higher weighted average
interest on borrowings in 1996.

     Mortgage.  On August 8, 1991, the company obtained a $10.8 million
mortgage at 9.5% interest, collateralized by the land and building of
its East Coast distribution center, with interest and principal based on
a 20-year amortization period.  On August 30, 1996, the company paid in
full the outstanding balance on the mortgage loan.  The outstanding
principal and accrued interest paid was $9.7 million.

     Bank Credit Facilities.  The company has available under its
principal credit agreement a $160 million revolving credit facility, and
a $30 million credit facility, the latter solely for the issuance of
letters of credit, both of which expire September 2002.  Interest is
payable upon borrowing maturity but no less than quarterly.  At year-end
1997 and 1996, the company had $16.6 million and $12.2 million,
respectively, in outstanding letters of credit.  Borrowing under the
credit facilities is subject to the company maintaining certain interest
rate coverage and leverage ratios.  As of January 31, 1998, the company
was in compliance with these bank covenants.

     In addition, the company has $45 million in short-term bank lines
of credit, which are available until canceled by either party.  When
utilized, interest is payable monthly under several pricing options.

     Included in accounts payable are checks outstanding in excess of
cash balances of approximately $50.6 million and $35.4 million at year-
end 1997 and 1996, respectively.  The company can utilize its revolving
line of credit to cover payment of these checks as they clear the bank.


Note C: Leases

     During fiscal 1997, the company leased its distribution center and
corporate office located in Newark, California, under a 15-year lease
agreement expiring 2002.  The lease contains six renewal options of five
years each.  The company exercised its right to purchase its Newark,
California, distribution center and corporate headquarters for $24.6
million and anticipates completing this transaction on April 1, 1998.
In September 1997, the company entered into a five-year lease for a
warehouse in Newark, California, which will store the company's packaway
merchandise.  In February 1998, the company entered into a three-year
lease for a warehouse in Carlisle, Pennsylvania.  Both of these
buildings replace third party warehousing services.  In addition, the
company leases its store sites, selected computer and related equipment
and distribution center equipment under operating leases with original,
noncancelable terms that in general range from three to fifteen years,
expiring through 2012.  Store leases typically contain provisions for
three to four renewal options of five years each.  Most store leases
also provide for minimum annual rentals, with provisions for additional
rent based on percentage of sales and for payment of certain expenses.

     In 1997, 1996 and 1995, the company realized tax benefits of $14.1
million, $14.0 million and $1.7 million, respectively, related to stock
options exercised and the vesting of restricted stock that were credited
to additional paid-in capital.

    The provisions for taxes for financial reporting purposes are
different from the tax provision computed by applying the statutory
federal income tax rate.  The differences are reconciled as follows:

                                                  1997    1996     1995

Note E: Employee Benefit Plans

     The company has available to certain employees a profit sharing
retirement plan. Under the plan, employee and company contributions and
accumulated plan earnings qualify for favorable tax treatment under
Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code.  In 1987, the company
adopted an Incentive Compensation Program, which provides cash awards to
key management employees based on the company's and the individual's
performance.  In 1991, the company began offering an Executive
Supplemental Retirement Plan, which allows eligible employees to
purchase individual life insurance policies and/or annuity contracts.
In 1993, the company made available to management a Nonqualified
Deferred Compensation Plan, which allows management to make payroll
contributions on a pre-tax basis in addition to the 401(k) Plan.  This
plan does not qualify under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code.


Note F: Stockholders' Equity

     Preferred Stock.  The company has four million shares of preferred
stock authorized, with a par value of $.01 per share.  No preferred
stock has been issued or outstanding during the past three years.

     Common Stock.  The company's Board of Directors has approved
repurchase programs over the past several years that resulted in the
buyback of 3.0 million shares at an average price of $32.72 in 1997, 4.5
million shares at an average price of $17.93 in 1996 and 1.5 million
shares at an average price of $8.03 in 1995.  In January 1998, the
company's Board of Directors authorized an expansion and continuation of
these repurchase programs for additional shares of the company's common
stock totaling $110 million.

     Dividends.  The company's Board of Directors declared cash
dividends of $.055 per common share in January 1998; $.045 per common
share in January, May, August and November 1997; and $.035 per common
share in January, May, August and November 1996.



     Stock-Based Compensation Plans.  At January 31, 1998, the company
had four stock-based compensation plans which are described below.
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 (SFAS
123),"Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation," establishes a fair value
method of accounting for stock options and other equity instruments.
Had compensation cost for these stock option and stock purchase plans
been determined based on the fair value at the grant dates for awards
under those plans consistent with the methods of SFAS 123, the company's
net income and earnings per share would have been reduced to the pro
forma amounts indicated below:


                                                                         

The impact of outstanding non-vested stock options granted prior to 1995
has been excluded from the pro forma calculation; accordingly, the 1997,
1996 and 1995 pro forma adjustments are not indicative of future period
pro forma adjustments, when the calculation will apply to all applicable
stock options.

     1992 Stock Option Plan.  The company's 1992 Stock Option Plan
allows for the granting of incentive and non-qualified stock options.
Stock options are to be granted at prices not less than the fair market
value of the common shares on the date the option is granted, expire ten
years from the date of grant and normally vest over a period not
exceeding four years from the date of grant.  Options under the plan are
exercisable upon grant, subject to the company's conditional right to
repurchase unvested shares.

     Outside Directors Stock Option Plan.  The company's Outside
Directors Stock Option Plan provides for the automatic grant of stock
options at pre-established times and for fixed numbers of shares to each
non-employee director.  Stock options are to be granted at exercise
prices not less than the fair market value of the common shares on the
date the option is granted, expire ten years from the date of grant and
normally vest over a period not exceeding three years from the date of
the grant.



     A summary of the activity under the company's two option plans for
1997, 1996 and 1995 is presented below:

   January 31, 1998                            2,854         $16.17

At year-end 1997, 1996 and 1995, there were 1.5 million, 2.3 million and
3.3 million shares, respectively, available for future issuance under
these plans.

The weighted average fair values per share of options granted during
1997, 1996 and 1995 were $7.98, $4.72 and $1.89, respectively.  For
determining pro forma earnings per share, the fair values for each
option granted were estimated on the date of grant using the Black-
Scholes option pricing model with the following assumptions for 1997,
1996 and 1995, respectively:  (i) dividend yield of 0.6%, 0.8% and 1.1%,
(ii) expected volatility of 43.0%, 43.8% and 43.2%, (iii) risk-free
interest rate of 6.2%, 5.9% and 6.7% and (iv) expected life of 3.3
years, 3.4 years and 3.3 years.  The company's calculations are based on
a multiple option approach, and forfeitures are recognized as they
occur.

The following table summarizes information about stock options
outstanding and exercisable at January 31, 1998:

==================================================================



     Employee Stock Purchase Plan.  Under the Employee Stock Purchase
Plan, eligible full-time employees can choose to have up to 10% of their
annual base earnings withheld to purchase the company's common stock.
The purchase price of the stock is 85% of the lower of the beginning of
the offering period or end of the offering period market price.  During
1997, 1996 and 1995, employees purchased approximately 86,000, 155,000
and 261,000 shares, respectively, of the company's common stock under
the plan at weighted average per-share prices of $21.79, $8.89 and
$8.96, respectively.  Through January  31, 1998, approximately 1,523,000
shares had been issued under this plan and 477,000 shares remained
available for future issuance.

     The weighted average fair values of the 1997, 1996 and 1995 awards
were $8.20, $6.72 and $3.02 per share, respectively.  For determining
pro forma earnings per share, the fair value of the employees' purchase
rights was estimated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model using
the following assumptions for 1997, 1996 and 1995, respectively:  (i)
dividend yield of 0.6%, 0.8% and 1.7%, (ii) expected volatility of
43.1%, 48.1% and 34.8%, (iii) risk-free interest rate of 5.6%, 5.5% and
5.9%, and (iv) expected life of 1.0 year, 1.0 year and 1.0 year.

     Restricted Stock Plan.  The company's Restricted Stock Plan
provides for stock awards to officers and certain key employees.  All
awards under the plan entitle the participant to full dividend and
voting rights.  Unvested shares are restricted as to disposition and
subject to forfeiture under certain circumstances.  Upon issuance of
restricted shares, unearned compensation is charged to stockholders'
equity for the cost of restricted stock and recognized as amortization
expense ratably over the vesting period of generally two to five years.
At year-end 1997, 1996 and 1995, the unamortized compensation expense
was $9.4 million, $7.1 million and $4.1 million, respectively.  A
summary of restricted stock award activity follows:

     We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
Ross Stores, Inc. and subsidiaries (the "Company") as of January 31,
1998 and February 1, 1997, and the related consolidated statements of
earnings, stockholders' equity, and cash flows for each of the three
years in the period ended January 31, 1998.  These financial
statements are the responsibility of the company's management.  Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements
based on our audits.

     We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted
auditing standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform
the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement.  An audit includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements.  An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates
made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation.  We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

     In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present
fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the
company as of January 31, 1998 and February 1, 1997, and the results
of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in
the period ended January 31, 1998 in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles.
