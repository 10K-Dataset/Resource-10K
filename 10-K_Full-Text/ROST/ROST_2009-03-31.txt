PART I

Item 1.    
Business.

Ross Stores, Inc. and its
subsidiaries (“we” or the “Company”) operate two chains of off-price retail
apparel and home accessories

stores. At January 31, 2009, we operated a total of
956 stores, of which 904 were Ross Dress for Less

®

(“Ross”) locations
in 27 states and Guam and 52 were dd’s DISCOUNTS

®

stores in four
states. Both chains target value-conscious women and men between the ages of 18
and 54. Ross target customers are primarily from middle income households, while
the dd’s DISCOUNTS target customer is typically from more moderate income
households. The decisions we make, from merchandising, purchasing and pricing,
to the locations of our stores, are aimed at these customer bases.

Ross offers first-quality,
in-season, name brand and designer apparel, accessories, footwear and home
fashions for the entire family at everyday savings of 20% to 60% off department
and specialty store regular prices. dd’s DISCOUNTS features more
moderately-priced assortments of first-quality, in-season, name brand and
fashion apparel, accessories, footwear and home fashions for the entire family
at everyday savings of 20% to 70% off moderate department and discount store
regular prices. We believe that both Ross and dd’s DISCOUNTS derive a
competitive advantage by offering a wide assortment of product within each of
our merchandise categories in organized and easy-to-shop store
environments.

Our mission is to offer
competitive values to our target customers by focusing on the following key
strategic objectives:

Maintain an appropriate level of recognizable
  brands, labels and fashions at strong discounts throughout the store.

Meet customer needs on a more local
  basis.

Deliver an in-store shopping experience that
  reflects the expectations of the off-price customer.

Manage real estate growth to compete effectively
  across all our markets.

We refer to our fiscal years ended
January 31, 2009, February 2, 2008, and February 3, 2007 as fiscal 2008, fiscal
2007, and fiscal 2006, respectively.

Merchandising, Purchasing and
Pricing

We seek to provide our customers
with a wide assortment of first-quality, in-season, brand-name and fashion
apparel, accessories, footwear and home merchandise for the entire family at
everyday savings of 20% to 60% below department and specialty store regular
prices at Ross, and 20% to 70% below moderate department and discount store
regular prices at dd’s DISCOUNTS. We sell recognizable brand-name merchandise
that is current and fashionable in each category. New merchandise typically is
received from three to six times per week at both Ross and dd’s DISCOUNTS
stores. Our buyers review their merchandise assortments on a weekly basis,
enabling them to respond to selling trends and purchasing opportunities in the
market. Our Ross merchandising strategy is reflected in our television
advertising for our Ross stores, which emphasizes a strong value message -- our
customers will find great savings every day on a broad assortment of brand-name
merchandise.

Merchandising.

Our merchandising strategy incorporates a combination of
off-price buying techniques to purchase advance-of-season, in-season, and
past-season merchandise for both Ross and dd’s DISCOUNTS. We believe nationally
recognized name brands sold at compelling discounts will continue to be an
important determinant of our success. We generally leave the brand-name label on
the merchandise we sell.


We have established merchandise
assortments that we believe are attractive to our target customers. Although we
offer fewer classifications of merchandise than most department stores, we
generally offer a large selection of brand names within each classification with
a wide assortment of vendors, labels, prices, colors, styles and fabrics within
each size or item. The mix of comparable store sales by department in fiscal
2008 was approximately as follows: Ladies 32%, Home Accents and Bed and Bath
23%, Men's 14%, Accessories, Lingerie, Fine Jewelry, and Fragrances 12%, Shoes
10%, and Children’s 9%. Our merchandise offerings also include product
categories such as small furniture and furniture accents, educational toys and
games, luggage, gourmet food and cookware, watches, sporting goods and, in
select Ross stores, fine jewelry.

Purchasing.

We have a combined network of approximately 7,200
merchandise vendors and manufacturers for both Ross and dd’s DISCOUNTS and
believe we have adequate sources of first-quality merchandise to meet our
requirements. We purchase the vast majority of our merchandise directly from
manufacturers, and we have not experienced any difficulty in obtaining
sufficient merchandise inventory.

We believe that our ability to
effectively execute certain off-price buying strategies is a key factor in our
success. Our buyers use a number of methods that enable us to offer our
customers brand-name and fashion merchandise at strong everyday discounts
relative to department, specialty, and discount stores for Ross and moderate
department and discount stores for dd’s DISCOUNTS. By purchasing later in the
merchandise buying cycle than department and specialty stores, we are able to
take advantage of imbalances between retailers’ demand for products and
manufacturers’ supply of those products.

Unlike most department and
specialty stores, we typically do not require that manufacturers provide
promotional allowances, co-op advertising allowances, return privileges, split
shipments, drop shipments to stores or delayed deliveries of merchandise. For
most orders, only one delivery is made to one of our four distribution centers.
These flexible requirements further enable our buyers to obtain significant
discounts on in-season purchases.

The vast majority of the apparel
and apparel-related merchandise that we offer in all of our stores is acquired
through opportunistic purchases created by manufacturer overruns and canceled
orders both during and at the end of a season. These buys are referred to as
"close-out" and "packaway" purchases. Close-outs can be shipped to stores
in-season, allowing us to get in-season goods into our stores at lower prices.
Packaway merchandise is purchased with the intent that it will be stored in our
warehouses until a later date, which may even be the beginning of the same
selling season in the following year. Packaway purchases are an effective method
of increasing the percentage of prestige and national brands at competitive
savings within our merchandise assortments. Packaway merchandise is mainly
fashion basics and, therefore, not usually affected by shifts in fashion
trends.

In fiscal 2008, we continued our
emphasis on this important sourcing strategy in response to compelling
opportunities available in the marketplace. Packaway accounted for approximately
38% of total inventories as of January 31, 2009 and February 2, 2008. We believe
the strong discounts we are able to offer on packaway merchandise are one of the
key drivers of our business results.

We continue to roll out additional
information system enhancements and process changes to improve our merchandising
capabilities. These new tools are designed to strengthen our ability to plan,
buy and allocate at a more local versus regional level. We expect to complete
the chain-wide rollout to all merchandise categories in fiscal 2010. The
long-term objective of these investments is to fine tune our merchandise
offerings to address more localized customer preferences and thereby gradually
increase sales productivity and gross profit margins in both newer and existing
regions and markets.

Our buying offices are located in
New York City and Los Angeles, the nation's two largest apparel markets. These
strategic locations allow our buyers to be in the market on a daily basis,
sourcing opportunities and negotiating purchases with vendors and manufacturers.
These locations also enable our buyers to strengthen vendor relationships -- a
key element in the success of our off-price buying strategies.


At the end of fiscal 2008, we had
a total of approximately 360 merchants for Ross and dd’s DISCOUNTS combined,
although the two buying organizations are separate and distinct. These buying
resources include merchandise management, buyers and assistant buyers. Ross and
dd’s DISCOUNTS buyers have an average of about 12 years of experience, including
merchandising positions with other retailers such as Ann Taylor, Bloomingdale's,
Burlington Coat Factory, Foot Locker, Kohl’s, Loehmann’s, Lord & Taylor,
Macy's, Marshalls, Nordstrom, Saks, T.J. Maxx and Value City. We continue to
make strategic investments in our merchandise organization to further develop
our relationships with an expanding number of manufacturers and vendors. Our
ongoing objective is to enhance our ability to procure the most desirable brands
and fashions at competitive discounts.

The off-price buying strategies
utilized by our experienced team of merchants enable us to purchase Ross
merchandise at net prices that are lower than prices paid by department and
specialty stores and dd’s DISCOUNTS merchandise at net prices that are lower
than prices paid by moderate department and discount stores.

Pricing.

Our policy is to sell brand-name merchandise at Ross that
is priced 20% to 60% below most department and specialty store regular prices.
At dd’s DISCOUNTS, we sell more moderate brand-name product and fashions that
are priced 20% to 70% below most moderate department and discount store regular
prices. Our pricing policy is reflected on the price tag displaying our selling
price as well as the comparable selling price for that item in department and
specialty stores for Ross merchandise, or in more moderate department and
discount stores for dd’s DISCOUNTS merchandise.

Our pricing strategy at Ross
differs from that of a department or specialty store. We purchase our
merchandise at lower prices and mark it up less than a department or specialty
store. This strategy enables us to offer customers consistently low prices. On a
weekly basis our buyers review specified departments in our stores for possible
markdowns based on the rate of sale as well as at the end of fashion seasons to
promote faster turnover of merchandise inventory and to accelerate the flow of
fresh product. A similar pricing strategy is in place at dd’s DISCOUNTS where
prices are compared to those in moderate department and discount
stores.

Stores

At January 31, 2009, we operated a
total of

956 stores comprised of 904 Ross stores and 52 dd’s DISCOUNTS stores. Our
stores are conveniently located in predominantly community and neighborhood
shopping centers in heavily populated urban and suburban areas. Where the size
of the market permits, we cluster stores to benefit from economies of scale in
advertising, distribution and field management.

We believe a key element of our
success is our organized, attractive, easy-to-shop, in-store environments at
both Ross and dd’s DISCOUNTS, which allow customers to shop at their own pace.
Our stores are designed for customer convenience in their merchandise
presentation, dressing rooms, checkout and merchandise return areas. Each
store's sales area is based on a prototype single floor design with a racetrack
aisle layout. A customer can locate desired departments by signs displayed just
below the ceiling of each department. We encourage our customers to select among
sizes and prices through prominent category and sizing markers, promoting a
self-service atmosphere. At most stores, shopping carts are available at the
entrance for customer convenience. All cash registers are centrally located at
store exits for customer ease and efficient staffing.

We use point-of-sale (“POS”)
hardware and software systems in all stores, which minimizes transaction time
for the customer at the checkout counter by electronically scanning each ticket
at the point of sale and authorizing credit for personal checks and credit cards
in a matter of seconds. In addition, the POS systems allow us to accept
PIN-based debit cards and electronic gift cards from customers. For Ross and
dd’s DISCOUNTS combined, approximately 58% of payments in fiscal 2008 and 56% of
payments in fiscal 2007 were made with credit cards and debit cards. We provide
cash or credit card refunds on all merchandise returned with a receipt within 30
days. Merchandise returns having a receipt older than 30 days are exchanged or
credited with a credit voucher at the price on the receipt.


Operating Costs

Consistent with the other aspects
of our business strategy, we strive to keep operating costs as low as possible.
Among the factors which have enabled us to keep operating costs low
are:

Labor costs that generally are lower than
  full-price department and specialty stores due to (i) a store design that
  creates a self-service retail format and (ii) the utilization of labor saving
  technologies.

Economies of scale with respect to general
  and administrative costs as a result of centralized merchandising, marketing
  and purchasing decisions.

Flexible store layout criteria which
  facilitates conversion of existing buildings to our format.

Information
Systems

In fiscal 2008, we continued to
invest in new information systems and technology to provide a platform for
growth over the next several years. Recent initiatives include the
following:

We completed development and began the
  rollout of demand forecasting software and related process changes designed to
  strengthen our merchandise planning effectiveness. We expect this initiative
  to drive gradual increases in store sales productivity and profitability by
  improving our ability to plan, buy and allocate product at a more local level.
  We plan to complete this rollout in fiscal 2010.

We implemented additional supply chain
  enhancements to support expansion of processing and storage facilities and to
  increase operating efficiency. These improvements included the expansion of a
  distribution center and enhanced warehouse management functionality.

We completed the rollout of new tools to
  better support the continued growth of our import business. These new tools
  provide our merchants with greater visibility into item cost components and
  inbound movement of import products.

We completed a project to implement new labor
  standards across our entire store base. As part of this project, we developed
  tools to more effectively generate store schedules by optimizing in-store
  tasks, available resources, and planned payroll budgets.

We completed a project to implement new
  online tools to assist our stores in their recruiting and hiring efforts.
  These new tools are designed to help our store managers expedite the hiring
  process and increase the quality of hiring decisions.

We implemented additional enhancements to our
  POS systems to reduce customer transaction and wait times.

We upgraded our loss prevention software to
  allow for greater in-depth analysis and reporting, and completed the rollout
  of additional store video surveillance systems to provide corporate and
  centralized remote monitoring.

We completed a project to integrate our
  systems with a third party payment services network to streamline our invoice
  processing and payment process. This project provides us with new capabilities
  which we are using to help lower our invoice processing costs and to increase
  our cash management efficiency.

Distribution

We have a total of four
distribution processing facilities. We lease a 1.3 million square foot
distribution center in Perris, California. We own a 1.3 million square foot
distribution center in Fort Mill, South Carolina, a 685,000 square foot
distribution center in Moreno Valley, California, and a 426,000 square foot
distribution center located in Carlisle, Pennsylvania. We currently have under
construction a 610,000 square foot expansion of our Moreno Valley, California
distribution center scheduled for completion in 2009. See additional discussion
in Management’s Discussion and Analysis.

In addition, we own one facility
and lease three other warehouse facilities for packaway storage, two of which
are located in Carlisle, Pennsylvania, totaling approximately 239,000 and
246,000 square feet, and two of which are located in Fort Mill, South Carolina,
totaling 253,000 and 423,000 (owned facility) square feet, respectively. We
utilize other third-party facilities as needed for storage of packaway
inventory. We also lease a 10-acre parcel of land that has been developed for
trailer parking adjacent to our Perris, California distribution
center.


In October 2008 we purchased 160
acres of land in South Carolina with the intention of building a new
distribution center in the future.

We utilize third-party cross docks
to distribute merchandise to stores on a regional basis. Shipments are made by
contract carriers to the stores from three to six times per week depending on
location.

We believe that our existing
distribution centers with their current expansion capabilities will provide
adequate processing capacity to support store growth over the next few
years.

Advertising

We rely primarily on television
advertising to communicate the Ross value proposition -- brand-name merchandise
at low everyday prices. This strategy reflects our belief that television is the
most efficient and cost-effective medium for communicating everyday savings on a
wide selection of brand-name bargains for both the family and home. Advertising
for dd’s DISCOUNTS is primarily focused on new store grand openings and local
community initiatives.

Trademarks

The trademarks for Ross Dress For
Less

®

and dd’s DISCOUNTS

®

have been registered with the
United States Patent and Trademark Office.

Employees

As of January 31, 2009, we had
approximately 40,000 total employees, including an estimated 26,500 part-time
employees. Additionally, we hire temporary employees -- especially during the
peak seasons. Our employees are non-union. Management considers the relationship
between the Company and our employees to be good.

Competition

We believe the principal
competitive factors in the off-price retail apparel and home accessories
industry are offering significant discounts on brand-name merchandise, offering
a well-balanced assortment appealing to our target customer, and consistently
providing store environments that are convenient and easy to shop. To execute
this concept, we continue to make strategic investments in our buying
organization. As discussed under Information Systems, we are also in the process
of completing the rollout in fiscal 2010 of additional enhancements to our
merchandise planning system to strengthen our ability to plan, buy, and allocate
product based on more local versus regional trends. We believe that we are well
positioned to compete on the basis of each of these factors.

Nevertheless, the retail apparel
market is highly fragmented and competitive. We face a challenging macro-economic environment that creates intense competition for business from
department stores, specialty stores, discount stores, warehouse stores, other
off-price retailers and manufacturer-owned outlet stores, many of which are
units of large national or regional chains that have substantially greater
resources than we do. We also compete to some degree with retailers that sell
apparel and home accessories through catalogs or over the internet. The retail
apparel business may become even more competitive in the future.

dd’s DISCOUNTS

We began the dd’s DISCOUNTS
concept in 2004 with ten initial locations in California and, as of January 31,
2009, operated 52 dd’s DISCOUNTS

stores in four states. This
smaller off-price concept targets the needs of households with more moderate
incomes

than Ross customers

.

We believe this is one of the fastest growing demographic
markets in the country. dd’s DISCOUNTS features a moderately-priced assortment
of first-quality, in-season, name brand and fashion apparel, accessories,
footwear and home merchandise at everyday savings of 20% to 70% off moderate
department and discount store regular prices.


The dd’s DISCOUNTS business
generally has similar merchandise departments and categories to those of Ross,
but features a different mix of brands at lower average price points. The
typical dd’s DISCOUNTS store is located in an established shopping center in a
densely populated urban or suburban neighborhood. The merchant, store and
distribution organizations for dd’s DISCOUNTS and Ross are separate and
distinct; however, dd’s DISCOUNTS shares certain other corporate and support
services with Ross.

 Risk Factors.

Our Annual Report on Form 10-K for
fiscal 2008, and information we provide in our Annual Report to Stockholders,
press releases, telephonic reports and other investor communications, including
those on our corporate website, may contain forward-looking statements with
respect to anticipated future events and our projected financial performance,
operations and competitive position that are subject to risk factors that could
cause our actual results to differ materially from those forward-looking
statements and our prior expectations and projections. Refer to Management’s
Discussion and Analysis for a more complete identification and discussion of
“Forward-Looking Statements.”

Our financial condition, results
of operations, cash flows and the performance of our common stock may be
adversely affected by a number of risk factors. Risks and uncertainties that
apply to both Ross and dd’s DISCOUNTS include, without limitation, the
following:

We are subject to the economic
and industry risks that affect large retailers operating in the United
States.

Our business is exposed to the
risks of a large, multi-store retailer, which must continually and efficiently
obtain and distribute a supply of fresh merchandise throughout a large and
growing network of stores. These risk factors include:

An increase in the level of competitive
  pressures in the retail apparel or home-related merchandise industry.

Potential changes in the level of consumer
  spending on or preferences for apparel or home-related merchandise, including
  the potential impact from uncertainty in financial and credit markets and the
  severity and duration of the current recession.

Potential changes in geopolitical and/or
  general economic conditions that could affect the availability of product
  and/or the level of consumer spending.

Unseasonable weather trends that could affect
  consumer demand for seasonal apparel and apparel-related products.

A change in the availability, quantity or
  quality of attractive brand-name merchandise at desirable discounts that could
  impact our ability to purchase product and continue to offer customers a wide
  assortment of merchandise at competitive prices.

Potential disruptions in the supply chain
  that could impact our ability to deliver product to our stores in a timely and
  cost-effective manner.

A change in the availability, quality or cost
  of new store real estate locations.

A downturn in the economy or a natural
  disaster in California or in another region where we have a concentration of
  stores or a distribution center. Our corporate headquarters, two distribution
  centers and

26% of our stores are located
  in California.


We are subject to operating
risks as we attempt to execute on our merchandising and growth
strategies.

The continued success of our
business depends, in part, upon our ability to increase sales at our existing
store locations, to open new stores, and to operate stores on a profitable
basis. Our existing strategies and store expansion programs may not result in a
continuation of our anticipated revenue or profit growth. In executing our
off-price retail strategies and working to improve efficiencies, expand our
store network, and reduce our costs, we face a number of operational risks,
including:

Our ability to attract and retain personnel
  with the retail talent necessary to execute our strategies.

Our ability to effectively operate our
  various supply chain, core merchandising and other information systems.

Our ability to improve our merchandising
  capabilities through the development and implementation of new processes and
  systems enhancements.

Our ability to improve new store sales and
  profitability, especially in newer regions and markets.

Our ability to achieve and maintain targeted
  levels of productivity and efficiency in our distribution centers.

Our ability to lease or acquire acceptable
  new store sites with favorable demographics and long term financial
  returns.

Our ability to identify and to successfully
  enter new geographic markets.

Our ability to achieve planned gross margins,
  by effectively managing inventories, markdowns, and shrink.

Our ability to effectively manage all
  operating costs of the business, the largest of which are payroll and benefit
  costs for store and distribution center employees.

Stores

At January 31, 2009, we operated a
total of 956 stores, of which 904 were Ross Dress for Less

®

(“Ross”)
locations in 27 states and Guam and 52 were dd’s DISCOUNTS

®

stores in
four states. All stores are leased, with the exception of two locations which we
own.

During fiscal 2008, we opened 72
new Ross stores and closed six existing stores. The average new Ross store in
fiscal 2008 was approximately 29,500 gross square feet, yielding about 24,500
square feet of selling space. As of January 31, 2009, our 904 Ross stores
generally ranged in size from about 25,000 to 35,000 gross square feet and had
an average of 29,900 gross square feet and 23,800 selling square
feet.

During fiscal 2008, we opened five
new dd’s DISCOUNTS stores and closed five existing stores. The average new dd’s
DISCOUNTS store in fiscal 2008 was approximately 23,600 gross square feet,
yielding about 18,600 square feet of selling space. As of January 31, 2009, our
52 dd’s DISCOUNTS stores had an average of 25,000 gross square feet and 20,300
selling square feet. Our dd’s DISCOUNTS stores are currently located in
California, Florida, Texas, and Arizona.

During fiscal 2008, no one store
accounted for more than 1% of our sales.


We carry earthquake insurance for
business interruption, inventory and personal property to mitigate our risk on
our corporate headquarters, distribution centers, buying offices, and all of our
stores.

Our real estate strategy in 2009
and 2010 is to open stores in states where we currently operate to increase our
market penetration and to reduce overhead and advertising expenses as a
percentage of sales in each market. Important considerations in evaluating a new
store location are the availability and quality of potential sites, demographic
characteristics, competition, and population density of the local trade area. In
addition, we continue to consider opportunistic real estate
acquisitions.

The following table summarizes the
locations of our stores by state as of January 31, 2009 and February 2, 2008. At
January 31, 2009, we had 39 dd’s DISCOUNTS stores in California, 6 in Florida, 5
in Texas, and 2 in Arizona. At February 2, 2008, we had 36 dd’s DISCOUNTS stores
in California, 9 in Florida, 5 in Texas, and 2 in Arizona.

Where possible, we have obtained
sites in buildings requiring minimal alterations. This has allowed us to
establish stores in new locations in a relatively short period of time at
reasonable costs in a given market. To date, we have been able to secure leases
in suitable locations for our stores. At January 31, 2009, the majority of our
stores had unexpired original lease terms ranging from three to ten years with
three to four renewal options of five years each. The average unexpired original
lease term of our leased stores is six years, or 22 years if renewal options are
included. See Note E of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.


See additional discussion under
“Stores” in Item 1.

Distribution
Centers

We operate four distribution
facilities. We have two 1.3 million square foot distribution centers -- one in
Fort Mill, South Carolina, and the other in Perris, California. Our Fort
Mill, South Carolina facility, which we own, opened in July 2002. The Perris, California facility opened in September 2003
and is financed with a ten-year synthetic lease facility that expires in July
2013. We own a 685,000 square foot distribution center in Moreno Valley,
California that we acquired to increase our distribution and packaway storage
capacity. We are in the process of expanding our Moreno Valley, California
distribution center to 1.3 million square feet. We also own a 426,000 square
foot distribution center located in Carlisle, Pennsylvania. See additional
discussion in Management’s Discussion and Analysis.

In November 2001 we entered into a
nine-year lease for a 239,000 square foot warehouse and a ten-year lease for a
246,000 square foot warehouse in Carlisle, Pennsylvania. In January 2009, we
exercised a three-year option for a 253,000 square foot warehouse in Fort Mill,
South Carolina, extending the term to February 2013. In June 2008, we purchased
a 423,000 square foot warehouse also in Fort Mill, South Carolina. All four of
these properties are used to store our packaway inventory. We also lease a
10-acre parcel of land that has been developed for trailer parking adjacent to
our Perris distribution center.

In October 2008 we purchased 160
acres of land in South Carolina with the intention of building a new
distribution center in the future.

See additional discussion under
“Distribution” in Item 1.

Other Leased Facilities

We lease approximately 181,000
square feet of office space for our corporate headquarters in Pleasanton,
California, under several leases. The terms for these leases expire between 2010
and 2014 with various renewal provisions.

We lease approximately 161,000 and
15,000 square feet of office space for our New York and Los Angeles buying
offices, respectively. The terms for these leases expire in 2015 and 2011,
respectively. The lease term for the New York office contains a renewal
provision.

Legal
Proceedings.

We are party to various litigation
matters related to customers, vendors, and employees, including class action
lawsuits alleging misclassification of assistant store managers and missed meal
and rest break periods, and other litigation incident to our business. We
believe that none of these legal proceedings will have a material adverse effect
on our financial condition or results of operations. See Note J of Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements.

Statements” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and our consolidated financial statements

Selected Financial Data


Item
7.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results
of Operations.

Overview

We are the second largest
off-price apparel and home goods retailer in the United States. At the end of
fiscal 2008, we operated 904 Ross Dress for Less (“Ross”) locations in 27 states
and Guam, and 52 dd’s DISCOUNTS stores in four states. Ross offers
first-quality, in-season, name brand and designer apparel, accessories, footwear
and home fashions at everyday savings of 20% to 60% off department and specialty
store regular prices. dd’s DISCOUNTS features a more moderately-priced
assortment of first-quality, in-season, name brand apparel, accessories,
footwear and home fashions at everyday savings of 20% to 70% off moderate
department and discount store regular prices.

Our primary objective is to pursue
and refine our existing off-price strategies to drive gains in profitability and
improved financial returns over the long term. In establishing appropriate
growth targets for our business, we closely monitor market share trends for the
off-price industry. Total aggregate sales for the five largest off-price
retailers in the United States increased 3% during 2008 on top of a 6% increase
in 2007. This compares to total national apparel sales which declined 4% during
2008 compared to a 4% increase in 2007, according to data published by the NPD
Group, which provides global sales and marketing information on the retail
industry.

The macro-economic and retail
climate became more difficult as the year progressed in 2008. We believe that
the stronger relative sales gains of the off-price retailers during the year
reflected the increasing importance of value to consumers, especially as the
recessionary headwinds accelerated. Our sales and earnings gains in 2008
benefited from efficient execution of our resilient and flexible off-price
business model. Our merchandise and operational strategies are designed to take
advantage of the expanding market share of our off-price industry as well as
continued customer demand for name brand fashions for the family and home at
compelling everyday discounts.

Looking ahead to 2009, we expect
the macro-economic pressures to continue, and are planning to maintain tight
controls of both inventory levels and operating expenses as part of our strategy
to help us maximize our profitability.

We refer to our fiscal years ended
January 31, 2009, February 2, 2008, and February 3, 2007 as fiscal 2008, fiscal
2007, and fiscal 2006, respectively. Fiscal 2006 was 53 weeks. Fiscal 2008 and
2007 were 52 weeks.

Stores.

Total stores open at the end of 2008, 2007 and 2006 were
956, 890 and 797, respectively. The number of stores at the end of fiscal 2008,
2007 and 2006 increased by 7%, 12% and 9% from the respective prior years. Our
expansion strategy is to open additional stores based on market penetration,
local demographic characteristics, competition, expected store profitability,
and the ability to leverage overhead expenses. We continually evaluate
opportunistic real estate acquisitions and opportunities for potential new store
locations. We also evaluate our current store locations and determine store
closures based on similar criteria.

Sales.

Sales for fiscal 2008 increased $510.9 million, or 8.6%,
compared to the prior year due to the opening of 66 net new stores during 2008,
and a 2% increase in sales from “comparable” stores (defined as stores that have
been open for more than 14 complete months). Sales for fiscal 2007 increased
$405.0 million, or 7.3%, compared to the same period in the prior year due to
the opening of 93 net new stores during 2007, and a 1% increase in sales from
comparable stores.

We expect to address the
competitive climate for off-price apparel and home goods by pursuing and
refining our existing strategies and by continuing to strengthen our
organization, to diversify our merchandise mix, and to more fully develop our
organization and systems to improve regional and local merchandise offerings.
Although our strategies and store expansion program contributed to sales gains
in fiscal 2008, 2007 and 2006, we cannot be sure that they will result in a
continuation of sales growth or an increase in net earnings.

Cost of goods sold.

Cost of goods sold in fiscal 2008
increased $338.4 million compared to the prior year mainly due to increased
sales from the opening of 66 net new stores during the year, and a 2% increase
in sales from comparable stores.

Cost of goods sold as a percentage
of sales for fiscal 2008 decreased approximately 90 basis points from the prior
year. This improvement was mainly the result of a 100 basis point increase in
merchandise gross margin as a percent of sales. In addition, distribution costs
for the year improved by about 20 basis points. As a percent of sales, these
favorable trends were partially offset by a 10 basis point increase in occupancy
expense and a 20 basis point increase in incentive costs.

Cost of goods sold in fiscal 2007
increased $300.7 million compared to the prior year mainly due to increased
sales from the opening of 93 net new stores during the year, and a 1% increase
in sales from comparable stores.


Cost of goods sold as a percentage
of sales for fiscal 2007 decreased approximately 20 basis points from the prior
year. This improvement was mainly the result of a 20 basis point improvement in
merchandise gross margin primarily due to lower markdowns and shortage as a
percent of sales.

We cannot be sure that the gross
profit margins realized in fiscal 2008, 2007 and 2006 will continue in future
years.

Selling, general and
administrative expenses.

For fiscal
2008, selling, general and administrative expenses (“SG&A”) increased $98.5
million compared to the prior year, mainly due to increased store operating
costs reflecting the opening of 66 net new stores during the year.

SG&A as a percentage of sales
for fiscal 2008 grew by approximately 30 basis points over the prior year. This
increase was mainly driven by a 20 basis point increase in store operating
expenses and a 10 basis point increase in general and administrative costs as a
percent of sales.

For fiscal 2007, SG&A
increased $72.9 million compared to the same period in the prior year, mainly
due to increased store operating costs reflecting the opening of 93 net new
stores during the year.

SG&A as a percentage of sales
for fiscal 2007 grew by approximately 15 basis points over the prior year. This
increase was mainly driven by a 40 basis point rise in store operating expenses.
Store operating costs in 2007 were impacted by minimum wage increases and the
de-leveraging effect of the 1% gain in comparable store sales. These cost
pressures were partially offset by a 25 basis point decline in other general and
administrative costs.

The largest component of SG&A
is payroll. The total number of employees, including both full and part-time, as
of fiscal year end 2008, 2007, and 2006 was approximately 40,000, 39,100, and
35,800, respectively.

Interest.

In fiscal 2008, interest expense decreased by $1.5
million primarily due to higher capitalization of construction interest. In
fiscal 2008, interest income decreased by $5.3 million primarily due to lower
investment yields as compared to the prior year. As a percentage of sales, the
reduction in net interest income in fiscal 2008 decreased pre-tax earnings by
approximately 10 basis points compared to the same period in the prior year. The
table below shows interest expense and income for fiscal 2008, 2007 and 2006:

Taxes on earnings.

Our effective tax rate for fiscal 2008,
2007, and 2006 was approximately 38%, 39%, and 39%, respectively, which
represents the applicable combined federal and state statutory rates reduced by
the federal benefit of state taxes deductible on federal returns. The effective
rate is affected by changes in law, location of new stores, level of earnings,
and the resolution of tax positions with various taxing authorities. We
anticipate that our effective tax rate for fiscal 2009 will be in the range of
38% to 40%.

Net earnings.

Net earnings as a percentage of sales for fiscal 2008
were higher compared to fiscal 2007 primarily due to lower cost of goods sold as
a percentage of sales, partially offset by higher SG&A expenses as a
percentage of sales. Net earnings as a percentage of sales for fiscal 2007 were
higher compared to fiscal 2006 primarily due to lower cost of goods sold as a
percentage of sales, partially offset by higher SG&A expenses as a
percentage of sales.


Earnings per share.

Diluted earnings per share in fiscal
2008 were $2.33, compared to $1.90 in fiscal 2007. This 23% increase in diluted
earnings per share is attributable to an approximate 17% increase in net
earnings and a 4% reduction in weighted average diluted shares outstanding,
largely due to the repurchase of common stock under our stock repurchase
program. Diluted earnings per share in fiscal 2007 were $1.90, compared to $1.70
in fiscal 2006 on a 53-week basis. This 12% increase in diluted earnings per
share is attributable to an approximate 8% increase in net earnings and a 3%
reduction in weighted average diluted shares outstanding, largely due to the
repurchase of common stock under our stock repurchase program.

Financial Condition

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Our primary sources of funds for
our business activities are cash flows from operations and short-term trade
credit. Our primary ongoing cash requirements are for merchandise inventory
purchases, capital expenditures in connection with opening new stores, and
investments in distribution centers and information systems. We also use cash to
repurchase stock under our stock repurchase program and to pay dividends.

Operating Activities

Net cash provided by operating
activities was $583.4 million, $353.6 million and $506.9 million in fiscal 2008,
2007 and 2006, respectively. The primary source of cash provided by operating
activities in fiscal 2008, 2007 and 2006 was net earnings plus non-cash expenses
for depreciation and amortization.

Working capital (defined as
current assets less current liabilities) was $358.5 million at the end of fiscal
2008, compared to $387.4 million at the end of fiscal 2007. The decrease in
working capital in fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007 is primarily due to lower
average in-store inventories.

Our primary source of liquidity is
the sale of our merchandise inventory. We regularly review the age and condition
of our merchandise and are able to maintain current merchandise inventory in our
stores through replenishment processes and liquidation of slower-moving
merchandise through clearance markdowns.

Investing Activities

In fiscal 2008, 2007 and 2006, our
capital expenditures were $224.4 million, $236.1 million and $223.9 million,
respectively. Our capital expenditures included fixtures and leasehold
improvements to open new stores, implement information technology systems, build
or expand distribution centers and install material handling equipment and
related distribution center systems, and various other expenditures related to
our stores, buying and corporate offices. In fiscal 2008 we also purchased land
in South Carolina with the intention of building a new distribution center in
the future. We opened 77, 97, and 66 new stores in fiscal 2008, 2007 and 2006,
respectively, and relocated one store in 2007 and two stores in 2006. In
addition, in 2006, we exercised our option to purchase our Fort Mill, South
Carolina distribution center from the lessor.


In fiscal 2008 we had purchases of
investments of $37.0 million and sales of investments of $42.5 million. In
fiscal 2007 we had purchases of investments of $146.1 million and sales of
investments of $137.1 million. In fiscal 2006 we had purchases of investments of
$71.9 million and sales of investments of $59.3 million.

We are forecasting approximately
$190 million in capital requirements in 2009 to fund expenditures for fixtures
and leasehold improvements to open both new Ross and dd’s DISCOUNTS stores, for
the relocation, or upgrade of existing stores, for investments in store and
merchandising systems, buildings, equipment and systems, and for various buying
and corporate office expenditures. We expect to fund these expenditures with
cash flows from operations.

Our capital expenditures over the
last three years are set forth in the table below:

Financing Activities

During fiscal 2008, 2007 and 2006,
our liquidity and capital requirements were provided by available cash and
investment balances, cash flows from operations, trade credit, and issuance of
senior notes. Our buying offices, our corporate headquarters, one distribution
center, one trailer parking lot, three warehouse facilities, and all but two of
our store locations are leased and, except for certain leasehold improvements
and equipment, do not represent capital investments. We own three distribution
centers in Carlisle, Pennsylvania, Moreno Valley, California, and Fort Mill,
South Carolina.

In January 2008, our Board of
Directors approved a two-year $600 million stock repurchase program for fiscal
2008 and 2009. We repurchased 9.3 million shares of common stock for an
aggregate purchase price of approximately $300 million in 2008 and expect to
complete the remaining purchase of $300 million in 2009. In November 2005, our
Board of Directors authorized a stock repurchase program of up to $400 million
for 2006 and 2007. We repurchased 6.9 million and 7.1 million shares of common
stock for aggregate purchase prices of approximately $200 million in both 2007
and 2006. These repurchases were funded by cash flows from operations.

In January 2009, our Board of
Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend payment of $.11 per common share,
payable on March 31, 2009. Our Board of Directors declared quarterly cash
dividends of $.095 per common share in January, May, August and November 2008,
and cash dividends of $.075 per common share in January, May, August, and
November 2007.

In March 2006, we repaid our $50
million term debt in full. In October 2006, we entered into a Note Purchase
Agreement with various institutional investors for $150 million of unsecured,
senior notes. See “Senior Notes” below for more information.

Short-term trade credit represents
a significant source of financing for merchandise inventory. Trade credit arises
from customary payment terms and trade practices with our vendors. We regularly
review the adequacy of credit available to us from all sources and expect to be
able to maintain adequate trade, bank and other credit lines to meet our capital
and liquidity requirements, including lease payment obligations in 2009.

We estimate that cash flows from
operations, bank credit lines and trade credit are adequate to meet operating
cash needs, fund our planned capital investments, repurchase common stock and
make quarterly dividend payments for at least the next twelve months.

Pursuant to the guidelines of FIN 48,
      a $26.0 million reserve for unrecognized tax benefits is included in other
      long-term liabilities on the Company’s consolidated balance sheet. These
      obligations are excluded from the schedule above as the timing of payments
      cannot be reasonably
estimated.

Senior Notes.

We have a Note Purchase Agreement with various
institutional investors for $150 million of unsecured, senior notes. The notes
were issued in two series and funding occurred in December 2006. The Series A
notes, issued for an aggregate of $85 million, are due in December 2018, and
bear interest at a rate of 6.38%. The Series B notes, issued for an aggregate
of $65 million, are due in December 2021, and bear interest at a rate of 6.53%.
Interest on these notes is included in Interest payment obligations in the table
above.

Borrowings under these notes are
subject to certain operating and financial covenants, including maintaining
certain interest coverage and other financial ratios. As of January 31, 2009, we
were in compliance with these covenants.

Capital leases.

The obligations under capital leases
relate to distribution center equipment and have a term of two years.

Off-Balance Sheet
Arrangements

Operating leases.

We lease our two buying offices, our
corporate headquarters, one distribution center, one trailer parking lot, three
warehouse facilities, and all but two of our store locations. Except for certain
leasehold improvements and equipment, these leased locations do not represent
long-term capital investments.

We have lease arrangements for
certain equipment in our stores for our point-of-sale (“POS”) hardware and
software systems. These leases are accounted for as operating leases for
financial reporting purposes. The initial terms of these leases are either two
or three years, and we typically have options to renew the leases for two to
three one-year periods. Alternatively, we may purchase or return the equipment
at the end of the initial or each renewal term. We have guaranteed the value of
the equipment of $3.9 million, at the end of the respective initial lease terms,
which is included in Other synthetic lease obligations in the table
above.

We lease approximately 181,000
square feet of office space for our corporate headquarters in Pleasanton,
California, under several facility leases. The terms for these leases expire
between 2010 and 2014 and contain renewal provisions.

We lease approximately 161,000 and
15,000 square feet of office space for our New York City and Los Angeles buying
offices, respectively. The lease terms for these facilities expire in 2015 and
2011, respectively. The lease term for the New York office contains a renewal
provision.


We lease a 1.3 million square foot
distribution center in Perris, California. The land and building for this
distribution center are financed under a $70 million ten-year synthetic lease
that expires in July 2013. Rent expense on this center is payable monthly at a
fixed annual rate of 5.8% on the lease balance of $70 million. At the end of the
lease term, we have the option to either refinance the $70 million synthetic
lease facility, purchase the distribution center at the amount of the
then-outstanding lease obligation, or arrange a sale of the distribution center
to a third party. If the distribution center is sold to a third party for less
than $70 million, we have agreed under a residual value guarantee to pay the
lessor any shortfall amount up to $56 million. Our contractual obligation of $56
million is included in Other synthetic lease obligations in the above table.

In accordance with Financial
Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Interpretation (“FIN”) No. 45, “Guarantor’s
Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect
Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others,” we have recognized a liability and
corresponding asset for the fair value of the residual value guarantee in the
amount of $8.3 million for the Perris, California distribution center and $1.2
million for the POS leases. These residual value guarantees are being amortized
on a straight-line basis over the original terms of the leases. The current
portion of the related asset and liability is recorded in prepaid expenses and
accrued expenses, respectively, and the long-term portion of the related assets
and liabilities is recorded in other long-term assets and other long-term
liabilities, respectively, in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.

In November 2001 we entered into a
nine-year lease for a 239,000 square foot warehouse and a ten-year lease for a
246,000 square foot warehouse both in Carlisle, Pennsylvania. In January 2009,
we exercised a three-year option for a 253,000 square foot warehouse in Fort
Mill, South Carolina, extending the term to February 2013. In June 2008, we
purchased a 423,000 square foot warehouse also in Fort Mill, South Carolina. All
four of these properties are used to store our packaway inventory. We also lease
a 10-acre parcel of land that has been developed for trailer parking adjacent to
our Perris distribution center.

The synthetic lease facilities
described above, as well as our revolving credit facility and senior notes, have
covenant restrictions requiring us to maintain certain interest coverage and
other financial ratios. In addition, the interest rates under these agreements
may vary depending on actual interest coverage ratios achieved. As of January
31, 2009, we were in compliance with these covenants.

Purchase obligations.

As of January 31, 2009 we had purchase
obligations of $621.1 million. These purchase obligations primarily consist of
merchandise inventory purchase orders, commitments related to store fixtures and
supplies, and information technology service and maintenance contracts.
Merchandise inventory purchase orders of $574.0 million represent purchase
obligations of less than one year as of January 31, 2009.

      Statements.

Revolving credit
facility.

We have available a $600.0
million revolving credit facility with our banks, which contains a $300.0
million sublimit for issuance of standby letters of credit, of which $239.6
million was available at January 31, 2009. This credit facility expires in July
2011, has a LIBOR-based interest rate plus an applicable margin (currently 45
basis points) and is payable upon maturity but not less than quarterly. Our
borrowing ability under this credit facility is subject to our maintaining
certain interest coverage and other financial ratios. As of January 31, 2009 we
had no borrowings outstanding under this facility and were in compliance with
the covenants.


Standby letters of credit.

We use standby letters of credit to
collateralize certain obligations related to our self-insured workers’
compensation and general liability claims. We had $60.4 million and $61.1
million in standby letters of credit outstanding at January 31, 2009 and
February 2, 2008, respectively.

Trade letters of credit.

We had $16.7 million and $20.8 million
in trade letters of credit outstanding at January 31, 2009 and February 2, 2008,
respectively.

Other

2008 Equity Incentive Plan.

In May 2008, our stockholders approved
the adoption of the Ross Stores, Inc. 2008 Equity Incentive Plan (the “2008
Plan”) with an initial share reserve of 8.3 million shares of our common stock,
of which 6.0 million shares can be issued as full value awards. The 2008 Plan
replaced the 2004 Equity Incentive Plan. The 2008 Plan provides for various
types of incentive awards, which may potentially include the grant of stock
options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock purchase rights, restricted
stock bonuses, restricted stock units, performance shares, performance units,
and deferred compensation awards.

Critical Accounting Policies

The preparation of our
consolidated financial statements requires our management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts. These estimates and assumptions
are evaluated on an ongoing basis and are based on historical experience and on
various other factors that management believes to be reasonable. We believe the
following critical accounting policies describe the more significant judgments
and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.

Merchandise
inventory.

Our merchandise inventory is
stated at the lower of cost or market, with cost determined on a weighted
average cost basis. We purchase manufacturer overruns and canceled orders both
during and at the end of a season which are referred to as "packaway" inventory.
Packaway inventory is purchased with the intent that it will be stored in our
warehouses until a later date, which may even be the beginning of the same
selling season in the following year.

Included in the carrying value of
our merchandise inventory is a provision for shortage. The shortage reserve is
based on historical shortage rates as evaluated through our periodic physical
merchandise inventory counts and cycle counts. If actual market conditions,
markdowns, or shortage are less favorable than those projected by us, or if
sales of the merchandise inventory are more difficult than anticipated,
additional merchandise inventory write-downs may be required.

Long-lived assets.

We record a long-lived asset impairment
charge when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount
of a long-lived asset may not be recoverable based on estimated future cash
flows. An impairment loss would be recognized if analysis of the undiscounted
cash flow of an asset group was less than the carrying value of the asset group.
If our actual results differ materially from projected results, an impairment
charge may be required in the future. In the course of performing our annual
analysis, we determined that no long-lived asset impairment charge was required
for fiscal 2008, 2007, or 2006.

Depreciation and amortization
expense.

Property and equipment are
stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation is
calculated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the
asset, typically ranging from five to twelve years for equipment and 20 to 40
years for real property. The cost of leasehold improvements is amortized over
the lesser of the useful life of the asset or the applicable lease
term.

Lease accounting.

When a lease contains “rent holidays” or
requires fixed escalations of the minimum lease payments, we record rental
expense on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease and the difference
between the average rental amount charged to expense and the amount payable
under the lease is recorded as deferred rent. We amortize deferred rent on a
straight-line basis over the lease term commencing on the possession date.
Tenant improvement allowances are included in other long-term liabilities and
are amortized over the lease term. Tenant improvement allowances are included as
a component of operating cash flows in the consolidated Statements of Cash
Flows.


Self-insurance.

We self insure certain of our workers’ compensation and
general liability risks as well as certain coverages under our health plans. Our
self-insurance liability is determined actuarially, based on claims filed and an
estimate of claims incurred but not reported. Should a greater amount of claims
occur compared to what is estimated or the costs of medical care increase beyond
what was anticipated, our recorded reserves may not be sufficient and additional
charges could be required.

Stock-based compensation.

We account for stock-based compensation under the
provisions of SFAS No. 123(R). The determination of the fair value of stock
options using the Black-Scholes model, is affected by our stock price as well as
assumptions as to our expected stock price volatility over the term of the
awards, actual and projected employee stock option exercise behavior, the
risk-free interest rate and expected dividends.

SFAS No. 123(R) requires companies
to estimate future expected forfeitures at the date of grant and revise those
estimates in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those
estimates. We use historical data to estimate pre-vesting forfeitures and to
recognize stock-based compensation expense. All stock-based compensation awards
are expensed over the service or performance periods of the awards.

Income Taxes.

We adopted FASB Interpretation No. 48, “Accounting for
Uncertainty in Income Taxes” (FIN 48), which supplements SFAS No. 109
“Accounting for Income Taxes” (SFAS No. 109) effective February 4, 2007. FIN 48
clarifies the criteria that an individual tax position must satisfy for some or
all of the benefits of that position to be recognized in a company’s
consolidated financial statements. FIN 48 prescribes a recognition threshold of
more-likely-than-not, and a measurement standard for all tax positions taken or
expected to be taken on a tax return, in order for those tax positions to be
recognized in the consolidated financial statements.

The critical accounting policies
noted above are not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of our accounting
policies. In many cases, the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is
specifically dictated by Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“GAAP”), with
no need for management’s judgment in their application. There are also areas in
which management’s judgment in selecting one alternative accounting principle
over another would not produce a materially different result. See our audited
consolidated financial statements and notes thereto under Item 8 in this Annual
Report on Form 10-K, which contain accounting policies and other disclosures
required by GAAP.

Effects of inflation or
deflation.

We do not consider the
effects of inflation or deflation to be material to our financial position and
results of operations.

New Accounting
Pronouncements

SFAS No. 157, “Fair Value
Measurements” (“SFAS No. 157”), is effective for financial assets and
liabilities for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007, except for
nonfinancial assets and liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair
value in the financial statements on a nonrecurring basis, for which application
was deferred for one year. SFAS No. 157 defines fair value, establishes a
framework for measuring fair value and expands required disclosures about fair
value measurements.

SFAS No. 159, “The Fair Value
Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities” (“SFAS No. 159”) is
effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. SFAS No. 159
establishes a fair value option under which entities can elect to report certain
financial assets and liabilities at fair value, with changes in fair value
recognized in earnings.

We adopted SFAS No. 157 and SFAS
No. 159 effective February 3, 2008. Adoption of the deferred provisions of SFAS
157 will not have a material impact on our operating results or financial
position.


Forward-Looking Statements

Our Annual Report on Form 10-K for
fiscal 2008, and information we provide in our Annual Report to Stockholders,
press releases, telephonic reports and other investor communications including
on our corporate website, may contain a number of forward-looking statements
regarding, without limitation, planned store growth, new markets, expected
sales, projected earnings levels, capital expenditures and other matters. These
forward-looking statements reflect our then current beliefs, projections and
estimates with respect to future events and our projected financial performance,
operations and competitive position. The words “plan,” “expect,” “target,”
“anticipate,” “estimate,” “believe,” “forecast,” “projected,” “guidance,”
“looking ahead” and similar expressions identify forward-looking statements.

Future economic and industry
trends that could potentially impact revenue, profitability, and growth remain
difficult to predict. As a result, our forward-looking statements are subject to
risks and uncertainties which could cause our actual results to differ
materially from those forward-looking statements and our previous expectations
and projections. Refer to Item 1A in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a more
complete discussion of risk factors for Ross and dd’s DISCOUNTS. The factors
underlying our forecasts are dynamic and subject to change. As a result, any
forecasts or forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are given
and do not necessarily reflect our outlook at any other point in time. We do not
undertake to update or revise these forward-looking statements.

ITEM 7A.     QUANTITATIVE AND
QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK.

We are exposed to market risks,
which primarily include changes in interest rates. We do not engage in financial
transactions for trading or speculative purposes.

We occasionally use forward
contracts to hedge against fluctuations in foreign currency prices. We had no
outstanding forward contracts as of January 31, 2009.

Interest payable on our revolving
credit facilities is based on variable interest rates and is, therefore,
affected by changes in market interest rates. As of January 31, 2009, we had no
borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facilities. In addition, lease
payments under certain of our synthetic lease agreements are determined based on
variable interest rates and are, therefore, affected by changes in market
interest rates.

In addition, we issued notes to
institutional investors in two series: Series A for $85 million accrues interest
at 6.38% and Series B for $65 million accrues interest at 6.53%. The amount
outstanding under these notes as of January 31, 2009 is $150 million.

Interest is receivable on our
short and long-term investments. Changes in interest rates may impact interest
income recognized in the future, or the fair value of our investment portfolio.

A hypothetical 100 basis point
increase or decrease in prevailing market interest rates would not have
materially impacted our consolidated financial position, results of operations,
cash flows, or the fair values of our short and long-term investments as of and
for the year ended January 31, 2009. We do not consider the potential losses in
future earnings and cash flows from reasonably possible, near term changes in
interest rates to be material.

CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH
FLOWS


NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS

Note A: Summary of Significant
Accounting Policies

Business.

Ross Stores, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the “Company”) is
an off-price retailer of first-quality, name brand apparel, shoes and
accessories for the entire family, as well as gift items, linens and other
home-related merchandise. At the end of fiscal 2008, the Company operated 904
Ross Dress for Less

®

(“Ross”) locations in 27 states and Guam and 52 dd’s
DISCOUNTS

®

stores in four states, which are supported by four distribution centers.
The Company’s headquarters, two distribution centers and 26% of its stores are
located in California.

Basis of presentation and
fiscal year.

The consolidated financial
statements include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries, all of
which are wholly-owned. Intercompany transactions and accounts have been
eliminated. The Company follows the National Retail Federation fiscal calendar
and utilizes a 52-53 week fiscal year whereby the fiscal year ends on the
Saturday nearest to January 31. The fiscal years ended January 31, 2009,
February 2, 2008 and February 3, 2007 are referred to as fiscal 2008, fiscal
2007 and fiscal 2006, respectively. Fiscal 2006 was 53 weeks. Fiscal 2008 and
2007 were 52 weeks.

Use of accounting estimates.

The preparation of consolidated
financial statements in conformity with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles
in the United States of America (“GAAP”) requires the Company to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities and
disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated
financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the
reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The
Company’s significant accounting estimates include valuation of merchandise
inventory and long-lived assets, and accruals for self-insurance.

Purchase obligations.

As of January 31, 2009, the Company had
purchase obligations of approximately $621.1 million. These purchase obligations
primarily consist of merchandise inventory purchase orders, commitments related
to store fixtures and supplies, and information technology service and
maintenance contracts. Merchandise inventory purchase orders of $574.0 million
represent purchase obligations of less than one year as of January 31,
2009.

Cash and cash equivalents.

Cash and cash equivalents are highly
liquid, fixed income instruments purchased with an original maturity of three
months or less.

Investments.

The Company’s investments are comprised of various debt
securities. At January 31, 2009 and February 2, 2008, these investments were
classified as available-for-sale and are stated at fair value. Investments are
classified as either short-term or long-term based on their original maturities.
Investments with an original maturity of less than one year are classified as
short-term. See Note B for additional information.

Merchandise inventory.

Merchandise inventory is stated at the
lower of cost (determined using a weighted average basis) or net realizable
value. The Company purchases manufacturer overruns and canceled orders both
during and at the end of a season which are referred to as "packaway" inventory.
Packaway inventory is purchased with the intent that it will be stored in the
Company's warehouses until a later date, which may even be the beginning of the
same selling season in the following year. Packaway inventory accounted for
approximately 38% of total inventories as of January 31, 2009 and February 2,
2008. The cost of the Company’s merchandise inventory is reduced by valuation
reserves for shortage based on historical shortage experience from the Company’s
physical merchandise inventory counts and cycle counts.

Cost of goods sold.

In addition to

product costs,
the Company includes in cost of goods sold its buying, distribution and freight
expenses as well as occupancy costs, and depreciation and amortization related
to the Company’s retail stores, buying and distribution facilities. Buying
expenses include costs to procure merchandise inventories. Distribution expenses
include the cost of operating the Company’s distribution centers.


Property and equipment.

Property and equipment, which include
amounts recorded under capital leases, are stated at cost, less accumulated
depreciation and amortization. Depreciation is calculated using the
straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the asset, typically
ranging from five to twelve years for equipment and 20 to 40 years for real
property. Depreciation and amortization expense on property and equipment was
$134.0 million, $120.7 million and $107.8 million for fiscal 2008, 2007 and
2006, respectively. The cost of leasehold improvements is amortized over the
useful life of the asset or the applicable lease term, whichever is less.
Computer hardware and software costs, net of amortization, of $125.8 million and
$136.4 million at January 31, 2009 and February 2, 2008, respectively, are
included in fixtures and equipment and are amortized over their estimated useful
life generally ranging from five to seven years. Property under capital leases,
net of depreciation, of $0.6 million at January 31, 2009 relates to distribution
center equipment and has a term of two years. The Company capitalizes interest
during the construction period. Interest capitalized was $3.2 million and $0.9
million in fiscal 2008 and fiscal 2007, respectively.

Other long-term
assets.

Intangible assets

are principally
comprised of lease rights, which are payments made to acquire store leases. An
impairment loss would be recognized if the undiscounted cash flow of an asset
group was less than the carrying value of the asset group.

Lease rights are
amortized over the remaining life of the lease. Amortization expense related to
these intangible assets was $0.1 million, $0.2 million and $0.3 million for
fiscal 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively.

Other long-term assets and certain
identifiable intangibles that are subject to amortization are reviewed for
impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the
carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Intangible assets that are
not subject to amortization, including goodwill, are tested for impairment
annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that
the asset may be impaired. Based on the Company’s evaluation as of January 31,
2009 and February 2, 2008, no adjustments were required to reduce the carrying
value of intangible assets to fair value.

Store closures.

The Company continually reviews the operating
performance of individual stores. For stores that are to be closed, the Company
records a liability for future minimum lease payments and related ancillary
costs at the time the liability is incurred. In 2008, the Company closed six
Ross Dress for Less and five dd’s DISCOUNTS locations. In connection with the
dd’s store closures, the Company recognized a lease loss liability of
approximately $1.0 million. Operating costs, including depreciation, of stores
to be closed are expensed during the period they remain in use.

Accounts payable.

Accounts payable represents amounts owed
to third parties at the end of the period. Accounts payable includes book cash
overdrafts (checks issued under zero balance accounts not yet presented for
payment) in excess of cash balances in such accounts of approximately $97.2
million and $102.0 million at January 31, 2009 and February 2, 2008,
respectively. The Company includes the change in book cash overdrafts in
operating cash flows.


Self-insurance.

The Company is self-insured for workers’ compensation,
general liability insurance costs and costs of certain medical plans. The
self-insurance liability is determined actuarially, based on claims filed and an
estimate of claims incurred but not yet reported. Self-insurance reserves as of
January 31, 2009 and February 2, 2008 consist of the following:

Lease
accounting.

When a lease contains “rent
holidays” or requires fixed escalations of the minimum lease payments, the
Company records rental expense on a straight-line basis over the term of the
lease and the difference between the average rental amount charged to expense
and the amount payable under the lease is recorded as deferred rent. The Company
amortizes deferred rent on a straight-line basis over the lease term commencing
on the possession date. As of January 31, 2009 and February 2, 2008, the balance
of deferred rent was $57.4 million and $55.7 million, respectively, and is
included in other long-term liabilities. Tenant improvement allowances are
included in other long-term liabilities and are amortized over the lease term.
Changes in tenant improvement allowances are included as a component of
operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows.

Advertising costs are expensed in the period incurred.
Advertising costs for fiscal 2008, 2007 and 2006 were $53.9 million, $50.2
million and $45.5 million, respectively.

Stock-based
compensation.

The Company accounts for
stock-based compensation in accordance with SFAS 123(R), “Share-Based Payment,”
which requires recognition of compensation expense based upon the grant date
fair value of all stock-based awards, typically over the vesting period. See
Note C for more information on the Company’s stock-based compensation
plans.

Taxes on earnings.

The Company accounts for income taxes in
accordance with SFAS No. 109, “Accounting for Income Taxes,” which requires the
recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax
consequences of events that have been recognized in the Company's consolidated
financial statements or tax returns. In estimating future tax consequences, the
Company generally considers all expected future events other than changes in the
tax law or tax rates.

The Company adopted FASB
Interpretation No. 48, “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes” (FIN 48),
which supplements SFAS No. 109 “Accounting for Income Taxes” (SFAS No. 109)
effective February 4, 2007. FIN 48 clarifies the criteria that an individual tax
position must satisfy for some or all of the benefits of that position to be
recognized in a company’s consolidated financial statements. FIN 48 prescribes a
recognition threshold of more-likely-than-not, and a measurement standard for
all tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return, in order for
those tax positions to be recognized in the consolidated financial statements.

Treasury stock.

The Company records treasury stock at
cost. Treasury stock includes shares purchased from employees for tax
withholding purposes related to vesting of restricted stock
grants.

Earnings per
share

(“EPS”).

SFAS No. 128, “Earnings
Per Share,” requires earnings per share to be computed and reported as both
basic EPS and diluted EPS. Basic EPS is computed by dividing net earnings by the
weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted EPS
is computed by dividing net earnings by the sum of the weighted average number
of common shares and dilutive common stock equivalents outstanding during the
period. Diluted EPS reflects the total potential dilution that could occur from
outstanding equity plan awards, including unexercised stock options and unvested
shares of both performance and non-performance based awards of restricted
stock.

In fiscal 2008, 2007 and 2006
there were 583,000, 1,277,000, and 3,114,000 weighted average shares,
respectively, that could potentially dilute basic EPS in the future that were
excluded from the calculation of diluted EPS because their effect would have
been anti-dilutive for those years.


The following is a reconciliation

computations:

Comprehensive
income.

Comprehensive income consists of
net earnings and other comprehensive income, principally unrealized investment
gains or losses. Components of comprehensive income are presented in the
consolidated statements of stockholders’ equity.

Derivative instruments and
hedging activities.

SFAS No. 133,
“Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities,” as amended,
requires the Company to record all derivatives as either assets or liabilities
on the balance sheet and to measure those instruments at fair value. The Company
had no derivative instruments outstanding as of January 31, 2009 or February 2,
2008.

Adoption of new accounting
standards.

SFAS No. 157, “Fair Value
Measurements” (“SFAS No. 157”), is effective for financial assets and
liabilities for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007, except for
nonfinancial assets and liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair
value in the financial statements on a nonrecurring basis, for which application
was deferred for one year. SFAS No. 157 defines fair value, establishes a
framework for measuring fair value and expands required disclosures about fair
value measurements.


SFAS No. 159, “The Fair Value
Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities” (“SFAS No. 159”) is
effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. SFAS No. 159
establishes a fair value option under which entities can elect to report certain
financial assets and liabilities at fair value, with changes in fair value
recognized in earnings.

The Company adopted SFAS No. 157,
and SFAS No. 159 effective February 3, 2008. Adoption of the deferred provisions
of SFAS No. 157 will not have a material impact on the Company’s operating
results or financial position.

Note B: Investments

The amortized cost and fair value
of the Company’s available-for-sale securities as of January 31, 2009 were:

At January 31, 2009, the Company
had investments of approximately $40.0 million of which $4.0 million had gross
unrealized losses of $1.0 million which had been in a continuous unrealized loss
position for more than twelve months. Of the remaining $36.0 million, $6.9
million of investments had gross unrealized losses of $0.9 million which had
been in a continuous unrealized loss position for less than twelve months. These
unrealized losses on investments were caused primarily by the downturn in the
market values of mortgaged backed securities and in the financial sector during
2008. The Company does not consider these investments to be other than
temporarily impaired at January 31, 2009.

In applying the valuation
principles in SFAS No. 157 to financial assets and liabilities, a three-tier
fair value hierarchy was used to prioritize the inputs used in the valuation
methodologies as follows:

Level
1—Observable inputs that reflect quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets
or liabilities in active markets.


Level
2—Include other inputs that are directly or indirectly observable in the
marketplace.

Level
3—Unobservable inputs which are supported by little or no market activity.

This fair value hierarchy also
requires the Company to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the
use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. Asset-backed, corporate,
U.S. Government and agency, and mortgage-backed securities are classified within
Level 1 or Level 2 because these securities are valued using quoted market
prices or alternative pricing sources and models utilizing market observable
inputs. The Company’s investment in auction rate securities is classified within
Level 3 because these are valued using valuation techniques for which some of
the inputs to these models are unobservable in the market.

Assets measured at fair value on a
recurring basis are summarized below:

The underlying assets in the
Company’s non-qualified deferred compensation program totaling $37.3 million as
of January 31, 2009 (included in Other long term assets) primarily consist of
money market, stable value, stock, and bond funds. The fair value measurement
for funds that are quoted market prices in active markets (Level 1) totaled
$28.7 million as of January 31, 2009. The fair value measurement for funds
without quoted market prices in active markets (Level 2) totaled $8.6 million as
of January 31, 2009. Fair market value for these funds is considered to be the
sum of participant funds invested under the contract plus accrued interest.

Company recognizes expense for ESPP purchase rights equal to the value of the
15% discount given on the purchase date.

At January 31, 2009, the Company
had two stock-based compensation plans, which are further described in Note H.

Note D: Debt

Bank credit
facilities.

The Company has a $600
million revolving credit facility with an expiration date of July 2011 and
interest pricing at LIBOR plus 45 basis points. This facility contains a $300
million sublimit for issuance of standby letters of credit, of which $239.6
million was available at January 31, 2009. Interest is payable upon borrowing
maturity but no less than quarterly. Borrowing under this credit facility is
subject to the Company maintaining certain interest coverage and other financial
ratios. The Company had no borrowings outstanding under this facility as of
January 31, 2009 and was in compliance with the covenants.

Senior Notes.

The Company has a Note Purchase Agreement with various
institutional investors for $150 million of unsecured senior notes. The notes
were issued in two series and funding occurred in December 2006. The Series A
notes, issued for an aggregate of $85 million, are due in December 2018, and
bear interest at a rate of 6.38%. The Series B notes, issued for an aggregate of
$65 million, are due in December 2021, and bear interest at a rate of 6.53%. The
fair value of these notes as of January 31, 2009 of approximately $156 million
is estimated by obtaining comparable market quotes. Borrowings under these notes
are subject to certain covenants including interest coverage and other financial
ratios. As of January 31, 2009, the Company was in compliance with these
covenants.

Letters of credit.

The Company uses standby letters of
credit to collateralize certain obligations related to its self-insured workers’
compensation and general liability programs. The Company had $60.4 million and
$61.1 million in standby letters of credit at January 31, 2009 and February 2,
2008, respectively.

The Company also had $16.7 million
and $20.8 million in trade letters of credit outstanding at January 31, 2009 and
February 2, 2008, respectively.

Note E: Leases

The Company leases all but two of
its store sites with original, non-cancelable terms that in general range from
three to ten years. In addition, the Company leases selected information
technology related equipment under operating leases. Store leases typically
contain provisions for three to four renewal options of five years each. Most
store leases also provide for minimum annual rentals and for payment of certain
expenses. In addition, some store leases also have provisions for additional
rent based on a percentage of sales.

The Company has lease arrangements
for certain equipment in its stores for its point-of-sale (“POS”) hardware and
software systems. These leases are accounted for as operating leases for
financial reporting purposes. The initial terms of these leases are either two
or three years and the Company typically has options to renew the leases for two
to three one-year periods. Alternatively, the Company may purchase or return the
equipment at the end of the initial or each renewal term. The Company’s
obligation under the residual value guarantee at the end of the respective lease
terms is $3.9 million.


The Company also leases a 1.3
million square foot distribution center in Perris, California. The land and
building for this distribution center is being financed under a $70 million
ten-year synthetic lease facility that expires in July 2013. Rent expense on
this distribution center is payable monthly at a fixed annual rate of 5.8% on
the lease balance of $70 million. At the end of the lease term, the Company must
either refinance the distribution facility, purchase it at the amount of the
then-outstanding lease balance, or sell it to a third party. If the distribution
center is sold to a third party for less than $70 million, the Company has
agreed under a residual value guarantee to pay the lessor any shortfall amount
up to $56 million.

In accordance with FIN No. 45,
“Guarantor’s Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including
Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others,” the Company has recognized a
liability and corresponding asset for the fair value of the residual value
guarantee in the amount of $8.3 million for the Perris, California distribution
center and $1.2 million for the POS leases. These residual value guarantees are
being amortized on a straight-line basis over the original terms of the leases.
The current portion of the related asset and liability is recorded in “Prepaid
expenses and other” and “Accrued expenses and other,” respectively, and the
long-term portion of the related assets and liabilities is recorded in “Other
long-term assets” and “Other long-term liabilities,” respectively, in the
accompanying consolidated balance sheets.

In November 2001, the Company
entered into a nine-year lease for a 239,000 square foot warehouse and a
ten-year lease for a 246,000 square foot warehouse in Carlisle, Pennsylvania. In
January 2009, the Company exercised a three-year option for a 253,000 square
foot warehouse in Fort Mill, South Carolina, extending the term to February
2013. In June 2008, the Company purchased a 423,000 square foot warehouse also
in Fort Mill, South Carolina. All four of these properties are used to store the
Company’s packaway inventory. The Company also leases a 10-acre parcel that has
been developed for trailer parking adjacent to its Perris distribution
center.

The synthetic lease facilities
described above, as well as the Company’s revolving credit facility and senior
notes, have covenant restrictions requiring the Company to maintain certain
interest coverage and other financial ratios. In addition, the interest rates
under these agreements may vary depending on the Company’s actual interest
coverage ratios. As of January 31, 2009, the Company was in compliance with
these covenants.

The Company leases approximately
181,000 square feet of office space for its corporate headquarters in
Pleasanton, California, under several facility leases. The lease terms for these
facilities expire between 2010 and 2014 and contain renewal
provisions.

The Company leases approximately
161,000 square feet of office space for its New York buying office and
approximately 15,000 square feet for its Los Angeles buying office. The lease
terms for these facilities expire in 2015 and 2011, respectively. The lease term
for the New York office contains a renewal provision.

Effective February 4, 2007, the
Company adopted the provisions of FIN 48. As a result, the Company established a
$26.3 million reserve for unrecognized tax benefits, inclusive of $6.0 million
of related interest. The reserve is classified as a long-term liability and
included in other long-term liabilities in the Company’s consolidated balance
sheets. Upon adoption of FIN 48, the Company also recognized a reduction in
retained earnings of $7.4 million and certain other deferred income tax assets
and liabilities were reclassified.


The changes in amounts of
unrecognized tax benefits (gross of federal tax benefits and excluding interest)
since adoption of FIN 48 at January 31, 2009 and February 2, 2008 are as

In fiscal 2008 and 2007, the
reserves for unrecognized tax benefits (net of federal tax benefits) were $26.0
million and $23.2 million inclusive of $6.5 million and $5.6 million of related
interest, respectively. The Company adopted a new tax method of accounting which
reduced its reserve during fiscal 2007. The Company accounts for interest and
penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a part of its provision for
taxes on earnings. If recognized, $19.2 million would impact the Company’s
effective tax rate. The difference between the total amount of unrecognized tax
benefits and the amounts that would impact the effective tax rate relates to
amounts attributable to deferred income tax assets and liabilities. These
amounts are net of federal and state income taxes.

During the next twelve months, it
is reasonably possible that the statute of limitations may lapse pertaining to
positions taken by the Company in prior year tax returns. As a result, the total
amount of unrecognized tax benefits may decrease, which would reduce the
provision for taxes on earnings by up to $1.5 million, net of federal tax
benefits.

The Company is generally open to
audit by the Internal Revenue Service under the statute of limitations for
fiscal years 2005 through 2008. The Company’s state income tax returns are
generally open to audit under the various statutes of limitations for fiscal
years 2004 through 2008. Certain state tax returns are currently under audit by
state tax authorities. The Company does not expect the result of these audits to
have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements.

Note G: Employee Benefit Plans

The Company has a defined
contribution plan that is available to certain employees. Under the plan,
employee and Company contributions and accumulated plan earnings qualify for
favorable tax treatment under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code. This
plan permits employees to make contributions up to the maximum limits allowable
under the Internal Revenue Code. The Company matches up to 4% of the employee’s
salary up to the plan limits. Company matching contributions to the 401(k) plan
were $7.3 million, $6.8 million and $6.1 million in fiscal 2008, 2007 and 2006,
respectively.

The Company also has an Incentive
Compensation Plan, which provides cash awards to key management employees based
on Company and individual performance.


The Company also makes available
to management a Non-qualified Deferred Compensation Plan which allows management
to make payroll contributions on a pre-tax basis in addition to the 401(k) plan.
Other long-term assets include $37.3 million and $48.2 million at January 31,
2009 and February 2, 2008, respectively, of long-term investments, at market
value, set aside or designated for the Non-qualified Deferred Compensation Plan.
Plan investments are designated by the participants, and investment returns are
not guaranteed by the Company. The Company has a corresponding liability to
participants of $37.3 million and $48.2 million at January 31, 2009 and February
2, 2008, respectively, included in other long-term liabilities in the
consolidated balance sheets.

In addition, the Company has
certain individuals who receive or will receive post-employment benefits. The
estimated liability for these benefits of $4.3 million and $3.2 million is
included in accrued liabilities and other in the accompanying consolidated
balance sheets as of January 31, 2009 and February 2, 2008,
respectively.

Note H: Stockholders'
Equity

Preferred stock.

The Company has four million shares of preferred
stock authorized, with a par value of $.01 per share. No preferred stock is
issued or outstanding.

Common stock.

In January 2008 the Company’s Board of Directors approved
a two-year stock repurchase program of up to $600 million for fiscal 2008 and
2009.

In November 2005, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized a two-year
stock repurchase program of up to $400 million for fiscal 2006 and 2007. The
following table summarizes the Company’s stock repurchase activity in fiscal
2008, 2007 and 2006:

dividend of $.075 per common share in January, May, August and November 2007,
and a cash dividend of $.06 per common share in January, May, August and
November 2006.

2008 Equity Incentive
Plan.

On May 22, 2008, the Company’s
stockholders approved the adoption of the Ross Stores, Inc. 2008 Equity
Incentive Plan (the “2008 Plan”) with an initial share reserve of 8.3 million
shares of the Company’s common stock, of which 6.0 million shares can be issued
as full value awards. The 2008 Plan replaced the 2004 Equity Incentive Plan (the
“2004 Plan”). The 2008 Plan provides for various types of incentive awards,
which may potentially include the grant of stock options, stock appreciation
rights, restricted stock purchase rights, restricted stock bonuses, restricted
stock units, performance shares, performance units, and deferred compensation
awards.


As of January 31, 2009, there were
5.8 million shares that remained available for grant under the 2008 Plan. A
summary of the stock option activity for fiscal 2008, 2007 and 2006 is presented
below.

The following table summarizes

During fiscal 2008 restricted
stock awards totaling 618,000 were issued and 33,000 shares were forfeited under
the 2008 and 2004 Plans. During fiscal 2007 and 2006, restricted stock awards
totaling 568,000 and 569,000, respectively, were issued under the 2004 Plan, and
43,000 and 149,000 shares were forfeited during each respective year. The market
value of these shares at the date of grant is amortized to expense ratably over
the vesting period of generally three to five years. The unamortized
compensation expense at

January 31, 2009 and
February 2, 2008 was $31.0 million and $29.6 million, respectively. During
fiscal 2008, 2007 and 2006, shares purchased by the Company for tax withholding
totaled 163,000, 125,000 and 133,400 shares, respectively, and are considered
treasury shares which are available for reissuance. As of January 31, 2009 and
February 2, 2008, the Company held 1,128,000 and 965,000 shares of treasury
stock, respectively. As of January 31, 2009 and February 2, 2008, shares of
unvested restricted stock subject to repurchase totaled 1.9 million and 2.0
million shares respectively. A total of 5,840,000, 2,709,000 and 3,278,000
shares were available for new restricted stock awards at the end of fiscal 2008,
2007 and 2006, respectively.

Performance share
awards.

Beginning in fiscal 2007, the
Company initiated a performance share award program for senior executives. A
performance share award represents a right to receive shares of common stock on
a specified settlement date based on the Company’s attainment of a
profitability-based performance goal during a performance period. If attained,
the common stock then granted vests over a specified remaining service period,
generally two years. The Company recognized $1.5 million and $0.6 million of
expense related to performance share awards in fiscal 2008 and 2007,
respectively.

Employee Stock Purchase Plan.

Under the Employee Stock Purchase Plan,
eligible full-time employees participating in the annual offering period can
choose to have up to the lesser of 10% or $21,250 of their annual base earnings
withheld to purchase the Company’s common stock. Starting in 2008, the purchase
price of the stock is 85% of the market price on the date of purchase. In
addition, purchases occur on a calendar quarterly basis (on the last trading day
of each quarter). Prior to 2008, the purchase price of the stock was the lower
of 85% of the market price at the beginning of the offering period, or end of
the offering period. During fiscal 2008, 2007 and 2006, employees purchased
approximately 188,000, 214,000 and 183,000 shares, respectively, of the
Company’s common stock under the plan at weighted average per share prices of
$27.89, $21.73 and $24.86, respectively. Through January 31, 2009, approximately
8,927,000 shares had been issued under this plan and 1,073,000 shares remained
available for future issuance.

Note I: Related Party
Transactions

The Company has an agreement with
its Chairman of the Board of Directors under which the Company pays an annual
consulting fee of $1.1 million in monthly installments through January 2012. In
addition, the agreement provides for administrative support and health and other
benefits for the individual and his dependents which totaled approximately $0.2
million in fiscal 2008, 2007, and 2006, along with amounts to cover premiums
through January 2012 on a life insurance policy with a death benefit of $2
million.

Note J: Litigation, Claims, and
Assessments

Like many California retailers,
the Company has been named in class action lawsuits regarding wage and hour
claims. Class action litigation involving allegations that hourly associates
have missed meal and/or rest break periods, as well as allegations of unpaid
overtime wages to assistant store managers at all Company stores under federal
and state law, remains pending as of January 31, 2009.

The Company is also party to
various other legal proceedings arising in the normal course of business.
Actions filed against the Company include commercial, customer, and labor and
employment-related claims, including lawsuits in which plaintiffs allege that
the Company violated state and/or federal wage and hour and related laws.
Actions against the Company are in various procedural stages. Many of these
proceedings raise factual and legal issues and are subject to
uncertainties.

In the opinion of management,
resolution of the class action litigation and other currently pending legal
proceedings is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company’s
financial condition or results of operations.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT
REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

Board of Directors and
Stockholders

Ross Stores, Inc.

Pleasanton, California

We have audited the accompanying
consolidated balance sheets of Ross Stores, Inc. and subsidiaries (the
"Company") as of January 31, 2009 and February 2, 2008, and the related
consolidated statements of earnings, stockholders' equity, and cash flows for
each of the three years in the period ended January 31, 2009. We also have
audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of January
31, 2009, based on criteria established in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission. The Company's management is responsible for these consolidated
financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial
reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over
financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Annual Report on
Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these consolidated financial statements and an opinion on the
Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in
accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
(United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of
material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial
reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the financial
statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts
and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles
used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial
reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial
reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and
evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on
the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as
we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide
a reasonable basis for our opinions.

A company's internal control over
financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the
company's principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons
performing similar functions, and effected by the company's board of directors,
management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements
for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those
policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in
reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and
dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that
transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that
receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with
authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a
material effect on the financial statements.

Because of the inherent
limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the
possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material
misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely
basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal
control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that
the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the
degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.


In our opinion, the consolidated
financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects,
the financial position of Ross Stores, Inc. and subsidiaries as of January 31,
2009 and February 2, 2008, and the results of their operations and their cash
flows for each of the three years in the period ended January 31, 2009, in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America. Also, in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects,
effective internal control over financial reporting as of January 31, 2009,
based on the criteria established in

Internal Control — Integrated
Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
Treadway Commission.

As discussed in Note F to the
consolidated financial statements, the Company adopted Financial Accounting
Standards Board Interpretation No. 48,

Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes — an interpretation of FASB
Statement No.109

, effective February 4,
2007.

ITEM 9A.     CONTROLS AND
PROCEDURES.

Disclosure Controls and
Procedures

Our management, with the
participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer,
conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our “disclosure controls and
procedures” (as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(e)) as of the end of the
period covered by this report. Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive
Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and
procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by this
report.

It should be noted that any system
of controls, however well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable,
and not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the system will be met. In
addition, the design of any control system is based in part upon certain
assumptions about the likelihood of future events.

Management’s Annual Report on
Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

Our management is responsible for
establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting,
as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f). Our internal control over financial
reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability
of financial reporting and the preparation of consolidated financial statements
for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles.

Under the supervision and with the
participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief
Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our
internal control over financial reporting based on the framework established by
the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) as
set forth in

Internal Control —
Integrated Framework

. Based on our
evaluation under the framework in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework

, our management concluded that our internal control over financial
reporting was effective as of January 31, 2009.

Our internal control over
financial reporting as of January 31, 2009 has also been audited by Deloitte
& Touche LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, and their
opinion as to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting
is stated in their report, dated March 26, 2009, which is included in Item 8 in
this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Because of its inherent
limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect
misstatements. It should be noted that any system of controls, however well
designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, and not absolute, assurance
that the objectives of the system will be met. In addition, the design of any
control system is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of
future events. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of
changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or
procedures may deteriorate.

Quarterly Evaluation of Changes
in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

Our management, with the
participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, also
conducted an evaluation of our internal control over financial reporting to
determine whether any change occurred during the fourth fiscal quarter of 2008
that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our
internal control over financial reporting. Based on that evaluation, our
management concluded that there was no such change during the fourth fiscal
quarter.
