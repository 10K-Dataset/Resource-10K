CONTENTS



PART I

Item 1. BUSINESS

(Dollar amounts in millions, except for per share data, unless otherwise stated)

General

The Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc. (together with its subsidiaries, “The Hartford” or the
“Company”) is a diversified insurance and financial services company. The Hartford, headquartered
in Connecticut, is among the largest providers of investment products, individual life, group life
and group disability insurance products, and property and casualty insurance products in the United
States. Hartford Fire Insurance Company, founded in 1810, is the oldest of The Hartford’s
subsidiaries. The Hartford writes insurance in the United States and internationally. At December
31, 2005, total assets and total stockholders’ equity of The Hartford were $285.6 billion and $15.3
billion, respectively.

Organization

The Hartford strives to maintain and enhance its position as a market leader within the financial
services industry and to maximize shareholder value. The Company pursues a strategy of developing
and selling diverse and innovative products through multiple distribution channels, continuously
developing and expanding those distribution channels, achieving cost efficiencies through economies
of scale and improved technology, maintaining effective risk management and prudent underwriting
techniques and capitalizing on its brand name and customer recognition of The Hartford Stag Logo,
one of the most recognized symbols in the financial services industry.

As a holding company that is separate and distinct from its subsidiaries, The Hartford Financial
Services Group, Inc. has no significant business operations of its own. Therefore, it relies on
the dividends from its insurance companies and other subsidiaries as the principal source of cash
flow to meet its obligations. Additional information regarding the cash flow and liquidity needs
of The Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc. may be found in the Capital Resources and Liquidity
section of Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations (“MD&A”).

The Company maintains a retail mutual fund operation, whereby the Company, through wholly-owned
subsidiaries, provides investment management and administrative services to The Hartford Mutual
Funds, Inc. and The Hartford Mutual Funds II, Inc. (“The Hartford mutual funds”) families of 48
mutual funds and 1 closed end fund. Investors can purchase “shares” in The Hartford mutual funds,
all of which are registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission in accordance with the
Investment Company Act of 1940. The Hartford mutual funds are owned by the shareholders of those
funds and not by the Company.

Reporting Segments

The Hartford is organized into two major operations: Life and Property & Casualty, each containing
reporting segments. In the quarter ended December 31, 2005, and as more fully described below, the
Company changed its reporting segments to reflect the current manner by which its chief operating
decision maker views and manages the business. All segment data for prior reporting periods have
been adjusted to reflect the current segment reporting. Within the Life and Property & Casualty
operations, The Hartford conducts business principally in ten operating segments. Additionally,
Corporate primarily includes all of the Company’s debt financing and related interest expense, as
well as certain capital raising activities and purchase accounting adjustments.

Life has realigned its reportable operating segments during 2005 to include six reportable
operating segments: Retail Products Group (“Retail”), Retirement Plans, Institutional Solutions
Group (“Institutional”), Individual Life, Group Benefits and International.

Retail offers individual variable and fixed market value adjusted (“MVA”) annuities, retail mutual
funds, 529 college savings plans, Canadian and offshore investment products.

Retirement Plans provides products and services to corporations pursuant to Section 401(k),
previously included in Retail, and products and services to municipalities and not-for-profit
organizations under Section 457 and 403(b), previously included in Institutional.

Institutional offers institutional liability products, including stable value products, structured
settlements and institutional annuities (primarily terminal funding cases), as well as variable
Private Placement Life Insurance (“PPLI”) owned by corporations and high net worth individuals.

Until the passage of Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”), Life
sold two principal types of PPLI: leveraged PPLI and variable products. Leveraged PPLI is a fixed
premium life insurance policy owned by a company or a trust sponsored by a company. HIPAA phased
out the deductibility of interest on policy loans under leveraged PPLI at the end of 1998, which
resulted in the virtual elimination of all sales of leveraged PPLI. In the fourth quarter of 2005,
the Company began classifying leveraged PPLI as a run-off block of business and, as a result, the
financial results of this business, previously included in Institutional, are now included in
Other.



Individual Life sells a variety of life insurance products, including variable universal life,
universal life, interest sensitive whole life and term life.

Group
Benefits provides employers, associations, affinity groups and
financial institutions with group life, accident and disability
coverage, along with other products and services, including voluntary benefits, group retiree
health, and medical stop loss.

International,
which primarily has operations located in Japan, Brazil, Ireland and the United Kingdom,
provides investments, retirement savings and other insurance and savings products to individuals
and groups outside the United States and Canada.

Life includes in an Other category its leveraged PPLI product line of business; corporate items not
directly allocated to any of its reportable operating segments; net realized capital gains and
losses on fixed maturity sales generated from movements in interest rates, less amortization of
those gains or losses back to the reportable segments; net realized capital gains and losses
generated from credit related events, less a credit risk fee charged to the reportable segments;
net realized capital gains and losses from non-qualifying derivative strategies (including embedded
derivatives) other than the net periodic coupon settlements on credit derivatives and the net
periodic coupon settlements on the cross currency swap used to economically hedge currency and
interest rate risk generated from sales of the Company’s yen based fixed annuity, which are
allocated to the reportable segments; the mark-to-market adjustment for the equity securities held
for trading reported in net investment income and the related change in interest credited reported
as a component of benefits, claims and claim adjustment expenses since these items are not
considered by the Company’s chief operating decision maker in evaluating the International results
of operations; and intersegment eliminations.

Property & Casualty is organized into four reportable operating segments: the underwriting segments
of Business Insurance, Personal Lines, and Specialty Commercial (collectively “Ongoing
Operations”); and the Other Operations segment.

Business Insurance provides standard commercial insurance coverage to small commercial and middle
market commercial businesses primarily throughout the United States. This segment offers workers’
compensation, property, automobile, liability, umbrella and marine coverages. Commercial risk
management products and services are also provided.

Personal Lines provides automobile, homeowners’ and home-based business coverages to the members of
AARP through a direct marketing operation; to individuals who prefer local agent involvement
through a network of independent agents in the standard personal lines market; and through the Omni
Insurance Group in the non-standard automobile market. Personal Lines also operates a member
contact center for health insurance products offered through AARP’s Health Care Options.

The Specialty Commercial segment offers a variety of customized insurance products and risk
management services. Specialty Commercial provides standard commercial insurance products
including workers’ compensation, automobile and liability coverages to large-sized companies.
Specialty Commercial also provides bond, professional liability, specialty casualty and livestock
coverages, as well as core property and excess and surplus lines coverages not normally written by
standard lines insurers. Alternative markets, within Specialty Commercial, provides insurance
products and services primarily to captive insurance companies, pools and self-insurance groups.
In addition, Specialty Commercial provides third party administrator services for claims
administration, integrated benefits, loss control and performance measurement through Specialty
Risk Services, a subsidiary of the Company.

The Other Operations segment consists of certain property and casualty insurance operations of The
Hartford which have discontinued writing new business and includes substantially all of the
Company’s asbestos and environmental exposures.

The measure of profit or loss used by The Hartford’s management in evaluating the performance of
its Life segments is net income. Likewise, within Property & Casualty, net income is the measure
of profit or loss used in evaluating the performance of Ongoing Operations and the Other Operations
segment. Within Ongoing Operations, the underwriting segments of Business Insurance, Personal
Lines and Specialty Commercial are evaluated by The Hartford’s management primarily based upon
underwriting results. Underwriting results represent premiums earned less incurred claims, claim
adjustment expenses and underwriting expenses. The sum of underwriting results, other revenues,
net investment income, net realized capital gains and losses, other expenses, and related income
taxes is net income (loss).

Life

Life’s business is conducted by Hartford Life, Inc. (“Hartford Life” or “Life”), an indirect
subsidiary of The Hartford, headquartered in Simsbury, Connecticut, a leading financial services
and insurance organization. Hartford Life provides (i) retail and institutional investment
products, including variable annuities, fixed market value adjusted (“MVA”) annuities, mutual
funds, private placement life insurance, which includes life insurance products purchased by a
company on the lives of its employees, and retirement plan services for the savings and retirement
needs of over 5.0 million customers, (ii) life insurance for wealth protection, accumulation and
transfer needs for approximately 746,000 customers, (iii) group benefits products such as group
life and group disability insurance for the benefit of millions of individuals, and (iv) fixed and
variable annuity products through its international operations for the savings and retirement needs
of over 360,000 customers. Life is one of the largest sellers of individual variable annuities,
variable universal life insurance and group disability insurance in the United States. Life’s
strong position in each of its core businesses provides an opportunity to increase the sale of
Life’s products and services as individuals increasingly save and plan for retirement, protect
themselves and their families against the financial uncertainties associated with disability or
death and engage in estate planning.



Hartford Life is among the largest consolidated life insurance groups in the United States based on
statutory assets as of December 31, 2005. In the past year, Life’s total assets under management,
which include $32.7 billion of third party assets invested in Life’s mutual funds and 529 College
Savings Plans, increased 11% to $276.5 billion at December 31, 2005 from $248.5 billion at December
31, 2004. Life generated revenues of $15.0 billion, $11.4 billion and $8.0 billion in 2005, 2004
and 2003, respectively. Additionally, Life generated net income of
$1.2 billion, $1.4 billion and
$845 in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.

Customer Service, Technology and Economies of Scale

Life maintains advantageous economies of scale and operating efficiencies due to its growth,
attention to expense and claims management and commitment to customer service and technology.
These advantages allow Life to competitively price its products for its distribution network and
policyholders. In addition, Life utilizes computer technology to enhance communications within
Life and throughout its distribution network in order to improve Life’s efficiency in marketing,
selling and servicing its products and, as a result, provides high-quality customer service .
In recognition of excellence in customer service for individual annuities, Hartford Life was
awarded the 2005 Annuity Service Award by DALBAR Inc., a recognized independent financial services
research organization, for the tenth consecutive year. Hartford Life is the only company to
receive this prestigious award in every year of the award’s existence. Also, in 2005 Life earned
its third DALBAR Award for Mutual Fund and Retirement Plan Service which recognizes Hartford Life
as the No. 1 service provider of mutual funds and retirement plans in the industry. Continuing the
trend of service excellence, Life’s Individual Life segment won its fifth consecutive DALBAR award
for service of life insurance customers. Additionally, Life’s Individual Life segment also won its
fourth consecutive DALBAR Financial Intermediary Service Award in 2005.

Risk Management

Life’s product designs, prudent underwriting standards and risk management techniques are
structured to protect it against disintermediation risk, greater than expected mortality and
morbidity experience and, for certain product features, specifically the guaranteed minimum death
benefit (“GMDB”), guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefit (“GMWB”) and guaranteed minimum income
benefit (“GMIB”) offered with variable annuity products, equity market volatility. As of December
31, 2005, Life had limited exposure to disintermediation risk on approximately 98% of its domestic
life insurance and annuity liabilities through the use of non-guaranteed separate accounts, MVA
features, policy loans, surrender charges and non-surrenderability provisions. Life effectively
utilizes prudent underwriting to select and price insurance risks and regularly monitors mortality
and morbidity assumptions to determine if experience remains consistent with these assumptions and
to ensure that its product pricing remains appropriate. Life also enforces disciplined claims
management to protect itself against greater than expected morbidity experience. Life uses
reinsurance structures and has modified benefit features to mitigate the mortality exposure
associated with GMDB. Life also uses reinsurance and derivative instruments to attempt to minimize
the volatility associated with the GMWB and GMIB liability.

Retail

The Retail segment focuses, through the sale of individual variable and fixed annuities, mutual
funds and other investment products, on the savings and retirement needs of the growing number of
individuals who are preparing for retirement or who have already retired. This segment’s assets
under management grew to $145.9 billion at December 31, 2005 from $137.1 billion at December 31,
2004 and from $118.4 billion at December 31, 2003. Retail generated revenues of $3.2 billion, $3.0
billion and $2.1 billion in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively, of which individual annuities
accounted for $2.7 billion, $2.6 billion and $1.8 billion for 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.
Net income in Retail was $622, $503 and $412 in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.

Life sells both variable and fixed individual annuity products through a wide distribution network
of national and regional broker-dealer organizations, banks and other financial institutions and
independent financial advisors. Life is a market leader in the annuity industry with sales of
$11.5 billion, $15.7 billion and $16.5 billion in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Life was
among the largest sellers of individual retail variable annuities in the United States with sales
of $11.2 billion, $15.0 billion and $15.7 billion in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. In
addition, Life continues to be the largest seller of individual retail variable annuities through
banks in the United States.

Life’s total account value related to individual annuity products was $115.5 billion as of December
31, 2005. Of this total account value, $105.3 billion, or 91%, related to individual variable
annuity products and $10.2 billion, or 9%, related primarily to fixed MVA annuity products. As of
December 31, 2004, Life’s total account value related to individual annuity products was $111.0
billion. Of this total account value, $99.6 billion, or 90%, related to individual variable
annuity products and $11.4 billion, or 10%, related primarily to fixed MVA annuity products. As of
December 31, 2003, Life’s total account value related to individual annuity products was $97.7
billion. Of this total account value, $86.5 billion, or 89%, related to individual variable
annuity products and $11.2 billion, or 11%, related primarily to fixed MVA annuity products.

Life continues to emerge as a significant participant in the mutual fund business. Retail mutual
fund assets were $29.1 billion, $25.2 billion and $20.3 billion as of December 31, 2005, 2004 and
2003, respectively.

Principal Products

Individual Variable Annuities

— Life earns fees, based on policyholders’ account values, for
managing variable annuity assets, providing various death benefits and principal guarantees, and
maintaining policyholder accounts. Life uses specified portions of the periodic deposits paid by a
customer to purchase units in one or more mutual funds as directed by the customer, who then
assumes the



investment performance risks and rewards. As a result, variable annuities permit policyholders to
choose aggressive or conservative investment strategies, as they deem appropriate, without
affecting the composition and quality of assets in Life’s general account. These products offer
the policyholder a variety of equity and fixed income options, as well as the ability to earn a
guaranteed rate of interest in the general account of Life. Life offers an enhanced guaranteed
rate of interest for a specified period of time (no longer than twelve months) if the policyholder
elects to dollar-cost average funds from Life’s general account into one or more non-guaranteed
separate accounts. Additionally, Retail sells variable annuity contracts that offer various
guaranteed minimum death and withdrawal benefits.

Policyholders may make deposits of varying amounts at regular or irregular intervals and the value
of these assets fluctuates in accordance with the investment performance of the funds selected by
the policyholder. To encourage persistency, many of Life’s individual variable annuities are
subject to withdrawal restrictions and surrender charges. Surrender charges range up to 8% of the
contract’s deposits less withdrawals, and reduce to zero on a sliding scale, usually within seven
years from the deposit date. Individual variable annuity account values of $105.3 billion as of
December 31, 2005, have grown from $99.6 billion as of December 31, 2004, primarily due to equity
market appreciation. Approximately 85% and 83% of the individual variable annuity account values
were held in non-guaranteed separate accounts as of December 31,
2005 and 2004, respectively.

The assets underlying Life’s variable annuities are managed both internally and by independent
money managers, while Life provides all policy administration services. Life utilizes a select
group of money managers all of which are among the nation’s most
successful investment managers. Furthermore, each money manager has an interest in the continued growth in sales of Life’s products and enhance the marketability of
Life’s annuities and the strength of its product offerings. Hartford Leaders, which is a
multi-manager variable annuity that combines the product manufacturing, wholesaling and service
capabilities of Life with the investment management expertise of American Funds, Franklin Templeton Group, AIM
Investments and MFS Investment Management, has emerged as an industry leader in terms of retail
sales. In 2005, the Director M variable annuity was introduced to combine the product
manufacturing, wholesaling and service capabilities of Life with the investment management
expertise of Wellington Management Company, LLP
(“Wellington”) and Hartford Investment Management Company
(“HIMCO”), the two money managers for the former Director product, as well
as an additional six investment firms: AllianceBernstein, Fidelity Investments, Lord Abbett,
Oppenheimer Funds, Putnam and Van Kampen.

Fixed MVA Annuities

— Fixed MVA annuities are fixed rate annuity contracts which guarantee a
specific sum of money to be paid in the future, either as a lump sum or as monthly income. In the
event that a policyholder surrenders a policy prior to the end of the guarantee period, the MVA
feature increases or decreases the cash surrender value of the annuity in respect of any interest
rate decreases or increases, respectively, thereby protecting Life from losses due to higher
interest rates at the time of surrender. The amount of payment will not fluctuate due to adverse
changes in Life’s investment return, mortality experience or expenses. Life’s primary fixed MVA
annuities have terms varying from one to ten years with an average term to maturity of
approximately four years. Account values of fixed MVA annuities were $10.2 billion and $11.4
billion as of December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively.

Mutual Funds

—

Life launched a family of retail mutual funds for which Life provides investment
management and administrative services. The fund family has grown significantly from 8 funds at
inception to the current offering of 48 mutual funds and 1 closed end fund, including the addition
of the Hartford Floating Rate Fund introduced in 2005. Life’s funds are managed by Wellington and
HIMCO. Life has entered into agreements with over 1,060 financial
services firms to distribute these mutual funds.

Life charges fees to the shareholders of the mutual funds, which are recorded as revenue by Life.
Investors can purchase shares in the mutual funds, all of which are registered with the Securities
and Exchange Commission, in accordance with the Investment Company Act of 1940. The mutual funds
are owned by the shareholders of those funds and not by Life. As such, the mutual fund assets and
liabilities, as well as related investment returns, are not reflected in The Hartford’s
consolidated financial statements. Total retail mutual fund assets under management were $29.1
billion and $25.2 billion as of December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively.

Marketing and Distribution

Life’s distribution network is based on management’s strategy of utilizing multiple and competing
distribution channels to achieve the broadest distribution to reach target customers. The success
of Life’s marketing and distribution system depends on its product offerings, fund performance,
successful utilization of wholesaling organizations, quality of customer service, and relationships
with national and regional broker-dealer firms, banks and other financial institutions, and
independent financial advisors (through which the sale of Life’s retail investment products to
customers is consummated).

Life maintains a distribution network of approximately 1,500 broker-dealers and approximately 500
banks. As of December 31, 2005, Life was selling products through the 25 largest retail banks in
the United States. Life periodically negotiates provisions and terms of its relationships with
unaffiliated parties, and there can be no assurance that such terms will remain acceptable to Life
or such third parties. Life’s primary wholesaler of its individual annuities is PLANCO Financial
Services, LLC. and its affiliate, PLANCO, LLC (collectively “PLANCO”) wholly owned subsidiaries of
Hartford Life and Accident Insurance Company (“HLA”). PLANCO is one of the nation’s largest
wholesalers of individual annuities and has played a significant role in The Hartford’s growth over
the past decade. As a wholesaler, PLANCO distributes Life’s fixed and variable annuities, mutual
funds, 529 plans and offshore products by providing sales support to registered representatives,
financial planners and broker-dealers at brokerage firms and banks across the United States.
Owning PLANCO secures an important distribution channel for Life and gives Life a wholesale
distribution platform



which it can expand in terms of both the number of individuals wholesaling its products and the
portfolio of products which they wholesale.

Competition

Retail competes with numerous other insurance companies as well as certain banks, securities
brokerage firms, independent financial advisors and other financial intermediaries marketing
annuities, mutual funds and other retirement-oriented products. Product sales are affected by
competitive factors such as investment performance ratings, product design, visibility in the
marketplace, financial strength ratings, distribution capabilities, levels of charges and credited
rates, reputation and customer service.

Retirement Plans

Life is among the top providers of retirement products and services, including asset management and
plan administration sold to municipalities and not-for-profit organizations pursuant to Section 457
and 403(b) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (referred to as “Section 457” and
“403(b)”, respectively). Life is also among the top providers of retirement products and services,
including asset management and plan administration sold to small- and medium-size corporations
pursuant to Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (referred to as
“401(k)”).

Life’s total account values related to retirement plans were $19.3 billion, $16.5 billion and $13.6
billion as of December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Governmental account values were
$10.5 billion, $10.0 billion and $9.0 billion as of December 31, 2005, and 2004 and 2003,
respectively. 401(k) products account values were $8.8 billion, $6.5 billion and $4.6 billion as
of December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Retirement Plans generated revenues of $470,
$434 and $380 for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively and net income of
$75, $66 and $42 in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.

Principal Products

Governmental

— Life sells retirement plan products and services to municipalities under Section 457
plans. Life offers a number of different investment products, including variable annuities and
fixed products, to the employees in Section 457 plans. Generally, with the variable products, Life
manages the fixed income funds and certain other outside money managers act as advisors to the
equity funds offered in Section 457 plans administered by Life. As of December 31, 2005, Life
administered over 3,600 plans under Sections 457 and 403(b).

401(k)

- Life sells retirement plan products and services to corporations under 401(k) plans
targeting the small and medium case markets. Life believes these markets are under-penetrated in
comparison to the large case market. As of December 31, 2005, Life administered over 10,300 401(k)
plans. Total assets under management were $9.8 billion, $7.3 billion and $5.2 billion as of
December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.

Institutional Mutual Funds

— Life sells its institutional shares of The Hartford Mutual Funds
(Class Y shares), the Hartford HLS Funds and the Hartford HLS Series II Funds, to qualified
retirement plans (i.e., section 401(k) and 457 plans) on an “investment only” basis. That means
that the funds are sold individually, with no recordkeeping services included and not as a part of
any bundled retirement program. The Hartford’s wholly-owned subsidiary, HL Investment Advisors,
LLC, serves as the investment advisor to these funds and contracts with sub-advisors to perform the
day-to-day management of the funds. The two primary sub-advisors to the Hartford HLS Funds are
Wellington, of Boston, Massachusetts for most of the equity funds and HIMCO for the fixed income funds.

Marketing and Distribution

In the Section 457 market, Retirement Plan’s distribution network uses internal personnel with
extensive experience to sell its products and services in the retirement plan and institutional
markets. The success of Life’s marketing and distribution system depends on its product offerings,
fund performance, successful utilization of wholesaling organizations, quality of customer service,
and relationships with national and regional broker-dealer firms, banks and other financial
institutions.

In the 401(k) market, Retirement Plan’s primary wholesaler of its plans is PLANCO. As a wholesaler,
PLANCO distributes Life’s 401(k) plans by providing sales support to registered representatives,
financial planners and broker-dealers at brokerage firms and banks across the United States. In
addition, Life uses internal personnel with extensive experience in the 401(k) market to sell its
products and services in the retirement plan market.

Competition

Retirement Plans competes with numerous other insurance companies as well as certain banks,
securities brokerage firms, independent financial advisors and other financial intermediaries
marketing annuities, mutual funds and other retirement-oriented products. Product sales are
affected by competitive factors such as investment performance ratings, product design, visibility
in the marketplace, financial strength ratings, distribution capabilities, levels of charges and
credited rates, reputation and customer service.



For the Section 457 and 403(b) as well as the 401(k) markets, which offer mutual funds wrapped in a
variable annuity or mutual fund retirement program (government markets) – the variety of available
funds and their performance is most important to plan sponsors. The competitors tend to be the
major mutual fund companies.

Institutional

Life provides structured settlement contracts, institutional annuities, institutional mutual funds
and stable value investment products such as funding agreements and guaranteed investment contracts
(“GICs”). Additionally, Life is a leader in the variable PPLI market, which includes life
insurance policies purchased by a company or a trust on the lives of employees, with Life or a
trust sponsored by Life named as the beneficiary under the policy.

Life has recently introduced two products for the high net worth markets. One is a specialized life
insurance contract for ultra-wealthy, high net worth investors, the other is a hedge fund designed
to leverage the strengths of The Hartford’s award-winning customer service and distribution
capability.

Life’s total account values related to institutional investment products were $17.9 billion, $14.6
billion and $12.7 billion as of December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Variable PPLI
products account values were $23.8 billion, $22.5 billion and $21.0 billion as of December 31,
2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Institutional generated revenues of $1.4 billion, $1.3 billion
and $1.5 billion for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively and net income
of $88, $68 and $32 in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.

Principal Products

Institutional Investment Products

— Life sells the following institutional investment products:
structured settlements, institutional mutual funds, GICs and other short-term funding agreements,
and other annuity contracts for special purposes such as funding of terminated defined benefit
pension plans (institutional annuities arrangements).

Structured Settlements

— Structured settlement annuity contracts provide for periodic payments to
an injured person or survivor, typically in settlement of a claim under a liability policy in lieu
of a lump sum settlement. Contracts pay either life contingent or period certain benefits, which
is at the discretion of the contract holder.

Institutional Mutual Funds

— Life sells institutional shares of The Hartford Mutual Funds (Class Y
shares) to both qualified (i.e., section 401(k) and 457 plans) and non-qualified (i.e., endowments
and foundations) institutional investors on an “investment only” basis. Life also sells its
Hartford HLS Funds and the Hartford HLS Series II Funds, to qualified retirement plans on an
“investment only” basis. That means that the funds are sold individually, with no recordkeeping
services included and not as a part of any bundled retirement program. The Hartford’s wholly-owned
subsidiary, HL Investment Advisors, LLC, serves as the investment advisor to these funds and
contracts with sub-advisors to perform the day-to-day management of the funds. The two primary
sub-advisors to the Hartford HLS Funds are Wellington, of Boston,
Massachusetts for most of the equity funds and HIMCO for the fixed income
funds.

Stable Value Products

— GICs are group annuity contracts issued to sponsors of qualified pension or
profit-sharing plans or stable value pooled fund managers. Under these contracts, the client
deposits a lump sum with The Hartford for a specified period of time for a guaranteed interest
rate. At the end of the specified period, the client receives principal plus interest earned.
Funding agreements are investment contracts that perform a similar function for non-qualified
assets. The Company issues fixed rate funding agreements to Hartford Life Global Funding trusts,
that, in turn, issue registered notes to institutional and retail investors.

Institutional Annuities

— Institutional annuities arrangements are group annuity contracts used to
fund pension liabilities that exist when a qualified retirement plan sponsor decides to terminate
an existing defined benefit pension plan. Group annuity contracts are very long-term in nature,
since they must pay the pension liabilities typically on a monthly basis to all participants
covered under the pension plan which is being terminated.

Variable PPLI Products

— PPVLI products continue to be used by employers to fund non-qualified
benefits or other post-employment benefit liabilities. A key advantage to plan sponsors is the
opportunity to select from a range of tax deferred investment allocations. Recent clarifications
in regulatory policy have made PPVLI products particularly attractive to banks with postretirement
medical obligations. PPVLI has also been widely used in the high net worth marketplace due to its
low costs, range of investment choices and ability to accommodate a fund of funds management style.
This institutionally priced hedge fund product is aimed at the rapidly growing market composed of
affluent investors unwilling to participate in hedge funds directly due to minimum investment
thresholds.

Marketing and Distribution

In the structured settlement market, the Institutional segment sells individual fixed immediate
annuity products through a small number of specialty brokerage firms that work closely with The
Hartford’s Property & Casualty operations. Life also works directly with the brokerage firms on
cases that do not involve The Hartford’s Property & Casualty operations.



In the institutional mutual fund market, the Institutional segment typically sells its products
through investment consulting firms employed by retirement plan sponsors. Institutional’s products
are also sold through 401(k) record keeping firms that offer a “platform” of mutual funds to their
plan sponsor clients. A third sales channel is direct sales to qualified plan sponsors, using
registered representatives employed by Hartford Equity Sales Company, Inc.

In the stable value marketplace, the Institutional segment sells GICs, funding agreements, and
investor notes to retirement plan sponsors either through investment management firms or directly,
using Hartford employees.

In the institutional annuities market, Life sells its group annuity products to retirement plan
sponsors through three different channels (1) a small number of specialty brokers, (2) large
benefits consulting firms and (3) directly, using Hartford employees.

In the PPVLI market, specialized strategic alliance partners with expertise in the large case
market assist in the placement of many cases. High net worth PPVLI is often placed with the
assistance of investment banking and wealth management specialists.

The hedge fund of funds product is positioned to be sold through family offices, wealth management
platforms and other specialists in the mass-affluent market.

Competition

The Institutional segment competes with numerous other insurance companies as well as certain
banks, securities brokerage firms, independent financial advisors and other financial
intermediaries marketing annuities, mutual funds and other retirement-oriented products. Product
sales are affected by competitive factors such as investment performance ratings, product design,
visibility in the marketplace, financial strength ratings, distribution capabilities, levels of
charges and credited rates, reputation and customer service.

For institutional product lines offering fixed annuity products (i.e., institutional annuities,
structured settlements and stable value), financial strength, stability and credit ratings are key
buying factors. As a result, the competitors in those marketplaces tend to be other large,
long-established insurance companies.

For product lines offering mutual funds – either unbundled (institutional mutual funds) or wrapped
in a variable annuity or mutual fund retirement program (government markets) – the variety of
available funds and their performance is most important to plan sponsors. The competitors tend to
be the major mutual fund companies.

For PPVLI, competition in the large case market comes from other insurance carriers and from
specialized agents with expertise in the benefit funding marketplace. For high net worth programs,
the competition is often from other investment banking firms allied with other insurance carriers.

The hedge fund of funds product competes against a range of similar products from respected
vendors, including investment banking firms and wire houses. It is distributed by former members
of the PLANCO team which assisted in The Hartford’s successful annuity business.

Individual Life

The Individual Life segment provides life insurance solutions to a wide array of partners to solve
the wealth protection, accumulation and transfer needs of its affluent, emerging affluent and
business insurance clients. As of December 31, 2005, life insurance in force increased 8% to
$150.8 billion, from $139.9 billion and $130.8 billion as of December 31, 2004 and 2003,
respectively. Account values increased 9% to $10.3 billion as of December 31, 2005 from $9.5
billion and $8.7 billion as of December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Revenues were $1,079,
$1,056 and $983 for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Net income in
Individual Life was $166, $155 and $145 for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003,
respectively.

Principal Products

Life holds a significant market share in the variable universal life product market and is a
leading seller of variable universal life insurance according to the Tillinghast VALUE Survey.
Sales in the Individual Life segment were $250, $233 and $196 for the years ended December 31,
2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.

Variable Universal Life

— Variable universal life provides life insurance with a return linked to
underlying investment portfolios as policyholders are allowed to invest premium dollars among a
variety of underlying mutual funds. As the return on the investment portfolios increase or
decrease, the surrender value of the variable universal life policy will increase or decrease, and,
under certain policyholder options or market conditions, the death benefit may also increase or
decrease. Life’s second-to-die products are distinguished from other products in that two lives
are insured rather than one, and the policy proceeds are paid upon the deaths of both insureds.
Second-to-die policies are frequently used in estate planning for a married couple as the policy
proceeds are paid out at the time an estate tax liability is incurred. Variable universal life
account values were $5.9 billion, $5.4 billion and $4.7 billion as of December 31, 2005, 2004 and
2003, respectively.

Universal Life and Interest Sensitive Whole Life

— Universal life and interest sensitive whole life
insurance coverages provide life insurance with adjustable rates of return based on current
interest rates. Universal life provides policyholders with flexibility in the timing and amount of
premium payments and the amount of the death benefit, provided there are sufficient policy funds to
cover all policy charges for the coming period, unless guaranteed no-lapse coverage is in effect.
At December 31, 2005 and 2004, guaranteed



no-lapse universal life represented approximately 4% and 2% of life insurance in-force,
respectively. Life also sells second-to-die universal life insurance policies. Universal life and
interest sensitive whole life account values were $3.7 billion, $3.4 billion and $3.3 billion as of
December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.

Marketing and Distribution

Consistent with Life’s strategy to access multiple distribution outlets, the Individual Life
distribution organization has been developed to penetrate multiple retail sales channels. Life
sells both variable and fixed individual life products through a wide distribution network of
national and regional broker-dealer organizations, banks and independent financial advisors. Life
is a market leader in selling individual life insurance through national stockbroker and financial
institutions channels. In addition, Life distributes individual life products through independent
life and property-casualty agents and Woodbury Financial Services, a subsidiary retail
broker-dealer. To wholesale Life’s products, Life has a group of highly qualified life insurance
professionals with specialized training in sophisticated life insurance sales. These individuals
are generally employees of Life who are managed through a regional sales office system.

Competition

Individual Life competes with approximately 1,200 life insurance companies in the United States, as
well as other financial intermediaries marketing insurance products. Competitive factors related
to this segment are primarily the breadth and quality of life insurance products offered, pricing,
relationships with third-party distributors, effectiveness of wholesaling support, pricing and
availability of reinsurance, and the quality of underwriting and customer service.

Group Benefits

The Group Benefits segment provides employers, associations, affinity groups and financial
institutions with group life, accident and disability coverage, along with other products and
services, including voluntary benefits, group retiree health, and medical stop loss. The Group
Benefits segment ranks number two in fully-insured group disability premium and number six in
fully-insured life premium of U.S. group carriers (according to LIMRA data as of June 30, 2005).
The Company also offers disability underwriting, administration, claims processing services and
reinsurance to other insurers and self-funded employer plans. Generally, policies sold in this
segment are term insurance. This allows the Company to adjust the rates or terms of its policies
in order to minimize the adverse effect of various market trends, including declining interest
rates and other factors. Typically policies are sold with one-, two- or three-year rate guarantees
depending upon the product. In the disability market, the Company focuses on its risk management
expertise and on efficiencies and economies of scale to derive a competitive advantage. Group
Benefits generated fully insured ongoing premiums of $3.7 billion, $3.6 billion and $2.3 billion
for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively, of which group disability
insurance accounted for $1.7 billion, $1.6 billion and $1.0 billion in 2005, 2004 and 2003,
respectively, and group life insurance accounted for $1.6 billion, $1.7 billion and $1.0 billion
for the year ended December 31, 2005, 2004, and 2003, respectively. The Company held group
disability reserves of $4.4 billion, $4.2 billion and $4.0 billion and group life reserves of $1.3
billion, $1.2 billion and $1.3 billion, as of December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Net
income in Group Benefits was $272, $229 and $148 for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and
2003, respectively.

Principal Products

Group Disability

— Life is one of the largest carriers in the “large case” market of the group
disability insurance business. The large case market, as defined by Life, generally consists of
group disability policies covering over 5,000 employees in a particular company. Life is
continuing its focus on the “small case” and “medium case” group markets, as well as associations
and affinity groups, emphasizing name recognition and reputation, financial strength and stability
and Life’s functional approach to claims management. Life also offers voluntary, or employee-paid,
short-term and long-term disability group benefits. Life’s efforts in the group disability market
focus on early intervention, return-to-work programs and successful rehabilitation, offering the
support to help claimants return to an active, productive life after a disability. Life also works
with disability claimants to improve their approval rate for Social Security Assistance (i.e.,
reducing payment of benefits by the amount of Social Security payments received).

Life’s short-term disability benefit plans provide a weekly benefit amount (typically 60% to 70% of
the insured’s earned income up to a specified maximum benefit) to insureds when they are unable to
work due to an accident or illness. Long-term disability insurance provides a monthly benefit for
those extended periods of time not covered by a short-term disability benefit plan when insureds
are unable to work due to disability. Insureds may receive total or partial disability benefits.
Most of these policies begin providing benefits following a 90- or 180-day waiting period and
generally continue providing benefits until the insured reaches age 65. Long-term disability
benefits are paid monthly and are limited to a portion, generally 50-70%, of the insured’s earned
income up to a specified maximum benefit.

Group Life and Accident

— Group term life insurance provides term coverage to employees and members
of associations, affinity groups and financial institutions and their dependents for a specified
period and has no accumulation of cash values. Life offers options for its basic group life
insurance coverage, including portability of coverage and a living benefit and critical illness
option, whereby terminally ill policyholders can receive death benefits in advance. Life also
offers voluntary, or employee-paid, life group benefits and accidental death and dismemberment
coverage either packaged with life insurance or on a stand-alone basis.



Other

— Life offers a host of other products and services, such as Family and Medical Leave Act
Administration, group retiree health, and specialized insurance products for physicians. Life
provides excess of loss medical coverage (known as stop loss insurance) to employers who self-fund
their medical plans and pay claims using the services of a third party administrator. Life also
provides travel accident, hospital indemnity, supplemental health insurance for military personnel
and their families and other coverages to individual members of various associations, affinity
groups, financial institutions and employee groups.

Marketing and Distribution

Life uses an experienced group of Company employees, managed through a regional sales office
system, to distribute its group insurance products and services through a variety of distribution
outlets, including brokers, consultants, third-party administrators and trade associations.

Competition

The Group Benefits business remains highly competitive. Competitive factors primarily affecting
Group Benefits are the variety and quality of products and services offered, the price quoted for
coverage and services, Life’s relationships with its third-party distributors, and the quality of
customer service. Group Benefits competes with numerous other insurance companies and other
financial intermediaries marketing insurance products. However, many of these businesses have
relatively high barriers to entry and there have been few new entrants into the group benefits
insurance market over the past few years.

International

International, which primarily has operations located in Japan, Brazil, Ireland and the United
Kingdom, provides investments, retirement savings and other insurance and savings products to
individuals and groups outside the United States and Canada. Net income for International was $96,
$39 and $13 in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The company’s Japan operation, Hartford Life KK,
which began selling variable annuities in December 2000, has grown significantly to become the
largest distributor of variable annuities in Japan. In August 2004, the Company began selling yen
and U.S. dollar denominated fixed annuities in Japan. With assets under management of $26.1
billion, $14.6 billion and $6.2 billion as of December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively, the
Japan operation is the largest component of International with net income of $120, $36 and $7 in
2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.

The Company’s Japan operation sells both variable and fixed individual annuity products through a
wide distribution network of Japan’s broker-dealer organizations, banks and other financial
institutions and independent financial advisors. The Company is a market leader in the annuity
industry with sales of $11.9 billion, $7.8 billion and $3.7 billion in 2005, 2004 and 2003,
respectively. The Company was the largest seller of individual retail variable annuities in Japan
with sales of $10.7 billion, $7.3 billion and $3.7 billion in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.

International’s other operations primarily include a 50% owned joint venture in Brazil and a
startup operation in Europe. The Brazil joint venture operates under the name Icatu-Hartford and
distributes pension, life insurance and other insurance and savings products through broker-dealer
organizations and various partnerships. The Company’s European operation, Hartford Life Limited,
began selling unit-linked investment bonds in the United Kingdom in April 2005. Unit-linked bonds
are similar to variable annuities marketed in the United States and Japan. Hartford Life Limited
established its operations hub in Dublin, Ireland with a branch office in London to help market and
service its business in the United Kingdom.

Principal Products

Individual Variable Annuities

- The Company earns fees, based on policyholders’ account values, for
managing variable annuity assets and maintaining policyholder accounts. The Company uses specified
portions of the periodic deposits paid by a customer to purchase units in one or more mutual funds
as directed by the customer, who then assumes the investment performance risks and rewards. These
products offer the policyholder a variety of equity and fixed income options. Additionally,
International sells variable annuity contracts that offer various guaranteed minimum death,
investment, and living benefits.

Policyholders may make deposits of varying amounts at regular or irregular intervals, and the value
of these assets fluctuates in accordance with the investment performance of the funds selected by
the policyholder. To encourage persistency, many of the Company’s individual variable annuities are
subject to withdrawal restrictions and surrender charges. Surrender charges range up to 7% of the
contract’s deposits, less withdrawals, and reduce to zero on a sliding scale, usually within seven
years from the deposit date. Individual variable annuity account values of $24.6 billion, as of
December 31, 2005, have grown from $14.1 billion, as of December 31, 2004, and $6.2 billion, as of
December 31, 2003, due to strong net cash flow, resulting from high levels of sales and market
appreciation.

Fixed MVA Annuities

- Fixed MVA annuities are fixed rate annuity contracts that guarantee a
specific sum of money to be paid in the future, either as a lump sum or as monthly income. In the
event that a policyholder surrenders a policy prior to the end of the guarantee period, the MVA
feature adjusts the contract’s cash surrender value with respect to any changes in interest rates,
thereby protecting the Company from losses due to higher interest rates at the time of surrender.
The amount of payment will not fluctuate due to adverse changes in the Company’s investment return,
mortality experience or expenses. The Company’s primary fixed MVA annuities are yen and dollar
denominated with terms varying from five to ten years with an average term to maturity of
approximately



ten years. Account values of fixed MVA annuities were $1.5 billion, $502 and $0 as of December 31,
2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.

Marketing and Distribution

The International distribution network is based on management’s strategy of developing and
utilizing multiple and competing distribution channels to achieve the broadest distribution to
reach target customers. The success of the Company’s marketing and distribution system depends on
its product offerings, fund performance, successful utilization of wholesaling, quality of customer
service, and relationships with securities firms, banks and other financial institutions, and
independent financial advisors (through which the sale of the Company’s retail investment products
to customers is consummated). As of December 31, 2005, the Japan operation employs a wholesaling
network that supports sales through 54 banks and securities firms.

Competition

The International segment competes with a number of domestic and international insurance companies
in Japan. Product sales are affected by competitive factors such as investment performance ratings,
product design, visibility in the marketplace, financial strength ratings, distribution
capabilities, levels of charges and credited rates, reputation and customer service.

Property & Casualty

Property & Casualty provides (1) workers’ compensation, property, automobile, liability, umbrella,
specialty casualty, marine, livestock and bond coverages to commercial accounts primarily
throughout the United States; (2) professional liability coverage and directors and officers
liability coverage, as well as excess and surplus lines business not normally written by standard
commercial lines insurers; (3) automobile, homeowners and home-based business coverage to
individuals throughout the United States; and (4) insurance-related services.

The Hartford seeks to distinguish itself in the property and casualty market through its product
depth and innovation, distribution capacity, customer service expertise, and technology for ease of
doing business. The Hartford is the tenth largest property and casualty insurance operation in the
United States based on direct written premiums for the year ended December 31, 2004, according to
A.M. Best Company, Inc. (“A.M. Best”). Property & Casualty generated revenues of $12.0 billion,
$11.3 billion and $10.7 billion in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Revenues include earned
premiums, servicing revenue, net investment income and net realized capital gains and losses.
Earned premiums for 2005, 2004 and 2003 were $10.2 billion, $9.5 billion and $8.8 billion,
respectively. Additionally, net income (loss) was $1.2 billion, $910 and $(745) for 2005, 2004 and
2003, respectively. The net loss for 2003 includes a $1.7 billion after-tax charge to strengthen
net asbestos reserves. Total assets for Property & Casualty were $40.3 billion, $38.0 billion and
$37.1 billion as of December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.

Business Insurance

Business Insurance provides standard commercial insurance coverage to small and middle market
commercial businesses primarily throughout the United States. This segment also provides
commercial risk management products and services as well as marine coverage. Earned premiums for
2005, 2004 and 2003 were $4.8 billion, $4.3 billion and $3.7 billion, respectively. The segment
had underwriting income of $396, $360 and $158 in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.

Principal Products

Business Insurance offers workers’ compensation, property, automobile, liability, umbrella and
marine coverages under several different products. Among these products, the Company has achieved
growth through its Select Xpand product, which is designed to meet the needs of businesses with $5
to $15 in revenues and serves businesses in the upper end of the small business market and lower
end of the middle commercial market. Commercial risk management products and services are also
provided.

Marketing and Distribution

Business Insurance provides insurance products and services through its home office located in
Hartford, Connecticut, and multiple domestic regional office locations and insurance centers. The
segment markets its products nationwide utilizing brokers and independent agents and involving
trade associations and employee groups. Brokers and independent agents are not employees of The
Hartford.

Competition

The commercial insurance industry is a highly competitive environment regarding product, price,
service and technology. The Hartford competes with other stock companies, mutual companies,
alternative risk sharing groups and other underwriting organizations. These companies sell through
various distribution channels and business models, across a broad array of product lines, and with
a high level of variation regarding geographic, marketing and customer segmentation. The Hartford
is the seventh largest commercial lines insurer in the United States based on direct written
premiums for the year ended December 31, 2004 according to A.M. Best. The relatively large size
and underwriting capacity of The Hartford provide opportunities not available to smaller companies.
In addition, the marketplace is affected by available capacity of the insurance industry as
measured by policyholders’



surplus. Surplus expands and contracts primarily in conjunction with profit levels generated by
the industry. National carriers are becoming more focused on core segments and continue to compete
for the same business, while regional carriers are broadening their target market and distribution.
Many carriers are focusing on technology to streamline the underwriting process, introduce more
sophisticated pricing models and increase the volume of business sold through agents.

Personal Lines

Personal Lines provides automobile, homeowners’ and home-based business coverages to the members of
AARP through a direct marketing operation; to individuals who prefer local agent involvement
through a network of independent agents in the standard personal lines market; and through the
Company’s Omni Insurance Group, Inc. (“Omni”) subsidiary in the non-standard automobile market.
Personal Lines also operates a member contact center for health insurance products offered through
AARP’s Health Care Options. The Hartford’s exclusive licensing arrangement with AARP continues
through January 1, 2010 for automobile, homeowners and home-based business. The Health Care
Options agreement continues through 2007. These agreements provide Personal Lines with an
important competitive advantage. Personal lines had earned premiums of $3.6 billion, $3.4 billion
and $3.2 billion in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Underwriting income for 2005, 2004 and 2003
was $460, $138 and $130, respectively. AARP had earned premiums of $2.3 billion, $2.1 billion and
$2.0 billion in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.

Principal Products

Personal Lines provides standard and non-standard automobile, homeowners and home-based business
coverages to individuals across the United States, including a special program designed exclusively
for members of AARP. During 2005, the Company continued the rollout of its new Dimensions
automobile and homeowners class plans for insurance sold through independent agents and brokers.
The new Dimensions class plans use a large number of interactive rating variables to determine a
rate that most accurately reflects the customer’s individual characteristics.

Marketing and Distribution

Personal Lines reaches diverse markets through multiple distribution channels including brokers,
independent agents, direct marketing, the internet and advertising in publications. This segment
provides customized products and services to customers through a network of independent agents in
the standard personal lines market, and in the non-standard automobile market through Omni.
Brokers and independent agents are not employees of The Hartford. Personal Lines has an important
relationship with AARP and markets directly to its over 36 million members.

Competition

The personal lines automobile and homeowners businesses are highly competitive. Personal lines
insurance is written by insurance companies of varying sizes that sell products through various
distribution channels, including independent agents, captive agents and directly to the consumer.
The personal lines market competes on the basis of price; product; service, including claims
handling; stability of the insurer and name recognition. The market is competitive with some
carriers filing rate decreases while others focus on acquiring business through other means, such
as increases in advertising and effective utilization of technology. Some carriers have increased
the amount of advertising in an effort to retain profitable business. The Hartford is the twelfth
largest personal lines insurer in the United States based on direct written premiums for the year
ended December 31, 2004 according to A.M. Best. Effective utilization of technology is becoming
increasingly important. A major competitive advantage of The Hartford is the exclusive licensing
arrangement with AARP to provide personal automobile, homeowners and home-based business insurance
products to its members. This arrangement is in effect through January 1, 2010. Management
expects favorable “baby boom” demographics to increase AARP membership during this period. In
addition, The Hartford provides customer service for most health insurance products offered through
AARP’s Health Care Options, pursuant to an agreement that continues through 2007.

Specialty Commercial

Specialty Commercial provides a wide variety of property and casualty insurance products and
services through retailers and wholesalers to large commercial clients and insureds requiring a
variety of specialized coverages. Excess and surplus lines coverages not normally written by
standard line insurers are also provided, primarily through wholesale brokers. Specialty
Commercial had earned premiums of $1.8 billion, $1.7 billion and $1.6 billion in 2005, 2004 and
2003, respectively. Underwriting income (loss) was $(165), $(53) and $10 in 2005, 2004 and 2003,
respectively.

Principal Products

Specialty Commercial offers a variety of customized insurance products and risk management
services. Specialty Commercial provides standard commercial insurance products including workers’
compensation, automobile and liability coverages to large-sized companies. Specialty Commercial
also provides bond, professional liability, specialty casualty and livestock coverages, as well as
core property and excess and surplus lines coverages not normally written by standard lines
insurers. A significant portion of specially casualty business, including workers’ compensation
business, is written through large deductible programs where the insured typically provides
collateral to support loss payments made within their deductible. Alternative markets, within
Specialty Commercial, provides insurance products and services primarily to captive insurance
companies, pools and self-insurance groups. In



addition, Specialty Commercial provides third-party administrator services for claims
administration, integrated benefits, loss control and performance measurement through Specialty
Risk Services, LLC, a subsidiary of the Company.

Marketing and Distribution

Specialty Commercial provides insurance products and services through its home office located in
Hartford, Connecticut and multiple domestic office locations. The segment markets its products
nationwide utilizing a variety of distribution networks including independent agents and brokers as
well as wholesalers. Brokers, independents agents and wholesalers are not employees of The
Hartford.

Competition

The commercial insurance industry is a highly competitive environment regarding product, price and
service. Specialty Commercial is comprised of a diverse group of businesses that are unique to
commercial lines. Each line of business operates independently with its own set of business
objectives, and focuses on the operational dynamics of their specific industry. These businesses,
while somewhat interrelated, have a unique business model and operating cycle. Specialty
Commercial is considered a transactional business and, therefore, competes with other companies for
business primarily on an account by account basis due to the complex nature of each transaction.
Earned premium growth is not an objective of Specialty Commercial since premium writings may
fluctuate based on the segment’s view of perceived market opportunity. Specialty Commercial
competes with other stock companies, mutual companies, alternative risk sharing groups and other
underwriting organizations. The relatively large size and underwriting capacity of The Hartford
provide opportunities not available to smaller companies.

Other Operations

The Other Operations segment includes operations that are under a single management structure,
Heritage Holdings, which is responsible for two related activities. The first activity is the
management of certain subsidiaries and operations of The Hartford that have discontinued writing
new business. The second is the management of claims (and the associated reserves) related to
asbestos, environmental and other exposures.

Life Reserves

Life insurance subsidiaries of Life establish and carry as liabilities, predominantly, three types
of reserves: (1) a liability equal to the balance that accrues to the benefit of the policyholder
as of the financial statement date, otherwise known as the account value, (2) a liability for
unpaid claims, including those that have been incurred but not yet reported, and (3) a liability
for future policy benefits, representing the present value of future benefits to be paid to or on
behalf of policyholders less the present value of future net premiums. The liabilities for unpaid
claims and future policy benefits are calculated based on actuarially recognized methods using
morbidity and mortality tables, which are modified to reflect Life’s actual experience when
appropriate. Liabilities for unpaid claims include estimates of amounts to fully settle known
reported claims as well as claims related to insured events that the Company estimates have been
incurred but have not yet been reported. Future policy benefit reserves are computed at amounts
that, with additions from estimated premiums to be received and with interest on such reserves
compounded annually at certain assumed rates, are expected to be sufficient to meet Life’s policy
obligations at their maturities or in the event of an insured’s disability or death. Other
insurance liabilities include those for unearned premiums and benefits in excess of account value.
Reserves for assumed reinsurance are computed in a manner that is comparable to direct insurance
reserves.

Property & Casualty Reserves

The Hartford establishes property and casualty reserves to provide for the estimated costs of
paying claims under insurance policies written by The Hartford. These reserves include estimates
for both claims that have been reported and those that have been incurred but not reported to The
Hartford and include estimates of all expenses associated with processing and settling these
claims. This estimation process involves a variety of actuarial techniques and is primarily based
on historical experience and consideration of current trends. Examples of current trends include
increases in medical cost inflation rates, changes in internal claim practices, changes in the
legislative and regulatory environment over workers’ compensation claims, evolving exposures to
claims asserted against religious institutions and other organizations relating to molestation or
abuse and other mass torts.

The Hartford continues to receive claims that assert damages from asbestos-related and
environmental-related exposures. Asbestos claims relate primarily to bodily injuries asserted by
those who came in contact with asbestos or products containing asbestos. Environmental claims
relate primarily to pollution related clean-up costs. As discussed further in the Critical
Accounting Estimates and Other Operations sections of the MD&A, significant uncertainty limits the
Company’s ability to estimate the ultimate reserves necessary for unpaid losses and related
expenses with regard to environmental and particularly asbestos claims.

Most of the Company’s property and casualty reserves are not discounted. However, certain
liabilities for unpaid claims for permanently disabled claimants have been discounted to present
value using an average interest rate of 4.5% in 2005 and 4.6% in 2004. As of December 31, 2005 and
2004, such discounted reserves totaled $680 and $646, respectively (net of discounts of $505, and
$440, respectively). In addition, certain structured settlement contracts, that fund loss run-offs
for unrelated parties having payment patterns that are fixed and determinable, have been discounted
to present value using an average interest rate of 5.5%. At



December 31, 2005 and 2004, such discounted reserves totaled $264 and $257, respectively (net of
discounts of $103 and $116, respectively). Accretion of these discounts did not have a material
effect on net income during 2005 or 2004.

As of December 31, 2005, net property and casualty reserves for claims and claim adjustment
expenses reported under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“GAAP”) exceeded net reserves
reported on a statutory basis by $203. The difference primarily results from a portion of the GAAP
provision for uncollectible reinsurance not recognized under statutory accounting and the required
exclusion from statutory reserves of assumed retroactive reinsurance, partially offset by the
discounting of GAAP-basis workers’ compensation reserves at rates no higher than risk-free interest
rates; such rates generally exceed the statutory discount rates set by regulators.

Further discussion on The Hartford’s property and casualty reserves, including asbestos and
environmental claims reserves, may be found in the Reserves section of the MD&A– Critical
Accounting Estimates.

A reconciliation of liabilities for unpaid claims and claim adjustment expenses is herein
referenced from Note 11 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. A table depicting the
historical development of the liabilities for unpaid claims and claim adjustment expenses, net of
reinsurance, follows.

The largest impacts of net reserve re-estimates are shown in the “1995 and Prior” accident
years. The reserve re-estimates in calendar years 1996 and 2003, include increases in reserves of
$785 in 1996 and $2.6 billion in 2003 related to reserve strengthening based on ground-up studies
of environmental and asbestos reserves. The ground up study that led to the strengthening in
calendar year 2003 confirmed the Company’s view of the existence of a substantial long-term
deterioration in the asbestos litigation environment. Excluding the impacts of asbestos and
environmental strengthening, over the past ten years, reserve re-estimates for total Property &
Casualty ranged from (3.0%) to 1.6% of total net recorded reserves.

Reserves for accident years 1996 and 1997 show the effects of favorable reestimation in subsequent
years. A contributing factor to this improvement, spread over several calendar years, was an
unexpected improvement in the environment for workers’ compensation. With the benefit of
hindsight, annual changes in loss cost trends were very low during this period as compared to
historical experience. Because it took several years for this improvement to emerge in the data,
it similarly took several years for this to be recognized in the Company’s estimates of
liabilities.

There was also reserve deterioration, spread over several calendar years, on accident years
1998-2000. Assumed casualty reinsurance contributed in part to this deterioration. Numerous
actuarial assumptions on assumed casualty reinsurance turned out to be low, including loss cost
trends, particularly on excess of loss business, and the impact of deteriorating terms and
conditions. Workers’ compensation also contributed to this deterioration, as medical inflation
trends were above initial expectations.

Accident years 2001 and 2002 are reasonably close to original estimates. However, each year shows
some swings by calendar period, with some favorable development later offset by unfavorable
development. The release for accident year 2001 during calendar year 2004 relates primarily to
reserves for September 11. Subsequent adverse developments on accident year 2001 relate to assumed
casualty reinsurance and unexpected development on mature claims in both general liability and
workers’ compensation. Reserve releases for accident year 2002 during calendar years 2003 and 2004
come largely from short-tail lines of business, where results emerge quickly and actual reported
losses are predictive of ultimate losses. Reserve increases on accident year 2002 during calendar



year 2005
were recognized, as unfavorable development on accident years prior to 2002 caused
the Company to increase its estimate of unpaid losses for the 2002 accident year.

Accident years 2003 and 2004 show favorable development in calendar years 2004 and 2005. A portion
of the release comes from short-tail lines of business, where results emerge quickly. During
calendar year 2005, favorable re-estimates occurred in Personal Lines for both loss and allocated
loss adjustment expenses. Workers’ compensation also experienced favorable re-estimates as the
latest evaluations of workers’ compensation claims indicate that underwriting actions of recent
years and reform in California have had a greater impact in controlling loss costs than was
originally estimated.

Within our professional liability business, during calendar year 2005, reserves were released for
directors and officers insurance on accident years 2003 and 2004 due to favorable developments,
while prior accident years reserves were strengthened for contracts that provide auto financing gap
coverage and auto lease residual value coverage. In 2003, the Company stopped writing contracts
that provide auto financing gap coverage and auto lease residual value coverage.

Ceded Reinsurance

Consistent with industry practice, The Hartford cedes insurance risk to reinsurance companies. For
Property & Casualty operations, these reinsurance arrangements are intended to provide greater
diversification of business and limit The Hartford’s maximum net loss arising from large risks or
catastrophes.

A major portion of The Hartford’s property and casualty reinsurance is effected under general
reinsurance contracts known as treaties, or, in some instances, is negotiated on an individual risk
basis, known as facultative reinsurance. The Hartford also has in-force excess of loss contracts
with reinsurers that protect it against a specified part or all of certain losses over stipulated
amounts.

Reinsurance does not relieve The Hartford of its primary liability and, as such, failure of
reinsurers to honor their obligations could result in losses to The Hartford. The Hartford
evaluates the risk transfer of its reinsurance contracts, the financial condition of its reinsurers
and monitors concentrations of credit risk. The Company’s monitoring procedures include careful
initial selection of its reinsurers, structuring agreements to provide collateral funds where
possible, and regularly monitoring the financial condition and ratings of its reinsurers.

In accordance with normal industry practice, Life is involved in both the cession and assumption of
insurance with other insurance and reinsurance companies. As of December 31, 2005, the Company’s
current policy for the largest amount of life insurance retained on any one life by any one of the
life operations was approximately $5.0, which increased from $2.9 as of December 31, 2004. In
addition, Life has reinsured the majority of the minimum death benefit guarantees as well as the
guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefits on contracts issued prior to July 2003 offered in connection
with its variable annuity contracts. Life also assumes reinsurance from other insurers. Life
evaluates the financial condition of its reinsurers and monitors concentrations of credit risk.
For the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, Life did not make any significant changes in
the terms under which reinsurance is ceded to other insurers except for Life’s 2003 recapture of a
block of business previously reinsured with an unaffiliated reinsurer and change in retention.
Reinsurance accounting is followed for ceded transactions when the risk transfer provisions of SFAS
No. 113, “Accounting and Reporting for Reinsurance of Short-Duration and Long-Duration Contracts,”
have been met. For further discussion see Note 6 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Investment Operations

The Hartford’s investment portfolios are primarily divided between Life and Property & Casualty.
The investment portfolios of Life and Property & Casualty are managed by HIMCO, a wholly-owned
subsidiary of The Hartford. HIMCO manages the portfolios to maximize economic value, while
attempting to generate the income necessary to support the Company’s various product obligations,
within internally established objectives, guidelines and risk tolerances. The portfolio objectives
and guidelines are developed based upon the asset/liability profile, including duration, convexity
and other characteristics within specified risk tolerances. The risk tolerances considered
include, for example, asset and credit issuer allocation limits, maximum portfolio below investment
grade holdings and foreign currency exposure. The Company attempts to minimize adverse impacts to
the portfolio and the Company’s results of operations from changes in economic conditions through
asset allocation limits, asset/liability duration matching and through the use of derivatives. For
further discussion of HIMCO’s portfolio management approach, see the Investments General section of
the MD&A.

In addition to managing the general account assets of the Company, HIMCO is also a Securities and
Exchange Commission (“SEC”) registered investment advisor for third party institutional clients, a
sub-advisor for certain fixed income mutual funds offered by Hartford Life and serves as the
sponsor and collateral manager for synthetic collateralized loan obligations. HIMCO specializes in
fixed income investment management that incorporates proprietary research and active management
within a disciplined risk framework to provide value added returns versus peers and benchmarks. As
of December 31, 2005 and 2004, the fair value of HIMCO’s total assets under management was
approximately $115.9 billion and $101.9 billion, respectively, of which $4.7 billion and $3.9
billion, respectively, were HIMCO managed third party accounts.

Regulation and Premium Rates

Insurance companies are subject to comprehensive and detailed regulation and supervision throughout
the United States. The extent of such regulation varies, but generally has its source in statutes
which delegate regulatory, supervisory and administrative powers to



state insurance departments. Such powers relate to, among other things, the standards of solvency
that must be met and maintained; the licensing of insurers and their agents; the nature of and
limitations on investments; establishing premium rates; claim handling and trade practices;
restrictions on the size of risks which may be insured under a single policy; deposits of
securities for the benefit of policyholders; approval of policy forms; periodic examinations of the
affairs of companies; annual and other reports required to be filed on the financial condition of
companies or for other purposes; fixing maximum interest rates on life insurance policy loans and
minimum rates for accumulation of surrender values; and the adequacy of reserves and other
necessary provisions for unearned premiums, unpaid claims and claim adjustment expenses and other
liabilities, both reported and unreported.

Most states have enacted legislation that regulates insurance holding company systems such as The
Hartford. This legislation provides that each insurance company in the system is required to
register with the insurance department of its state of domicile and furnish information concerning
the operations of companies within the holding company system which may materially affect the
operations, management or financial condition of the insurers within the system. All transactions
within a holding company system affecting insurers must be fair and equitable. Notice to the
insurance departments is required prior to the consummation of transactions affecting the ownership
or control of an insurer and of certain material transactions between an insurer and any entity in
its holding company system. In addition, certain of such transactions cannot be consummated
without the applicable insurance department’s prior approval. In the jurisdictions in which the
Company’s insurance company subsidiaries are domiciled, the acquisition of more than 10% of The
Hartford’s outstanding common stock would require the acquiring party to make various regulatory
filings.

The extent of insurance regulation on business outside the United States varies significantly among
the countries in which The Hartford operates. Some countries have minimal regulatory requirements,
while others regulate insurers extensively. Foreign insurers in many countries are faced with
greater restrictions than domestic competitors domiciled in that particular jurisdiction. The
Hartford’s international operations are comprised of insurers licensed in their respective
countries.

Employees

The Hartford had approximately 30,000 employees as of December 31, 2005.

Available Information

The Hartford makes available free of charge on or through its Internet website
(

http://www.thehartford.com

) The Hartford’s annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form
10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to
Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act as soon as reasonably practicable after The Hartford
electronically files such material with, or furnishes it to, the SEC.

Item 1A. RISK FACTORS

Investing in The Hartford involves risk. In deciding whether to invest in The Hartford, you
should carefully consider the following risk factors, any of which could have a significant or
material adverse effect on the business, financial condition, operating results or liquidity of The
Hartford. This information should be considered carefully together with the other information
contained in this report and the other reports and materials filed by The Hartford with the
Securities and Exchange Commission. The risks described below are not the only ones facing The
Hartford. Additional risks may also have a significant or material adverse effect on the business,
financial condition, operating results or liquidity of The Hartford.

It is difficult for us to predict our potential exposure for asbestos and environmental claims and
our ultimate liability may exceed our currently recorded reserves, which may have a material
adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition and liquidity.

We continue to receive asbestos and environmental claims. Significant uncertainty limits the
ability of insurers and reinsurers to estimate the ultimate reserves necessary for unpaid losses
and related expenses for both environmental and particularly asbestos claims. We believe that the
actuarial tools and other techniques we employ to estimate the ultimate cost of claims for more
traditional kinds of insurance exposure are less precise in estimating reserves for our asbestos
and environmental exposures. Traditional actuarial reserving techniques cannot reasonably estimate
the ultimate cost of these claims, particularly during periods where theories of law are in flux.
Accordingly, the degree of variability of reserve estimates for these exposures is significantly
greater than for other more traditional exposures. It is also not possible to predict changes in
the legal and legislative environment and their effect on the future development of asbestos and
environmental claims. Although potential Federal asbestos-related legislation is being considered
in the Senate, it is uncertain whether such legislation will be enacted or what its effect would be
on our aggregate asbestos liabilities. Because of the significant uncertainties that limit the
ability of insurers and reinsurers to estimate the ultimate reserves necessary for unpaid losses
and related expenses for both environmental and particularly asbestos claims, the ultimate
liabilities may exceed the currently recorded reserves. Any such additional liability cannot be
reasonably estimated now but could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated operating
results, financial condition and liquidity.



The occurrence of one or more terrorist attacks in the geographic areas we serve or the threat of
terrorism in general may have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated operating
results, financial condition or liquidity.

The occurrence of one or more terrorist attacks in the geographic areas we serve could result in
substantially higher claims under our insurance policies than we have anticipated. Private sector
catastrophe reinsurance is extremely limited and generally unavailable for terrorism losses caused
by attacks with nuclear, biological, chemical or radiological weapons. Reinsurance coverage from
the federal government under the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of 2002, as extended through 2007, is
also limited. Accordingly, the effects of a terrorist attack in the geographic areas we serve may
result in claims and related losses for which we do not have adequate reinsurance. This would
likely cause us to increase our reserves, adversely affect our earnings during the period or
periods affected and, if significant enough, could adversely affect our liquidity and financial
condition. Further, the continued threat of terrorism and the occurrence of terrorist attacks, as
well as heightened security measures and military action in response to these threats and attacks,
may cause significant volatility in global financial markets, disruptions to commerce and reduced
economic activity. These consequences could have an adverse effect on the value of the assets in
our investment portfolio. The continued threat of terrorism also could result in increased
reinsurance prices and potentially cause us to retain more risk than we otherwise would retain if
we were able to obtain reinsurance at lower prices. Terrorist attacks also could disrupt our
operations centers in the U.S. or abroad. As a result, it is possible that any, or a combination
of all, of these factors may have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated operating
results, financial condition and liquidity.

We may incur losses due to our reinsurers being unwilling or unable to meet their obligations under
reinsurance contracts and the availability, pricing and adequacy of reinsurance may not be
sufficient to protect us against losses.

As an insurer, we frequently seek to reduce the losses that may arise from catastrophes, or other
events that can cause unfavorable underwriting results, through reinsurance. Under these
reinsurance arrangements, other insurers assume a portion of our losses and related expenses;
however, we remain liable as the direct insurer on all risks reinsured. Consequently, ceded
reinsurance arrangements do not eliminate our obligation to pay claims and we are subject to our
reinsurers’ credit risk with respect to our ability to recover amounts due from them. Although we
evaluate periodically the financial condition of our reinsurers to minimize our exposure to
significant losses from reinsurer insolvencies, our reinsurers may become financially unsound or
choose to dispute their contractual obligations by the time their financial obligations become due.
The inability or unwillingness of any reinsurer to meet its financial obligations to us could
negatively affect our consolidated operating results. In addition, market conditions beyond our
control determine the availability and cost of the reinsurance we are able to purchase. Recently,
the price of reinsurance has increased significantly, and may continue to increase. No assurances
can be made that reinsurance will remain continuously available to us to the same extent and on the
same terms and rates as are currently available. If we were unable to maintain our current level
of reinsurance or purchase new reinsurance protection in amounts that we consider sufficient and at
prices that we consider acceptable, we would have to either accept an increase in our net liability
exposure, reduce the amount of business we write, or develop other alternatives to reinsurance.

We are exposed to significant capital markets risk related to changes in interest rates, equity
prices and foreign exchange rates which may adversely affect our results of operations, financial
condition or cash flows.

We are exposed to significant capital markets risk related to changes in interest rates, equity
prices and foreign currency exchange rates. Our exposure to interest rate risk relates primarily
to the market price and cash flow variability associated with changes in interest rates. A rise in
interest rates will reduce the net unrealized gain position of our investment portfolio, increase
interest expense on our variable rate debt obligations and, if long-term interest rates rise
dramatically within a six to twelve month time period, certain of our Life businesses may be
exposed to disintermediation risk. Disintermediation risk refers to the risk that our policyholders
may surrender their contracts in a rising interest rate environment, requiring us to liquidate
assets in an unrealized loss position. Our primary exposure to equity risk relates to the
potential for lower earnings associated with certain of our Life businesses, such as variable
annuities, where fee income is earned based upon the fair value of the assets under management. In
addition, certain of our Life products offer guaranteed benefits which increase our potential
benefit exposure should equity markets decline. We are also exposed to interest rate and equity
risk based upon the discount rate and expected long-term rate of return assumptions associated with
our pension and other post-retirement benefit obligations. Sustained declines in long-term
interest rates or equity returns likely would have a negative effect on the funded status of these
plans. Our primary foreign currency exchange risks are related to net income from foreign
operations, non–U.S. dollar denominated investments, investments in foreign subsidiaries, the yen
denominated individual fixed annuity product, and certain guaranteed benefits associated with the
Japan variable annuity. These risks relate to the potential decreases in value and income
resulting from a strengthening or weakening in foreign exchange rates verses the U.S. dollar. In
general, the weakening of foreign currencies versus the U.S. dollar will unfavorably affect net
income from foreign operations, the value of non-U.S. dollar denominated investments, investments
in foreign subsidiaries and realized gains or losses on the yen denominated individual fixed
annuity product. In comparison, a strengthening of the Japanese yen in comparison to the U.S. dollar
and other currencies may increase our exposure to the guarantee benefits associated with the Japan
variable annuity. If significant, declines in equity prices, changes in U.S. interest rates and
the strengthening or weakening of foreign currencies against the U.S. dollar, individually or in
tandem, could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial
condition or cash flows.



We may be unable to effectively mitigate the impact of equity market volatility on our financial
position and results of operations arising from obligations under annuity product guarantees, which
may affect our consolidated results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.

Our primary exposure to equity risk relates to the potential for lower earnings associated with
certain of our life businesses where fee income is earned based upon the fair value of the assets
under management. In addition, some of the products offered by these businesses, especially
variable annuities, offer certain guaranteed benefits which increase our potential benefit exposure
as the equity markets decline. We are subject to equity market volatility related to these
benefits, especially the guaranteed minimum death benefit (“GMDB”), guaranteed minimum withdrawal
benefit (“GMWB”) and guaranteed minimum income benefit (“GMIB”) offered with variable annuity
products. We use reinsurance structures and have modified benefit features
to mitigate the exposure associated with GMDB. We also use reinsurance in combination with
derivative instruments to minimize the claim exposure and the volatility of net income associated
with the GMWB liability. While we believe that these and other actions we have taken mitigate the
risks related to these benefits, we are subject to the risks that reinsurers are unable or
unwilling to pay, that other risk management procedures prove ineffective or that unanticipated
policyholder behavior, combined with adverse market events, produces economic losses beyond the
scope of the risk management techniques employed, which individually or collectively may have a
material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial condition or cash
flows.

Regulatory proceedings or private claims relating to incentive compensation or payments made to
brokers or other producers, alleged anti-competitive conduct and other sales practices could have a
material adverse effect on us.

We have received multiple regulatory inquiries regarding our compensation arrangements with brokers
and other producers. For example, in June 2004, the Company received a subpoena from the New York
Attorney General’s Office in connection with its inquiry into compensation arrangements between
brokers and carriers. In mid-September 2004 and subsequently, the Company has received additional
subpoenas from the New York Attorney General’s Office, which relate more specifically to possible
anti-competitive activity among brokers and insurers. On October 14, 2004, the New York Attorney
General’s Office filed a civil complaint against Marsh & McLennan Companies, Inc., and Marsh, Inc.
(collectively, “Marsh”). The complaint alleges, among other things, that certain insurance
companies, including the Company, participated with Marsh in arrangements to submit inflated bids
for business insurance and paid contingent commissions to ensure that Marsh would direct business
to them. The Company was not joined as a defendant in the action, which has since settled.

Since the beginning of October 2004, the Company has received subpoenas or other information
requests from Attorneys General and regulatory agencies in more than a dozen jurisdictions
regarding broker compensation, possible anti-competitive activity and sales practices. These
inquiries have concerned lines of business in both our Property & Casualty and Life operations.
The Company may continue to receive additional subpoenas and other information requests from
Attorneys General or other regulatory agencies regarding similar issues. The Company intends to
continue cooperating fully with these investigations, and is conducting an internal review, with
the assistance of outside counsel, regarding broker compensation issues in its Property & Casualty
and Group Benefits operations. Although no regulatory action has been initiated against the
Company in connection with the allegations described in the civil complaint, it is possible that
one or more other regulatory agencies may pursue action against the Company or one or more of its
employees in the future on this matter or on other similar matters. If such an action is brought,
it could have a material adverse effect on the Company.

Regulatory and market-driven changes may affect our practices relating to the payment of incentive
compensation to brokers and other producers, including changes that have been announced and those
which may occur in the future, and could have a material adverse effect on us in the future.

We pay brokers and independent agents commissions and other forms of incentive compensation in
connection with the sale of many of the Company’s insurance products. Since the New York Attorney
General’s Office filed a civil complaint against Marsh on October 14, 2004, several of the largest
national insurance brokers, including Marsh, Aon Corporation and Willis Group Holdings Limited,
have announced that they have discontinued the use of contingent compensation arrangements. Other
industry participants may make similar, or different, determinations in the future. In addition,
legal, legislative, regulatory, business or other developments may require changes to industry
practices relating to incentive compensation. At this time, it is not possible to predict the
effect of these announced or potential changes on our business or distribution strategies, but such
changes could have a material adverse effect on us in the future .

Our consolidated results of operations, financial condition or cash flows in a particular
period or periods may be adversely affected by unfavorable loss development.

Our success depends upon our ability to accurately assess the risks associated with the businesses
that we insure. We establish loss reserves to cover our estimated liability for the payment of all
unpaid losses and loss expenses incurred with respect to premiums earned on the policies that we
write. Loss reserves do not represent an exact calculation of liability. Rather, loss reserves
are estimates of what we expect the ultimate settlement and administration of claims will cost,
less what has been paid to date. These estimates are based upon actuarial and statistical
projections and on our assessment of currently available data, as well as estimates of claims
severity and frequency, legal theories of liability and other factors. Loss reserve estimates are
refined periodically as experience develops and claims are reported and settled. Establishing an
appropriate level of loss reserves is an inherently uncertain process. Because of this
uncertainty, it is possible that our reserves at any given time will prove inadequate.
Furthermore, since



estimates of aggregate loss costs for prior accident years are used in pricing our insurance
products, we could later determine that our products were not priced adequately to cover actual
losses and related loss expenses in order to generate a profit. To the extent we determine that
actual losses and related loss expenses exceed our expectations and reserves recorded in our
financial statements, we will be required to increase reserves. Increases in reserves would be
recognized as an expense during the period or periods in which these determinations are made,
thereby adversely affecting our results of operations for the related period or periods. Depending
on the severity and timing of these determinations, this could have a material adverse effect on
our consolidated results of operations, financial condition or cash flows in a particular quarterly
or annual period.

As a property and casualty insurer, we are particularly vulnerable to losses from the incidence and
severity of catastrophes, both natural and man-made, the occurrence of which may have a material
adverse effect on our financial condition, consolidated results of operations or cash flows in a
particular quarterly or annual period.

Our property and casualty insurance operations expose us to claims arising out of catastrophes.
Catastrophes can be caused by various unpredictable events, including earthquakes, hurricanes,
hailstorms, severe winter weather, floods, fires, tornadoes, explosions and other natural or
man-made disasters. We also face substantial exposure to losses resulting from acts of war, acts
of terrorism and political instability. The geographic distribution of our business subjects us to
catastrophe exposure for natural events occurring in a number of areas, including, but not limited
to, hurricanes in Florida, the Gulf Coast and the Atlantic coast regions of the United States, and
earthquakes in California and the New Madrid region of the United
States. Catastrophes could disrupt our operations centers in these
areas. Further, we expect that increases
in the values and concentrations of insured property in these areas will increase the severity of
catastrophic events  in the future. Our liquidity could be constrained by a catastrophe, or multiple
catastrophes, which result in extraordinary losses or a downgrade of our debt or financial strength
ratings. In addition, because accounting rules do not permit insurers to reserve for such
catastrophic events until they occur, claims from catastrophic events could have a material adverse
effect on our financial condition, consolidated results of operations or cash flows in a particular
quarterly or annual period.

Competitive activity may adversely affect our market share and profitability, which could have an
adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.

The insurance industry is highly competitive. Our competitors include other insurers and, because
many of our products include an investment component, securities firms, investment advisers, mutual
funds, banks and other financial institutions. In recent years, there has been substantial
consolidation and convergence among companies in the insurance and financial services industries
resulting in increased competition from large, well-capitalized insurance and financial services
firms that market products and services similar to ours. Many of these firms also have been able
to increase their distribution systems through mergers or contractual arrangements. These
competitors compete with us for producers such as brokers and independent agents. Larger
competitors may have lower operating costs and an ability to absorb greater risk while maintaining
their financial strength ratings, thereby allowing them to price their products more competitively.
These competitive pressures could result in increased pricing pressures on a number of our
products and services, particularly as competitors seek to win market share, and may harm our
ability to maintain or increase our profitability. Because of the competitive nature of the
insurance industry, there can be no assurance that we will continue to effectively compete with our
industry rivals, or that competitive pressure will not have a material adverse effect on our
business, results of operations or financial condition.

We may experience unfavorable judicial or legislative developments that would adversely affect our
business, results of operations, financial condition or liquidity.

We are involved in legal actions which do not arise in the ordinary course of business, some of
which assert claims for substantial amounts. These actions include, among others, putative state
and federal class actions seeking certification of a state or national class. Such putative class
actions have alleged, for example, underpayment of claims or improper underwriting practices in
connection with various kinds of insurance policies, such as personal and commercial automobile,
property, and inland marine; improper sales practices in connection with the sale of life insurance
and other investment products; improper fee arrangements in connection with mutual funds; and
unfair settlement practices in connection with the settlement of asbestos claims. We are also
involved in individual actions in which punitive damages are sought, such as claims alleging bad
faith in the handling of insurance claims. Given the large or indeterminate amounts sought in
certain of these actions, and the inherent unpredictability of litigation, it is possible that an
adverse outcome in certain matters could, from time to time, have a material adverse effect on the
Company’s consolidated results of operations or cash flows in particular quarterly or annual
periods.

Like many other insurers, we also have been joined in actions by asbestos plaintiffs asserting that
insurers had a duty to protect the public from the dangers of asbestos. Traditional actuarial
reserving techniques cannot reasonably estimate the ultimate cost of these claims, particularly
during periods where theories of law are in flux. The degree of variability of reserve estimates
for these exposures is significantly greater than for other more traditional exposures. It is also
not possible to predict changes in the legal and legislative environment and their impact on the
future development of asbestos claims. Because of the significant uncertainties surrounding these
exposures, it is possible that our estimate of the ultimate liabilities for these claims may change
and that the required adjustment to recorded reserves could exceed the currently recorded reserves
by an amount that could be material to our results of operations, financial condition and
liquidity. Further, it is unknown whether potential Federal asbestos-related legislation will be
enacted, and if so, what its effect will be on The Hartford’s aggregate asbestos liabilities.
Depending on the provisions of any legislation which is ultimately enacted, the legislation may
have a material adverse effect on the Company.



Potential changes in domestic and foreign regulation may increase our business costs and required
capital levels, which could adversely affect our business, consolidated operating results,
financial condition or liquidity.

We are subject to extensive laws and regulations. These laws and regulations are complex and
subject to change. Moreover, they are administered and enforced by a number of different
governmental authorities, including foreign regulators, state insurance regulators, state
securities administrators, the Securities and Exchange Commission, the New York Stock Exchange, the
National Association of Securities Dealers, the U.S. Department of Justice, and state attorneys
general, each of which exercises a degree of interpretive latitude. Consequently, we are subject
to the risk that compliance with any particular regulator’s or enforcement authority’s
interpretation of a legal issue may not result in compliance with another regulator’s or
enforcement authority’s interpretation of the same issue, particularly when compliance is judged in
hindsight. In addition, there is risk that any particular regulator’s or enforcement authority’s
interpretation of a legal issue may change over time to our detriment, or that changes in the
overall legal environment may, even absent any particular regulator’s or enforcement authority’s
interpretation of a legal issue changing, cause us to change our views regarding the actions we
need to take from a legal risk management perspective, thus necessitating changes to our practices
that may, in some cases, limit our ability to grow and improve the profitability of our business.

State insurance laws regulate most aspects of our U.S. insurance businesses, and our insurance
subsidiaries are regulated by the insurance departments of the states in which they are domiciled
and licensed. State laws in the U.S. grant insurance regulatory authorities broad administrative
powers with respect to, among other things:

State insurance regulators and the National Association of Insurance Commissioners, or NAIC,
regularly re-examine existing laws and regulations applicable to insurance companies and their
products. Our international operations are subject to regulation in the relevant jurisdictions in
which they operate, which in many ways is similar to the state regulation outlined above, with
similar related restrictions. Our asset management operations are also subject to extensive
regulation in the various jurisdictions where they operate. These regulations are primarily
intended to protect investors in the securities markets or investment advisory clients and
generally grant supervisory authorities broad administrative powers. Changes in all of these laws
and regulations, or in interpretations thereof, are often made for the benefit of the consumer at
the expense of the insurer and thus could have a material adverse effect on our business,
consolidated operating results, financial condition and liquidity. Compliance with these laws and
regulations is also time consuming and personnel-intensive, and changes in these laws and
regulations may increase materially our direct and indirect compliance costs and other expenses of
doing business, thus having an adverse effect on our business, consolidated operating results,
financial condition and liquidity.

Our business, results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected by general
domestic and international economic and business conditions that are less favorable than
anticipated.

Factors such as consumer spending, business investment, government spending, the volatility and
strength of the capital markets, and inflation all affect the business and economic environment
and, ultimately, the amount and profitability of business we conduct. For example, in an economic
downturn characterized by higher unemployment, lower family income, lower corporate earnings, lower
business investment and consumer spending, the demand for financial and insurance products could be
adversely affected. Further, given that we offer our products and services in North America,
Japan, Europe and South America, we are exposed to these risks in multiple geographic locations.
Our operations are subject to different local political, regulatory, business and financial risks
and



challenges which may affect the demand for our products and services, the value of our investment
portfolio, the required levels of our capital and surplus, and the credit quality of local
counterparties. These risks include, for example, political, social or economic instability in
countries in which we operate, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, credit risks of our
local borrowers and counterparties, lack of local business experience in certain markets, and, in
certain cases, risks associated with the potential incompatibility with partners. Additionally,
much of our overall growth is due to our expansion into new markets for our investment products,
primarily in Japan. Our expansion in these new markets requires us to respond to rapid changes in
market conditions in these areas. Accordingly, our overall success depends, in part, upon our
ability to succeed despite these differing and dynamic economic, social and political conditions.
We may not succeed in developing and implementing policies and strategies that are effective in
each location where we do business and we cannot guarantee that the inability to successfully
address the risks related to economic conditions in all of the geographic locations where we
conduct business will not have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or
financial condition.

We may experience difficulty in marketing and distributing products through our current and future
distribution channels.

We distribute our annuity, life and certain property and casualty insurance products through a
variety of distribution channels, including brokers, independent agents, broker-dealers, banks,
wholesalers, affinity partners, our own internal sales force and other third party organizations.
In some areas of our business, we generate a significant portion of our business through individual
third party arrangements. For example, we generated approximately 64% of our personal lines earned
premium in 2005 under an exclusive licensing arrangement with AARP that continues through January
1, 2010. We periodically negotiate provisions and renewals of these relationships and there can be
no assurance that such terms will remain acceptable to us or such third parties. An interruption
in our continuing relationship with certain of these third parties could materially affect our
ability to market our products.

Our business, results of operations, financial condition or liquidity may be adversely affected by
the emergence of unexpected and unintended claim and coverage issues.

As industry practices and legal, judicial, social and other environmental conditions change,
unexpected and unintended issues related to claims and coverage may emerge. These issues may
either extend coverage beyond our underwriting intent or increase the frequency or severity of
claims. In some instances, these changes may not become apparent until some time after we have
issued insurance contracts that are affected by the changes. As a result, the full extent of
liability under our insurance contracts may not be known for many years after a contract is issued
and this liability may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations,
financial condition or liquidity at the time it becomes known.

We may experience a downgrade in our financial strength or credit ratings which may make our
products less attractive, increase our cost of capital, and inhibit our ability to refinance our
debt, which would have an adverse effect on our business, consolidated operating results, financial
condition and liquidity.

Financial strength and credit ratings, including commercial paper ratings, have become an
increasingly important factor in establishing the competitive position of insurance companies.
Rating organizations assign ratings based upon several factors. While most of the factors relate
to the rated company, some of the factors relate to the views of the rating organization, general
economic conditions, and circumstances outside the rated company’s control. In addition, rating
organizations may employ different models and formulas to assess the financial strength of a rated
company, and from time to time rating organizations have, in their discretion, altered these
models. Changes to the models, general economic conditions, or circumstances outside our control
could impact a rating organization’s judgment of its rating and the subsequent rating it assigns
us. We cannot predict what actions rating organizations may take, or what actions we may be
required to take in response to the actions of rating organizations, which may adversely affect us.
Our financial strength ratings, which are intended to measure our ability to meet policyholder
obligations, are an important factor affecting public confidence in most of our products and, as a
result, our competitiveness. A downgrade in our financial strength ratings, or an announced
potential downgrade, of one of our principal insurance subsidiaries could affect our competitive
position in the insurance industry and make it more difficult for us to market our products, as
potential customers may select companies with higher financial strength ratings. The interest
rates we pay on our borrowings are largely dependent on our credit ratings. A downgrade of our
credit ratings, or an announced potential downgrade, could affect our ability to raise additional
debt with terms and conditions similar to our current debt, and accordingly, likely increase our
cost of capital. In addition, a downgrade of our credit ratings could make it more difficult to
raise capital to refinance any maturing debt obligations, to support business growth at our
insurance subsidiaries and to maintain or improve the current financial strength ratings of our
principal insurance subsidiaries described above. As a result, it is possible that any, or a
combination of all, of these factors may have a material adverse effect on our business,
consolidated operating results, financial condition and liquidity.

Limits on the ability of our insurance subsidiaries to pay dividends to us may adversely affect our
liquidity.

The Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc. is a holding company with no significant operations.
Our principal asset is the stock of our insurance subsidiaries. State insurance regulatory
authorities limit the payment of dividends by insurance subsidiaries. In addition, competitive
pressures generally require certain of our insurance subsidiaries to maintain financial strength
ratings. These restrictions and other regulatory requirements affect the ability of our insurance
subsidiaries to make dividend payments. Limits on the ability of the insurance subsidiaries to pay
dividends could adversely affect our liquidity, including our ability to pay dividends to
shareholders and service our debt.



Item 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS

None.

Item 2. PROPERTIES

The Hartford owns the land and buildings comprising its Hartford location and other properties
within the greater Hartford, Connecticut area which total approximately 1.9 million of the 2.2
million square feet owned. In addition, The Hartford leases approximately 5.3 million square feet
throughout the United States and approximately 208 thousand square feet in other countries. All of
the properties owned or leased are used by one or more of all ten operating segments, depending on
the location. For more information on operating segments see Part 1, Item 1, Business of The
Hartford – Reporting Segments. The Company believes its properties and facilities are suitable and
adequate for current operations.

Item 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

The Hartford is involved in claims litigation arising in the ordinary course of business, both
as a liability insurer defending third-party claims brought against insureds and as an insurer
defending coverage claims brought against it. The Hartford accounts for such activity through the
establishment of unpaid claim and claim adjustment expense reserves. Subject to the uncertainties
discussed below under the caption “Asbestos and Environmental Claims,” management expects that the
ultimate liability, if any, with respect to such ordinary-course claims litigation, after
consideration of provisions made for potential losses and costs of defense, will not be material to
the consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash flows of The Hartford.

The Hartford is also involved in other kinds of legal actions, some of which assert claims for
substantial amounts. These actions include, among others, putative state and federal class
actions seeking certification of a state or national class. Such putative class actions have
alleged, for example, underpayment of claims or improper underwriting practices in connection with
various kinds of insurance policies, such as personal and commercial automobile, property, and
inland marine; improper sales practices in connection with the sale of life insurance and other
investment products; improper fee arrangements in connection with mutual funds; and unfair
settlement practices in connection with the settlement of asbestos claims. The Hartford also is
involved in individual actions in which punitive damages are sought, such as claims alleging bad
faith in the handling of insurance claims. Like many other insurers, The Hartford also has been
joined in actions by asbestos plaintiffs asserting that insurers had a duty to protect the public
from the dangers of asbestos. Management expects that the ultimate liability, if any, with
respect to such lawsuits, after consideration of provisions made for estimated losses, will not be
material to the consolidated financial condition of The Hartford. Nonetheless, given the large or
indeterminate amounts sought in certain of these actions, and the inherent unpredictability of
litigation, it is possible that an adverse outcome in certain matters could, from time to time,
have a material adverse effect on the Company’s consolidated results of operations or cash flows
in particular quarterly or annual periods.

Broker Compensation Litigation

– On October 14, 2004, the New York Attorney General’s Office filed
a civil complaint (the “NYAG Complaint”) against Marsh Inc. and Marsh & McLennan Companies, Inc.
(collectively, “Marsh”) alleging, among other things, that certain insurance companies, including
The Hartford, participated with Marsh in arrangements to submit inflated bids for business
insurance and paid contingent commissions to ensure that Marsh would direct business to them. The
Hartford was not joined as a defendant in the action, which has since settled. Since the filing of
the NYAG Complaint, several private actions have been filed against the Company asserting claims
arising from the allegations of the NYAG Complaint.

Two securities class actions, now consolidated, have been filed in the United States District Court
for the District of Connecticut alleging claims against the Company and certain of its executive
officers under Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act and SEC Rule 10b-5. The consolidated
amended complaint alleges on behalf of a putative class of shareholders that the Company and the
four named individual defendants, as control persons of the Company, failed to disclose to the
investing public that The Hartford’s business and growth was predicated on the unlawful activity
alleged in the NYAG Complaint. The class period alleged is August 6, 2003 through October 13,
2004, the day before the NYAG Complaint was filed. The complaint seeks damages and attorneys’
fees. Defendants filed a motion to dismiss in June 2005, and the Court heard oral argument on
December 22, 2005. The Company and the individual defendants dispute the allegations and intend to
defend these actions vigorously.

Two corporate derivative actions, now consolidated, also have been filed in the same court. The
consolidated amended complaint, brought by a shareholder on behalf of the Company against its
directors and an executive officer, alleges that the defendants knew adverse non-public information
about the activities alleged in the NYAG Complaint and concealed and misappropriated that
information to make profitable stock trades, thereby breaching their fiduciary duties, abusing
their control, committing gross mismanagement, wasting corporate assets, and unjustly enriching
themselves. The complaint seeks damages, injunctive relief, disgorgement, and attorneys’ fees.
Defendants filed a motion to dismiss in May 2005, and the plaintiffs thereafter agreed to stay
further proceedings pending resolution of the motion to dismiss the securities class action. All
defendants dispute the allegations and intend to defend these actions vigorously.

Three consolidated putative class actions filed in the same court on behalf of participants in the
Company’s 401(k) plan, alleging that the Company and other plan fiduciaries breached their
fiduciary duties to plan participants by, among other things, failing to inform them of the risk
associated with investment in the Company’s stock as a result of the activity alleged in the NYAG
Complaint, have been voluntarily dismissed by the plaintiffs without payment.



The Company is also a defendant in a multidistrict litigation in federal district court in New
Jersey. There are two consolidated amended complaints filed in the multidistrict litigation, one
related to alleged conduct in connection with the sale of property-casualty insurance and the other
related to alleged conduct in connection with the sale of group benefits products. The Company and
various of its subsidiaries are named in both complaints. The actions assert, on behalf of a class
of persons who purchased insurance through the broker defendants, claims under the Sherman Act, the
Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (“RICO”), state law, and in the case of the
group benefits complaint, claims under ERISA arising from conduct similar to that alleged in the
NYAG Complaint. The class period alleged is 1994 through the date of class certification, which
has not yet occurred. The complaints seek treble damages, injunctive and declaratory relief, and
attorneys’ fees. The Company also has been named in two similar actions filed in state courts,
which the defendants have removed to federal court. Those actions currently are transferred to the
court presiding over the multidistrict litigation. In addition, the Company was joined as a
defendant in an action by the California Commissioner of Insurance alleging similar conduct by
various insurers in connection with the sale of group benefits products. The Commissioner’s action
asserts claims under California insurance law and seeks injunctive relief only. The Company
disputes the allegations in all of these actions and intends to defend the actions vigorously.

Additional complaints may be filed against the Company in various courts alleging claims under
federal or state law arising from the conduct alleged in the NYAG Complaint. The Company’s
ultimate liability, if any, in the pending and possible future suits is highly uncertain and
subject to contingencies that are not yet known, such as how many suits will be filed, in which
courts they will be lodged, what claims they will assert, what the outcome of investigations by
the New York Attorney General’s Office and other regulatory agencies will be, the success of
defenses that the Company may assert, and the amount of recoverable damages if liability is
established. In the opinion of management, it is possible that an adverse outcome in one or more
of these suits could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s consolidated results of
operations or cash flows in particular quarterly or annual periods.

Fair Credit Reporting Act Putative Class Action

– In October 2001, a complaint was filed in the
United States District Court for the District of Oregon, on behalf of a putative nationwide class
of homeowners and automobile policyholders from 1999 to the present, alleging that the Company
willfully violated the Fair Credit Reporting Act (“FCRA”) by failing to send appropriate notices
to new customers whose initial rates were higher than they would have been had the customer had a
more favorable credit report. In July 2003, the district court granted summary judgment for the
Company, holding that FCRA’s adverse action notice requirement did not apply to the rate first
charged for an initial policy of insurance.

The plaintiff appealed and, in August 2005, a panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the
Ninth Circuit reversed the district court, holding that the adverse action notice requirement
applies to new business and that the Company’s notices, even when sent, contained inadequate
information. Although no court previously had decided the notice requirements applicable to
insurers under FCRA, and the district court had not addressed whether the Company’s alleged
violations of FCRA were willful because it had agreed with the Company’s interpretation of FCRA
and found no violation, the Court of Appeals further held, over a dissent by one of the judges,
that the Company’s failure to send notices conforming to the Court’s opinion constituted a willful
violation of FCRA as a matter of law. FCRA provides for a statutory penalty of $100 to $1,000 per
willful violation. Simultaneously, the Court of Appeals issued decisions in related cases against
four other insurers, reversing the district court and holding that those insurers also had
violated FCRA in similar ways. On October 3, 2005, the Court of Appeals withdrew its opinion in
the Hartford case and issued a revised opinion, which changed certain language of the opinion but
not the outcome.

On October 31, 2005, the Company timely filed a petition for rehearing and for rehearing en banc
in the Ninth Circuit. While that petition was pending, on January 25, 2006, the Court of Appeals
again withdrew its opinion in the Hartford case and issued a second revised opinion. The new
opinion vacated the Court’s earlier ruling that the Company had willfully violated FCRA as a
matter of law and remanded the case to the district court for further proceedings. On remand, the
Company will have an opportunity to present evidence that its conduct was not willful. If the
Company is found not to have acted willfully, statutory penalties will not be available, and the
plaintiff will have to prove actual damages.

No class has been certified, and the Company intends to continue to defend this action vigorously.
The Company’s ultimate liability, if any, in this action is highly uncertain and subject to
contingencies that are not yet known. In the opinion of management, it is possible that an
adverse outcome in this action could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s consolidated
results of operations or cash flows.

Blanket Casualty Treaty Litigation

– The Company is engaged in pending litigation in Connecticut
Superior Court against certain of its upper-layer reinsurers under its Blanket Casualty Treaty
(“BCT”). The BCT is a multi-layered reinsurance program providing excess-of-loss coverage in
various amounts from the 1930s through the 1980s. The upper layers were first placed in 1950,
predominantly with London Market reinsurers, including Lloyd’s syndicates. The action seeks, among
other relief, damages for the reinsurer defendants’ failure to pay certain billings for asbestos
and pollution claims.

In December 2003, the Company entered into a global settlement with MacArthur Company, an asbestos
insulation distributor and installer then in bankruptcy, for $1.15 billion. The Company then billed
the reinsurer defendants under the BCT for $117 of the settlement amount. After the reinsurers
refused to pay the MacArthur billing, the Company amended its complaint to add, among other things,
claims related to that billing. Most of the reinsurer defendants counterclaimed, seeking a
declaration that they did not owe reinsurance for the MacArthur settlement.



The litigation concerns under what circumstances losses arising from multiple claims against a
single insured may be combined and ceded as a single “accident” under the BCT so as to reach the
upper layers of the program. The BCT contains a unique definition of “accident.” The application
of this definition to the ceded losses is the crux of the dispute.

In April 2005, the Superior Court phased the proceedings, providing for a trial of the MacArthur
billing first, in April 2006, with other billings to follow in subsequent trial settings. In
September 2005, the London Market reinsurer defendants moved for summary judgment on the
MacArthur-related claims. After briefing and oral argument, the Superior Court issued a decision
on December 13, 2005, granting the defendants’ motion. The Company has noticed an appeal to the
Connecticut Appellate Court and intends to prosecute its appeal vigorously.

The outcome of the appeal is uncertain. If the decision of the Superior Court is affirmed on
appeal, the Company may be unable to collect not only its billing for the MacArthur settlement but
also other current and future billings to which the same relevant facts and legal analysis would
apply. The Company has recorded gross reinsurance recoveries of asbestos and pollution losses
under the BCT of $586. The Company has considered the risk of non-collection of these recoveries
in its allowance of $335 as of December 31, 2005 for all uncollectible reinsurance recoverables
associated with older, long-term casualty liabilities reported in the Other Operations segment. If
the Company ultimately is unable to collect asbestos and pollution recoveries under the BCT, an
adjustment to decrease the Company’s net reinsurance recoverables would be required in an amount
that would have a material adverse effect on the Company’s consolidated results of operations or
cash flows in a particular quarterly or annual period.

Asbestos and Environmental Claims

– As discussed in Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis
of Financial Condition and Results of Operations under the caption “Other Operations (Including
Asbestos and Environmental Claims)”, The Hartford continues to receive asbestos and environmental
claims that involve significant uncertainty regarding policy coverage issues. Regarding these
claims, The Hartford continually reviews its overall reserve levels and reinsurance coverages, as
well as the methodologies it uses to estimate its exposures. Because of the significant
uncertainties that limit the ability of insurers and reinsurers to estimate the ultimate reserves
necessary for unpaid losses and related expenses, particularly those related to asbestos, the
ultimate liabilities may exceed the currently recorded reserves. Any such additional liability
cannot be reasonably estimated now but could be material to The Hartford’s consolidated operating
results, financial condition and liquidity.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

(Dollar amounts in millions, except for per share data, unless otherwise stated)

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (“MD&A”)
addresses the financial condition of The Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc. and its
subsidiaries (collectively, “The Hartford” or the “Company”) as of December 31, 2005, compared
with December 31, 2004, and its results of operations for each of the three years in the period
ended December 31, 2005. This discussion should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated
Financial Statements and related Notes beginning on page F-1. Certain reclassifications have been
made to prior year financial information to conform to the current year presentation.

Certain of the statements contained herein are forward-looking statements. These forward-looking
statements are made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation
Reform Act of 1995 and include estimates and assumptions related to economic, competitive and
legislative developments. These forward-looking statements are subject to change and uncertainty
which are, in many instances, beyond the Company’s control and have been made based upon
management’s expectations and beliefs concerning future developments and their potential effect
upon the Company. There can be no assurance that future developments will be in accordance with
management’s expectations or that the effect of future developments on The Hartford will be those
anticipated by management. Actual results could differ materially from those expected by the
Company, depending on the outcome of various factors, including, but not limited to, those set
forth in Item 1A, Risk Factors. These factors include: the difficulty in predicting the Company’s
potential exposure for asbestos and environmental claims; the possible occurrence of terrorist
attacks; the response of reinsurance companies under reinsurance contracts and the availability,
pricing and adequacy of reinsurance to protect the Company against losses; changes in the stock
markets, interest rates or other financial markets, including the potential effect on the Company’s
statutory capital levels; the inability to effectively mitigate the impact of equity market
volatility on the Company’s financial position and results of operations arising from obligations
under annuity product guarantees; the Company’s potential exposure arising out of regulatory
proceedings or private claims relating to incentive compensation or payments made to brokers or
other producers and alleged anti-competitive conduct; the uncertain effect on the Company of
regulatory and market-driven changes in practices relating to the payment of incentive compensation
to brokers and other producers, including changes that have been announced and those which may
occur in the future; the possibility of unfavorable loss development; the incidence and severity of
catastrophes, both natural and man-made; stronger than anticipated competitive activity;
unfavorable judicial or legislative developments; the potential effect of domestic and foreign
regulatory developments, including those which could increase the Company’s business costs and
required capital levels; the possibility of general economic and business conditions that are less
favorable than anticipated; the Company’s ability to distribute its products through distribution
channels, both current and future; the uncertain effects of emerging claim and coverage issues; a
downgrade in the Company’s financial strength or credit ratings; the ability of the Company’s
subsidiaries to pay dividends to the Company; and other factors described in such forward-looking
statements.

OVERVIEW

The Hartford is a diversified insurance and financial services company with operations dating
back to 1810. The Company is headquartered in Connecticut and is organized into two major
operations: Life and Property & Casualty, each containing reporting segments. In the quarter ended
December 31, 2005, and as more fully described below, the Company changed its reporting segments to
reflect the current manner by which its chief operating decision maker views and manages the
business. All segment data for prior reporting periods have been adjusted to reflect the current
segment reporting. Within the Life and Property & Casualty operations, The Hartford conducts
business principally in ten operating segments. Additionally, Corporate primarily includes all of
the Company’s debt financing and related interest expense, as well as certain capital raising
activities and purchase accounting adjustments.

Life has realigned its reportable operating segments during 2005 to include six reportable
operating segments: Retail Products Group (“Retail”), Retirement Plans, Institutional Solutions
Group (“Institutional”), Individual Life, Group Benefits and International. Through Life the
Company provides investment and retirement products such as variable and fixed annuities, mutual
funds and retirement plan services; other institutional investment products; structured
settlements; private placement life insurance; individual life insurance



products including variable universal life, universal life, interest sensitive whole life and term
life; and group benefit products, such as group life and group disability insurance.

Property & Casualty is organized into four reportable operating segments: the underwriting segments
of Business Insurance, Personal Lines and Specialty Commercial (collectively “Ongoing Operations”),
and the Other Operations segment. Through Property & Casualty the Company provides a number of
coverages, as well as insurance-related services, to businesses throughout the United States,
including workers’ compensation, property, automobile, liability, umbrella, specialty casualty,
marine, livestock, bond, professional liability and director’s and officer’s liability coverages.
Property & Casualty also provides automobile, homeowners, and home-based business coverage to
individuals throughout the United States, as well as insurance-related services to businesses.

Many of the principal factors that drive the profitability of The Hartford’s Life and Property &
Casualty operations are separate and distinct. Management considers this diversification to be a
strength of The Hartford that distinguishes the Company from many of its peers. To present its
operations in a more meaningful and organized way, management has included separate overviews
within the Life and Property & Casualty sections of MD&A. For further overview of Life’s
profitability and analysis, see page 43. For further overview of Property & Casualty’s
profitability and analysis, see page 58.

Regulatory Developments

In June 2004, the Company received a subpoena from the New York Attorney General’s Office in
connection with its inquiry into compensation arrangements between brokers and carriers. In
mid-September 2004 and subsequently, the Company has received additional subpoenas from the New
York Attorney General’s Office, which relate more specifically to possible anti-competitive
activity among brokers and insurers. Since the beginning of October 2004, the Company has received
subpoenas or other information requests from Attorneys General and regulatory agencies in more than
a dozen jurisdictions regarding broker compensation and possible anti-competitive activity. The
Company may receive additional subpoenas and other information requests from Attorneys General or
other regulatory agencies regarding similar issues. In addition, the Company has received a
request for information from the New York Attorney General’s Office concerning the Company’s
compensation arrangements in connection with the administration of workers compensation plans. The
Company intends to continue cooperating fully with these investigations, and is conducting an
internal review, with the assistance of outside counsel, regarding broker compensation issues in
its Property & Casualty and Group Benefits operations.

On October 14, 2004, the New York Attorney General’s Office filed a civil complaint against Marsh &
McLennan Companies, Inc., and Marsh, Inc. (collectively, “Marsh”). The complaint alleges, among
other things, that certain insurance companies, including the Company, participated with Marsh in
arrangements to submit inflated bids for business insurance and paid contingent commissions to
ensure that Marsh would direct business to them. The Company was not joined as a defendant in the
action, which has since settled. Although no regulatory action has been initiated against the
Company in connection with the allegations described in the civil complaint, it is possible that
the New York Attorney General’s Office or one or more other regulatory agencies may pursue action
against the Company or one or more of its employees in the future. The potential timing of any
such action is difficult to predict. If such an action is brought, it could have a material
adverse effect on the Company.

On October 29, 2004, the New York Attorney General’s Office informed the Company that the Attorney
General is conducting an investigation with respect to the timing of the previously disclosed sale
by Thomas Marra, a director and executive officer of the Company, of 217,074 shares of the
Company’s common stock on September 21, 2004. The sale occurred shortly after the issuance of two
additional subpoenas dated September 17, 2004 by the New York Attorney General’s Office. The
Company has engaged outside counsel to review the circumstances related to the transaction and is
fully cooperating with the New York Attorney General’s Office. On the basis of the review, the
Company has determined that Mr. Marra complied with the Company’s applicable internal trading
procedures and has found no indication that Mr. Marra was aware of the additional subpoenas at the
time of the sale.

There continues to be significant federal and state regulatory activity relating to financial
services companies, particularly mutual funds companies. These regulatory inquiries have focused
on a number of mutual fund issues, including market timing and late trading, revenue sharing and
directed brokerage, fees, transfer agents and other fund service providers, and other mutual-fund
related issues. The Company has received requests for information and subpoenas from the SEC,
subpoenas from the New York Attorney General’s Office, a subpoena from the Connecticut Attorney
General’s Office, requests for information from the Connecticut Securities and Investments Division
of the Department of Banking, and requests for information from the New York Department of
Insurance, in each case requesting documentation and other information regarding various mutual
fund regulatory issues. The Company continues to cooperate fully with these regulators in these
matters.

The SEC’s Division of Enforcement and the New York Attorney General’s Office are investigating
aspects of the Company’s variable annuity and mutual fund operations related to market timing. The
Company continues to cooperate fully with the SEC and the New York Attorney General’s Office in
these matters. The Company’s mutual funds are available for purchase by the separate accounts of
different variable universal life insurance policies, variable annuity products, and funding
agreements, and they are offered directly to certain qualified retirement plans. Although existing
products contain transfer restrictions between subaccounts, some products, particularly older
variable annuity products, do not contain restrictions on the frequency of transfers. In addition,
as a result of the settlement of litigation against the Company with respect to certain owners of
older variable annuity contracts, the Company’s ability to restrict transfers by these owners has,
until recently, been limited. The Company has executed an agreement with the parties to the
previously settled litigation which, together with separate agreements between these contract
owners and their broker, has resulted in the exchange or surrender of substantially all of the
variable annuity contracts that were the subject of the previously settled litigation. Pursuant to
an agreement in principle reached in February 2005 with the Board of Directors of the mutual funds,
the Company has



indemnified the affected mutual funds for material harm deemed to have been caused to the funds by
frequent trading by these owners for the period from January 2, 2004 through December 31, 2005.
The Company does not expect to incur additional costs pursuant to this agreement in principle in
light of the exchange or surrender of these variable annuity contracts.

The SEC’s Division of Enforcement also is investigating aspects of the Company’s variable annuity
and mutual fund operations related to directed brokerage and revenue sharing. The Company
discontinued the use of directed brokerage in recognition of mutual fund sales in late 2003. The
Company continues to cooperate fully with the SEC in these matters.

The Company has received subpoenas from the New York Attorney General’s Office and the Connecticut
Attorney General’s Office requesting information relating to the Company’s group annuity products,
including single premium group annuities used in maturity or terminal funding programs. These
subpoenas seek information about how various group annuity products are sold, how the Company
selects mutual funds offered as investment options in certain group annuity products, and how
brokers selling the Company’s group annuity products are compensated. The Company continues to
cooperate fully with these regulators in these matters.

To date, none of the SEC’s and New York Attorney General’s market timing investigation, the SEC’s
directed brokerage investigation, or the New York Attorney General’s and Connecticut Attorney
General’s single premium group annuity investigation has resulted in the initiation of any formal
action against the Company by these regulators. However, the Company believes that the SEC, the
New York Attorney General’s Office, and the Connecticut Attorney General’s Office are likely to
take some action against the Company at the conclusion of the respective investigations. The
Company is engaged in active discussions with the SEC, the New York Attorney General’s Office and
the Connecticut Attorney General’s Office. The potential timing of any resolution of any of these
matters or the initiation of any formal action by any of these regulators is difficult to predict.
The Company recorded a charge of $66, after-tax, to establish a reserve for the market timing and
directed brokerage matters in the first quarter of 2005. Based on recent developments, the Company
recorded an additional charge of $36, after-tax, in the fourth quarter of 2005 to increase the
reserve for the market timing, directed brokerage and single premium group annuity matters. This
reserve is an estimate; in view of the uncertainties regarding the outcome of these regulatory
investigations, as well as the tax-deductibility of payments, it is possible that the ultimate cost
to the Company of these matters could exceed the reserve by an amount that would have a material
adverse effect on the Company’s consolidated results of operations or cash flows in a particular
quarterly or annual period.

On May 24, 2005, the Company received a subpoena from the Connecticut Attorney General’s Office
seeking information about the Company’s participation in finite reinsurance transactions in which
there was no substantial transfer of risk between the parties. The Company is cooperating fully
with the Connecticut Attorney General’s Office in this matter.

On June 23, 2005, the Company received a subpoena from the New York Attorney General’s Office
requesting information relating to purchases of the Company’s variable annuity products, or
exchanges of other products for the Company’s variable annuity products, by New York residents who
were 65 or older at the time of the purchase or exchange. On August 25, 2005, the Company received
an additional subpoena from the New York Attorney General’s Office requesting information relating
to purchases of or exchanges into the Company’s variable annuity products by New York residents
during the past five years where the purchase or exchange was funded using funds from a
tax-qualified plan or where the variable annuity purchased or exchanged for was a sub-account of a
tax-qualified plan or was subsequently put into a tax-qualified plan. The Company is cooperating
fully with the New York Attorney General’s Office in these matters.

On July 14, 2005, the Company received an additional subpoena from the Connecticut Attorney
General’s Office concerning the Company’s structured settlement business. This subpoena requests
information about the Company’s sale of annuity products for structured settlements, and about the
ways in which brokers are compensated in connection with the sale of these products. The Company is
cooperating fully with the New York Attorney General’s Office and the Connecticut Attorney
General’s Office in these matters.

The Company has received a request for information from the New York Attorney General’s Office
about issues relating to the reporting of workers’ compensation premium. The Company is
cooperating fully with the New York Attorney General’s Office in this matter.

Broker Compensation

As the Company has disclosed previously, the Company pays brokers and independent agents
commissions and other forms of incentive compensation in connection with the sale of many of the
Company’s insurance products. Since the New York Attorney General’s Office filed a civil complaint
against Marsh on October 14, 2004, several of the largest national insurance brokers, including
Marsh, Aon Corporation and Willis Group Holdings Limited, have announced that they have
discontinued the use of contingent compensation arrangements. Other industry participants may make
similar, or different, determinations in the future. In addition, legal, legislative, regulatory,
business or other developments may require changes to industry practices relating to incentive
compensation. At this time, it is not possible to predict the effect of these announced or
potential changes on the Company’s business or distribution strategies.



CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES

The preparation of financial statements, in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”), requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent
assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues
and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

The Company has identified the following estimates as critical in that they involve a higher degree
of judgment and are subject to a significant degree of variability: property and casualty reserves
for unpaid claims and claim adjustment expenses, net of reinsurance; Life deferred policy
acquisition costs and present value of future profits associated with variable annuity and other
universal life-type contracts; the evaluation of other-than-temporary impairments on investments in
available-for-sale securities; the valuation of guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefit derivatives;
pension and other postretirement benefit obligations; and contingencies relating to corporate
litigation and regulatory matters. In developing these estimates management makes subjective and
complex judgments that are inherently uncertain and subject to material change as facts and
circumstances develop. Although variability is inherent in these estimates, management believes
the amounts provided are appropriate based upon the facts available upon compilation of the
financial statements.

Property & Casualty Reserves, Net of Reinsurance

The Hartford establishes property and casualty reserves to provide for the estimated costs of
paying claims under insurance policies written by the Company. These reserves include estimates
for both claims that have been reported and those that have been incurred but not reported, and
include estimates of all expenses associated with processing and settling these claims. Estimating
the ultimate cost of future claims and claim adjustment expenses is an uncertain and complex
process. This estimation process is based largely on the assumption that past developments are an
appropriate predictor of future events and involves a variety of actuarial techniques that analyze
experience, trends and other relevant factors. Reserve estimates can change over time because of
unexpected changes in the external environment. Potential external factors include (1) changes in
the inflation rate for goods and services related to covered damages such as medical care, hospital
care, auto parts, wages and home repair, (2) changes in the general economic environment that could
cause unanticipated changes in the claim frequency per unit insured, (3) changes in the litigation
environment as evidenced by changes in claimant attorney representation in the claims negotiation
and settlement process, (4) changes in the judicial environment regarding the interpretation of
policy provisions relating to the determination of coverage and/or the amount of damages awarded
for certain types of damages, (5) changes in the social environment regarding the general attitude
of juries in the determination of liability and damages, (6) changes in the legislative environment
regarding the definition of damages and (7) new types of injuries caused by new types of injurious
exposure: past examples include breast implants, lead paint and construction defects. Reserve
estimates can also change over time because of changes in internal company operations. Potential
internal factors include (1) periodic changes in claims handling procedures, (2) growth in new
lines of business where exposure and loss development patterns are not well established or (3)
changes in the quality of risk selection in the underwriting process. In the case of assumed
reinsurance, all of the above risks apply. In addition, changes in ceding company case reserving
and reporting patterns can create additional factors that need to be considered in estimating the
reserves. Due to the inherent complexity of the assumptions used, final claim settlements may vary
significantly from the present estimates, particularly when those settlements may not occur until
well into the future.

Through both facultative and treaty reinsurance agreements, the Company cedes a share of the risks
it has underwritten to other insurance companies. The Company’s net reserves for loss and loss
adjustment expenses include anticipated recovery from reinsurers on unpaid claims. The estimated
amount of the anticipated recovery, or reinsurance recoverable, is net of an allowance for
uncollectible reinsurance.

Reinsurance recoverables include an estimate of the amount of gross loss and loss adjustment
expense reserves that may be ceded under the terms of the reinsurance agreements, including
incurred but not reported unpaid losses. The Company calculates its ceded reinsurance projection
based on the terms of any applicable facultative and treaty reinsurance, including an estimate of
how incurred but not reported losses will ultimately be ceded by reinsurance agreement.
Accordingly, the Company’s estimate of reinsurance recoverables is subject to similar risks and
uncertainties as the estimate of the gross reserve for unpaid claim and claim adjustment expenses.

The Company provides an allowance for uncollectible reinsurance, reflecting management’s current
estimate of reinsurance cessions that may be uncollectible in the future due to reinsurers’
unwillingness or inability to pay and contemplates recoveries under ceded reinsurance contracts and
settlements of disputes that could be different than the ceded liabilities. The Company analyzes
recent developments in commutation activity between reinsurers and cedants, recent trends in
arbitration and litigation outcomes in disputes between reinsurers and cedants and the overall
credit quality of the Company’s reinsurers. Where its contracts permit, the Company secures future
claim obligations with various forms of collateral, including irrevocable letters of credit,
secured trusts, funds held accounts and group-wide offsets. The allowance for uncollectible
reinsurance was $413 as of December 31, 2005, including $335 related to Other Operations and $78
related to Ongoing Operations.

Due to the inherent uncertainties as to collection and the length of time before reinsurance
recoverables become due, it is possible that future adjustments to the Company’s reinsurance
recoverables, net of the allowance, could be required, which could have a material adverse effect
on the Company’s consolidated results of operations or cash flows in a particular quarter or annual
period.

The Hartford, like other insurance companies, categorizes and tracks its insurance reserves for its
segments by “line of business”, such as property, auto physical damage, auto liability, commercial
multi-peril package business, workers’ compensation, general liability



professional liability and bond. Furthermore, The Hartford regularly reviews the appropriateness
of reserve levels at the line of business level, taking into consideration the variety of trends
that impact the ultimate settlement of claims for the subsets of claims in each particular line of
business. In addition, within the Other Operations segment, the Company has reserves for asbestos
and environmental (A&E) claims. Adjustments to previously established reserves, which may be
material, are reflected in the operating results of the period in which the adjustment is
determined to be necessary. In the judgment of management, information currently available has
been properly considered in the reserves established for claims and claim adjustment expenses.
Incurred but not reported (IBNR) reserves represent the difference between the estimated
ultimate cost of all claims and the actual reported loss and loss adjustment expenses (“reported
losses”). Reported losses represent cumulative loss and loss adjustment expenses paid plus case
reserves for outstanding reported claims. Company actuaries evaluate the total reserves (IBNR and
case reserves) on an accident year basis. An accident year is the calendar year in which a loss is
incurred, or, in the case of claims-made policies, the calendar year in which a loss is reported.

Reserving for non-A&E reserves within Ongoing and Other Operations

How non-A&E reserves are set

Reserves are set by line of business within the various operating segments. As indicated in the
above table, a single line of business may be written in one or more of the segments. Case
reserves are established by a claims handler on each individual claim and are adjusted as new
information becomes known during the course of handling the claim. Lines of business for which loss
data (e.g. paid losses and case reserves) emerge (i.e. is reported) over a long period of time are
referred to as long-tail lines of business. Lines of business for which loss data emerge more
quickly are referred to as short-tail lines of business. Within the Company’s Ongoing Operations
the shortest-tail lines of business are property and auto physical damage. The longest tail lines
of business within Ongoing Operations include workers’ compensation, general liability, and
professional liability. Assumed reinsurance, which is within Other Operations, is also long-tail
business.

Company reserving actuaries, who are independent of the business units, regularly review reserves
for both current and prior accident years using the most current claim data. These quarterly
reserve reviews incorporate a variety of actuarial methods and judgments and involve rigorous
analysis. For most lines of business, a variety of actuarial methods are reviewed and the
actuaries select methods and specific assumptions appropriate for each line of business based on
the current circumstances affecting that line of business. These selections incorporate input, as
judged by the reserving actuaries to be appropriate, from claims personnel, pricing actuaries and
operating management on reported loss cost trends and other factors that could affect the reserve
estimates. The output of the quarterly reserve reviews are reserve estimates that are referred to
herein as the “actuarial indication.”

For short-tail lines of business, emergence of paid loss and case reserves is credible and likely
indicative of ultimate losses. The method used to set reserves for these lines incorporates two
key assumptions. The first key assumption is an expected loss ratio for the current accident year.
This loss ratio is determined through a review of prior accident years’ loss ratios and expected
changes to earned pricing, loss costs, mix of business, ceded reinsurance and other factors that
are expected to impact the loss ratio for the current accident year. The second key assumption is
a development pattern for reported losses (also referred to as the loss emergence pattern). IBNR
reserves for the current year are set as the product of the expected loss ratio for the period,
earned premium for the period and the proportion of losses expected to be reported in future
calendar periods for the current accident period. IBNR reserves for prior accident years are
similarly determined, again relying on an expected development pattern for reported losses.

For long-tail lines of business, emergence of paid losses and case reserves is less credible in the
early periods and, accordingly may not be indicative of ultimate losses. For these lines, methods
which rely on actual paid losses and case reserves and incorporate a development pattern assumption
are given less weight in calculating IBNR reserves for the early stages of loss emergence because
such



a low percentage of ultimate losses are reported in that time frame. Accordingly, for any given
accident year, the rate at which losses emerge in the early periods is generally not as reliable an
indication of the ultimate loss costs as it would be for shorter-tail lines of business. The
estimation of reserves for these lines of business in the early stages of loss emergence is
therefore largely influenced by prior accident years’ loss ratios and expected changes to earned
pricing, loss costs, mix of business, ceded reinsurance and other factors that are expected to
affect the loss ratio. For later periods of loss emergence, methods which incorporate actual paid
losses and case reserves and a development pattern assumption are given more weight in estimating
ultimate losses.

The final step in the quarterly reserve review involves a comprehensive review by senior reserving
actuaries who apply their judgment and, in concert with senior management, determine the
appropriate level of reserves to record. Numerous factors are considered in this determination
process including, but not limited to, the assessed reliability of key loss trends and assumptions
that may be significantly influencing the current actuarial indications, the maturity of the
accident year, pertinent trends observed over the recent past, the level of volatility within a
particular line of business, and the improvement or deterioration of actuarial indications in the
current period as compared to the prior periods. In general, changes are made more quickly to more
mature accident years and less volatile lines of business. At year-end 2005, total recorded net
reserves excluding asbestos and environmental and excluding the allowance for uncollectible
reinsurance are 0.6% higher than the actuarial indication of the reserves. Annually, as part of
the statutory reporting requirements, IBNR is allocated to accident year by statutory line of
business. This work forms the basis for the loss development table and reserve re-estimates table
shown in the “Business” section.

During 2005, there were numerous changes to reserve estimates. Among other loss developments in
2005, these changes included strengthening of workers’ compensation reserves for claim payments
expected to emerge after 20 years of development, a release of 2003 and 2004 accident year workers’
compensation reserves, strengthening of assumed casualty reinsurance reserves and a release of
reserves for allocated loss adjustment expenses, predominately in Personal Lines. See “Reserves”
within the Property and Casualty MD&A for further discussion of reserve developments.

Current trends contributing to reserve uncertainty

The Hartford is a multi-line company in the property and casualty business. The Hartford is
therefore subject to reserve uncertainty stemming from a number of conditions, including but not
limited to those noted above, any of which could be material at any point in time for any segment.
Certain issues may become more or less important over time as conditions change. As various market
conditions develop, management must assess whether those conditions constitute a long-term trend
that should result in a reserving action (i.e. increasing or decreasing the reserve). Below is a
discussion of certain market conditions that Company management has observed during 2005.

Within the commercial segments and the Other Operations segment, the Company has exposure to
claims asserted for bodily injury as a result of long-term or continuous exposure to harmful
products or substances. Examples include, but are not limited to, pharmaceutical products, latex
gloves, silica and lead paint. The Company also has exposure to claims from construction defects,
where property damage or bodily injury from negligent construction is alleged. The Company also
has exposure to claims asserted against religious institutions and other organizations relating to
molestation or abuse. Such exposures may involve potentially long latency periods and may
implicate coverage in multiple policy periods. These factors make reserves for such claims more
uncertain than other bodily injury or property damage claims. With regard to these exposures, the
Company is monitoring trends in litigation, the external environment, the similarities to other
mass torts and the potential impact on the Company’s reserves.

In Personal Lines, reserving estimates are generally less variable than for the Company’s other
property and casualty segments. This is largely due to the coverages having relatively shorter
periods of loss emergence. Estimates, however, can still vary due to a number of factors,
including interpretations of frequency and severity trends and their impact on recorded reserve
levels. Severity trends can be impacted by changes in internal claim handling and case reserving
practices in addition to changes in the external environment. These changes in claim practices
increase the uncertainty in the interpretation of case reserve data, which increases the
uncertainty in recorded reserve levels. In addition, the success of the Company’s new Dimensions
class plan for automobile first introduced in 2004 has lead to a different mix of business by type
of insured than the Company experienced in the past. In general, the Company now has a lower
proportion of preferred risks than in the past. Such a change in mix increases the uncertainty of
the reserve projections, since historical data and reporting patterns may not be applicable to the
new business.

In Business Insurance, workers’ compensation is the Company’s single biggest line of business and
the line of business with the longest pattern of loss emergence. Reserve estimates for workers’
compensation are particularly sensitive to assumptions about medical inflation, which has been
increasing steadily over the past few years. In addition, changes in state legislative and
regulatory environments impact the Company’s estimates. These changes increase the uncertainty in
the application of development patterns.

In the Specialty Commercial segment, many lines of insurance, such as excess insurance and large
deductible workers’ compensation insurance are “long-tail” lines of insurance. For long-tail
lines, the period of time between the incidence of the insured loss and either the reporting of the
claim to the insurer, the settlement of the claim, or the payment of the claim can be substantial,
and in some cases, several years. As a result of this extended period of time for losses to
emerge, reserve estimates for these lines are more uncertain (i.e. more variable) than reserve
estimates for shorter-tail lines of insurance. Estimating required reserve levels for large
deductible workers’ compensation insurance is further complicated by the uncertainty of whether
losses that are attributable to the deductible amount can be paid by the insured; if such losses
are not paid by the insured due to financial difficulties, the Company would be contractually
liable. Another example of reserve variability relates to reserves for directors and officers
insurance. There is uncertainty in the required level of reserves due to the impact of recent
allegations within the financial services industry, including those in the mutual fund, investment
banking and insurance industries.



Within Ongoing Operations, the Company has reserves for natural catastrophes that have occurred.
The Company’s estimates of loss and loss expenses arising from catastrophe losses are based on
information from reported claims, information from catastrophe loss models and estimates of
reinsurance recoverables on ceded losses. For catastrophe losses that occur shortly before the end
of the reporting period, the loss and loss expense reserves rely heavily on estimates derived from
catastrophe loss models and previous experience and, therefore, are subject to significant
uncertainty. For large catastrophes, such as with hurricane Katrina in 2005, there may be a long
time lag between the date the catastrophe occurs and the date that residents and business owners
are able to return to their properties to report a claim. In addition, it is sometimes difficult
for claim adjusters to access the most significantly impacted areas. Estimating reserves for
catastrophes is further complicated by the need to estimate the effect of anticipated “demand
surge” which is the tendency for the cost of building materials and contractors to rise based on an
increase in demand in the affected areas.

Impact of changes in key assumptions on reserve volatility

As stated above, the Company’s practice is to estimate reserves using a variety of methods,
assumptions and data elements. Within its reserve estimation process for reserves other
than asbestos and environmental, the Company does not derive statistical loss distributions or
confidence levels around its reserve estimate and, as a result, does not have reserve range
estimates to disclose.

The reserve estimation process includes explicit assumptions about a number of factors in the
internal and external environment. Across most lines of business, the most important assumptions
are future loss development factors applied to paid or reported losses to date. For most lines,
the reported loss development factor is most important. In workers’ compensation, paid loss
development factors are also important. The trend in loss costs is also a key assumption,
particularly in the most recent accident years, where loss development factors are less credible.

The following discussion includes disclosure of possible variation from current estimates of loss
reserves due to a change in certain key assumptions. Each of the impacts described below is
estimated individually, without consideration for any correlation among key assumptions or among
lines of business. Therefore, it would be inappropriate to take each of the amounts described
below and add them together in an attempt to estimate volatility for the Company’s reserves in
total. The estimated variation in reserves due to changes in key assumptions is a reasonable
estimate of possible variation that may occur in the future, likely over a period of several
calendar years. It is important to note that the variation discussed is not meant to be a
worst-case scenario, and therefore, it is possible that future variation may be more than amounts
discussed below.

Recorded reserves for workers’ compensation, net of reinsurance, are $5.0 billion, across Business
Insurance and Specialty Commercial. The two most important assumptions for workers’ compensation
reserves are loss development factors and loss cost trends, particularly medical cost inflation.
Loss development patterns are dependent on medical cost inflation. Approximately half of the
workers’ compensation net reserves are related to future medical costs. A review of National
Council on Compensation Insurance (“NCCI”) data suggests that the annual growth in industry
medical claim costs has varied from -2% to +12% since 1991. Across the entire reserve base, a 1
point change in calendar year medical inflation would change the estimated net reserve by $600, in
either direction.

Recorded reserves for auto liability, net of reinsurance, are $2.2 billion across all lines, $1.5
billion of which is in Personal Lines. Personal auto liability reserves are shorter-tailed than
other lines of business (such as workers’ compensation) and, therefore, less volatile. However,
the size of the reserve base means that future changes in estimate could be material to the
Company’s results of operations in any given period. The key assumption for Personal Lines auto
liability is the annual loss cost trend, particularly the severity trend component of loss costs.
A review of Insurance Services Office (“ISO”) data suggests that annual growth in industry
severity since 1999 has varied from +1% to +6%. A 2.5 point change in assumed annual severity is
within historical variation for the industry and for the Company. A 2.5 point change in assumed
annual severity for the two most recent accident years would change the estimated net reserve need
by $70, in either direction. Assumed annual severity for accident years prior to the two most
recent accident years is likely to have minimal variability.

Recorded reserves for general liability, net of reinsurance, are $1.9 billion across Business
Insurance and Specialty Commercial. Reported loss development patterns are a key assumption for
this line of business, particularly for more mature accident years. Historically, assumptions on
reported loss development patterns have been impacted by, among other things, emergence of new
types of claims (e.g. construction defect claims) or a shift in the mixture between smaller, more
routine claims and larger, more complex claims. The Company has reviewed the historical variation
in reported loss development patterns. If the reported loss development patterns change by 10%, a
change that is within historical variation, the estimated net reserve need would change by $300,
in either direction.

Similar to general liability, assumed casualty reinsurance is affected by reported loss development
pattern assumptions. In addition to the items identified above that would affect both direct and
reinsurance liability claim development patterns, there is also an impact to assumed reporting
patterns for any changes in claim notification from ceding companies to the reinsurer. Recorded
net reserves for assumed reinsurance business, excluding asbestos and environmental liabilities,
within Other Operations were $1.1 billion as of December 31, 2005. If the development patterns
underlying the Company’s net reserves for HartRe assumed casualty reinsurance are incorrect by 10
points, the estimated net reserve need would change by $287, in either direction.



Reserving for Asbestos and Environmental Claims within Other Operations

How A&E reserves are set

The Company continues to receive asbestos and environmental claims. Asbestos claims relate
primarily to bodily injuries asserted by people who came in contact with asbestos or products
containing asbestos. Environmental claims relate primarily to pollution and related clean-up costs.

The Company wrote several different categories of insurance contracts that may cover asbestos and
environmental claims. First, the Company wrote primary policies providing the first layer of
coverage in an insured’s liability program. Second, the Company wrote excess policies providing
higher layers of coverage for losses that exhaust the limits of underlying coverage. Third, the
Company acted as a reinsurer assuming a portion of those risks assumed by other insurers writing
primary, excess and reinsurance coverages. Fourth, subsidiaries of the Company participated in the
London Market, writing both direct insurance and assumed reinsurance business.

In establishing reserves for asbestos claims, the Company evaluates its insureds’ estimated
liabilities for such claims using a ground-up approach. The Company considers a variety of
factors, including the jurisdictions where underlying claims have been brought, past, pending and
anticipated future claim activity, disease mix, past settlement values of similar claims, dismissal
rates, allocated claim adjustment expense, and potential bankruptcy impact.

Similarly, a ground-up exposure review approach is used to establish environmental reserves. The
Company’s evaluation of its insureds’ estimated liabilities for environmental claims involves
consideration of several factors, including historical values of similar claims, the number of
sites involved, the insureds’ alleged activities at each site, the alleged environmental damage at
each site, the respective shares of liability of potentially responsible parties at each site, the
appropriateness and cost of remediation at each site, the nature of governmental enforcement
activities at each site, and potential bankruptcy impact.

Having evaluated its insureds’ probable liabilities for asbestos and/or environmental claims, the
Company then evaluates its insureds’ insurance coverage programs for such claims. The Company
considers its insureds’ total available insurance coverage, including the coverage issued by the
Company. The Company also considers relevant judicial interpretations of policy language and
applicable coverage defenses or determinations, if any.

Evaluation of both the insureds’ estimated liabilities and the Company’s exposure to the insureds
depends heavily on an analysis of the relevant legal issues and litigation environment. This
analysis is conducted by the Company’s lawyers and is subject to applicable privileges.

For both asbestos and environmental reserves, the Company also compares its historical direct net
loss and expense paid and incurred experience, and net loss and expense paid and incurred
experience year by year, to assess any emerging trends, fluctuations or characteristics suggested
by the aggregate paid and incurred activity.

Once the gross ultimate exposure for indemnity and allocated claim adjustment expense is determined
for its insureds by each policy year, the Company calculates its ceded reinsurance projection based
on any applicable facultative and treaty reinsurance and the Company’s experience with reinsurance
collections.

Uncertainties Regarding Adequacy of Asbestos and Environmental Reserves

With regard to both environmental and particularly asbestos claims, significant uncertainty limits
the ability of insurers and reinsurers to estimate the ultimate reserves necessary for unpaid
losses and related expenses. Traditional actuarial reserving techniques cannot reasonably estimate
the ultimate cost of these claims, particularly during periods where theories of law are in flux.
The degree of variability of reserve estimates for these exposures is significantly greater than
for other more traditional exposures. In particular, the Company believes there is a high degree
of uncertainty inherent in the estimation of asbestos loss reserves.

In the case of the reserves for asbestos exposures, factors contributing to the high degree of
uncertainty include inadequate loss development patterns, plaintiffs’ expanding theories of
liability, the risks inherent in major litigation, and inconsistent emerging legal doctrines.
Furthermore, over time, insurers, including the Company, have experienced significant changes in
the rate at which asbestos claims are brought, the claims experience of particular insureds, and
the value of claims, making predictions of future exposure from past experience uncertain. For
example, in the past few years, insurers in general, including the Company, have experienced an
increase in the number of asbestos-related claims due to, among other things, plaintiffs’ increased
focus on new and previously peripheral defendants and an increase in the number of insureds seeking
bankruptcy protection as a result of asbestos-related liabilities. Plaintiffs and insureds have
sought to use bankruptcy proceedings, including “pre-packaged” bankruptcies, to accelerate and
increase loss payments by insurers. In addition, some policyholders have asserted new classes of
claims for coverages to which an aggregate limit of liability may not apply. Further
uncertainties include insolvencies of other carriers and unanticipated developments
pertaining to the Company’s ability to recover reinsurance for asbestos and environmental claims.
Management believes these issues are not likely to be resolved in the near future.

In the case of the reserves for environmental exposures, factors contributing to the high degree of
uncertainty include expanding theories of liability and damages; the risks inherent in major
litigation; inconsistent decisions concerning the existence and scope of coverage for environmental
claims; and uncertainty as to the monetary amount being sought by the claimant from the
insured.



It is also not possible to predict changes in the legal and legislative environment and their
effect on the future development of asbestos and environmental claims. It is unknown whether
potential Federal asbestos-related legislation will be enacted or what its effect would be on the
Company’s aggregate asbestos liabilities.

The reporting pattern for assumed reinsurance claims, including those related to asbestos and
environmental claims is much longer than for direct claims. In many instances, it takes months or
years to determine that the policyholder’s own obligations have been met and how the reinsurance in
question may apply to such claims. The delay in reporting reinsurance claims and exposures adds to
the uncertainty of estimating the related reserves.

Given the factors and emerging trends described above, the Company believes the actuarial tools and
other techniques it employs to estimate the ultimate cost of claims for more traditional kinds of
insurance exposure are less precise in estimating reserves for its asbestos and environmental
exposures. For this reason, the Company relies on exposure-based analysis to estimate the ultimate
costs of these claims and regularly evaluates new information in assessing its potential asbestos
and environmental exposures.

A number of factors affect the variability of estimates for asbestos and environmental reserves
including assumptions with respect to the frequency of claims, the average severity of those claims
settled with payment, the dismissal rate of claims with no payment and the expense to indemnity
ratio. The uncertainty with respect to the underlying reserve assumptions for asbestos and
environmental adds a greater degree of variability to these reserve estimates than reserve
estimates for more traditional exposures. While this variability is reflected in part in the size
of the range of reserves developed by the Company, that range may still not be indicative of the
potential variance between the ultimate outcome and the recorded reserves. The recorded net
reserves as of December 31, 2005 of $2.7 billion ($2.3 billion and $360 for asbestos and
environmental, respectively) is within an estimated range, unadjusted for covariance, of $2.0
billion to $3.1 billion. The process of estimating asbestos and environmental reserves remains
subject to a wide variety of uncertainties, which are detailed in Note 12 of Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements. Due to these uncertainties, further developments could cause the Company to
change its estimates and ranges of its asbestos and environmental reserves, and the effect of these
changes could be material to the Company’s consolidated operating results, financial condition and
liquidity.

In the opinion of management, based upon the known facts and current law, the reserves recorded for
the Company’s property and casualty businesses at December 31, 2005 represent the Company’s best
estimate of its ultimate liability for claims and claim adjustment expenses related to losses
covered by policies written by the Company. However, because of the significant uncertainties
surrounding environmental, and particularly asbestos exposures, it is possible that management’s
estimate of the ultimate liabilities for these claims may change and that the required adjustment
to recorded reserves could exceed the currently recorded reserves by an amount that could be
material to the Company’s results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.

Life Deferred Policy Acquisition Costs and Present Value of Future Profits Associated with Variable
Annuity and Other Universal Life-Type Contracts

Accounting Policy and Assumptions

Life policy acquisition costs include commissions and certain other expenses that vary with and are
primarily associated with acquiring business. Present value of future profits is an intangible
asset recorded upon applying purchase accounting in an acquisition of a life insurance company.
Deferred policy acquisition costs and the present value of future profits intangible asset are
amortized in the same way. Both are amortized over the estimated life of the contracts acquired,
generally 20 years. Within the following discussion, deferred policy acquisition costs and the
present value of future profits intangible asset will be referred to as “DAC”. At December 31,
2005 and 2004, the carrying value of the Company’s Life DAC asset was $8.6 billion and $7.4
billion, respectively. Of those amounts, $4.5 billion and $4.4 billion related to individual
variable annuities sold in the U.S., $1.2 billion and $0.8 billion related to individual variable
annuities sold in Japan and $2.0 billion and $1.8 billion related to universal life-type contracts
sold by Individual Life.

The Company amortizes DAC related to traditional policies (term, whole life and group insurance)
over the premium-paying period in proportion to the present value of annual expected premium
income. The Company amortizes DAC related to investment contracts and universal life-type
contracts (including individual variable annuities) using the retrospective deposit method. Under
the retrospective deposit method, acquisition costs are amortized in proportion to the present
value of estimated gross profits (“EGPs”). The Company uses other measures for amortizing DAC,
such as gross costs, as a replacement for EGPs when EGPs are expected
to be negative for multiple years of the contract’s life. The Company also adjusts the DAC balance, through other comprehensive
income, by an amount that represents the amortization of DAC that would have been required as a
charge or credit to operations had unrealized gains and losses on investments been realized.
Actual gross profits, in a given reporting period, that vary from management’s initial estimates
result in increases or decreases in the rate of amortization, commonly referred to as a “true-up”,
which are recorded in the current period. The true-up recorded for the years ended December 31,
2005, 2004 and 2003, was an increase to amortization of $18, $16 and $38, respectively.

Each year, the Company develops future EGPs for the products sold during that year. The EGPs for
products sold in a particular year are aggregated into cohorts. Future gross profits are projected
for the estimated lives of the contracts, generally 20 years and are, to a large extent, a function
of future account value projections for individual variable annuity products and to a lesser extent
for variable universal life products. The projection of future account values requires the use of
certain assumptions. The assumptions considered to be important in the projection of future
account value, and hence the EGPs, include separate account fund performance, which is impacted by
separate account fund mix, less fees assessed against the contract holder’s account balance,
surrender and lapse rates, interest margin, and mortality. The assumptions are developed as part
of an annual process and are dependent upon the Company’s current best estimates of future events
which are likely to be different for each year’s cohort. For example, upon completion of a study



during the fourth quarter of 2005, the Company, in developing projected account values and the
related EGP’s for the 2005 cohorts, used a separate account
return assumption of 7.6% (after fund fees, but before mortality and
expense charges) for U.S.
products and 4.3% (after fund fees, but before mortality and
expense charges) for Japanese products. (Although the Company used a separate account return
assumption of 4.3% for the 2005 cohort, based on the relative fund mix of all variable products
sold in Japan, the weighted average rate on the entire Japan block is 5.0%.) For prior year
cohorts, the Company’s separate account return assumption, at the time those cohorts’ account
values and related EGPs were projected, was 9.0% for U.S. products and 5.4% for Japanese products.

Unlock and Sensitivity Analysis

EGPs that are used as the basis for determining amortization of DAC are evaluated regularly to
determine if actual experience or other evidence suggests that earlier estimates should be revised.
Assumptions used to project account values and the related EGPs, are not revised unless the EGPs
in the DAC amortization model fall outside of a reasonable range. In the event that the Company
was to revise assumptions used for prior year cohorts, thereby changing its estimate of projected
account value, and the related EGPs, in the DAC amortization model, the cumulative DAC amortization
would be adjusted to reflect such changes, in the period the revision was determined to be
necessary, a process known as “unlocking”.

To determine the reasonableness of the prior assumptions used and their impact on previously
projected account values and the related EGPs, the Company evaluates, on a quarterly basis, its
previously projected EGPs. The Company’s process to assess the reasonableness of its EGPs involves
the use of internally developed models, which run a large number of stochastically determined
scenarios of separate account fund performance. Incorporated in each scenario are the Company’s
current best estimate assumptions with respect to separate account returns, lapse rates, mortality,
and expenses. These scenarios are run for individual variable annuity business in the U.S. and
independently for individual variable annuity business in Japan and are used to calculate
statistically significant ranges of reasonable EGPs. The statistical ranges produced from the
stochastic scenarios are compared to the present value of EGPs used in the respective DAC
amortization models. If EGPs used in the DAC amortization model fall outside of the statistical
ranges of reasonable EGPs, a revision to the assumptions in prior year cohorts used to project
account value and the related EGPs, in the DAC amortization model would be necessary. A similar
approach is used for variable universal life business.

As of
December 31, 2005, the present value of the EGPs used in the DAC
amortization models, for variable annuities and variable universal life
business, fell
within the statistical range of reasonable EGPs. Therefore, the Company did not revise the
separate account return assumption, the account values or any other
assumptions, in those DAC
amortization models, for 2004 and prior cohorts.

The Company performs analyses with respect to the potential impact of an unlock. To illustrate the
effects of an unlock, assume the Company had concluded that a revision to previously projected
account values and the related EGPs was required as of December 31, 2005. If the Company assumed a
separate account return assumption of 7.6% for all U.S. product cohorts and 5.0% for all Japanese
product cohorts and used its current best estimate assumptions for mortality and lapses, for all
products, to project account values forward from the current account value to reproject future
EGPs, the estimated decrease to amortization (an increase to net income) for all business would be
approximately $10-$15, after-tax. If, instead, the Company assumed a separate account return
assumption of 8.6% in the U.S. (6.0% in Japan) or 6.6% in the U.S. (4.0% in Japan), the estimated
after-tax change in amortization for all business would have been a decrease of $55-$60 and an
increase (a decrease to net income) of $30-$35, respectively.

The Company has estimated that the present value of the EGPs is likely to remain within the
statistical range for its U.S. individual variable annuity business if account values were to
decline (due to declining separate account return performance, increased lapses or increased
mortality) by 17% or less over the next twelve months or increase (due to increasing separate
account return performance, decreasing lapses or decreased mortality) by 20% or less over the next
twelve months.

However, significant favorable experience in the funds underlying the Japan variable annuities
resulted in actual account values exceeding the account value in the DAC amortization model.
Therefore, EGPs in the DAC amortization models for Japanese individual variable annuity business,
based on previously projected account values that are lower than actual account values, were just
inside the statistical range of reasonable EGPs as of December 31, 2005. Continued favorable
experience on key assumptions for Japan variable annuities, which could include increasing fund
return performance, decreasing lapses or decreasing mortality, could result in the DAC amortization
model EGPs being outside of the statistical range of reasonableness and result in an unlock which
would result in a decrease to DAC amortization and an increase to the DAC asset. If the Company
assumed a separate account return assumption of 5.0% for all Japanese product cohorts and used its
current best estimate assumptions for mortality and lapses to project account values forward from
the current account values to reproject future EGPs, the estimated decrease to amortization for
Japan variable annuities would be approximately $25-$30, after-tax. If, instead, the Company
assumed a separate account return assumption of 6.0% in Japan or 4.0% in Japan, the estimated
after-tax decrease in amortization for Japan variable annuities would be $30-$35 and $20-$25,
respectively.

Aside from absolute levels and timing of market performance, additional factors that will influence
this unlock determination include the degree of volatility in separate account fund performance and
shifts in asset allocation within the separate account made by policyholders. The overall return
generated by the separate account is dependent on several factors, including the relative mix of
the underlying sub-accounts among bond funds and equity funds as well as equity sector weightings.
The Company’s overall U.S. separate account fund performance has been reasonably correlated to the
overall performance of the S&P 500 Index (which closed at 1,248 on December 31, 2005), although no
assurance can be provided that this correlation will continue in the future.

The overall recoverability of the DAC asset is dependent on the future profitability of the
business. The Company tests the aggregate recoverability of the DAC asset by comparing the amounts
deferred to the present value of total EGPs. In addition, the Company routinely stress tests its
DAC asset for recoverability against severe declines in its separate account assets, which could
occur if the equity markets experienced another significant sell-off, as the majority of
policyholders’ funds in the separate accounts is invested in the



equity market. As of December 31, 2005, the Company believed U.S. individual and Japan individual
variable annuity separate account assets could fall, through a combination of negative market
returns, lapses and mortality, by at least 39% and 60%, respectively, before portions of its DAC
asset would be unrecoverable.

Valuation of Guaranteed Minimum Withdrawal Benefit Derivatives

The Company offers certain variable annuity products with a guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefit
(“GMWB”) rider. The fair value of the GMWB obligation is calculated based on actuarial and capital
market assumptions related to the projected cash flows, including benefits and related contract
charges, over the lives of the contracts, incorporating expectations concerning policyholder
behavior. Because of the dynamic and complex nature of these cash flows, stochastic techniques
under a variety of market return scenarios and other best estimate assumptions are used.
Estimating these cash flows involves numerous estimates and subjective judgments including those
regarding expected market rates of return, market volatility, correlations of market returns and
discount rates. At each valuation date, the Company assumes expected returns based on risk-free
rates as represented by the current LIBOR forward curve rates; market volatility assumptions for
each underlying index based on a blend of observed market “implied volatility” data and annualized
standard deviations of monthly returns using the most recent 20 years of observed market
performance; correlations of market returns across underlying indices based on actual observed
market returns and relationships over the ten years preceding the valuation date; and current
risk-free spot rates as represented by the current LIBOR spot curve to determine the present value
of expected future cash flows produced in the stochastic projection process. Changes in capital
market assumptions can significantly change the value of the GMWB obligation. For example,
independent decreases in equity market returns, decreases in interest rates and increases in equity
index volatility will all have the effect of decreasing the GMWB asset resulting in a realized loss
in net income. Furthermore, changes in policyholder behavior can also significantly change the
value of the GMWB obligation. For example, independent increases in fund mix towards equity based
funds vs. bond funds, increases in withdrawals, increasing mortality, increasing usage of the
step-up feature and decreases in lapses will all have the effect of decreasing the GMWB asset
resulting in a realized loss in net income. Independent changes in any one of these assumptions
moving in the opposite direction will have the effect of increasing the GMWB asset resulting in a
realized gain in net income. During the fourth quarter of 2005, the Company reflected a newly
reliable market input for volatility on Standard and Poor’s (“S&P”) 500 index options. The impact
of reflecting the newly reliable market input for the S&P 500 index volatility resulted in a
decrease to the GMWB asset of $83. The impact to net income including other changes in
assumptions, after DAC amortization and taxes was a loss of $18.

Evaluation of Other-Than-Temporary Impairments on Available-for-Sale Securities

The Hartford’s investments in fixed maturities, which include bonds, redeemable preferred stock and
commercial paper; and certain equity securities, which include common and non-redeemable preferred
stocks, are classified as “available-for-sale” and accordingly are carried at fair value with the
after-tax difference from cost or amortized cost, as adjusted for the effect of deducting the life
and pension policyholders’ share of the immediate participation guaranteed contracts; and certain
life and annuity deferred policy acquisition costs and reserve adjustments, reflected in
stockholders’ equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (“AOCI”).

One of the significant estimates related to available-for-sale securities is the evaluation of
investments for other-than-temporary impairments. If a decline in the fair value of an
available-for-sale security is judged to be other-than-temporary, a charge is recorded in net
realized capital losses equal to the difference between the fair value and cost or amortized cost
basis of the security. In addition, for securities expected to be sold, an other-than-temporary
impairment charge is recognized if the Company does not expect the fair value of a security to
recover to cost or amortized cost prior to the expected date of sale. The fair value of the
other-than-temporarily impaired investment becomes its new cost basis.

The evaluation of impairments is a quantitative and qualitative process, which is subject to risks
and uncertainties and is intended to determine whether declines in the fair value of investments
should be recognized in current period earnings. The risks and uncertainties include changes in
general economic conditions, the issuer’s financial condition or near term recovery prospects and
the effects of changes in interest rates. The Company has a security monitoring process overseen
by a committee of investment and accounting professionals (“the committee”) that identifies
securities that, due to certain characteristics, as described below, are subjected to an enhanced
analysis on a quarterly basis.

Securities not subject to Emerging Issues Task Force (“EITF”) Issue No. 99-20, “Recognition of
Interest Income and Impairment on Purchased and Retained Beneficial Interests in Securitized
Financial Assets” (“non-EITF Issue No. 99-20 securities”) that are in an unrealized loss position,
are reviewed at least quarterly to determine if an other-than-temporary impairment is present based
on certain quantitative and qualitative factors. The primary factors considered in evaluating
whether a decline in value for non-EITF Issue No. 99-20 securities is other-than-temporary include:
(a) the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than cost or amortized
cost, (b) the financial condition, credit rating and near-term prospects of the issuer, (c) whether
the debtor is current on contractually obligated interest and principal payments and (d) the intent
and ability of the Company to retain the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for
recovery. Non-EITF Issue No. 99-20 securities depressed by twenty percent or more for six months
are presumed to be other-than-temporarily impaired unless significant objective verifiable evidence
supports that the security price is temporarily depressed and is expected to recover within a
reasonable period of time. The evaluation of non-EITF Issue No. 99-20 securities depressed more
than ten percent is documented and discussed quarterly by the committee.

For certain securitized financial assets with contractual cash flows including asset-backed
securities, (“ABS”), EITF Issue No. 99-20 requires the Company to periodically update its best
estimate of cash flows over the life of the security. If the fair value of a securitized financial
asset is less than its cost or amortized cost and there has been a decrease in the present value of
the estimated cash flows since the last revised estimate, considering both timing and amount, an
other-than-temporary impairment charge is recognized. Estimating



future cash flows is a quantitative and qualitative process that incorporates information received
from third party sources along with certain internal assumptions and judgments regarding the future
performance of the underlying collateral. As a result, actual results may differ from current
estimates. In addition, projections of expected future cash flows may change based upon new
information regarding the performance of the underlying collateral.

Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit Obligations

The Company maintains a U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plan (the “Plan”) that covers
substantially all employees, as well as unfunded excess plans to provide benefits in excess of
amounts permitted to be paid to participants of the Plan under the provisions of the Internal
Revenue Code. The Company has also entered into individual retirement agreements with certain
retired directors providing for unfunded supplemental pension benefits. In addition, the Company
provides certain health care and life insurance benefits for eligible retired employees. The
Company maintains international plans which represent an immaterial percentage of total pension
assets, liabilities and expense and, for reporting purposes, are combined with domestic plans.

Pursuant to accounting principles related to the Company’s pension and other postretirement
obligations to employees under its various benefit plans, the Company is required to make a
significant number of assumptions in order to calculate the related liabilities and expenses each
period. The two economic assumptions that have the most impact on pension and other
postretirement expense are the discount rate and the expected long-term rate of return on plan
assets. In determining the discount rate assumption, the Company utilizes a discounted cash flow
analysis of the Company’s pension and other postretirement obligations, currently available market
and industry data and consultation with its plan actuaries. The yield curve utilized in the cash
flow analysis is comprised of bonds rated Aa or higher with maturities primarily between zero and
thirty years. Based on all available information, it was determined that 5.50% was the
appropriate discount rate as of December 31, 2005 to calculate the Company’s benefit liability.
Accordingly, the 5.50% discount rate will also be used to determine the Company’s 2006 pension and
other postretirement expense. At December 31, 2004, the discount rate was 5.75%.

The Company determines the expected long-term rate of return assumption based on an analysis of the
Plan portfolio’s historical compound rates of return since 1979 (the earliest date for which
comparable portfolio data is available) and over rolling 5 year, 10 year and 20 year periods,
balanced along with future long-term return expectations that generally anticipate an investment
mix of 60% equity securities and 40% fixed income securities. The Company selected these periods,
as well as shorter durations, to assess the portfolio’s volatility, duration and total returns as
they relate to pension obligation characteristics, which are influenced by the Company’s workforce
demographics. While the historical return of the Plan’s portfolio has been 11.03% since 1979,
based upon management’s outlook with respect to market returns, as well as the planned asset mix,
management lowered its long-term rate of return assumption to 8.00% as of December 31, 2005 from
8.50% as of December 31, 2004.

To illustrate the impact of these assumptions on annual pension and other postretirement expense
for 2006 and going forward, a 25 basis point change in the discount rate will increase/decrease
pension and other postretirement expense by approximately $15 and a 25 basis point change in the
long-term asset return assumption will increase/decrease pension and other postretirement expense
by approximately $8.

Contingencies Relating to Corporate Litigation and Regulatory Matters

Management follows the requirements of SFAS No. 5 “Accounting for Contingencies”. This statement
requires management to evaluate each contingent matter separately. A loss is recorded if probable
and reasonably estimable. Management establishes reserves for these contingencies at its “best
estimate”, or, if no one number within the range of possible losses is more probable than any
other, the Company records an estimated reserve at the low end of the range of losses.

The Company has a quarterly monitoring process involving legal and accounting professionals. Legal
personnel first identify outstanding corporate litigation and regulatory matters posing a
reasonable possibility of loss. These matters are then jointly reviewed by accounting and legal
personnel to evaluate the facts and changes since the last review in order to determine if a
provision for loss should be recorded or adjusted, the amount that should be recorded, and the
appropriate disclosure. The outcomes of certain contingencies currently being evaluated by the
Company, which relate to corporate litigation and regulatory matters, are inherently difficult to
predict, and the reserves that have been established for the estimated settlement amounts are
subject to significant changes. In view of the uncertainties regarding the outcome of these
matters, as well as the tax-deductibility of payments, it is possible that the ultimate cost to the
Company of these matters could exceed the reserve by an amount that would have a material adverse
effect on the Company’s consolidated results of operations or cash flows in a particular quarterly
or annual period.

Operating Results

2005 Compared to 2004

— Net income increased $159 for the year ended December 31, 2005 compared
with the prior year. The increase was primarily due to the following:

•

An increase in Property & Casualty net income of $326, driven primarily by
improved underwriting results in the Personal Lines and Other Operations segments, increased
net investment income, and a reduction in other expenses; partially offset by a decrease in
net realized capital gains. The improved underwriting results in Personal Lines was driven
primarily by a reduction in current year catastrophe losses, a reduction in net unfavorable
prior accident year loss reserve development and earned premium growth. The improvement in
underwriting results for Other Operations was primarily due to a reduction in net unfavorable
prior accident year loss reserve development. The increase in net investment income was
primarily due to higher assets under management resulting from increased cash flows from
underwriting, higher investment yields on fixed maturity investments and an increase in income
from limited partnership investments.



•

An increase in net income for Retail of $119,
principally driven by higher fee income from growth in the variable annuity and mutual fund
businesses as a result of higher assets under management as compared to the prior year
periods.

•

An increase in net income for International of $57, principally
driven by higher fee income and investment spread in Japan derived from a 78% increase in the
assets under management.

•

An increase in net income for the Group Benefits segment of $43, driven primarily
by higher earned premiums and net investment income as well as a favorable loss ratio.

Partially offsetting these increases were:

•

A $216 tax benefit recorded in 2004 to reflect the effect of the IRS audit
settlement on tax years prior to 2004.

•

A charge of $102, after-tax, recorded in 2005 in Life to reserve for
investigations related to market timing by the SEC and New York Attorney General’s Office,
directed brokerage by the SEC and single premium group annuities by the New York Attorney
General’s Office and the Connecticut Attorney General’s Office.

•

An after-tax expense of $46 recorded in Life during 2005, related to the
termination of a provision of an agreement with a mutual fund distribution partner of the
Company’s retail mutual funds.

Total revenues increased $4.4 billion for the year ended December 31, 2005 compared with the prior
year. The increase was primarily due to the following:

•

An increase of $3.3 billion in net investment income, driven primarily by a $3.0
billion increase in net investment income on the Company’s trading securities portfolio. Also
contributing to the increase was a higher average invested asset base.

•

An increase of $793 in earned premiums. Earned premium growth of $486 in
Business Insurance was primarily driven by new business premium growth outpacing non-renewals
in the prior 12 months. Earned premium growth of $165 in Personal Lines was primarily driven
by new business growth outpacing non-renewals in auto and the effect of earned pricing
increases in homeowners. Earned premiums increased $158 in Group Benefits primarily due to
increased sales, particularly in group disability, and continued strong persistency.

•

An increase of $541 in fee income primarily driven by increased individual
annuity assets under management in the United States and Japan.

Partially offsetting these increases was:

•

A decrease of $274 in net realized capital gains primarily due to lower net gains
on the sale of fixed maturity securities, losses associated with GMWB derivatives, Japanese
fixed annuity contract hedges and periodic net coupon settlements. These losses were offset
in part by changes in the value of non-qualifying foreign currency swaps.

2004 Compared to 2003

— Net income increased $2.2 billion for the year ended December 31, 2004
compared with the prior year. The increase was primarily due to the following:

Total revenues increased $4.0 billion for the year ended December 31, 2004 compared with the prior
year. The increase was primarily due to the following:

•

Increased earned premiums for Group Benefits driven primarily by the acquisition
of the group benefits business of CNA, sales growth and favorable persistency.

•

Increased earned premiums in the Business Insurance, Personal Lines and Specialty
Commercial segments primarily due to earned pricing increases and growth in new business
premiums out pacing non-renewals for Personal Lines and Business Insurance.

•

Increased fee income for Retail resulted from an increase in variable annuity
average account values.

•

Net investment income increased due primarily to the adoption
of SOP 03-1, which resulted in $1.6 billion of net investment income.

Net Realized Capital Gains and Losses

See “Investment Results” in the Investments section.



Income Taxes

The effective tax rate for 2005, 2004 and 2003 was 24%, 15% and 83%, respectively. The principal
causes of the difference between the effective rate and the U.S. statutory rate of 35% for 2005
were tax-exempt interest earned on invested assets and the separate account dividends received
deduction (“DRD”). For 2004, the principal causes were tax exempt interest earned on invested
assets, the separate account DRD and the tax benefit associated with the settlement of the
1998-2001 IRS audit. Income taxes paid (received) in 2005, 2004 and 2003 were $447, $32 and
($107), respectively. For additional information, see Note 13 of Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements.

The separate account DRD is estimated for the current year using information from the most recent
year-end, adjusted for projected equity market performance. The estimated DRD is generally updated
in the third quarter for the provision-to-filed-return adjustments, and in the fourth quarter based
on known actual mutual fund distributions and fee income from The Hartford’s variable insurance
products. The actual current year DRD can vary from the estimates based on, but not limited to,
changes in eligible dividends received by the mutual funds, amounts of distributions from these
mutual funds, appropriate levels of taxable income as well as the utilization of capital loss carry
forwards at the mutual fund level.

calculation of the year ended December 31, 2003 diluted earnings (loss) per share, since the
inclusion of options of 1.8 would have been antidilutive to the earnings per share
calculation. In the absence of the net loss, weighted average common shares outstanding and
dilutive potential common shares would have totaled 274.2.

Outlook

Life

In the Retail segment management believes the market for retirement products continues to expand as
individuals increasingly save and plan for retirement. However, competition has increased
substantially in the retail market with most major variable annuity writers now offering living
benefits such as GMWB riders. As a result, sales may be lower than the
level of sales attained in 2005 when considering the competitive environment, the risk of
disruption on new sales from product offering changes, customer acceptance of new products and the
effect on the distribution related to product offering changes. The success of the Company’s new
living income benefit and any new products will ultimately be based on customer acceptance. With
the increased competition in the variable annuity market causing lower sales levels from the level
in 2004, combined with surrender activity on the aging block of business, net outflows are
currently forecasted to be above levels experienced in 2005. This will be largely dependent on the
Company’s ability to attract new customers and to retain contract holder’s account values in
existing or new product offerings as they reach the end of the surrender charge period of their
contract.

The future profitability of the Retirement Plans segment will depend on the Company’s ability to
increase assets under management across all businesses and maintain its investment spread earnings
on the products sold largely in the Government business. 401(k) sales are expected to remain
strong throughout 2006 primarily due to the continuing growth in the market for retirement
products. The Government market is highly competitive from a pricing perspective, and a small
number of cases often account for a significant portion of sales, therefore the Company may not be
able to sustain the level of sales growth attained in 2005.

The future net income of the Institutional segment will depend on the Company’s ability to increase
assets under management across all businesses and maintain its investment spread earnings on the
products sold largely in the Institutional Investment Products (“IIP”) business. The IIP markets
are highly competitive from a pricing perspective, and a small number of cases often account for a
significant portion of sales, therefore the Company may not be able to sustain the level of assets
under management growth attained in 2005. IIP will launch new products in 2006 to provide
solutions that deal specifically with longevity risk. Longevity risk is defined as the likelihood
of an individual outliving their assets. IIP is also designing innovative solutions to
corporation’s defined benefit liabilities. The focus of the PPLI business is variable PPLI
products to fund non-qualified benefits or other post employment benefit liabilities. The market
served by PPLI is subject to extensive legal and regulatory review that could have an adverse
effect on its business.

In Individual Life variable universal life sales and account values remain sensitive to equity
market levels and returns. The Company continues to pursue new and enhanced products, as well as
broader and deeper distribution opportunities to increase sales. Individual Life continues to face
uncertainty surrounding estate tax legislation, aggressive competition from other life insurance
providers, reduced availability and higher price of reinsurance, and the current regulatory
environment regarding reserving practices for universal life products with no-lapse guarantees
which may negatively affect Individual Life’s future earnings.

In Group Benefits, management anticipates the increased scale of the group life and disability
operations and the expanded distribution network for its products and services will generate strong
sales growth. Sales, however, may be negatively affected by the competitive



pricing environment in the marketplace. Management is committed to selling competitively priced
products that meet the Company’s internal rate of return guidelines.

In the International segment management is optimistic about the growth potential of the retirement
savings market in Japan. Several trends such as an aging population, longer life expectancies,
declining birth rate leading to a smaller number of younger workers to support each retiree, and
under funded pension systems have resulted in greater need for an individual to plan and adequately
fund retirement savings. However, competition has increased substantially in the Japanese market
with most major competitors offering guaranteed benefit riders and, as a result, the Company may
not be able to sustain the level of sales attained in 2005. Continued growth depends on increasing
the Company’s penetration in the Japanese market by securing new distribution outlets for our
products and accessing more customers within existing distributors. In addition, the Company will
be looking for ways to leverage our variable annuity capability into other investment product
opportunities.

Property & Casualty

In 2006, management expects continued growth in written and earned premiums in Business Insurance
and Personal Lines, partially offset by an expected decline in written and earned premium in
Specialty Commercial. Within Business Insurance, in both small commercial and middle market, the
Company plans to continue to broaden its relationships with key agencies to increase new business,
maintain renewal retention and expand market share in targeted states. Management expects
double-digit written premium growth in small commercial in 2006. The Personal Lines segment is
expected to deliver written premium growth in the mid-single digits in 2006, including growth from
both AARP and Agency. The Company expects new business growth in Agency business as well as strong
renewal retention in AARP. Within Specialty Commercial, management expects written and earned
premium to decline in 2006 given the non-renewal of a captive insurance program which represented
$240 of written premium in 2005. Partially offsetting this decline is an expectation of growth in
property written premium driven by new business growth and written pricing increases. Also, a
decrease in the percentage of risks ceded to reinsurers will likely contribute to growth in
professional liability written premium.

Management expects written pricing trends in 2006 to be affected by increased competition in
Business Insurance and Personal Lines. Price competition is most significant for Select Xpand and
middle market business within Business Insurance. Competition is also intensifying in Personal
Lines, especially in auto. Rather than competing on rate, many companies are advertising heavily
to drive new business and retain profitable customers. In 2006, management believes that pricing
declines in Business Insurance will lessen somewhat as higher reinsurance costs are reflected in
the market. Within Personal Lines, the Company expects written pricing to be flat to slightly
negative for auto and written pricing increases in the mid-single digits for homeowners. In the
wake of the third and fourth quarter hurricanes of 2005, specialty property written pricing has
been increasing in catastrophe prone areas and management expects rates to continue to increase in
2006.

Within Business Insurance and Personal Lines, loss costs are expected to increase in 2006 as
increasing claim severity is expected to outpace favorable claim frequency. As a result of the
anticipated written pricing decreases in some lines and less favorable written pricing increases in
other lines, management expects the current accident year loss and loss expense ratio in Business
Insurance and Personal Lines to increase moderately in 2006. Within Specialty Commercial,
management expects that the written pricing increases in property will yield a lower current
accident year loss and loss adjustment expense ratio, provided that catastrophe property claim
experience returns to expected levels.

The Other Operations segment will continue to manage the discontinued operations of The Hartford as
well as claims (and associated reserves) related to asbestos, environmental and other exposures.
The Hartford will continue to review various components of all of its reserves on a regular basis.

LIFE

Executive Overview

Life provides investment and retirement products such as variable and fixed annuities, mutual funds
and retirement plan services and other institutional products; individual and PPLI; and, group
benefit products, such as group life and group disability insurance.

Life derives its revenues principally from: (a) fee income, including asset management fees, on
separate account and mutual fund assets and mortality and expense fees, as well as cost of
insurance charges; (b) net investment income on general account assets; (c) fully insured premiums;
and (d) certain other fees. Asset management fees and mortality and expense fees are primarily
generated from separate account assets, which are deposited with Life through the sale of variable
annuity and variable universal life products and from mutual funds. Cost of insurance charges are
assessed on the net amount at risk for investment-oriented life insurance products. Premium
revenues are derived primarily from the sale of group life, and group disability and individual
term insurance products.

Life’s expenses essentially consist of interest credited to policyholders on general account
liabilities, insurance benefits provided, amortization of the deferred policy acquisition costs,
expenses related to the selling and servicing the various products offered by the Company,
dividends to policyholders, and other general business expenses.

Life’s profitability in its variable annuity, mutual fund and, to a lesser extent, variable
universal life businesses, depends largely on the amount of the contract holder account value or
assets under management on which it earns fees and the level of fees charged. Changes in account
value or assets under management are driven by two main factors: net flows, which measure the
success of the Company’s



asset gathering and retention efforts, and the market return of the funds, which is heavily
influenced by the return realized in the equity markets. Net flows are comprised of new sales and
other deposits less surrenders, death benefits, policy charges and annuitizations of investment
type contracts, such as: variable annuity contracts. In the mutual fund business, net flows are
known as net sales. Net sales are comprised of new sales less redemptions by mutual fund
customers. Life uses the average daily value of the S&P 500 Index as an indicator for evaluating
market returns of the underlying account portfolios in the United States. Relative profitability
of variable products is highly correlated to the growth in account values or assets under
management since these products generally earn fee income on a daily basis. Thus, a prolonged
downturn in the financial markets could reduce revenues and potentially raise the possibility of a
charge against deferred policy acquisition costs.

The profitability of Life’s fixed annuities and other “spread-based” products depends largely on
its ability to earn target spreads between earned investment rates on its general account assets
and interest credited to policyholders. Profitability is also influenced by operating expense
management including the benefits of economies of scale in the administration of its United States
variable annuity businesses in particular. In addition, the size and persistency of gross profits
from these businesses is an important driver of earnings as it affects the rate of amortization of
the deferred policy acquisition costs.

Life’s profitability in its individual life insurance and group benefits businesses depends largely
on the size of its in force block, the adequacy of product pricing and underwriting discipline,
actual mortality and morbidity experience, and the efficiency of its claims and expense management.

Performance Measures

Fee Income

Fee income is largely driven from amounts collected as a result of contractually defined
percentages of assets under management on investment type contracts. These fees are generally
collected on a daily basis from the contract holder’s account. For individual life insurance
products, fees are contractually defined percentages based on levels of insurance, age, premiums
and deposits collected and contractholder account value. Life insurance fees are generally
collected on a monthly basis. Therefore, the growth in assets under management either through
positive net flows or net sales and favorable equity market performance will have a favorable
impact on fee income. Conversely, negative net flows or net sales and unfavorable equity market
performance will reduce fee income generated from investment type contracts.

•

The 2005 increase in U.S. variable annuity account values can be attributed to
market growth over the past four quarters.

•

Net flows and net sales for the U.S. variable annuity and retail mutual fund
businesses, respectively, have decreased from prior year levels. In particular, variable
annuity net flows and mutual fund net sales were negatively affected due to lower sales levels
and higher surrenders due to increased competition.

•

Changes in market value are based on market conditions and investment management performance.

•

Japan annuity account values and net flows continue to grow as a result of strong sales and significant market growth in 2005.



Net Investment Income and Interest Credited

Certain investment type contracts such as fixed annuities and other spread-based contracts generate
deposits that the Company collects and invests to earn investment income. These investment type
contracts use this investment income to credit the contract holder an amount of interest specified
in the respective contract; therefore, management evaluates performance of these products based on
the spread between net investment income and interest credited. Net investment income and interest
credited can be volatile period over period, which can have a significant positive or negative
effect on the operating results of each segment. The volatile nature of net investment income is
driven primarily by prepayments on securities and earnings on partnership investments. In
addition, insurance type contracts such as those sold by Group Benefits (discussed below) collect
and invest premiums for protection from losses specified in the
particular insurance contract and those sold by Institutional,
collect and invest premiums for certain life contingent benefits.

Amounts reported in 2003 are prior to the adoption of SOP 03-1.

•

Net investment income and interest credited in Other
increased for the year ended December 31, 2005 due to $3,847
increase in the mark-to-market effects of trading account
securities supporting the Japanese variable annuity business.

•

Net investment income and interest credited on general
account assets in Retail declined for the year ended December
31, 2005 due to lower assets under management from surrenders
on market value adjusted (“MVA”) fixed annuity products at
the end of their guarantee period. The increase for the year
ended December 31, 2004 was largely due to the adoption of
SOP 03-1.

•

Net investment income and interest credited on general
account assets in Institutional increased as a result of the
Company’s funding agreement backed Investor Notes program,
partially offset by surrenders in the PPLI business.

•

In addition to interest credited on general account
assets, Institutional also had other contract benefits for
limited payment contracts of $292, $279 and $231 for the
years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.
These amounts need to be deducted from net investment income
to understand the net interest spread on these businesses
because these contracts are accounted for as traditional
insurance products.

Premiums

As discussed above, traditional insurance type products, such as those sold by Group Benefits,
collect premiums from policyholders in exchange for financial protection of the policy holder from
a specified insurable loss, such as death or disability. These premiums together with net
investment income earned from the overall investment strategy are used to pay the contractual
obligations under these insurance contracts. Two major factors, new sales and persistency, impact
premium growth. Sales can increase or decrease in a given year based on a number of factors,
including but not limited to, customer demand for the Company’s product offerings, pricing
competition, distribution channels and the Company’s reputation and ratings. A majority of sales
correspond with the open enrollment periods of employers’ benefits, typically January 1 or July 1.
Persistency is the percentage of insurance policies remaining in force from year to year as
measured by premiums.

Earned premiums and other considerations include $27, $4

2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The increase in premiums
and other considerations for Group Benefits in 2005 compared
to 2004 was driven by sales and favorable persistency.

Expenses



There are three major categories for expenses. The first major category of expenses is benefits
and claims. These include the costs of mortality and morbidity, particularly in the group benefits
business, and mortality in the individual life businesses, as well as other contractholder benefits
to policyholders. In addition, traditional insurance type products generally use a loss ratio
which is expressed as the amount of benefits incurred during a particular period divided by total
premiums and other considerations, as a key indicator of underwriting performance. Since Group
Benefits occasionally buys a block of claims for a stated premium amount, the Company excludes this
buyout from the loss ratio used for evaluating the underwriting results of the business as buyouts
may distort the loss ratio.

The second major category is insurance operating costs and expenses, which is commonly expressed in
a ratio of a revenue measure depending on the type of business. The third category is the
amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs and the present value of future profits, which is
typically expressed as a percentage of pre-tax income before the cost of this amortization. The
individual annuity business within Retail accounts for the majority of the amortization of deferred
policy acquisition costs and present value of future profits for Life.

Profitability

Management evaluates the rates of return various businesses can provide as a way of determining
where additional capital should be invested to increase net income and shareholder returns.
Specifically, because of the importance of its individual annuity products, the Company uses the
return on assets for the individual annuity business for evaluating profitability. In Group
Benefits, after tax margin is a key indicator of overall profitability.

Individual annuity’s ROA increased for the year ended December 31, 2005,
compared to the prior year. In particular, variable annuity fees and fixed annuity general
account spreads each increased for the year ended December 31, 2005 compared to the prior
year. The increase in the ROA can be attributed to the increase in account values and
resulting increased fees including GMWB rider fees without a corresponding increase in
expenses, while the increase in fixed annuity general account spread resulted from fixed
annuity contracts that were repriced upon the contract reaching maturity. Also, contributing
to a higher ROA in 2005 is an increase in the separate account dividends received deduction
(“DRD”) tax benefit compared to 2004.

•

The improvement in the Group Benefits after-tax margin for the year ended
December 31, 2005 was primarily due to favorable loss ratios and higher net investment income
as compared to 2004.

Life realigned its reportable operating segments in 2005 from Retail, Institutional,
Individual Life and Group Benefits to Retail, Retirement Plans, Institutional, Individual Life,
Group Benefits and International.

Retail offers individual variable and fixed market value adjusted (“MVA”) annuities, retail mutual
funds, 529 college savings plans, Canadian and offshore investment products.

Retirement Plans offers retirement plan products and services to corporations and municipalities
under Section 401(k), 403(b) and 457 plans.

Institutional offers institutional liability products, including stable value products, structured
settlements and institutional annuities (primarily terminal funding cases), as well as variable
PPLI owned by corporations and high net worth individuals.

Individual Life sells a variety of life insurance products, including variable universal life,
universal life, interest sensitive whole life and term life.

Group Benefits provides employers, associations, affinity groups and financial institutions with
group life, accident and disability coverage, along with other products and services, including
voluntary benefits, group retiree health, and medical stop loss.

International, which primarily has operations located in Japan, Brazil, Ireland and the United
Kingdom, provides investments, retirement savings and other insurance and savings products to
individuals and groups outside the United States and Canada.

Life includes in an Other category its leveraged PPLI product line of business; corporate items not
directly allocated to any of its reportable operating segments; net realized capital gains and
losses on fixed maturity sales generated from movements in interest rates, less amortization of
those gains or losses back to the reportable segments; net realized capital gains and losses
generated from credit related events, less a credit risk fee charged to the reportable segments;
net realized capital gains and losses from non-qualifying derivative strategies (including embedded
derivatives) other than the net periodic coupon settlements on credit derivatives and the net
periodic coupon settlements on the cross currency swap used to economically hedge currency and
interest rate risk generated from sales of the Company’s yen based fixed annuity, which are
allocated to the reportable segments; the mark-to-market adjustment for the equity securities held
for trading reported in net investment income and the related change in interest credited reported
as a component of benefits, claims and claim adjustment expenses since these items are not
considered by the Company’s chief operating decision maker in evaluating the International results
of operations; and intersegment eliminations.

2005 Compared to 2004 —

Life’s net income for the year ended December 31, 2005 decreased compared
to the prior year due to higher income tax expense. Income tax expense increased for the year
ended December 31, 2005 due to the absence of a tax benefit of $190 recorded in 2004 to reflect the
impact of the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) audit settlement on tax years prior to 2004.
Partially offsetting the increase in income tax expense compared to the prior year was an increase
in the DRD benefit related to the 2005 tax year of $50. Additional contributing factors to the
decrease in net income can be found below:

•

For the year ended December 31, 2005, Life experienced realized capital losses
of $25 as compared to realized capital gains of $164 for the year ended December 31, 2004.
See the Investments section for further discussion of investment results and related
realized capital gains and losses.

•

Life recorded an after-tax charge of $102 for the year ended December 31, 2005
to establish reserves for regulatory matters for investigations related to market timing by
the SEC and New York Attorney General’s Office, directed brokerage by the SEC,



and single premium group annuities by the New York Attorney General’s Office and the
Connecticut Attorney General’s Office.

•

Life recorded an after-tax expense of $46 for the year ended December 31,
2005, which related to the termination of a provision of an agreement with a mutual fund
distribution partner.

Partially offsetting the decreases to earnings discussed above was:

2004 Compared to 2003 —

Life’s net income increased in 2004 due primarily to business growth in
virtually all segments as discussed below, a lower effective income tax rate, and higher net
realized capital gains. (See the Investments section for further discussion of investment results
and related realized capital gains). Life recorded in the third quarter of 2004 a tax benefit of
$190, consisting primarily of a change in estimate of the dividends-received deduction (“DRD”) tax
benefit reported during 2003 and prior years and interest, and changed the estimate of the
after-tax benefit for the DRD benefit related to the 2004 tax year. Additional contributing
factors to the increase in net income can be found below:

Partially offsetting the increases to earnings discussed above was:

•

Retail recorded lower spread income on market value adjusted (“MVA”) fixed
annuities due to the adoption of SOP 03-1 in 2004.

•

Slightly offsetting the positive earnings drivers for the year ended December
31, 2004 was the cumulative effect of accounting change from the Company’s adoption of SOP
03-1. (For further discussion of the impact of the Company’s adoption of SOP 03-1, see
Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements).



Income Taxes

The effective tax rate for 2005, 2004 and 2003 was 21%, 13% and 21%, respectively. The principal
causes of the difference between the effective rates and the U.S. statutory rate of 35% for 2005
were tax-exempt interest earned on invested assets and the separate account dividends received
deduction (“DRD”). For 2004, the principal causes were tax exempt interest earned on invested
assets, the separate account dividends received deduction and the tax benefit associated with the
settlement of the 1998-2001 IRS audit. For additional information, see Note 13 of Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements.

The separate account DRD is estimated for the current year using information from the most recent
year-end, adjusted for projected equity market performance. The estimated DRD is generally updated
in the third quarter for the provision-to-filed-return adjustments, and in the fourth quarter based
on known actual mutual fund distributions and fee income from The Hartford’s variable insurance
products. The actual current year DRD can vary from the estimates based on, but not limited to,
changes in eligible dividends received by the mutual funds, amounts of distributions from these
mutual funds, appropriate levels of taxable income as well as the utilization of capital loss carry
forwards at the mutual fund level.

Retail focuses on the savings and retirement needs of the growing number of individuals who
are preparing for retirement, or have already retired, through the sale of individual variable and
fixed annuities, mutual funds and other investment products. Life is both a leading writer of
individual variable annuities and a top seller of individual variable annuities through banks in
the United States.

2005 Compared to 2004 —

Net income in Retail increased for the year ended December 31, 2005
primarily due to improved fee income driven by higher assets under management. Assets under
management increased primarily as a result of market growth. A more expanded discussion of
earnings growth can be found below:

•

The increase in fee income in the variable annuity business for the year ended December
31, 2005 was mainly a result of growth in average account values. The year-over-year
increase in average account values of 10% can be attributed to market appreciation of
$6.3 billion during 2005. Variable annuities had net outflows of $881 for the year
ended December 31, 2005 compared to net inflows of $5.5 billion for the year ended
December 31, 2004. The net outflows in 2005 were due to increased surrender activity
and increased sales competition, particularly as it relates to guaranteed living
benefits riders were offered with variable annuity products.

•

Mutual fund fee income increased for the year ended December 31, 2005 due to increased
assets under management driven by market appreciation of $2.6 billion and net sales of
$1.3 billion. Despite the increase in assets under management, the amount of net sales
has declined for the year ended December 31, 2005 compared to the prior year. This
decrease is attributed to market competition and higher redemption amounts due to a
higher lapse rate.

•

The fixed annuity business contributed $66 of higher investment spread income in 2005
compared to 2004, excluding the cumulative effects of accounting change, due to
improved investment spreads from the MVA products.



•

Benefits and claims and claim adjustment expenses have decreased for the year ended
December 31, 2005 due to an increase in reserves in the third quarter of 2004 related
to the acquisition of a block of acquired business from London Pacific Life and Annuity
Company in liquidation. The increase in reserves of $62 was offset by an equivalent
increase in earned premium. Also contributing to the decrease in benefits expense is a
decrease in interest credited as older fixed annuity MVA business with higher credited
rates matures and either lapse or renews at lower credited rates.

•

The effective tax rate decreased for the year ended December 31, 2005 compared to the
prior year end due to an increase in the DRD benefit as a percentage of pre-tax income.

Partially offsetting these positive earnings drivers were the following items:

•

Throughout Retail, insurance operating costs and other expenses increased for the year
ended December 31, 2005 compared to the prior year. General insurance expenses
increased due to increased costs related to technology services as well as sales and
marketing. In addition, the Company recorded an after-tax expense of $46, for the
termination of a provision of an agreement with a mutual fund distribution partner.

•

There was higher amortization of DAC, which resulted from higher gross profits due to
the positive earnings drivers as discussed above.

2004 Compared to 2003 —

Net income increased for the year ended December 31, 2004, principally
driven by higher fee income from double digit growth in the assets under management in virtually
all businesses of the segment and strong expense management:

•

Fee income generated by the variable annuity operation increased, as average account
values were higher in 2004 as compared to the prior year. The increase in average
account values can be attributed to market appreciation of $7.6 billion and net flows of
$5.5 billion during 2004.

•

Retail mutual fund fee income increased as a result of an increase in assets under
management of 24% year over year principally due to net sales and market appreciation of
$2.5 billion each during 2004.

Partially offsetting the positive earnings drivers were the following items:

•

There was higher amortization of DAC, due to higher gross profits and increased
subsequent deposit activity, primarily in individual annuity.

•

Lower income from the fixed annuity business, due to lower investment spread from the
market value adjusted (“MVA”) product caused by the cumulative effect of accounting
change from the Company’s adoption of SOP 03-1. With the adoption of SOP 03-1, the
Company includes the investment return from the fixed annuity product in net investment
income and includes interest credited to contract holders in the benefits, claims and
claim adjustment expenses. In prior years, the market value spread was reported as
guaranteed separate account income in fee income and other.

•

The effective tax rate increased for the year ended December 31, 2004 due to the absence
of a prior year tax benefit recorded in 2003.

Outlook

Management believes the market for retirement products continues to expand as individuals
increasingly save and plan for retirement. Demographic trends suggest that as the “baby boom”
generation matures, a significant portion of the United States population will allocate a greater
percentage of their disposable incomes to saving for their retirement years due to uncertainty
surrounding the Social Security system and increases in average life expectancy. Competition has
increased substantially in the variable annuities market with most major variable annuity writers
now offering living benefits such as GMWB riders. The Company’s strategy in 2006 revolves around
introducing new products and continually evaluating the portfolio of products currently offered.
As a result, sales may be lower than the level of sales attained in
2005 when considering the competitive environment, the risk of disruption on new sales from product
offering changes, customer acceptance of new products and the effect on the distribution related to
product offering changes.

Individual annuity sales of $11.5 billion in 2005 decreased 27% compared to prior year levels of
$15.7 billion. Significantly contributing to the Company’s variable annuity sales during 2005 and
2004 was Principal First, a GMWB rider. In an effort to meet diverse customer needs, in the fourth
quarter of 2005, Life introduced a new living withdrawal benefit, which guarantees a steady income
stream for the life of the policyholder. The success of this and any new product will ultimately
be based on customer acceptance. With the increased competition in the variable annuity market
causing lower sales levels from the level in 2004, combined with surrender activity on the aging
block of business, net outflows are currently forecasted to be above levels experienced in 2005.
This will be largely dependent on the Company’s ability to attract new customers and to retain
contract holder’s account values in existing or new product offerings as they reach the end of the
surrender charge period of their contract.

The growth and profitability of the individual annuity and mutual fund businesses is dependent to
a large degree on the performance of the equity markets. In periods of favorable equity market
performance, Life may experience stronger sales and higher net flows, which will increase assets
under management and thus increase fee income earned on those assets. In addition, higher equity
market levels will generally reduce certain costs to Life of individual annuities, such as
guaranteed minimum death benefit (“GMDB”) and GMWB benefits. Conversely, weak equity markets may
dampen sales activity and increase surrender activity causing declines in assets under management
and lower fee income. Such declines in the equity markets will also increase the cost to Life of
GMDB and GMWB benefits associated with individual annuities. Life attempts to mitigate some of
the volatility associated with the GMDB and GMWB benefits using reinsurance or other risk
management strategies, such as hedging. Future net income for Life will be affected by the



effectiveness of the risk management strategies Life has implemented to mitigate the net income
volatility associated with the GMDB and GMWB benefits of variable annuity contracts. For
spread-based products sold in the Retail segment, the future growth will depend on the ability to
earn targeted returns on new business given competition, retention of account values in the fixed
annuity business when the contract holder’s rate guarantee expires and the future interest rate
environment.

Retirement Plans primarily offers customized wealth creation and financial protection for
corporate and government employers through its two business units, Government and 401(k).

2005 Compared to 2004 —

Net income in Retirement Plans increased for the year ended December 31,
2005 compared to the prior year primarily due to higher earnings in the 401(k) business. Net
income for the Government business was relatively stable as positive market appreciation was
largely offset by negative net flows, resulting in modest growth in assets under management:

•

401(k) fee income increased 39% or $30 for the year ended December 31, 2005 compared to the
prior year. This increase is a result of positive net flows from the 401(k) business of $1.8
billion over the prior year driven by strong sales and increasing ongoing deposits
contributing to the growth in 401(k) assets under management of 34% to $9.8 billion. Total
401(k) deposits and net flows increased substantially by 32% and 26%, respectively, over the
prior year primarily due to the full year impact of 2004’s expansion of wholesaling
capabilities and new product offerings.

•

The DAC amortization rate decreased in 2005 compared to 2004 as a result of higher profits.

Partially offsetting these positive earnings drivers were the following items:

•

General account spread decreased for both 401(k) and Governmental businesses for the year
ended December 31, 2005 compared to prior year. The decrease is attributable to a
decrease in the net investment income earned rate for both businesses. Average general
account assets for the Retirement Plans segment increased approximately 7% in 2005
compared to 2004, while net investment income increased 2% compared to the prior year.
Benefits and claims expense, which mainly consists of interest credited, increased 5% for
the year ended December 31, 2005 compared to prior year, which was driven by a 7% increase
in Governmental’s general account business.

•

An increase in insurance operating costs and other expenses of $19 during 2005 was
principally driven by the 401(k) business. The additional costs can be attributed to
greater sales and assets under management, resulting in a 20% increase in asset-based
commissions to third parties, technology expenditures, and marketing and servicing costs
supporting the segment’s business. However, the increase in 401(k) sales has driven down
the overall general insurance expense per case by over 4% compared to the prior year.

2004 Compared to 2003 —

Net income for the year ended December 31, 2004 increased primarily due to
higher fee income related to the 401(k) business compared to the prior year. A more expanded
discussion of earnings growth can be found below.

•

401(k) fee income increased 57% or $28 for year ended December 31, 2004 compared to the
prior year. This increase is a result of positive net flows from the 401(k) business of $1.4
billion over the past four quarters driven by strong sales contributing to the



increase in 401(k) assets under management of 42% to $6.5 billion. Total deposits and net flows increased substantially by 45% and
42%, respectively, over the prior year primarily due to the expansion of wholesaling capabilities and new product offerings.

•

The Governmental business contributed significantly higher income in 2004. The 11%
increase in net investment income in 2004 compared to 2003 as well as $9 of additional
fee income was attributed to the growth in the average account values as a result of
positive net flows of $230 and market appreciation of $767.

•

The effective tax rate decreased for the year ended December 31, 2004 due to an
increase in the DRD benefit as a percentage of pre-tax income.

Partially
offsetting these positive earnings drivers was the following item:

•

Insurance operating costs and other expenses for 401(k) increased for the year ended
December 31, 2004 compared to the prior year mainly driven by greater sales and assets
under management, resulting in a 50% increase in commissions over prior year, in
addition to growth in investment technology services and sales and marketing costs.

Outlook

The future profitability of this segment will depend on Life’s ability to increase assets under
management across all businesses and maintain its investment spread earnings on the general account
products sold largely in the Government business. 401(k) sales are expected to remain strong
throughout 2006 primarily due to the continuing growth in the market for retirement products. As
the “baby boom” generation approaches retirement, management believes these individuals will
contribute more of their income to retirement plans due to the uncertainty of the Social Security
system and the increase in average life expectancy. Assets under management are also expected to
increase in 2006 due to both strong sales and the effects of increasing company wholesaling
activities in 2005. Disciplined expense management will continue to be a focus; however, as Life
looks to expand its reach in this market, additional investments in service and technology will
occur. The Government market is highly competitive from a pricing perspective, and a small number
of cases often account for a significant portion of sales, therefore the Company may not be able to
sustain the level of sales growth attained in 2005.

Institutional primarily offers customized wealth creation and financial protection for
institutions, corporate and high net worth individuals through its two business units:
Institutional Investment Products (“IIP”) and PPLI.

2005 Compared to 2004 —

Net income in Institutional increased for the year ended December 31, 2005
compared to the prior year driven by higher earnings in both the Institutional and PPLI businesses:

•

Total revenues increased in Institutional driven by positive net
flows of $2.4 billion during the past four quarters, which
resulted in higher assets under management. Net flows for
Institutional increased for the year ended December 31, 2005
compared to the prior year, primarily as a result of the Company’s
funding agreement backed Investor Notes program, which was
launched in the third quarter of 2004. Investor Note sales for the years ended
December 31, 2005 and 2004 were $2.0 billion and $643,
respectively.

•

General account spread is one of the main drivers of net income
for the Institutional line of business. An increase in spread
income in 2005 was driven by higher assets under management noted
above, combined with improved partnership income and mortality
gains related to terminal funding and structured settlement
contracts that include life contingencies. For the year ended
December 31, 2005 and 2004, gains related to mortality,
investments or other activity were $10 and $3 after-tax,
respectively. During 2005,



the Company invested in more variable rate assets to back the increasing block of variable rate liabilities sold under the stable
value product line. This asset/liability matching strategy has decreased portfolio yields, as variable rate assets have lower
initial coupon yields then fixed rate assets. At the same time the stable value variable rate liabilities have lower crediting
rates in the current period than stable value fixed rate liabilities, which has allowed the Company to maintain-to-slightly-increase
its general account spread on a yield basis.

•

PPLI’s net income increased $3 or 17% compared to prior year primarily due to asset
growth in the variable business combined with favorable mortality experience.

Partially offsetting these positive earnings drivers was the following item:

•

PPLI’s cost of insurance charges has decreased due to reductions in the face amount of
certain cases. These face reductions have also resulted in lower death benefits. This
impact combined with favorable mortality, which increases the provision for future
experience rate credits has led to the year over year decrease in fee income and other.

2004 Compared to 2003 —

Net income for the year ended December 31, 2004 increased primarily due to
PPLI businesses compared to the prior year:

•

The decrease in other expenses was primarily attributed to a PPLI $40 after-tax charge, recorded in the third quarter
ended September 30, 2003, associated with the settlement of a certain litigation matter.

Partially offsetting these positive earnings drivers were the following items:

•

Lower income from the IIP and PPLI businesses, excluding the aforementioned settlement of a certain litigation matter.

•

The decrease in net income in IIP was due primarily to lower spread income and slightly higher insurance operating
costs for the year ended December 31, 2004 as compared to 2003. In addition, IIP reported lower earnings for 2004
compared to the prior year due to favorable mortality experience in 2003.

•

Additionally, income tax expense was higher for 2004 due primarily to decreases in other expenses related to the PPLI
business, as discussed above. The effective tax rate increased over the previous year-end because the percentage
increase in tax preferred items (DRD, tax-exempt interest) was not as great as the percentage increase in pre-tax
income from 2003 to 2004.

•

Earned Premiums decreased for the year ended December 31, 2004 compared to 2003 due to lower sales on limited payment
contracts for the Structured Settlement and Terminal Funding products, consistent with a corresponding decrease in
Benefits, Claims and Claim Adjustment Expenses.

Outlook

The future net income of this segment will depend on Life’s ability to increase assets under
management across all businesses and maintain its investment spread earnings on the products sold
largely in the IIP business. The IIP markets are highly competitive from a pricing perspective, and
a small number of cases often account for a significant portion of sales, therefore the Company may
not be able to sustain the level of assets under management growth attained in 2005. In 2004, IIP
introduced the Hartford Income Notes, a new funding agreement backed product that provides the
Company with opportunity for future growth. This product provides access to both a multi-billion
dollar retail market, and a nearly trillion dollar institutional market. These markets are very
competitive and the Company’s success depends in part on the level of credited interest rates and
the Company’s credit rating.

As the “baby boom” generation approaches retirement, management believes these individuals will
seek investment and insurance vehicles that will give them steady streams of income throughout
retirement. IIP will launch new products in 2006 to provide solutions that deal specifically with
longevity risk. Longevity risk is defined as the likelihood of an individual outliving their
assets. IIP is also designing innovative solutions to corporation’s defined benefit liabilities.
The focus of the PPLI business is variable PPLI products to fund non-qualified benefits or other
post employment benefit liabilities. The market served by PPLI is subject to extensive legal and
regulatory review that could have an adverse effect on its business.

Individual Life provides life insurance solutions to a wide array of partners to solve the
wealth protection, accumulation and transfer needs of their affluent, emerging affluent and
business insurance clients.

2005 Compared to 2004 —

Net income increased $11 or 7% for the year ended December 31, 2005 as
compared to the prior year, primarily due to increases in both life insurance inforce and account
values. The following factors contributed to the earnings increase:

•

Fee income increased $35 for the year ended December 31, 2005 as compared to the prior
year. Cost of insurance charges, a component of total fee income, increased $22 in
2005, driven by business growth and aging of the prior year block of variable
universal, universal, and interest-sensitive whole life insurance inforce. Other fee
income, another component of total fee income, increased $7 in 2005 primarily due to
growth and improved product performance primarily in interest-sensitive whole life and
variable universal life insurance products. Variable fee income grew $6 in 2005, as
equity market performance and premiums in excess of withdrawals added to the variable
universal life account value.

•

Net investment income increased a moderate $2 for the year ended December 31, 2005 as
compared to the prior year due to increased general account assets from business
growth, partially offset by lower interest rates on new investments and reduced
prepayments on bonds in 2005.

•

Benefits, claims and claim adjustment expenses decreased for the year ended December
31, 2005 as compared to the prior year.

•

Income tax expense and the resulting tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2005 was
aided by a DRD tax benefit of $7, whereas income tax expense for the year ended
December 31, 2004 includes a DRD tax benefit of $5.

Partially offsetting these positive earnings drivers were the following factors:

•

Amortization of DAC increased for the year ended December 31, 2005 compared to the
prior year primarily as a result of product mix and higher gross margins within
variable universal and interest-sensitive whole life insurance products.

•

Insurance operating costs and other expenses increased $3 for the year ended December
31, 2005 compared to the prior year as a result of business growth.

2004 Compared to 2003

—

Net income increased $10 or 7% for the year ended December 31, 2004 as
compared to the prior year, primarily driven by increases in both life insurance inforce and
account values, resulting from business growth and improved investment spreads. The following
factors contributed to the earnings increase:

•

Fee income increased for the year ended December 31, 2004 as
compared to the prior year primarily due to increased cost of
insurance charges as life insurance inforce grew and aged and
variable universal life account values increased driven by
favorable equity markets and new sales. Account values and life
insurance inforce grew 9% and 7% from 2003 to 2004, respectively.

•

Net investment income increased for the year ended December 31,
2004 as compared to the prior year primarily due to the adoption
of SOP 03-1, growth in general account values and prepayments on
bonds. The adoption of SOP 03-1 also resulted in



increases in benefits, claims and claim adjustment expenses and a decrease to fee income and
other for the year ended December 31, 2004 as compared to the prior year period for the
segment’s Modified Guarantee Life Insurance product, which was formerly classified as a separate
account product.

Partially offsetting these positive earnings drivers were the following factors:

•

Benefits, claims and claim adjustment expenses increased for the
year ended December 31, 2004 as compared to the prior year
primarily due to the absence in 2004 of the unusually favorable
mortality experienced in 2003, along with continued growth and
aging of life insurance inforce.

•

Insurance operating costs and other expenses increased for the
year ended December 31, 2004 as compared to the prior year as a
result of business growth.

•

Additionally, income tax expense was higher for the year ended
December 31, 2004 as compared to the prior year due primarily to
earnings growth, as discussed above. Income tax expense includes
a DRD tax benefit of $5 related to the 2004 tax year, whereas,
income tax expense for 2003 includes a total DRD tax benefit of
$6.

Outlook

Individual Life sales grew to $250 in 2005 from $233 in 2004 and $196 in 2003 with the successful
introduction of new universal life and variable universal life products. Variable universal life
sales and account values remain sensitive to equity market levels and returns. The Company
continues to pursue new and enhanced products, as well as broader and deeper distribution
opportunities to increase sales. Individual Life continues to face uncertainty surrounding estate
tax legislation, aggressive competition from other life insurance providers, reduced availability
and higher price of reinsurance, and the current regulatory environment regarding reserving
practices for universal life products with no-lapse guarantees which may negatively affect
Individual Life’s future earnings.

The Group Benefits segment provides employers, associations, affinity groups and financial
institutions with group life, accident and disability coverage, along with other products and
services, including voluntary benefits, group retiree health, and medical stop loss. The Company
also offers disability underwriting, administration, claims processing services and reinsurance to
other insurers and self-funded employer plans.

Group Benefits has a block of financial institution business that is experience rated. This
business comprised approximately 9% of the segment’s 2005 and 2004 premiums and other
considerations (excluding buyouts) and, on average, 5% of the segment’s 2005 and 2004 net income.
In 2003, this business comprised 2% of both the segment’s premiums and other considerations
(excluding buyouts) and net income. Under the terms of this business, the loss experience will
inversely affect the commission expenses incurred.

2005 Compared to 2004 —

Net income of $272 included a non-recurring tax benefit of $9 related to
the CNA Acquisition. Excluding this tax benefit, net income increased 15% to $263 for the year
ended December 31, 2005 as compared to $229 for the prior year due primarily to higher earned
premiums and net investment income as well as a favorable loss ratio. The following factors
contributed to the earnings increase:

•

Earned premiums, excluding buyouts, increased 4% driven by sales growth of 23%, particularly in disability, for the year
ended December 31, 2005 and continued strong persistency during 2005.

•

Net investment income increased due to higher average asset balances as well as slightly higher average investment yields.

•

The segment’s loss ratio (defined as benefits, claims and claim adjustment expenses as a percentage of premiums and other
considerations excluding buyouts) was 73.1% for the year ended December 31, 2005, down from 74.0% in the prior year due to
improved morbidity experience as well as favorable mortality experience. Excluding financial institutions, the loss ratio was
77.3%, down from 78.7% in the prior year.



Partially offsetting the positive earnings drivers noted above was the following item:

•

Operating costs were higher for the year ended December 31, 2005 as compared to the prior year primarily due to higher
operating expenses related to business growth.

2004 Compared to 2003

—

Net income increased for the year ended December 31, 2004 as compared to
the prior year due to earned premium growth and net investment income growth as the result of the
CNA Acquisition as well as a favorable loss ratio. The following factors contributed to the
earnings increase:

•

Earned premiums excluding buyouts, increased 57% for the year ended December 31, 2004 as
compared to the prior year driven by premium growth resulting from the CNA Acquisition,
sales growth of 25%, and favorable persistency.

•

The segment’s loss ratio was 74.0% for the year ended December 31, 2004 as compared to
78.5% for the prior year, which contributed favorably to net income. The improvement in
loss ratio in 2004 was the result of improved mortality and morbidity experience.
Excluding financial institutions, the loss ratio was 78.7%, down from 79.5% in the prior
year.

Partially offsetting these favorable items were the following factors:

•

Higher commissions due to higher sales and premiums previously discussed.

•

Operating costs increased due to business growth and the CNA Acquisition.

•

The segment’s ratio of insurance operating costs and other expenses to premiums and other
considerations (excluding buyouts) increased to 27.7% for the year ended December 31, 2004,
from 24.6% for prior year. The increase in expense ratio was primarily attributed to lower
losses, which resulted in increased commissions, on a larger block of experience rated
financial institution business. Excluding the financial institution business, the 2004
expense ratio was 23.6% for the year ended December 31, 2004, down from 23.8% for the prior
year.

Outlook

The Company anticipates the increased scale of the group life and disability operations and the
expanded distribution network for its products and services will generate strong sales growth in
2006. Sales, however, may be negatively affected by the competitive pricing environment in the
marketplace. Management is committed to selling competitively priced products that meet the
Company’s internal rate of return guidelines.

Despite the current market conditions, including low interest rates, rising medical costs, the
changing regulatory environment and cost containment pressure on employers, the Group Benefits
segment continues to leverage its strength in claim practices risk management, service and
distribution, enabling the Company to capitalize on market opportunities. Additionally, employees
continue to look to the workplace for a broader and ever expanding array of insurance products. As
employers design benefit strategies to attract and retain employees, while attempting to control
their benefit costs, management believes that the need for the Group Benefits segment’s products
will continue to expand. This, combined with the significant number of employees who currently do
not have coverage or adequate levels of coverage, creates unique opportunities for our products and
services.

International, with operations in Japan, Brazil, Ireland and the United Kingdom, focuses on
the savings and retirement needs of the growing number of individuals outside the United States who
are preparing for retirement, or have already retired, through the sale of variable annuities,
fixed annuities and other insurance and savings products. The Company’s Japan operation, which
began selling



variable annuities at the end of 2000, has grown significantly to become the largest
distributor of variable annuities in Japan and the largest component of International.

2005 Compared to 2004 —

Net income increased significantly for the year ending December 31, 2005,
principally driven by higher fee income and investment spread in Japan, derived from a 78% increase
in the assets under management. A more expanded discussion of earnings growth can be found below:

2004 Compared to 2003

—

Net income improved in 2004 compared to 2003 primarily as a result of an
increase in fee income from significant growth in the Japan variable annuity business. A more
expanded discussion of earnings growth can be found below:

•

The increase in fee income was primarily attributed
to higher variable annuity assets under management
in our Japan operations. As of December 31, 2004,
Japan’s variable annuity assets under management
were $14.1 billion, a 127% increase from the
previous year.

•

At the end of the third quarter of 2004, the MVA
fixed annuity product was introduced to provided a
diversified product portfolio to customers in Japan.
Japan fixed annuity sales and assets under
management for the year ending December 31, 2004
were $521 and $502, respectively.

Outlook

Management is optimistic about growth potential of the retirement savings market in Japan. Several
trends such as an aging population, longer life expectancies, declining birth rate leading to a
smaller number of younger workers to support each retiree, and under funded pension systems have
resulted in greater need for an individual to plan and adequately fund retirement savings.

As of September 30, 2005, the Japan variable annuity industry assets surpassed $71 billion since
its inception in 1999. As of September 2005, International, with $21.9 billion in assets, had a 31%
market share of the industry’s assets compared to $11.1 billion, a 29% market share as of September
30, 2004. As of December 31, 2005, International had $24.6 billion in variable annuity assets.
Total annuity sales were $11.9 billion in 2005, a 53% increase over the previous year. Sales
included $1.2 billion in fixed annuity sales. Hartford Japan now has over 360,000 customers.

Competition has increased substantially in the Japanese market with most major competitors offering
guaranteed benefit riders and, as a result, the Company may not be able to sustain the level of
sales attained in 2005. Continued growth depends on increasing the Company’s penetration in the
Japanese market by securing new distribution outlets for our products and accessing more customers
within existing distributors. In addition, we will be looking for ways to leverage our variable
annuity capability into other investment product opportunities. In an effort to meet diverse
customer needs, in November 2005, the Company introduced a new variable annuity offering which adds
greater liquidity and asset allocations with a greater equity component. The success of this new
product will ultimately be based on customer acceptance.

Profitability depends on the account values of our customers which are affected by equity, bond and
currency markets. Periods of favorable market performance will increase assets under management and
thus increase fee income earned on those assets. In addition, higher account values levels will
generally reduce certain costs to the Company of individual annuities, such as guaranteed minimum
death benefits (“GMDB”) and GMIB benefits.
Expanse management is also an important component of
product profitability.

Represents the cumulative impact of the Company’s adoption of SOP 03-1.

Net investment income includes the mark-to-market adjustment for equity securities held for
trading which increased primarily due to increased assets and market performance in International.
This increase net investment income is offset by an increase in benefit, claims and claim
adjustment expenses which reflects the interest credited on the Japan account balance liability.

2005 Compared to 2004

—

Net income decreased for the year ended December 31, 2005. The following
factors contributed to the change in earnings:

•

Net realized capital gains decreased for the year
ended December 31, 2005 due to increasing interest
rates and the realized loss associated with the GMWB
derivatives.

•

Income tax benefit decreased for the year ended
December 31, 2005 due to the absence of a $190 tax
benefit recorded during 2004.

•

Other than the impact of Japan interest credited,
benefits, claims, and claim adjustment expenses
increased for the year ended December 31, 2005
primarily due to the establishment of a $102
after-tax reserve for investigations related to
market timing by the SEC and the New York Attorney
General’s Office, directed brokerage by the SEC and
single premium group annuities by the New York
Attorney General’s Office and the Connecticut
Attorney General’s Office.

2004 Compared to 2003

—

Net income increased for the year ended December 31, 2004. The following
factors contributed to the earnings increase:

•

Net realized capital gains increased for the year ended December 31, 2004 due to net gains on bond sales
and lower impairments.

•

Income tax benefit for the year ended December 31, 2004 included a $190 tax benefit.

PROPERTY & CASUALTY

Executive Overview

Property & Casualty is organized into four reportable operating segments: the underwriting
segments of Business Insurance, Personal Lines and Specialty Commercial (collectively “Ongoing
Operations”); and the Other Operations segment.

Property & Casualty provides a number of coverages, as well as insurance related services, to
businesses throughout the United States, including workers’ compensation, property, automobile,
liability, umbrella, specialty casualty, marine, livestock, bond, professional liability and
directors and officers’ liability coverages. Property & Casualty also provides automobile,
homeowners and home-based business coverage to individuals throughout the United States as well as
insurance-related services to businesses.

Property & Casualty derives its revenues principally from premiums earned for insurance coverages
provided to insureds, investment income, and, to a lesser extent, from fees earned for services
provided to third parties and net realized capital gains and losses. Premiums charged for
insurance coverages are earned principally on a pro rata basis over the terms of the related
policies in force.

Service fees principally include revenues from third party claims administration services provided
by Specialty Risk Services and revenues from member contact center services provided through AARP’s
Health Care Options program.

Net income is the measure of profit or loss used in evaluating the performance of Ongoing
Operations and the Other Operations segment. Within Ongoing Operations, the underwriting segments
of Business Insurance, Personal Lines and Specialty Commercial are evaluated by The Hartford’s
management primarily based upon underwriting results. Underwriting results is a before-tax measure
that represents earned premiums less incurred claims, claim adjustment expenses and underwriting
expenses. Underwriting results within Ongoing Operations are influenced significantly by earned
premium growth and the adequacy of the Company’s pricing. Underwriting profitability over time is
also greatly influenced by the Company’s underwriting discipline, which seeks to manage exposure to
loss through favorable risk selection and diversification, its management of claims, its use of
reinsurance and its ability to manage its expense ratio which it accomplishes through economies of
scale and its management of acquisition costs and other underwriting expenses. The Hartford
believes that underwriting results provides investors with a valuable measure of before-tax
profitability derived from underwriting activities, which are managed separately from the Company’s
investing activities. Underwriting results is also



presented for Ongoing Operations and Other Operations. A reconciliation of underwriting results to
net income for Ongoing Operations and Other Operations is set forth in their respective discussions
herein.

Pricing adequacy depends on a number of factors, including the ability to obtain regulatory
approval for rate changes, proper evaluation of underwriting risks, the ability to project future
loss cost frequency and severity based on historical loss experience adjusted for known trends, the
Company’s response to rate actions taken by competitors, and expectations about regulatory and
legal developments and expense levels. Property & Casualty seeks to price its insurance policies
such that insurance premiums and future net investment income earned on premiums received will
cover underwriting expenses and the ultimate cost of paying claims reported on the policies and
provide for a profit margin. For many of its insurance products, Property & Casualty is required
to obtain approval for its premium rates from state insurance departments.

In setting its pricing, Property & Casualty assumes an expected level of losses from natural or
man-made catastrophes that will cover the Company’s exposure to catastrophes over the long-term.
In most years, however, Property & Casualty’s actual losses from catastrophes will be more or less
than that assumed in its pricing due to the significant volatility of catastrophe losses. ISO
defines a catastrophe loss as an event that causes $25 or more in industry insured property losses
and affects a significant number of property and casualty policyholders and insurers.

Given the lag in the period from when claims are incurred to when they are reported and paid, final
claim settlements may vary from current estimates of incurred losses and loss expenses,
particularly when those payments may not occur until well into the future. Reserves for lines of
business with a longer lag (or “tail”) in reporting are more difficult to estimate. Reserve
estimates for longer tail lines are initially set based on loss and loss expense ratio assumptions
estimated when the business was priced and are adjusted as the paid and reported claims develop,
indicating that the ultimate loss and loss expense ratio will differ from the initial assumptions.
Adjustments to previously established loss and loss expense reserves, if any, are reflected in
underwriting results in the period in which the adjustment is determined to be necessary.

Through its Other Operations segment, Property & Casualty is responsible for managing operations of
The Hartford that have discontinued writing new or renewal business as well as managing the claims
related to asbestos and environmental exposures.

Key Performance Ratios and Measures

The Company considers several measures and ratios to be the key performance indicators for the
property and casualty underwriting businesses. The following tables and the segment
discussions for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003 include various premium measures
and underwriting ratios. Management believes that these measures and ratios are useful in
understanding the underlying trends in The Hartford’s property and casualty insurance underwriting
business. However, these key performance indicators should only be used in conjunction with, and
not in lieu of, underwriting income for the individual Property & Casualty segments and net income
for the Property & Casualty business as a whole and may not be comparable to other performance
measures used by the Company’s competitors.

The Company aims to achieve both growth and profitability in the Business Insurance and Personal
Lines businesses and, therefore, key performance indicators for these two segments include both
growth and profitability measures. Specialty Commercial, however, is comprised of transactional
businesses where premium writings may fluctuate based on perceived market opportunity. As such,
the key performance indicators do not include a growth objective for Specialty Commercial. The
number of policies in force is a growth measure used for Personal Lines only.

Combined ratio before catastrophes and prior accident year development

:

The combined ratio before catastrophes and prior accident year development represents the
combined ratio for the current accident year, excluding the impact of catastrophes. The Company
believes this ratio is an important measure of the trend in profitability since it removes the
impact of volatile and unpredictable catastrophe losses and prior accident year reserve
development. Before considering catastrophes, the combined ratio related to current accident
year business has improved from 2004 to 2005 principally due to improved current accident year
performance for auto bodily injury and workers’ compensation claims, partially offset by the
effect of an increase in non-catastrophe loss costs for property coverages and an increase in
the expense ratio, which was largely due to the hurricane-related assessments of $64 in 2005.

Other Operations net income (loss):

The Other Operations segment is responsible for managing operations of The Hartford that have
discontinued writing new or renewal business as well as managing the claims related to asbestos
and environmental exposures. As such, neither earned premiums nor underwriting ratios are
meaningful financial measures. Instead, management believes that net income (loss) is a more
meaningful measure. Whether Other Operations reports net income or a net loss is largely a
function of the amount of prior accident year development and the amount of investment income
earned on assets held to meet claim liabilities. In 2005, Other Operations reported net income
of $71 as net investment income earned exceeded unfavorable prior accident year loss
development. In 2003 and 2004, the segment reported net losses as unfavorable prior accident
year loss development exceeded net investment income. Unfavorable prior accident year
development decreased from $409 in 2004 to $212 in 2005. The net loss in 2003 includes net
asbestos reserve strengthening of $1.7 billion after-tax. Reserve estimates within Other
Operations, including estimates for asbestos and environmental claims, are inherently uncertain.
Refer to the Other Operations segment MD&A for further discussion of Other Operations prior
accident year development and operating results.

The investment return, or yield, on Property & Casualty’s invested assets is an important
element of the Company’s earnings since insurance products are priced with the assumption that
premiums received can be invested for a period of time before loss and loss adjustment expenses are
paid. For longer tail lines, such as workers’ compensation and general liability, claims are paid
over several years and, therefore, the premiums received for these lines of business can generate
significant investment income.

Due to the emphasis on preservation of capital and the need to maintain sufficient liquidity to
satisfy claim obligations, the vast majority of Property & Casualty’s invested assets have been
held in fixed maturities, including, among other asset classes, corporate bonds, municipal bonds,
government debt, short-term debt, mortgage-backed securities and asset-backed securities. Based
upon the fair value of Property & Casualty’s investments as of December 31, 2005 and 2004,
approximately 94% and 96%, respectively, of invested assets were held in fixed maturities.

When fixed maturity or equity investments are sold, any gain or loss is reported in net realized
capital gains (losses). Individual securities may be sold for a variety of reasons, including a
decision to change the Company’s asset allocation in response to market conditions and the need to
liquidate funds to meet large claim settlements Accordingly, net realized capital gains (losses)
for any particular period are not predictable and can vary significantly. Refer to the Investment
section of MD&A for further discussion of net investment income and net realized capital gains
(losses).

Allocation of Invested Assets and Investment Income to Ongoing Operations and Other Operations

Property & Casualty’s insurance business has been written by a number of writing companies that,
under a pooling arrangement, participate in the Hartford Fire Insurance Pool, the lead company of
which is the Hartford Fire Insurance Company (“Hartford Fire”). Property & Casualty maintains one
portfolio of invested assets for all business written by the Hartford Fire Insurance Pool
companies, including business reported in both the Ongoing Operations and Other Operations
segments. Separate investment portfolios are maintained within Other Operations for the runoff of
international assumed reinsurance claims and for the runoff business of Heritage Holdings, Inc.,
including its subsidiaries, Excess Insurance Company Ltd., First State Insurance Company and
Heritage Reinsurance Company, Ltd. Within the Hartford Fire Insurance Pool, invested assets are
attributed to Ongoing Operations and Other Operations pursuant to the Company’s capital attribution
process.

The Hartford attributes capital to each line of business or segment using an internally-developed,
risk-based capital attribution methodology that incorporates management’s assessment of the
relative risks within each line of business or segment, as well as the capital requirements of
external parties, such as regulators and rating agencies.

Net investment income earned on the Hartford Fire invested asset portfolio is allocated between
Ongoing Operations and Other Operations based on the allocation of invested assets to each segment
and the expected investment yields earned by each segment. Net investment income earned on the
separate portfolios within Other Operations is recorded entirely within Other Operations. Based on



the Company’s method of allocating net investment income for the Hartford Fire Insurance Pool and
the net investment income earned by Other Operations on its separate investment portfolios, in
2005, the before-tax investment yield for Ongoing Operations was 5.5% and the before-tax investment
yield for Other Operations was 5.7%.

2005 Compared to 2004 -

Net income increased $326, or 36%, as a result of a $535, or 45%, increase in income before income
taxes. The increase in income before income taxes was driven primarily by the following:

Partially offsetting these improvements were the following:

•

An $89 decrease in net realized capital gains due to lower net realized gains on the
sale of fixed maturity investments and net losses on non-qualifying derivatives during 2005
compared to net gains during 2004.

•

An $88 increase in insurance operating costs, principally related to hurricane-related
assessments. Hurricane-related assessments in 2005 were $64, primarily for assessments
payable to the Florida Citizens Property Insurance Corporation (Citizens) as a result of
losses incurred by Citizens from the 2004 and 2005 Florida hurricanes.

•

An increase in property non-catastrophe current accident year loss and loss adjustment
expenses as a percentage of earned premium.



2004 Compared to 2003

-

Net income increased $1.7 billion, from a net loss of ($745) in 2003, as a result of a $2,508
increase in income before income taxes. The increase in income before income taxes was driven
primarily by the following:

•

A $2.6 billion increase in asbestos and environmental reserves recorded in 2003,

•

An increase in underwriting profit derived from a $779 increase in earned premium,
before considering the $90 reduction in earned premium on retrospectively-rated policies in
2004. The $779 increase in earned premium reflected growth in Business Insurance, Personal
Lines and Specialty Commercial, partially offset by a $346 decline in Other Operations
earned premium as a result of exiting the assumed reinsurance business.

•

A $76 increase in net investment income, primarily driven by an increase in underwriting
cash flow, partially offset by a decrease in the investment yield, and

•

An improvement in non-catastrophe current accident year loss and loss adjustment
expenses as a percentage of earned premium in all segments of Ongoing Operations. The
improvement was principally driven by strong earned pricing and favorable property claim
frequency in 2004.

Partially offsetting these improvements were the following:

•

A $246 increase in current accident year catastrophe losses. Current accident year
catastrophe losses of $523 in 2004 included losses from Hurricanes Charley, Frances, Ivan
and Jeanne.

•

A $194 increase in net unfavorable prior accident year development, before considering
the $2.6 billion of net asbestos and environmental reserve strengthening in 2003. Refer to
the Ongoing Operations and Other Operations sections herein.

•

A $120 decrease in net realized capital gains due to lower net realized gains on the sale of fixed maturity investments.

•

A $90 reduction in earned premium on retrospectively-rated policies recorded within Specialty Commercial in 2004.

Reserves

Reserving for property and casualty losses is an estimation process. As additional experience and
other relevant claim data become available, reserve levels are adjusted accordingly. Such
adjustments of reserves related to claims incurred in prior years are a natural occurrence in the
loss reserving process and are referred to as “reserve development.” Reserve development that
increases previous estimates of ultimate loss costs is called “reserve strengthening.” Reserve
development that decreases previous estimates of ultimate loss costs is called “reserve releases.”
Reserve development can influence the comparability of year over year underwriting results and is
set forth in the paragraphs and tables that follow. The “prior accident year development” in the
following table represents the ratio of reserve development to earned premiums. For a detailed
discussion of the Company’s reserve policies, see Notes 1, 11 and 12 of Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements and the discussion in Critical Accounting Estimates.

Current accident year catastrophe loss and loss adjustment expenses

In 2005, the current accident year provision for claim and claim adjustment expenses of $6.7
billion included net catastrophe loss and loss adjustment expenses of $351, of which $264 related
to Hurricanes Katrina, Rita and Wilma. The following table shows current accident year catastrophe
impacts in 2005, including reinstatement premium owed to reinsurers:

A significant portion of the gross incurred loss and loss adjustment expenses are recoverable
from reinsurers under the Company’s principal catastrophe reinsurance program in addition to other
reinsurance programs. Reinsurance recoveries under the Company’s principal catastrophe reinsurance
program, which covers multiple lines of business, are allocated to the segments in accordance with
a pre-established methodology that is consistent with the method used to allocate the ceded premium
to each segment. In addition to its retention, the Company has a co-participation in the losses
ceded under the principal catastrophe reinsurance program, which varies by layer, and is recorded
in Specialty Commercial. In the third and fourth quarters of 2005, the Company reinstated the
limits under its reinsurance programs that were exhausted by Hurricane Katrina and Wilma, resulting
in additional ceded premium of $73, which is reflected as a reduction in earned premium.

The Company’s estimates of net loss and loss expenses arising from Hurricanes Katrina, Rita and
Wilma are based on information from reported claims and estimates of reinsurance recoverables on
ceded losses. Estimating ultimate net losses for the 2005 hurricanes is challenging. Given the
long time lag between Hurricane Katrina’s landfall and when many residents and business owners were
able to return to their properties, the Company expects reported losses to emerge more slowly for
Hurricane Katrina than for past hurricanes. Also, the extent of the damage caused by the
hurricanes in the Gulf coast region potentially will increase loss costs due to increased demand
for building materials and contractors needed to complete repair work. Given the inherent
uncertainty in how reported claims will ultimately develop, ultimate loss and loss expenses paid
after December 31, 2005 for Hurricanes Katrina, Rita and Wilma could vary significantly from the
reserves recorded as of December 31, 2005.

The Company’s estimate of loss and loss adjustment expenses under Hurricanes Katrina, Rita and
Wilma is based on covered losses under the terms of the policies. The Company does not provide
residential flood insurance on its Personal Lines homeowners policies so the Company’s estimate of
hurricane losses on Personal Lines homeowners business does not include any provision for damages
arising from flood waters. The Company acts as an administrator for the Write Your Own flood
program on behalf of the National Flood Insurance Program under FEMA, for which it earns a fee for
collecting premiums and processing claims. Under the program, the Company services both personal
lines and commercial lines flood insurance policies and does not assume any underwriting risk. As
a result, catastrophe losses in the above table do not include any losses related to the Write Your
Own flood program.

During the year ended December 31, 2005, the Company’s reestimates of prior accident year
reserves included the following significant reserve changes.

Ongoing Operations

Other Operations

•

Strengthened assumed reinsurance reserves by $85, principally for accident years 1997
through 2001. In recent years, the Company has seen an increase in reported losses above
previous expectations and this increase in reported losses contributed to the reserve
re-estimates. Assumed reinsurance exposures are inherently less predictable than direct
insurance exposures because the Company may not receive notice of a reinsurance claim until
the underlying direct insurance claim is mature. The reserve strengthening of $85 represents
6% of the $1.3 billion of net Reinsurance reserves within Other Operations as of December 31,
2004. The “all other” category of reserves covers a wide range of insurance and assumed
reinsurance coverages, including, but not limited to, potential liability for construction
defects, lead paint, molestation, silica, pharmaceutical products and other long-tail
liabilities.

•

Strengthened environmental reserves by $37 as a result of an environmental reserve
evaluation completed during the third quarter of 2005. While the review found no apparent
underlying cause or change in the claim environment, loss estimates for individual cases
changed based upon the particular circumstances of each account. The $37 of reserve
strengthening represented 1% of the Company’s net reserves for asbestos and environmental
claims as of December 31, 2004.

Current accident year catastrophe loss and loss adjustment expenses

In 2004, the current accident year provision for claim and claim adjustment expenses of $6.6
billion included net catastrophe loss and loss adjustment expenses of $523, of which $394 related
to Hurricanes Charley, Frances, Ivan and Jeanne. Gross of reinsurance, current accident year
catastrophe losses were $811.

The Company’s estimates of net loss and loss expenses arising from Hurricanes Charley, Frances,
Ivan and Jeanne are based on information from reported claims and estimates of reinsurance
recoverables on ceded losses. In the third quarter of 2004, the Company reinstated the limits
under its reinsurance programs that were exhausted by the 2004 hurricanes, resulting in additional
ceded premium of $17, which is reflected as a reduction in earned premium.

During the year ended December 31, 2004, the Company’s re-estimates of prior accident year
reserves included the following significant reserve changes.

Ongoing Operations

•

Released September 11 net reserves by $298 due to favorable developments in 2004, including
the closure of primary insurance property cases, a high participation rate within the Victim’s
Compensation Fund and the expiration of the deadline for filing a liability claim in March
2004.



•

Strengthened reserves for construction defects claims by $190, representing 11% of the
Company’s $1.8 billion of net reserves for general liability claims as of December 31, 2004.
The Company’s construction defects claims, which relate primarily to accident years prior to
2000, have experienced increasing severity, particularly due to losses from contractors in
California.

•

Strengthened auto liability reserves by $25 and package business reserves by $38 related to
accident years 1998 to 2002 as actual reported losses were above previous expectations. In
particular, the Company observed a higher frequency of large claims (generally those greater
than $100,000) than had been anticipated in prior estimates. The auto liability reserve
strengthening of $25 represented 1% of the Company’s net reserves for auto liability claims as
of December 31, 2004 and the package business reserve strengthening of $38 represented 3% of
the Company’s net reserves for package business as of December 31, 2004.

•

Within the Specialty Commercial segment there were other offsetting positive and negative
adjustments. The principal offsetting adjustments related to a strengthening in specialty
large deductible workers’ compensation reserves and a release in other liability reserves,
each approximately $150.

Other Operations

•

Reduced the reinsurance recoverable asset associated with older, long-term casualty
liabilities, including asbestos liabilities, by $181. Strengthened environmental reserves by
$75.

•

Strengthened reserves for assumed casualty reinsurance by $170, primarily related to
assumed casualty treaty reinsurance for the years 1997 through 2001. The $170 of
strengthening represents 13% of the $1.3 billion of net Reinsurance reserves as of December
31, 2004. In recent years, the Company has seen an increase in reported assumed reinsurance
claims above previous expectations and this increase in reported claims contributed to the
reserve re-estimates.

•

Released September 11 net reserves by $97 due to favorable developments, including a lack
of significant additional loss notices on assumed reinsurance property treaties.

During the year ended December 31, 2003, the Company’s re-estimates of prior accident year
reserves included the following significant reserve changes.

Ongoing Operations

•

Strengthened reserves in Specialty Commercial by $52, primarily as a result of losses in the bond and professional
liability lines of business. The bond reserve strengthening was isolated to a few severe
contract surety claims related to accident year 2002. The professional liability reserve
strengthening involved a provision for anticipated settlements of reinsurance obligations for
contracts outstanding at the time of the original acquisition of Reliance Group Holdings’ auto
residual value portfolio in the third quarter of 2000.

Other Operations

•

As discussed in the Other Operations segment section, strengthened net asbestos reserves by
$2.6 billion.

•

Strengthened assumed reinsurance reserves by $129, primarily related to accident years 1997
through 2000 and principally in the casualty line of HartRe assumed reinsurance.

Impact of Re-estimates

As explained in connection with the Company’s discussion of Critical Accounting Estimates, the
establishment of Property and Casualty reserves is an estimation process, using a variety of
methods, assumptions and data elements. Ultimate losses may vary significantly from the current
estimates. Many factors can contribute to these variations and the need to change the previous
estimate of required reserve levels. Subsequent changes can generally be thought of as being the
result of the emergence of additional facts that were not known or anticipated at the time of the
prior reserve estimate and/or changes in interpretations of information and trends.

The table below shows the range of annual reserve re-estimates experienced by The Hartford over the
past five years. The amount of prior accident year development (as shown in the reserve
rollforward) for a given calendar year is expressed as a percent of the beginning calendar year
reserves, net of reinsurance. The percentage relationships presented are significantly influenced
by the facts and circumstances of each particular year and by the fact that only the last five
years are included in the range. Accordingly, these percentages are not intended to be a
prediction of the range of possible future variability. See “Impact of key assumptions on reserve
volatility” within Critical Accounting Estimates for further discussion of the potential for
variability in recorded loss reserves.

[2]

Before the reserve strengthening for asbestos and environmental reserves over the past ten
years, reserve re-estimates for total Property and Casualty ranged from (3.0%) to 1.6% .

The potential variability of the Company’s Property and Casualty reserves would normally be
expected to vary by segment and the types of loss exposures insured by those segments.
Illustrative factors influencing the potential reserve variability for each of the segments are
discussed under Critical Accounting Estimates. In general, over the long term, the Company would
expect the variability of its Personal Lines reserve estimates to be relatively less than the
variability of the reserve estimates for its other property and casualty segments. The Company
would expect the degree of variability of the remaining segments’ reserve estimates, from lower
variability to higher variability, to be generally Business Insurance, Specialty Commercial, and
Other Operations. The actual relative variability could prove to be different than anticipated.

Risk Management Strategy

The Hartford’s property and casualty operations have processes to manage catastrophic risk
exposures to natural disasters, such as hurricanes and earthquakes, and other perils, such as
terrorism. The Hartford’s risk management processes include, but are not limited to, disciplined
underwriting protocols, exposure controls, sophisticated risk modeling, effective risk transfer,
and efficient capital management strategies.

In managing exposure, The Hartford’s risk management processes involve establishing underwriting
guidelines for both individual risks, including individual policy limits, and in aggregate,
including aggregate exposure limits by geographic zone and peril. The Company establishes exposure
limits and actively monitors the risk exposures as a percent of Property & Casualty surplus. For
natural catastrophe perils, the Company generally limits its exposure to natural catastrophes from
a single 250-year event to less than 30% of Property & Casualty statutory surplus for losses prior
to reinsurance and to less than 15% of Property & Casualty statutory surplus for losses net of
reinsurance. For terrorism, the Company manages its exposure in major metropolitan areas to
single-site conventional terrorism attacks, such that the Company endeavors to limit its exposure,
including exposures resulting from the Company’s Group Life operations, to less than 7% of the
combined statutory surplus of the Life and Property and Casualty operations. The Company monitors
exposures monthly and employs both internally developed and vendor-licensed loss modeling tools as
part of its risk management discipline.

In managing risk, The Hartford utilizes reinsurance to transfer exposures to well-established and
financially secure reinsurers. Reinsurance is used to manage aggregate exposures as well as
specific risks based on accumulated property and casualty liabilities in certain geographic zones.
All treaty purchases related to the Company’s property and casualty operations are administered by
a



centralized function to support a consistent strategy and ensure that the reinsurance activities
are fully integrated into the organization’s risk management processes.

A variety of traditional reinsurance products are used as part of the Company’s risk management
strategy, including excess of loss occurrence-based products that protect aggregate property and
workers’ compensation exposures, and individual risk or quota share products, that protect specific
classes or lines of business. There are no significant finite risk contracts in place and the
statutory surplus benefit from all such prior year contracts is immaterial. Facultative
reinsurance is also used to manage policy-specific risk exposures based on established underwriting
guidelines. The Hartford also participates in governmentally administered reinsurance facilities
such as the Florida Hurricane Catastrophe Fund (“FHCF”), the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program
established under The Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of 2002 and other reinsurance programs relating
to particular risks or specific lines of business.

Catastrophe Treaty Protection

The Company has several catastrophe reinsurance programs, including reinsurance treaties that cover
property and workers’ compensation losses aggregating from single catastrophe events.

For property catastrophe losses, the Company has a
principal property catastrophe reinsurance
program and other treaties that cover losses specific to a line of business. The Hartford’s
principal property catastrophe reinsurance program for the treaty year effective January 1, 2005,
provided coverage, on average, for 88% of $695 of losses incurred from a single catastrophe event
in excess of a $125 retention. The exact amount and percentage of coverage varies by layer. Among
the specific line of business treaties, the Company has two treaties covering losses on business
written by the Specialty Commercial unit. For the treaty year effective January 1, 2005, one of
the two specialty property treaties covered, on average, 95% of up to $290 of losses incurred from
a single catastrophe event in excess of a $10 retention on excess and surplus property business.
For the treaty year effective July 1, 2005, the other specialty property treaty covers 95% of up to
$175 of losses incurred from a single catastrophe event in excess of a $10 retention on specialty
property business written with national accounts. Property catastrophe losses incurred on
specialty property business written with national accounts is also reimbursable under the principal
catastrophe reinsurance program, subject to the overall program limits and retention.

In addition, the Company has reinsurance from FHCF which covered, for the treaty year effective
June 1, 2005, 90% of up to $312 of Personal Lines property losses incurred from a single
catastrophe event in excess of an $83 retention. The Company has other treaties and facultative
reinsurance agreements that cover property catastrophe losses on a per risk basis. Also, for the
treaty year effective July 1, 2005, the Company reinsured 95% of up to $280 of workers’
compensation losses incurred from a single catastrophe event in excess of a $20 retention.

For catastrophe treaties that renewed on January 1, 2006, the terms of the treaties are
substantially unchanged in 2006, except that the principal property catastrophe program provides
coverage, on average, for 88% of up to $675 of property losses incurred from a single catastrophe
event in excess of a $175 retention. Also, the Company’s retention on the specialty property
treaty covering excess and surplus lines property business was
increased from $10 to $20 and provides coverage on average for 95% of up to $330 of losses incurred on a single catastrophe event. In the
aftermath of the 2004 and 2005 hurricane season, third-party catastrophe loss models for hurricane
loss events are being updated to incorporate medium-term forecasts of increased hurricane frequency
and severity. Given the losses sustained by reinsurers from the 2004 and 2005 hurricanes and the
changes being made to the third-party catastrophe loss models for the peril of hurricane,
reinsurance pricing has increased with the January 1, 2006 renewals. Like other property and
casualty insurance companies, the Company has been reviewing its capacity to write business in
catastrophe prone areas and will consider further changes to its reinsurance programs.

The principal property catastrophe reinsurance program and other reinsurance programs include a
provision to reinstate limits in the event that a catastrophe loss exhausts limits on one or more
layers under the treaties. Limits were reinstated under the principal catastrophe reinsurance
program and the specialty property treaties after Hurricane Katrina and Hurricane Wilma, resulting
in recording estimated reinstatement premium of $60 in the third quarter of 2005 and $13 in the
fourth quarter of 2005. In addition to the reinstated limits under the principal catastrophe and
other reinsurance programs, the Company purchased additional limits for losses that may arise from
future catastrophe events, the premium for which will be recognized over the future coverage
period.

In addition to the reinsurance protection provided by The Hartford’s principal catastrophe
reinsurance program, in November 2004, the Company purchased two fully collateralized, four-year
reinsurance coverages for losses sustained from qualifying hurricane and earthquake loss events.
The Company purchased this reinsurance from Foundation Re, a Cayman Islands reinsurance company,
which financed the provision of reinsurance through the issuance of $248 in catastrophe bonds to
investors under two separate bond tranches. The first coverage provides reinsurance protection
above the Company’s principal reinsurance program and covers losses arising from large hurricane
loss events affecting the Gulf and Eastern Coast of the United States. The coverage reinsures 45%
of $400 in losses in excess of an index loss trigger equating to approximately $1.3 billion in
Hartford losses. The index trigger has an estimated probability of attachment of approximately
1-in-100 years. The second coverage purchased by the Company reinsures 90% of $75 in losses in
excess of an index loss trigger equating to approximately $125 in Hartford losses arising from
qualifying hurricane and earthquake events. Qualifying hurricane and earthquake events are those
which occur in the year following a large hurricane or earthquake event that has an estimated
occurrence probability of 1-in-100 years. If industry loss estimates as of December 31, 2005 prove
to be correct, neither Hurricane Katrina, Rita or Wilma would trigger a recovery under this
program. Accordingly, the Company has not recorded any recoveries from Foundation Re.

In February of 2006, the Company purchased $105 of additional four-year reinsurance protection from
Foundation Re. This additional purchase provides coverage for 26% of $400 in losses in excess of
an index loss trigger of $1.3 billion from Gulf and East Coast



hurricanes and from California, Pacific Northwest, and New Madrid earthquake events. Foundation Re
financed the provision of this additional reinsurance through the issuance of $105 of catastrophe
bonds to investors.

For terrorism, private sector catastrophe reinsurance capacity is extremely limited and generally
unavailable for terrorism losses caused by attacks with nuclear, biological, chemical or
radiological weapons. As such, the Company’s principal reinsurance protection against large-scale
terrorist attacks is the coverage currently provided through the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of
2002 (TRIA). On December 22, 2005, the President signed the Terrorism Risk Insurance Extension
Act of 2005 (“TRIEA”) extending the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of 2002 (“TRIA”) through the end
of 2007. TRIA provides a backstop for insurance-related losses resulting from any “act of
terrorism” certified by the Secretary of the Treasury, in concurrence with the Secretary of State
and Attorney General, that results in industry losses in excess of $50 in 2006 and $100 in 2007.
Under the program, the federal government would pay 90% of covered losses from a certified act of
terrorism in 2006 after an insurer’s losses exceed 17.5% of the Company’s eligible direct
commercial earned premiums in 2005, up to a combined annual aggregate limit for the federal
government and all insurers of $100 billion. In 2007, the federal government would pay 85% of
covered losses from a certified act of terrorism after an insurer’s losses exceed 20% of the
Company’s eligible direct commercial earned premiums in 2006, up to a combined annual aggregate
limit for the federal government and all insurers of $100 billion. If an act of terrorism or acts
of terrorism result in covered losses exceeding the $100 billion annual limit, insurers with losses
exceeding their deductibles will not be responsible for additional losses.

Given the possibility that TRIA may not be extended beyond December 31, 2007 and the very limited
private terrorism reinsurance capacity available, including reinsurance against losses from
terrorism acts using weapons of mass destruction, the Company has been actively managing its
exposures to the peril of terrorism, including adopting underwriting actions designed to reduce
exposures in specific locations of the country. The Company has worked with various industry
groups to develop policy exclusions related to the peril of terrorism, including those associated
with nuclear, biological, chemical and radiological attacks. The Company may include such
exclusions in policies in the future in those jurisdictions and classes of business where such
exclusions are permitted, and take additional underwriting actions as deemed appropriate.

To manage the potential credit risk resulting from the use of reinsurance, a Reinsurance Security
Committee, representing several disciplines within the Company (i.e. underwriting, legal,
accounting, senior management), evaluates the credit standing, financial performance, management
and operational quality of each potential reinsurer. Through that process, the committee maintains
a list of reinsurers approved for participation on all treaty and facultative reinsurance
placements. The Company’s approval designations reflect the differing credit exposure associated
with various classes of business. Participation authorizations are categorized along property,
short-tail casualty and long-tail casualty lines. In addition to defining participation
eligibility, the Company regularly monitors each active reinsurer’s credit risk exposure in the
aggregate and limits that exposure based upon independent credit rating levels.

Reinsurance Recoverables

The Company’s net reinsurance recoverables from various property and casualty reinsurance
arrangements amounted to $5.6 billion and $5.2 billion as of December 31, 2005 and December 31,
2004, respectively. Of the total net reinsurance recoverables as of December 31, 2005, 8.9%
relates to the Company’s mandatory participation in various involuntary assigned risk pools, which
are backed by the financial strength of the property and casualty insurance industry. Of the
remainder, $3.7 billion, or 73.0%, were rated by A.M. Best. Of the total rated by A.M. Best, 94.4%
were rated A- (excellent) or better. The remaining $1.4 billion, or 27%, of net recoverables from
reinsurers were comprised of the following: 5.7% related to voluntary pools, 3.7% related to
captive insurance companies, and 17.6% related to companies not rated by A.M. Best.

Where its contracts permit, the Company secures future claim obligations with various forms of
collateral including irrevocable letters of credit, secured trusts, funds held accounts and group
wide offsets. The allowance for uncollectible reinsurance was $413 and $374 as of December 31,
2005 and December 31, 2004, respectively. As part of its reinsurance recoverable review, the
Company analyzes recent developments in commutation activity between reinsurers and cedants,
recent trends in arbitration and litigation outcomes in disputes between cedants and reinsurers
and the overall credit quality of the Company’s reinsurers. Due to the inherent uncertainties as
to collection and the length of time before such amounts will be due, it is possible that future
adjustments to the Company’s reinsurance recoverables, net of the allowance, could be required,
which could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s consolidated results of operations or
cash flows in a particular quarterly or annual period.

Annually, the Company completes an evaluation of the reinsurance recoverable asset associated
with older, long-term casualty liabilities reported in the Other Operations segment. As a result
of this evaluation, the Company reduced its net reinsurance recoverable by $20 in 2005 and $181 in
2004. The after-tax income effect of the $181 reduction in 2004 was $118. The $181 primarily
related to a reduction of the amount of liabilities, principally asbestos, that the Company
expected to cede to reinsurers and, to a lesser extent, an increase in the allowance for
uncollectible reinsurance recoverables.

Premium Measures

Written premium is a statutory accounting financial measure which represents the amount of premiums
charged for policies issued, net of reinsurance, during a fiscal period. Earned premium is a GAAP
and statutory measure. Premiums are considered earned and are included in the financial results on
a pro rata basis over the policy period. Management believes that written premium is a performance
measure that is useful to investors as it reflects current trends in the Company’s sale of property
and casualty insurance products. Statutory accounting principles allow companies to report written
premium for workers’ compensation business in either the period the premiums are billed or the
period the policies incept

.

Prior to the fourth quarter of 2005, premiums for most workers’
compensation policies were recognized as written in the period the premiums were billed. In the
fourth quarter of 2005, the Company changed its statutory accounting practice for workers’
compensation premium to recognize the premium as written in the period the policies incept,



consistent with the statutory accounting practice followed for the rest of the Company’s business.
This change had no effect on earned premium. For all periods presented, written premium for
workers’ compensation business has been adjusted to reflect written premium in the period the
policies incept. Reinstatement premium represents additional ceded premium paid for the
reinstatement of the amount of reinsurance coverage that was reduced as a result of a reinsurance
loss payment.

Unless otherwise specified, the following discussion speaks to changes for the year ended December
31, 2005 compared to the year ended December 31, 2004 and the year ended December 31, 2004 compared
to the year ended December 31, 2003.

ONGOING OPERATIONS

Ongoing Operations includes the three underwriting segments of Business Insurance, Personal
Lines and Specialty Commercial.

Earned Premiums

Earned premium growth is an objective for Business Insurance and Personal Lines. Earned premium
growth is not a specific objective for Specialty Commercial since Specialty Commercial is comprised
of transactional businesses where premium writings may fluctuate based on the segment’s view of
perceived market opportunity. Written premiums are earned over the policy term, which is six
months for certain Personal Lines auto business and 12 months for substantially all of the
remainder of the Company’s business. Written pricing, new business growth and premium renewal
retention are factors that contribute to growth in written and earned premium.

The difference between written premiums and earned premiums is attributable to the change in
unearned premium reserve.


compared to 2004

•

Total Ongoing Operations’ earned premiums grew $682, or 7%, due primarily to
growth in Business Insurance and Personal Lines. Earned premiums are net of third and
fourth quarter property catastrophe reinstatement premiums related to hurricanes totaling
$73 in 2005 and $17 in 2004.

•

Earned premium growth of $486 in Business Insurance was primarily driven by
new business premium growth outpacing non-renewals in the prior 12 months. Earned premium
growth of $165 in Personal Lines was primarily driven by new business growth outpacing
non-renewals in auto and the effect of earned pricing increases in homeowners.

•

Specialty Commercial earned premiums increased by $31, primarily driven by a
$90 reduction in earned premiums under retrospectively-rated policies during 2004 and
increases in casualty, bond, professional liability and other premiums, partially offset
by a $216 decrease in property earned premiums, primarily due to a decrease of $127 from
exiting the multi-peril crop insurance business during 2004.


compared to 2003

•

Total Ongoing Operations’ earned premiums grew $1.1 billion, or 13%, due to growth in
all three segments. Earned premiums are net of third quarter property catastrophe
reinstatement premium of $17 in 2004.

•

Business Insurance and Personal Lines earned premiums increased by $867 due to earned
pricing increases and new business premium growth outpacing non-renewals.

•

Specialty Commercial earned premiums increased by $168, primarily due to a $75 increase
in earned premiums from a captive insurance program and increases in earned premium for
property, bond, professional liability and other, partially offset by a $90 decrease in
earned premiums under retrospectively rated-rated policies recorded in 2004.

2005 Compared to 2004

Net income increased $210, or 22%, driven primarily by the following:

•

A $246 increase in underwriting results, and

•

A $179 increase in net investment income due, in part, to a larger investment
base due to increased cash flows from underwriting, higher investment yields on fixed
maturity investments and an increase in income from limited partnership investments. Also
contributing to the increase, was the effect of allocating more invested assets to Ongoing
Operations in 2005. Less invested assets were needed in Other Operations given the
reduction in Other Operations’ loss reserves and the reduction in invested assets needed to
support those reserves.

The improvements in net income were partially offset by:

•

A $79 decrease in net realized capital gains due to lower net realized gains on the sale
of fixed maturity investments and lower net gains on non-qualifying derivatives, and

•

A $139 increase in income tax expense, reflecting an increase in income before income
taxes.

Underwriting results increased by $246, with a corresponding 2.1 point improvement in the combined
ratio from 95.3 to 93.2, driven primarily by the following factors.

•

A $171 decrease in current accident year catastrophe losses. Catastrophe losses in 2005
included $264 of losses from Hurricanes Katrina, Rita and Wilma, whereas catastrophe losses
in 2004 included $394 of losses from Hurricanes Charley, Frances, Ivan and Jeanne,

•

A $106 improvement in current accident year underwriting results before catastrophes,
with a corresponding 0.3 point improvement in the combined ratio before catastrophes and
prior accident year development,

•

A net reserve release of $95 in 2005, predominantly related to allocated loss adjustment
expenses on Personal Lines auto liability claims,

•

A $75 release of workers’ compensation reserves in 2005 related to accident years 2003
and 2004, and



•

Net unfavorable reserve development of $5 in 2004, including reserve increases of $303,
partially offset by a reserve release of $298 for September 11. Reserve increases in 2004
included $190 for construction defects claims, $38 for small commercial package business and
$25 for auto liability claims.

Partially offsetting these improvements were factors decreasing underwriting results and increasing
the combined ratio:

•

A $120 strengthening of workers’ compensation reserves in 2005 related to reserves for
claim payments expected to emerge after 20 years of development,

•

A $40 strengthening of general liability reserves within Business Insurance related to accident years 2000 to 2003, and

•

Reserve strengthening of $33 related to the third quarter 2004 hurricanes.

The $106 improvement in current accident year underwriting results before catastrophes is primarily
due to earned premium growth and a slight improvement in current accident year non-catastrophe loss
costs, partially offset by $64 of hurricane-related assessments in 2005. Earned premiums grew
$682, primarily due to growth in Business Insurance and Personal Lines and the effect of a $90
decrease in earned premium on retrospectively rated policies recorded in 2004, partially offset by
a decrease in specialty property earned premium and a $56 increase in catastrophe treaty
reinstatement premiums.

The combined ratio before catastrophes and prior accident year development decreased from 2004 to
2005 due to the effect of the $90 decrease in earned premium on retrospectively-rated policies in
2004. Before the effect of the $90 earned premium reduction in 2004, the combined ratio before
catastrophes and prior accident year development increased 0.5 points, to 89.4 in 2005, principally
due to an increase in the expense ratio, partially offset by a slight improvement in current
accident year loss and loss adjustment expense ratio. In 2005, the Company recognized improved
current accident year performance for auto bodily injury and workers’ compensation claims,
partially offset by the effect of an increase in non-catastrophe property loss costs.
Non-catastrophe property loss costs increased primarily due to increasing claim severity and, in
specialty property, increasing claim frequency as well.

The expense ratio increased 0.6 points during 2005, to 26.5, primarily due to $64 of hurricane
related assessments incurred in 2005 related to the 2004 and 2005 hurricanes. Apart from the
impact of hurricane related assessments, the favorable effects on the expense ratio of an increase
in earned premiums, a reduction in contingent commissions and a shift to lower commission workers’
compensation business were offset by the unfavorable effects of an increase in catastrophe treaty
reinstatement premiums and reduced catastrophe treaty profit commissions. The reduction in
contingent commissions was due, in part, to a decision made by some agents and brokers not to
accept contingent commissions after the third quarter of 2004. The hurricane-related assessments
were predominantly from the Citizens Property Insurance Corporation (Citizens) in Florida. Citizens
is a company established by the State of Florida to provide personal and commercial insurance to
individuals and businesses in Florida who are in high risk areas of the state and are unable to
obtain insurance through the private insurance markets. The third quarter 2004 hurricanes caused a
deficit in Citizens’ “high risk” account, which triggered an assessment to the Company of $15. In
addition, the Company recorded an estimated Citizens’ assessment of $46 based on losses sustained
by Citizens as a result of hurricane Wilma in the fourth quarter of 2005. Assessments recorded
related to the 2004 and 2005 hurricanes could be adjusted in future periods as catastrophe losses
develop. While the Company may recoup these assessments from Florida policyholders through
surcharges that it will bill on new and renewal premium written in the future, the surcharges are
not recognized until the period in which the future premium is earned.

2004 compared to 2003

Net income increased $172, or 22%, driven primarily by the following:

•

A $147 increase in underwriting results.

•

A $67 increase in net investment income, primarily as a result of an increase in
underwriting cash flow, partially offset by a decrease in the before-tax investment yield,
and

•

A $62 decrease in other expenses, primarily due to $41 of severance costs in 2003 and a
reduction in bad debt expense in 2004 due to improved collection efforts in Business
Insurance.

The improvements in net income were partially offset by:

•

A $53 decrease in net realized capital gains due to lower net realized gains on the sale of fixed maturity investments, and

•

An $85 increase in income tax expense reflecting the increase in income before income taxes.

Underwriting results increased by $147, with a corresponding 1.2 point improvement in the combined
ratio from 96.5 to 95.3, driven primarily by the factors described below.

Factors improving underwriting results and the combined ratio:

•

A $362 improvement in current accident year underwriting results before catastrophes,
with a corresponding 3.1 point improvement in the combined ratio before catastrophes and
prior accident year development, and

•

A $20 strengthening of contract surety claim reserves in 2003 related to accident year
2002 and a $25 provision in 2003 related to the auto residual value business acquired from
Reliance Group Holdings in 2000.

Partially offsetting these improvements were factors decreasing underwriting results and increasing
the combined ratio:

•

A $250 increase in current accident year catastrophe losses, due to losses from
Hurricanes Charley, Frances, Ivan and Jeanne in the third quarter of 2004.



•

Net unfavorable reserve development of $5 in 2004, including reserve increases of $303,
partially offset by a reserve release of $298 for September 11. Reserve increases in 2004
included $190 for construction defects claims, $38 for small
commercial package business and $25 for auto liability claims.

The $362 improvement in current accident year underwriting results before catastrophes is due to
earned premium growth and an improvement in the combined ratio before catastrophes and prior
accident year development, partially offset by the effect of a $90 decrease in earned premium on
retrospectively rated policies recorded in 2004. The combined ratio before catastrophes and prior
accident year development improved 3.1 points, to 89.7, primarily due to strong earned pricing, an
improvement in non-catastrophe current accident year loss and loss adjustment expenses and a 0.9
point improvement in the expense ratio.

The improvement in current accident year non-catastrophe loss and loss adjustment expenses was
primarily due to favorable claim frequency. The 0.9 point improvement in the expense ratio was
principally due to the effect of earned premium growth and a shift to lower commission workers’
compensation business.

Earned Premiums

2005 Compared to 2004

Earned premiums for Business Insurance increased $486, or 11%, in 2005, primarily due to new
business growth outpacing non-renewals in both small commercial and middle market over the
preceding twelve months and modest earned pricing increases in small commercial, partially offset
by earned pricing decreases in middle market.

•

Growth in small commercial earned premium was driven primarily by growth in workers’
compensation and package business for both Select Xpand and traditional Select. New
business written premium for small commercial increased by $6, as an increase in new
business for workers’ compensation was largely offset by a decrease in new business for
package and commercial auto. Premium renewal retention for small commercial increased from
83% to 86% in 2005, excluding the impact of modest written pricing increases.

•

Growth in middle market earned premium was driven primarily by growth in workers’
compensation and marine, partially offset by a decrease in property and commercial auto.
New business written premium for middle market increased by $22 for the year ended December
31, 2005, mostly related to workers’ compensation business. Premium renewal retention for
middle market increased from 83% to 86%, excluding the impact of written pricing decreases,
as stronger retention on smaller accounts was partially offset by a decrease in retention
on larger accounts.

For the year ended December 31, 2005, earned pricing increased 3% for small commercial and
decreased 3% for middle market. As substantially all premiums in the segment are earned over a 12
month policy period, earned pricing changes for the year ended December 31, 2005 primarily reflect
written pricing changes during the last six months of 2004 and the year ended December 31, 2005.

•

Written pricing for small commercial increased 4% in the last six months of 2004 and 2% in 2005.

•

Written pricing for middle market decreased 2% in the last six of 2004 and 5% in 2005.

2004 Compared to 2003

Earned premiums for the segment increased $603, or 16%, in 2004, primarily due to earned pricing
increases and new business premium outpacing non-renewals.

•

Growth in small commercial earned premiums was driven primarily by written premium
growth for Select Xpand. The new business premium growth of $172 in Small Commercial was
due primarily to growth from the Select Xpand product and growth from an increase in the
number of agents, partially offset by the moderation in written pricing increases.

•

Growth in middle market earned premiums was driven primarily by growth in workers’
compensation premium. New business premium decreased by $61 due largely to written pricing
decreases.



Premium renewal retention remained strong, decreasing slightly from 87% for the year ended December
31, 2003 to 85% for the year ended December 31, 2004. Written pricing decreases for middle market
during 2004 contributed to the decrease in premium renewal retention.

For the year ended December 31, 2004, earned pricing increased 7% for small commercial and 3% for
middle market. As substantially all premiums in the segment are earned over a 12 month policy
period, earned pricing changes for the year ended December 31, 2004 primarily reflect written
pricing increases of 9% during the last six months of 2003 and 2% in 2004.

Underwriting results and ratios

2005 Compared to 2004

Underwriting results increased by $36, with a 0.1 point increase in the combined ratio to 91.7.
The net increase in underwriting results was principally driven by the following factors:

•

A $67 improvement resulting from earned premium growth at a combined ratio less than 100.0 and from
a decrease in the combined ratio before catastrophes and prior accident year development of 0.3
points, from 89.7 to 89.4

•

A $58 decrease in current accident year catastrophe losses. Catastrophe losses in 2005 for
Hurricanes Katrina, Rita and Wilma were $68 compared to catastrophe losses in 2004 for Hurricanes
Charley, Frances, Ivan and Jeanne of $98,

•

A $75 release of workers’ compensation reserves during
2005 related to accident years 2003 and 2004, and

•

A $25 release of prior accident year reserves for allocated loss adjustment expenses during 2005.

Partially offsetting the improvements in underwriting results were the following factors:

•

Net favorable reserve development of $67 in 2004 included a $175 release of September 11 reserves,
partially offset by a $38 strengthening of reserves for small commercial package business, a $25
strengthening of automobile liability reserves and a $23 strengthening of reserves for construction
defects claims,

•

A $50 strengthening of workers’ compensation reserves during 2005 related to reserves for claim
payments expected to emerge after 20 years of development,

•

A $40 strengthening of general liability reserves during 2005 for accident years 2000-2003 due to
higher than anticipated loss payments beyond four years of development, and

•

A $20 strengthening of third quarter 2004 hurricane reserves during 2005.

The combined ratio before catastrophes and prior accident year development decreased 0.3 points to
89.4, due primarily to earned pricing increases in small commercial, improved current accident year
underwriting results for workers’ compensation business and a 0.6 point decrease in the expense
ratio, partially offset by earned pricing decreases in middle market and increasing non-catastrophe
property claim costs. The improved current accident year performance for workers’ compensation
business was consistent with the favorable prior accident year development recorded in 2005 related
to accident years 2003 and 2004.

Contributing to the 0.6 point decrease in the expense ratio was earned premium growth, a shift to
more workers’ compensation business which has lower commissions and a $16 reduction in contingent
commissions, partially offset by $20 of hurricane related assessments in 2005. The $16 reduction
in contingent commissions was due, in part, to a decision made by some agents and brokers not to
accept contingent commissions after the third quarter of 2004.



2004 Compared to 2003

Underwriting results increased by $202, with a corresponding 4.1 point decrease in the combined
ratio to 91.6. The net increase in underwriting results was principally driven by the following
factors:

•

A $181 improvement resulting from earned
premium growth at a combined ratio less than
100.0 and from a decrease in the combined ratio
before catastrophes and prior accident year
development of 3.3 points, from 93.0 to 89.7,
and

•

Net favorable reserve development of $67 in
2004, including a $175 release of September 11
reserves, partially offset by a $38
strengthening of small commercial package
business reserves, a $25 strengthening of auto
liability claim reserves and a $23
strengthening of construction defects claim
reserves.

Partially offsetting the improvements in underwriting results was a $40 increase in current
accident year catastrophe losses due to losses from Hurricanes Charley, Frances, Ivan and Jeanne
during the third quarter of 2004.

The combined ratio before catastrophes and prior accident year development decreased 3.3 points,
to 89.7, due primarily to earned pricing increases in excess of loss cost increases in both small
commercial and middle market and a 1.7 point decrease in the expense ratio. Improved claim
frequency was partially offset by increased claim severity. The 1.7 point improvement in the
expense ratio was primarily due to earned premium growth a shift to more workers’ compensation
business which has lower commissions.

Outlook

In 2006, management expects the Business Insurance segment to achieve mid- to high-single-digit
written premium growth and to generate strong results. In both small commercial and middle market,
the Company plans to continue to broaden its relationships with key agencies to increase new
business, maintain renewal retention and expand market share in targeted states. The Company will
also continue to enhance the technology used with its agents to further improve the ease of doing
business with The Hartford.

In small commercial, the Company expects double-digit written premium growth to be generated, in
part, through the use of customized pricing, more sophisticated pricing models and automated
underwriting decision making tools and increasing its underwriting appetite within certain
industries and risks. Also, the Company increased the number of small commercial sales
representatives by 20% in 2005 and expects to increase the sales staff further in 2006. Within
middle market, the Company expects to focus on growing its property book of business as well as
protecting its renewals.

Management expects written pricing trends in 2006 to be affected by increased competition. While
the increase in written pricing for small commercial business was 2% in 2005, management expects
written pricing for small commercial to be flat to slightly negative for 2006. For middle market
business, pricing continued to decline in the fourth quarter of 2005, particularly for property
business in geographic areas not prone to catastrophes and in non-property lines of business.
While written pricing for middle market business in 2005 declined by 5%, management believes that
pricing declines will lessen somewhat as higher reinsurance costs are reflected in the market.
Loss costs are expected to increase in 2006 as increasing claim severity is expected to outpace
favorable claim frequency. As a result of the anticipated slight decrease in written pricing and
increase in loss costs, management expects the current accident year loss and loss expense ratio
for Business Insurance to increase moderately in 2006.

Earned Premiums

2005 Compared to 2004

Earned premiums increased $165, or 5%, due primarily to earned premium growth in both AARP and
Agency, partially offset by a reduction in Other Affinity and Omni.

•

AARP earned premium grew $150, or 7%, reflecting an
increase in the penetration of the AARP target
market and the effect of direct marketing programs
to increase premium writings, particularly in auto.

•

Agency earned premium grew $90, or 10%, as a result
of continued growth of the Dimensions class plans
first introduced in 2004. Dimensions, which has
been rolled out to 41 states for auto and 37 states
for homeowners, allows Personal Lines to write a
broader class of risks.

•

Omni earned premium decreased by $55, or 22%,
because of a strategic decision by management to
focus on more profitable non-standard auto business.

The earned premium growth in AARP and Agency during 2005 was primarily due to new business written
premium outpacing non-renewals for auto business in 2004 and 2005 and to earned pricing increases
in homeowners’ business.

Auto earned premium grew $106, or 4%, primarily from growth in AARP and Agency, offset by a decline
in Omni and Other Affinity auto business. Before considering the decline in Omni and Other
Affinity business, auto earned premium grew $240, or 8%. Homeowners earned premium grew $59, or
7%, due to growth in AARP and Agency business, partially offset by a decline in Other Affinity
business. Consistent with the growth in earned premium, the number of policies in force has
increased in auto and homeowners from 2,166,922 and 1,348,573, respectively, as of December 31,
2004 to 2,222,688 and 1,384,364, respectively, as of December 31, 2005. The growth in policies in
force does not correspond directly with the growth in earned premiums due to the effect of earned
pricing changes and because policy in force counts are as of a point in time rather than over a
period of time.



Auto new business written premium was $426 in 2005, down $43 from the prior year, due primarily to
a $52 decline in Omni new business and, to a lesser extent, a decline in Agency and Other Affinity
new business, partially offset by an increase in AARP new business. Homeowners’ new business
written premium was $131 in 2005, up $16 from the prior year, primarily due to an increase in
Agency new business written premium.

Premium renewal retention for automobile decreased from 89% to 87% and premium renewal retention
for homeowners decreased from 100% to 94%, primarily due to a decrease in retention of Agency
business.

Earned pricing increases for automobile of 1% in 2005 were down from 5% in 2004. Likewise, earned
pricing increases for homeowners of 7% in 2005 were down from 11% in 2004. The moderation in
earned pricing increases during 2005 is a reflection of written pricing changes from 2004 to 2005.

•

Written pricing for automobile increased 2% in the last six months of 2004 but was flat in 2005.

•

Written pricing for homeowners increased 7% in the last six months of 2004 and 6% in 2005.

The written price declines are reflective of the company’s response in different states and
different auto segments to the current levels of price adequacy. Written pricing for homeowners
has increased primarily due to increased insurance to value.

2004 Compared to 2003

Earned premiums increased $264 due to growth in both AARP and Agency, partially offset by a
reduction in Other Affinity earned premium. Earned premiums for Omni were flat from 2003 to 2004.

•

AARP earned premium grew $190, or 10%, reflecting
growth in the size of the AARP target market and the
effect of direct marketing programs to increase
premium writings, in both auto and homeowners.

•

Agency earned premium grew $100, or 12%, as a result
of the growth of the Dimensions auto and homeowners’
class plans. Dimensions, which had been rolled out
to 37 states for auto and 28 states for homeowners
in 2004, allows Personal Lines to write a broader
class of risks.

•

Omni earned premium was flat during 2004 because of
a strategic decision by management to focus on more
profitable non-standard auto business.

The earned premium growth in AARP and Agency is primarily because new business growth over the
prior 6 to 12 months exceeded non-renewals in both auto and homeowners.

The number of policies in force at year end increased in auto and homeowners from 2,058,825 and
1,319,629, respectively, as of December 31, 2003, to 2,166,922 and 1,348,573, respectively, as of
December 31, 2004. The growth in policies in force does not correspond directly with the growth in
earned premium due to the impact of earned pricing increases and because policy in force counts are
as of a point in time rather than over a period of time. Most of the growth in homeowners policies
in force was generated by Agency while for auto policies in force, growth in both AARP and Agency
is partially offset by a decline in Omni.

For the year ended December 31, 2004, new business premiums in AARP and Agency were $311 and $167,
respectively, which was up from $226 and $105, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2003.

Premium renewal retention for automobile decreased from 91% to 89%. The decrease in premium
renewal retention for automobile was driven largely by the impact of declining written pricing
increases. Premium renewal retention for homeowners decreased from 101% to 100%, also due to
declining written pricing increases.

Earned pricing increases for automobile of 5% for the year ended December 31, 2004 were down from
9% during the year ended December 31, 2003. Likewise, earned pricing increases for homeowners of
11% for the year ended December 31, 2004 were down from 14% during the year ended December 31,
2003. The moderation in earned pricing increases during 2004 is a reflection of a decline in
written pricing increases from 2003 to 2004.

•

Written pricing for automobile increased 8% in the last six months of 2003 and 3% in 2004.

•

Written pricing for homeowners increased 13% in the last six months of 2003 and 9% in 2004.

In addition to earned pricing increases, homeowners earned premiums included the effect of
automatic increases in the amount of insurance coverage to adjust for construction cost inflation.

Underwriting Results and Ratios

2005 Compared to 2004

Underwriting results increased $322, with a corresponding 8.7 point decrease in the combined
ratio from 96.0 to 87.3. The net increase in underwriting results was principally driven by the
following factors:

•

A $166 decrease in current accident year catastrophe
losses. Catastrophe losses in 2005 included losses
for Hurricanes Katrina, Rita and Wilma of $50
whereas catastrophe losses in 2004 included losses
for Hurricanes Charley, Frances, Ivan and Jeanne of
$215,

•

A $95 reduction in prior accident year reserves for
allocated loss adjustment expenses, predominantly
related to auto liability claims, and

•

A $58 improvement in current accident year
underwriting results derived from earned premium
growth at a combined ratio less than 100.0, as well
as from a decrease in the combined ratio before
catastrophes and prior accident year development of
1.0 point, from 88.2 to 87.2.

The 1.0 point improvement in the combined ratio before catastrophes and prior accident year
development was primarily due to a lower current accident year loss and loss adjustment expense
ratio for auto liability claims and earned pricing increases for homeowners business slightly
outpacing increases in non-catastrophe property loss costs, partially offset by the effect of the
$24 increase in reinstatement premiums. The lower current accident year loss and loss adjustment
expense ratio for auto liability claims was consistent with the favorable prior accident year
development on auto liability allocated loss adjustment expense reserves recognized in 2005.
Within homeowners, an increase in loss costs was due entirely to increasing claim severity. The
expense ratio increased by 0.6 points, to 23.7, primarily due to $31 of hurricane-related
assessments in 2005.

2004 Compared to 2003

In 2004, underwriting results increased $8 and the combined ratio remained relatively flat at
96.0. Net prior accident year development was not significant in either 2004 or 2003. As a
result, the net increase in underwriting results was principally driven by a $142 improvement
resulting from earned premium growth at a combined ratio less than 100.0 and from a decrease in the
combined ratio before catastrophes and prior accident year development of 3.5 points, from 91.7 to
88.2. Largely offsetting this improvement was a $124 increase in current accident year catastrophe
losses due to losses from hurricanes Charley, Frances, Ivan and Jeanne during the third quarter of
2004.

The 3.5 point decrease in the combined ratio before catastrophes and prior year development was
primarily due to earned pricing increases and favorable claim frequency, partially offset by
increased claim severity. The expense ratio remained relatively flat at 23.1%, despite earned
premium growth, because of higher commissions as a result of increased Agency business and
increased other underwriting expenses.

Outlook

In 2006, the Personal Lines segment is expected to deliver written premium growth in the mid-single
digits, including growth from both AARP and Agency. In 2006, the Company will continue to pursue a
number of strategies to promote growth and profitability. Within the AARP business, growth is
expected through an increase in marketing to AARP members, including the expansion of its AARP
direct response television marketing initiative. Within the Agency business, these strategies
include refinement of its Dimensions class



plans, expansion of its product breadth, an increase in the number of new agency appointments and
the use of value pricing to long-time customers. The Company expects new business growth in Agency
business as well as strong renewal retention in AARP.

Strong underwriting profitability within the past couple of years has intensified the level of
competition, putting downward pressure on rates, particularly in auto. For auto, written pricing
in 2006 is expected to be flat to slightly negative. For homeowners, management expects written
pricing increases in the mid-single digits. Regulatory requirements applying to premium rates vary
from state to state, and, in most states, rates are subject to prior regulatory approval. State
regulatory constraints may prevent companies from obtaining the necessary rates to achieve an
underwriting profit. Industry rates may remain inadequate in certain states in 2006. Loss costs
in 2006 are expected to increase in the mid-single digits as increasing claim severity is expected
to slightly outpace favorable claim frequency. While earned pricing is expected to keep pace with
loss cost increases in homeowners, margins will likely be reduced for auto.

SPECIALTY COMMERCIAL

Specialty Commercial offers a variety of customized insurance products and risk management
services. The segment provides standard commercial insurance products including workers’
compensation, automobile and liability coverages to large-sized companies. Specialty Commercial
also provides bond, professional liability, specialty casualty and livestock coverages, as well as
core property and excess and surplus lines coverages not normally written by standard lines
insurers. Specialty Commercial provides other insurance products and services primarily to captive
insurance companies, pools and self-insurance groups. In addition, Specialty Commercial provides
third-party administrator services for claims administration, integrated benefits, loss control and
performance measurement through Specialty Risk Services.

Earned Premiums

2005 Compared to 2004

Earned premiums for the Specialty Commercial segment increased by $31, or 2%, due to a $247
increase in casualty, bond, professional liability and other earned premiums, partially offset by
a $216 decrease in property earned premiums.

2004 Compared to 2003

Earned premiums for the Specialty Commercial segment grew $168, or 11%, due primarily to earned
premium growth in all lines of business, partially offset by a $90 reduction in premiums receivable
under retrospectively-rated policies, reflecting a decrease in estimated earned premium under the
terms of these policies.



•

Property earned premium increased $32, or 7%, primarily due
to an increase of $43 in the portion of property business
derived from multi-peril crop insurance premiums. In the
fourth quarter of 2004, the Company transferred its entire
book of multi-peril crop insurance (MPCI) to Rural Community
Insurance Company (RCIC), a subsidiary of Wells Fargo &
Company. The agreement transferred in bulk all 2005 crop year
policies to RCIC in exchange for an initial payment and
renewal fees based upon retention of the transferred business
over a three year period. The Company retained responsibility
for the MPCI business written for the 2004 and prior crop
years. Earned premium for MPCI business for the year ended
December 31, 2004 was $127. Before considering the increase
in MPCI premiums, earned premiums for property declined by
6%, reflecting a business decision to write less new business
and renew less premium as a result of the decline in written
pricing.

•

Casualty earned premiums increased $20, or 3%, primarily
because of written premium growth in a single captive
insurance program and high single-digit earned pricing
increases, partially offset by a decrease in premium renewal
retention. Of the total growth in earned premium for the
year ended December 31, 2004, $75 was attributable to a
single captive insurance program. The increase in earned
premiums was partially offset by a $90 decrease in earned
premiums under retrospectively-rated policies.

•

Bond earned premium grew $36, or 24%, primarily as a result
of an increase in contract surety business and a decrease in
ceded premiums, partially offset by a slight decrease in
premium renewal retention.

•

Professional liability earned premiums grew $39, or 13%,
primarily due to a decrease in the portion of risks ceded to
outside reinsurers and earned pricing increases, partially
offset by a decrease in renewal retention and new business
growth. Earned pricing increases in professional liability
were due entirely to written pricing increases in 2003 as
prices declined in 2004.

•

Within the “other” category, earned premiums increased $41,
or 62%, primarily due to increased premiums on inter-segment
reinsurance programs.

Underwriting Results and Ratios

2005 Compared to 2004

Underwriting results decreased by $112, with a corresponding 6.3 point increase in the combined
ratio to 109.4. Underwriting results of ($53) in 2004 included a $90 decrease in earned premiums
under retrospectively rated policies. Before the decrease in earned premiums under
retrospectively-rated policies, underwriting results decreased by $202, principally driven by the
following factors:

•

A $109 decrease in current accident year non-catastrophe underwriting results,

•

A $53 increase in current accident year catastrophe losses. Catastrophe losses in 2005 for Hurricanes Katrina, Rita
and Wilma were $145 compared to catastrophe losses in 2004 for Hurricanes Charley, Frances, Ivan and Jeanne of $81.
Catastrophe losses in 2005 and 2004 include $70 and $19, respectively, of catastrophe losses assumed under
inter-segment reinsurance programs and

•

A $40 increase in unfavorable prior accident year loss development. Prior accident year loss development of $109 in
2005 consisted primarily of $70 of reserve strengthening for workers’ compensation reserves for claim payments expected
to emerge after 20 years of development and $20 of reserve development for large deductible workers’ compensation
reserves. Reserve development in 2005 also included a release of reserves for directors and officers insurance related
to accident years 2003 and 2004 and strengthening of prior accident year reserves for contracts that provide auto
financing gap coverage and auto lease residual value coverage; the release and offsetting strengthening were each
approximately $80. Prior accident year loss development of $69 in 2004 included $167 of reserve strengthening for
construction defect claims, a release of $116 in September 11 reserves and strengthening in large deductible workers’
compensation reserves and a release in other liability reserves, each approximately $150.



Contributing to the $109 decrease in current accident year underwriting results were higher
non-catastrophe losses in property and a $22 increase in net catastrophe treaty reinstatement
premiums, partially offset by improvement in professional liability. The expense ratio increased
by 3.2 points, to 24.3, primarily due to a reduction in ceding commissions on professional
liability business, a reduction in profit commissions due to increased catastrophe losses and a
shift to more casualty business which has a higher expense ratio, partially offset by the impact
on the expense ratio of the $90 earned premium adjustment in 2004.

2004 Compared to 2003

Underwriting results decreased $63, with a corresponding 3.8 point increase in the combined ratio
from 99.3 to 103.1. Underwriting results of ($53) in 2004 included a $90 decrease in earned
premiums under retrospectively rated policies. Before the decrease in earned premiums under
retrospectively-rated policies, underwriting results improved by $27, principally driven by the
following factors:

•

A $131 improvement in current accident year underwriting results, partially offset by

•

An $86 increase in current accident year catastrophe losses, principally due to losses incurred for hurricanes Charley,
Frances, Ivan and Jeanne in the third quarter of 2004 and

•

A $17 increase in unfavorable prior accident year loss development. Prior accident year loss development of $69 in
2004 included $167 of reserve strengthening for construction defect claims, a release of $116 in September 11 reserves
and strengthening in large deductible workers’ compensation reserves and a release in other liability reserves, each
approximately $150. Prior accident year loss development of $52 in 2003 consisted primarily of $20 of reserve
strengthening for a few severe contract surety claims related to accident year 2002 and a $25 provision for anticipated
settlements on reinsurance obligations for contracts outstanding at the time of the original acquisition of Reliance
Group Holdings’ auto residual value portfolio in the third quarter of 2000.

Current accident year non-catastrophe underwriting results improved in all lines of business. The
improvement in casualty, bond and professional liability was due to earned pricing increases
exceeding loss costs. The improvement in property was due to low non-catastrophe property losses,
despite a decline in earned pricing. The expense ratio for the year ended December 31, 2004
decreased over the prior year expense ratio due primarily to earned premium growth.

Outlook

Specialty Commercial is comprised of businesses that provide specialized or customized products
within niche markets. Management expects each of these businesses to maintain underwriting
discipline in 2006 in an increasingly competitive environment. Accordingly, written premium growth
is not a primary objective for the Specialty Commercial segment. Rather, the Company will grow
opportunistically where risks are adequately priced to achieve targeted returns. Management
expects to grow written premium in 2006 primarily in property and professional liability. The
growth in property will likely come from new business growth and written pricing increases. A
decrease in the percentage of risks ceded to reinsurers will likely contribute to the growth in
professional liability written premium. Largely offsetting this growth, casualty written premiums
will likely decline given the non-renewal of a captive insurance program which represented $241 of
written premium in 2005. The non-renewal of this program is not expected to have a significant
impact on underwriting results.

Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2005, specialty property written pricing has been increasing in
catastrophe prone areas and management expects rates to continue to increase in 2006. The written
price increases reflect, in part, a medium-term forecast of increased hurricane frequency and
severity as well as an increase in the cost of reinsurance. Although written pricing increases are
expected for property and bond, written pricing decreases are expected for casualty and
professional liability,

In 2006, management expects that the written pricing increases in property will yield a lower loss
and loss adjustment expense ratio, provided that catastrophe property claim experience returns to
expected levels. The level of catastrophe losses can have a significant impact on Specialty
Commercial’s underwriting results, however, due to specialty property exposures in hurricane-prone
areas. Specialty Commercial’s expense ratio will likely continue to vary significantly from
period to period depending, in part, on the level of profit commissions and reinstatement premium
recognized related to catastrophe activity and changes in business mix.

The Other Operations segment includes operations that are under a single management structure,
Heritage Holdings, which is responsible for two related activities. The first activity is the
management of certain subsidiaries and operations of the Company that have discontinued writing new
business. The second is the management of claims (and the associated reserves) related to
asbestos, environmental and other exposures. The Other Operations book of business contains
policies written from approximately the 1940s to 2003. The Company’s experience has been that this
book of runoff business has, over time, produced significantly higher claims and losses than were
contemplated at inception.

2005 Compared to 2004

Net income increased $116, driven by the following:

•

A $222 increase in underwriting results, primarily due to a $197 decrease in prior year loss development. Reserve
development in 2005 included $85 of reserve strengthening for assumed reinsurance, $37 of environmental reserve
strengthening, and a $20 increase in the allowance for uncollectible reinsurance. In 2004, reserve development was
driven by a $181 provision for the reinsurance recoverable asset associated with older, long-term casualty liabilities,
$170 of reserve strengthening for assumed reinsurance, and $75 of environmental reserve strengthening, which was
partially offset by a $97 release of September 11 reserves.

•

A $62 decrease in net investment income, primarily as a result of a decrease in invested assets resulting from net
claims and claim adjustment expenses paid in 2004 and 2005. Other Operations net investment income includes income
earned on the separate portfolios of Heritage Holdings and its subsidiaries, and on the Hartford Fire invested asset
portfolio, which is allocated between Ongoing Operations and Other Operations. The Company attributes capital and
invested assets to each segment using an internally developed, risk-based capital attribution methodology.

•

A $70 decrease in income tax benefit (expense) reflecting an increase in income before taxes.

2004 Compared to 2003

Net loss decreased $1.5 billion, driven by the following:

•

A $2.4 billion increase in underwriting results, primarily due to a $2.4 billion decrease in prior year loss
development. Reserve development in 2004 included a $181 provision for the reinsurance recoverable asset associated
with older, long-term casualty liabilities, $170 of reserve strengthening for assumed reinsurance, and $75 of
environmental reserve strengthening, which was partially offset by a $97 release of September 11 reserves. In 2003,
reserve development was driven by $2.6 billion of asbestos reserve strengthening. The $346 decrease in earned premiums
and related decrease of $266 in current year benefits, claims and claim adjustment expenses were the result of the
Company’s decision to exit from the assumed reinsurance business in the second quarter of 2003.

•

A $768 decrease in income tax benefit reflecting a decrease in the loss before taxes.

Asbestos and Environmental Claims

The Company continues to receive asbestos and environmental claims. Asbestos claims relate
primarily to bodily injuries asserted by people who came in contact with asbestos or products
containing asbestos. Environmental claims relate primarily to pollution and related clean-up costs.

The Company wrote several different categories of insurance contracts that may cover asbestos and
environmental claims. First, the Company wrote primary policies providing the first layer of
coverage in an insured’s liability program. Second, the Company wrote excess policies providing
higher layers of coverage for losses that exhaust the limits of underlying coverage. Third, the
Company acted as a reinsurer assuming a portion of those risks assumed by other insurers writing
primary, excess and reinsurance coverages. Fourth, subsidiaries of the Company participated in the
London Market, writing both direct insurance and assumed reinsurance business.

With regard to both environmental and particularly asbestos claims, significant uncertainty limits
the ability of insurers and reinsurers to estimate the ultimate reserves necessary for unpaid
losses and related expenses. Traditional actuarial reserving techniques cannot reasonably estimate
the ultimate cost of these claims, particularly during periods where theories of law are in flux.
The degree of variability of reserve estimates for these exposures is significantly greater than
for other more traditional exposures. In particular, the Company believes there is a high degree
of uncertainty inherent in the estimation of asbestos loss reserves.

In the case of the reserves for asbestos exposures, factors contributing to the high degree of
uncertainty include inadequate loss development patterns, plaintiffs’ expanding theories of
liability, the risks inherent in major litigation, and inconsistent emerging legal doctrines.
Furthermore, over time, insurers, including the Company, have experienced significant changes in
the rate at which asbestos claims are brought, the claims experience of particular insureds, and
the value of claims, making predictions of future exposure from past experience uncertain. For
example, in the past few years, insurers in general, including the Company, have experienced an
increase in the number of asbestos-related claims due to, among other things, plaintiffs’ increased
focus on new and previously peripheral defendants and an increase in the number of insureds seeking
bankruptcy protection as a result of asbestos-related liabilities. Plaintiffs and insureds have
sought to use bankruptcy proceedings, including “pre-packaged” bankruptcies, to accelerate and
increase loss payments by insurers. In addition, some policyholders have asserted new classes of
claims for coverages to which an aggregate limit of liability may not apply. Further
uncertainties include insolvencies of other carriers and unanticipated developments
pertaining to the Company’s ability to recover reinsurance for asbestos and environmental claims.
Management believes these issues are not likely to be resolved in the near future.



In the case of the reserves for environmental exposures, factors contributing to the high degree of
uncertainty include expanding theories of liability and damages; the risks inherent in major
litigation; inconsistent decisions concerning the existence and scope of coverage for environmental
claims; and uncertainty as to the monetary amount being sought by the claimant from the insured.

It is also not possible to predict changes in the legal and legislative environment and their
effect on the future development of asbestos and environmental claims. It is unknown whether
potential Federal asbestos-related legislation will be enacted or what its effect would be on the
Company’s aggregate asbestos liabilities.

The reporting pattern for assumed reinsurance claims, including those related to asbestos and
environmental claims, is much longer than for direct claims. In many instances, it takes months or
years to determine that the policyholder’s own obligations have been met and how the reinsurance in
question may apply to such claims. The delay in reporting reinsurance claims and exposures adds to
the uncertainty of estimating the related reserves.

Given the factors and emerging trends described above, the Company believes the actuarial tools and
other techniques it employs to estimate the ultimate cost of claims for more traditional kinds of
insurance exposure are less precise in estimating reserves for its asbestos and environmental
exposures. For this reason, the Company relies on exposure-based analysis to estimate the ultimate
costs of these claims and regularly evaluates new information in assessing its potential asbestos
and environmental exposures.

Reserve Activity

Reserves and reserve activity in the Other Operations segment are categorized and reported as
asbestos, environmental, or “all other”. The “all other” category of reserves covers a wide range
of insurance and assumed reinsurance coverages, including, but not limited to, potential liability
for construction defects, lead paint, silica, pharmaceutical products, molestation and other
long-tail or late-emerging liabilities. In addition, within the “all other” category of reserves,
Other Operations records its allowance for future reinsurer insolvencies and disputes that might
affect reinsurance collectibility associated with asbestos, environmental, and other claims
recoverable from reinsurers.

The following table presents reserve activity, inclusive of estimates for both reported and
incurred but not reported claims, net of reinsurance, for Other Operations, categorized by
asbestos, environmental and all other claims, for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and
2003.

Excludes asbestos and environmental net liabilities reported in Ongoing Operations of $10 and $6, respectively, as of
December 31, 2005, $13 and $9, respectively, as of December 31, 2004, and $11 and $8, respectively, as of December 31,
2003. Total net claim and claim adjustment expenses incurred in Ongoing Operations for the twelve months ended December
31, 2005, 2004, and 2003 includes $11, $13, and $13, respectively, related to asbestos and environmental claims. Total net
claim and claim adjustment expenses paid in Ongoing Operations for the twelve months ended December 31, 2005, 2004, and
2003 includes $17, $11, and $12, respectively, related to asbestos and environmental claims.

Gross of reinsurance, asbestos and environmental reserves, including liabilities in Ongoing Operations, were $3,845 and
$432, respectively, as of December 31, 2005, $4,322 and $501, respectively, as of December 31, 2004, and $5,884 and $542,
respectively, as of December 31, 2003.

The one year and average three year net paid amounts for asbestos claims, including Ongoing Operations, are $215 and $526,
respectively, resulting in a one year net survival ratio of 10.7 and a three year net survival ratio of 4.4 (12.7 excluding
the MacArthur payments). Net survival ratio is the quotient of the net carried reserves divided by the average annual
payment amount and is an indication of the number of years that the net carried reserve would last (i.e. survive) if the
future annual claim payments were consistent with the calculated historical average.

The Company has been evaluating and closely monitoring assumed reinsurance reserves in Other
Operations. For the years ended December 31, 2004 and December 31, 2003, the Company booked
unfavorable reserve development of $170 and $129, respectively, related to HartRe assumed
reinsurance. The Company reviewed certain of HartRe’s assumed reinsurance reserves during the
first and second quarters of 2005. Unfavorable trends continued into 2005 and, as a result, the
Company increased reserves by $12 and $73 in



the first and second quarters, respectively. The majority of the reserve strengthening of $85 was
for assumed casualty reinsurance for the years 1997 through 2001. With the transfer of the HartRe
assumed reinsurance business into Other Operations, the segment has exposure related to more
recent assumed casualty reinsurance reserves, particularly for the underwriting years 1997 through
2001. Assumed reinsurance exposures are inherently less predictable than direct insurance
exposures because the Company may not receive notice of a reinsurance claim until the underlying
direct insurance claim is mature. This causes a delay in the receipt of information from the
ceding companies. In recent years, the Company has seen an increase in reported losses above
previous expectations and this increase in reported losses contributed to the reserve
re-estimates. The Company completed an updated evaluation of HartRe’s assumed reinsurance
reserves in the fourth quarter of 2005. The evaluation indicated no change in assumed reinsurance
reserves. The Company currently expects to perform a review of its HartRe assumed reinsurance
liabilities at least annually.

During the third quarters of 2005 and 2004, the Company completed its annual environmental reserve
evaluations. In each of these evaluations, the Company reviewed all of its domestic direct and
assumed reinsurance accounts exposed to environmental liability. The Company also examined its
London Market exposures for both direct insurance and assumed reinsurance. In both years, the
Company found estimates for individual cases changed based upon the particular circumstances of
each account, although the reviews found no apparent underlying cause or change in the claim
environment. The net effect of these changes resulted in $37 and $75 increases in net
environmental liabilities in 2005 and 2004, respectively.

During the second quarters of 2005 and 2004, the Company completed its annual evaluations of the
reinsurance recoveries associated with older, long-term casualty liabilities reported in the Other
Operations segment. In conducting these reviews, the Company used its most recent detailed
evaluations of ceded liabilities reported in the segment, including its estimate of future claims,
the reinsurance arrangements in place and the years of potential reinsurance available. In each of
these reviews, the Company also analyzed the overall credit quality of the Company’s reinsurers,
recent trends in arbitration and litigation outcomes in disputes between cedants and reinsurers,
and recent developments in commutation activity between reinsurers and cedants. The allowance for
uncollectible reinsurance reflects management’s current estimate of reinsurance cessions that may
be uncollectible in the future due to reinsurers’ unwillingness or inability to pay, and
contemplates recoveries under ceded reinsurance contracts and settlements of disputes that could be
different than the ceded liabilities. As a result of the evaluation in the second quarter of 2005,
the Company increased its allowance for uncollectible reinsurance by $20 to reflect deterioration
in the credit ratings of certain reinsurers and the Company’s opinion as to the ability of certain
reinsurers to pay claims in the future. As a result of the evaluation in the second quarter of
2004, the Company reduced its estimated net reinsurance recoverable by $181, which was comprised of
a $126 reduction of ceded amounts and a $55 increase in the allowance for uncollectible
reinsurance. In the second quarter of 2004, the Company also consolidated within the “all other”
category its allowance for reinsurer credit quality and disputes that might affect reinsurance
coverage associated with Other Operations into a single allowance.

As of December 31, 2005, the allowance for uncollectible reinsurance totals $335. The Company
currently expects to perform its regular comprehensive review of Other Operations reinsurance
recoverables in the second quarter of 2006. The Company is engaged in pending litigation in
Connecticut Superior Court against certain of its upper-layer reinsurers under its Blanket Casualty
Treaty (“BCT”). For discussion of the Company’s BCT litigation and the potential effect on the
Company’s net reinsurance recoverables, see Note 12 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
Uncertainties regarding the factors that affect the allowance for uncollectible reinsurance could
cause the Company to change its estimates, and the effect of these changes could be material to the
Company’s consolidated results of operations or cash flows.

During the second quarter of 2005, the Company completed its annual asbestos reserve evaluation.
As part of this evaluation, the Company reviewed all of its open direct domestic insurance accounts
exposed to asbestos liability as well as assumed reinsurance accounts and certain closed accounts.
The Company also examined its London Market exposures for both direct insurance and assumed
reinsurance. The evaluation indicated no change in the overall gross or net reserves.

During the first quarter of 2004, the Company completed an updated gross asbestos reserve
evaluation. As part of this evaluation, the Company also reviewed all of its open direct domestic
insurance accounts exposed to asbestos liability as well as assumed reinsurance accounts and
certain closed accounts. The Company also examined its London Market exposures for both direct
insurance and assumed reinsurance. The evaluation indicated no change in the overall gross asbestos
reserves.

On December 19, 2003, Hartford Accident and Indemnity Co. (“Hartford A&I”) entered into a
settlement agreement with MacArthur Co. and its subsidiary, Western MacArthur Co. Under the
settlement agreement, during the first quarter of 2004, Hartford A&I paid $1.15 billion into an
escrow account owned by Hartford A&I. The funds were held in the escrow account until conditions
precedent to the settlement occurred. On April 22, 2004, the funds were disbursed from the escrow
account into a trust established for the benefit of present and future asbestos claimants pursuant
to the bankruptcy plan. The settlement payments were accounted for as a reduction in unpaid claim
and claim adjustment expenses during the first quarter of 2004.

In the first quarter of 2003, several events occurred that in the Company’s view confirmed the
existence of a substantial long-term deterioration in the asbestos litigation environment. As a
result of these worsening conditions, the Company conducted a comprehensive evaluation of its
asbestos exposures in an effort to project, beginning at the individual account level, the effect
of these trends on the Company’s estimated total exposure to asbestos liability. Based on the
Company’s evaluation of the deteriorating conditions, the Company strengthened its gross and net
asbestos reserves by $3.9 billion and $2.6 billion, respectively. The reserve strengthening related
primarily to policies effective in 1985 or prior years. The Company had incorporated an absolute
asbestos exclusion in most of its general liability policies written after 1985.



A number of factors affect the variability of estimates for asbestos and environmental reserves
including assumptions with respect to the frequency of claims, the average severity of those claims
settled with payment, the dismissal rate of claims with no payment and the expense to indemnity
ratio. The uncertainty with respect to the underlying reserve assumptions for asbestos and
environmental adds a greater degree of variability to these reserve estimates than reserve
estimates for more traditional exposures. While this variability is reflected in part in the size
of the range of reserves developed by the Company, that range may still not be indicative of the
potential variance between the ultimate outcome and the recorded reserves. The recorded net
reserves as of December 31, 2005 of $2.7 billion ($2.3 billion and $360 for asbestos and
environmental, respectively) is within an estimated range, unadjusted for covariance, of $2.0
billion to $3.1 billion. The process of estimating asbestos and environmental reserves remains
subject to a wide variety of uncertainties, which are detailed in the “Critical Accounting
Estimates—Property & Casualty Reserves, Net of Reinsurance” section of Management’s Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Due to these uncertainties, further
developments could cause the Company to change its estimates and ranges of its asbestos and
environmental reserves, and the effect of these changes could be material to the Company’s
consolidated operating results, financial condition and liquidity.

The Company classifies its asbestos and environmental reserves into three categories: direct
insurance, assumed reinsurance and London Market. Direct insurance includes primary and excess
coverage. Assumed reinsurance includes both “treaty” reinsurance (covering broad categories of
claims or blocks of business) and “facultative” reinsurance (covering specific risks or individual
policies of primary or excess insurance companies). London Market business includes the business
written by one or more of the Company’s subsidiaries in the United Kingdom, which are no longer
active in the insurance or reinsurance business. Such business includes both direct insurance and
assumed reinsurance.

Of the three categories of claims (direct, assumed reinsurance and London Market), direct policies
tend to have the greatest factual development from which to estimate the Company’s exposures.

Assumed reinsurance exposures are inherently less predictable than direct insurance exposures
because the Company may not receive notice of a reinsurance claim until the underlying direct
insurance claim is mature. This causes a delay in the receipt of information at the reinsurer
level and adds to the uncertainty of estimating related reserves.

London Market exposures are the most uncertain of the three categories of claims. As a participant
in the London Market (comprised of both Lloyd’s of London and London Market companies), certain
subsidiaries of the Company wrote business on a subscription basis, with those subsidiaries’
involvement being limited to a relatively small percentage of a total contract placement. Claims
are reported, via a broker, to the “lead” underwriter and, once agreed to, are presented to the
following markets for concurrence. This reporting and claim agreement process makes estimating
liabilities for this business the most uncertain of the three categories of claims.

The following table sets forth, for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, paid and
incurred loss activity by the three categories of claims for asbestos and environmental.

Consistent with the Company’s long-standing reserving practices, the Company will continue to
review and monitor its reserves in the Other Operations segment regularly and, where future
developments indicate, make appropriate adjustments to the reserves. For a discussion of the
Company’s reserving practices, please see the “Critical Accounting Estimates—Property & Casualty
Reserves, Net of Reinsurance” section of Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations. The loss reserving assumptions, drawn from both industry data
and the Company’s experience, have been applied over time to all of this business and have resulted
in reserve strengthening or reserve releases at various times over the past decade. The Company
believes that its current asbestos and environmental reserves are reasonable and appropriate.
However, analyses of future developments could cause the Company to change its estimates and ranges
of its asbestos and environmental reserves, and the effect of these changes could be material to
the Company’s consolidated operating results, financial condition and liquidity.

The Company expects to perform its regular reviews of asbestos liabilities in the second quarter of
2006 and environmental liabilities in the third quarter of 2006. If there are significant
developments that affect particular exposures, reinsurance arrangements or the financial condition
of particular reinsurers, the Company will make adjustments to its reserves, or the portion of
liabilities it expects to cede to reinsurers.

Outlook

The Other Operations segment will continue to manage the discontinued operations of The Hartford as
well as claims (and associated reserves) related to asbestos, environmental and other exposures.
The Hartford will continue to review various components of all of its reserves on a regular basis.

INVESTMENTS

General

The Hartford’s investment portfolios are primarily divided between Life and Property & Casualty.
The investment portfolios of Life and Property & Casualty are managed by HIMCO, a wholly-owned
subsidiary of The Hartford. HIMCO manages the portfolios to maximize economic value, while
attempting to generate the income necessary to support the Company’s various product obligations,
within internally established objectives, guidelines and risk tolerances. The portfolio objectives
and guidelines are developed based upon the asset/liability profile, including duration, convexity
and other characteristics within specified risk tolerances. The risk tolerances considered
include, for example, asset and credit issuer allocation limits, maximum portfolio below investment
grade (“BIG”) holdings and foreign currency exposure. The Company attempts to minimize adverse
impacts to the portfolio and the Company’s results of operations due to changes in economic
conditions through asset allocation limits, asset/liability duration matching and through the use
of derivatives. For a further discussion of how the investment portfolio’s credit and market risks
are assessed and managed, see the Investment Credit Risk and Capital Markets Risk Management
sections of the MD&A.

HIMCO’s security selection process is a multi-dimensional approach that combines independent
internal credit research along with a macro-economic outlook of technical trends (e.g. interest
rates, slope of the yield curve and credit spreads) and market pricing to identify valuation
inefficiencies and relative value buying and selling opportunities. Security selection and
monitoring is performed by asset class specialists working within dedicated portfolio management
teams.

HIMCO portfolio managers may sell securities (except those securities in an unrealized loss
position for which the Company has indicated its intent and ability to hold until the price
recovers) due to portfolio guidelines or market technicals or trends. For example, the Company may
sell securities to manage risk, capture market valuation inefficiencies or relative value
opportunities, to remain compliant with internal asset/liability duration matching guidelines, or
to modify a portfolio’s duration to capitalize on interest rate levels or the yield curve slope.

HIMCO believes that advantageously buying and selling securities within a disciplined framework,
provides the greatest economic value for the Company over the long-term.

Return on general account invested assets is an important element of The Hartford’s financial
results. Significant fluctuations in the fixed income or equity markets could weaken the Company’s
financial condition or its results of operations. Additionally, changes in market interest rates
may impact the period of time over which certain investments, such as mortgage-backed securities
(“MBS”), are repaid and whether certain investments are called by the issuers. Such changes may,
in turn, impact the yield on these investments and also may result in re-investment of funds
received from calls and prepayments at rates below the average portfolio yield. Net investment
income and net realized capital gains accounted for approximately 30%, 23% and 19% of the Company’s
consolidated revenues for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The
increase in the percentage of consolidated revenues for 2005, as compared to the prior years, is
primarily due to an increase in the value of equity securities held for trading.

Fluctuations in interest rates affect the Company’s return on, and the fair value of, fixed
maturity investments, which comprised approximately 72% and 80% of the fair value of its invested
assets as of December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Other events beyond the Company’s control
could also adversely impact the fair value of these investments. Specifically, a downgrade of an
issuer’s credit rating or default of payment by an issuer could reduce the Company’s investment
return.

The Company invests in private placement securities, mortgage loans and limited partnership
arrangements in order to further diversify its investment portfolio. These investment types
comprised approximately 18% and 16% of the fair value of its invested assets as of December 31,
2005 and 2004, respectively. These security types are typically less liquid than direct
investments in publicly traded fixed income or equity investments. However, generally these
securities have higher yields to compensate for the liquidity risk.



A decrease in the fair value of any investment that is deemed other-than-temporary would result in
the Company’s recognition of a net realized capital loss in its financial results prior to the
actual sale of the investment. For a further discussion of the evaluation of other-than-temporary
impairments, see the Critical Accounting Estimates section of the MD&A under “Evaluation of
Other-Than-Temporary Impairments on Available-for-Sale Securities”.

Valuation of Investments and Derivative Instruments

The Hartford’s investments in fixed maturities, which include bonds, redeemable preferred stock and
commercial paper; and certain equity securities, which include common and non-redeemable preferred
stocks, are classified as “available-for-sale” and accordingly are carried at fair value with the
after-tax difference from cost or amortized cost, as adjusted for the effect of deducting the life
and pension policyholders’ share of the immediate participation guaranteed contracts; and certain
life and annuity deferred policy acquisition costs and reserve adjustments, reflected in
stockholders’ equity as a component of AOCI. The equity investments associated with the variable
annuity products offered in Japan are recorded at fair value and are classified as “trading” with
changes in fair value recorded in net investment income. Policy loans are carried at outstanding
balance, which approximates fair value. Other investments primarily consist of mortgage loans,
limited partnership interests and derivatives. Mortgage loans on real estate are recorded at the
outstanding principal balance adjusted for amortization of premiums or discounts and net of
valuation allowances, if any. Limited partnerships are accounted for under the equity method and
accordingly the Company’s share of partnership earnings are included in net investment income.
Derivatives are carried at fair value.

Valuation of Fixed Maturities

The fair value for fixed maturity securities is largely determined by one of three primary pricing
methods: independent third party pricing service market quotations, independent broker quotations
or pricing matrices, which use data provided by external sources. With the exception of short-term
securities for which amortized cost is predominantly used to approximate fair value, security
pricing is applied using a hierarchy or “waterfall” approach whereby prices are first sought from
independent pricing services with the remaining unpriced securities submitted to brokers for prices
or lastly priced via a pricing matrix.

Prices from independent pricing services are often unavailable for securities that are rarely
traded or are traded only in privately negotiated transactions. As a result, certain of the
Company’s ABS and commercial mortgage-backed securities (“CMBS”) are priced via broker quotations.
A pricing matrix is used to price securities for which the Company is unable to obtain either a
price from an independent third party service or an independent broker quotation. The pricing
matrix begins with current treasury rates and uses credit spreads and issuer-specific yield
adjustments received from an independent third party source to determine the market price for the
security. The credit spreads, as assigned by a nationally recognized rating agency, incorporate
the issuer’s credit rating and a risk premium, if warranted, due to the issuer’s industry and the
security’s time to maturity. The issuer-specific yield adjustments, which can be positive or
negative, are updated twice annually, as of June 30 and December 31, by an independent third party
source and are intended to adjust security prices for issuer-specific factors. The matrix-priced
securities at December 31, 2005 and 2004, primarily consisted of non-144A private placements and
have an average duration of 5.0 and 4.8 years, respectively.

The following table identifies the fair value of fixed maturity securities by pricing source as of
December 31, 2005 and 2004.

Short-term investments are primarily valued at amortized cost, which approximates fair value.

The fair value of a financial instrument is the amount at which the instrument could be
exchanged in a current transaction between knowledgeable, unrelated willing parties. As such, the
estimated fair value of a financial instrument may differ significantly from the amount that could
be realized if the security was sold immediately.

Valuation of Derivative Instruments

Derivative instruments are reported at fair value based upon either pricing valuation models, which
utilize independent third party data as inputs, or broker quotations. Other than the GMWB rider
and the associated reinsurance contracts, which are discussed in the Critical Accounting Estimates
section of the MD&A under “Valuation of Guaranteed Minimum Withdrawal Benefit Derivatives”,
approximately 81% and 69% of derivatives, based upon notional values, were priced via valuation
models, while the remaining 19% and 31% of derivatives were priced via broker quotations, as of
December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively.

Life

The primary investment objective of Life’s general account is to maximize economic value consistent
with acceptable risk parameters, including the management of the interest rate sensitivity of
invested assets, while generating sufficient after-tax income to support policyholder and corporate
obligations, as discussed in the Capital Markets Risk Management section of the MD&A under “Market
Risk — Life”.

Fixed maturity investments increased $281, or 1%, since December 31, 2004, primarily the result of
positive operating cash flows, product sales and a decrease in long-term interest rates,
substantially offset by an increase in short-term to intermediate-term interest rates, credit
spread widening and foreign currency depreciation in comparison to the U.S. dollar for foreign
denominated securities. Equity securities held for trading increased $10.4 billion, or 76%, since
December 31, 2004, due to positive cash flow primarily generated from sales and deposits related to
variable annuity products sold in Japan and positive performance of the underlying investment funds
supporting the Japanese variable annuity product, partially offset by foreign currency depreciation
in comparison to the U.S. dollar. Policy loans decreased $646, or 24%, since December 31, 2004, as
a result of certain policy loan surrenders. Mortgage loans increased $590, or 64%, since December
31, 2004, as a result of a decision to increase Life’s investment in this asset class primarily due
to its attractive yields and diversification opportunities.

Relates to the Japanese fixed annuity product (product and related derivative hedging instruments excluding periodic
net coupon settlements).

Primarily consists of changes in fair value on non-qualifying derivatives, changes in fair value of certain derivatives
in fair value hedge relationships and hedge ineffectiveness on qualifying derivative instruments.

2005 Compared to 2004

— Net investment income, excluding income on policy loans and equity
securities held for trading, increased $164, or 6%, compared to the prior year. The increase in
net investment income was primarily due to income earned on a higher average invested assets base
as well as higher partnership income. The increase in the average invested assets base, as
compared to the prior year, was primarily due to positive operating cash flows, investment contract
sales such as retail and institutional notes, and universal life-type product sales such as
individual fixed annuity products sold in Japan. The higher partnership income was due to certain
of the Company’s partnerships reporting higher market values and the result of certain partnerships
liquidating their underlying investment holdings in the favorable market environment.

Net investment income on equity securities held for trading for 2005 was primarily generated by
positive performance of the underlying investment funds supporting the Japanese variable annuity
product, partially offset by foreign currency depreciation in comparison to the U.S. dollar. Net
investment income on equity securities held for trading for 2004 was primarily generated by
positive performance of the underlying investment funds supporting the Japanese variable annuity
product as well as foreign currency appreciation in comparison to the U.S. dollar. The change in
net investment income as compared to the prior year is primarily due to the performance of the
underlying funds on a higher asset base.



For 2005, the yield on average invested assets was relatively consistent with the prior year.
An increase in yield as a result of higher partnership income was offset by a reduction in yield
due to lower policy loan income. Based upon forward interest rates as of December 31, 2005, Life
expects the average before-tax new investment yield for fixed rate debt securities in 2006 to range
from 5.1% to 5.3%, slightly below the current average portfolio yield. However, any slight decline
in the average fixed rate debt security yield is expected to be offset by an average higher yield
on variable rate securities as well as additional yield generated from diversifying into other
asset types. Therefore, excluding partnership income and policy loan income, Life expects the
yield on average invested assets for 2006 to be at or slightly higher than the 2005 level. If
future interest rates differ from the forward rates as of December 31, 2005, the actual average new
investment yields may be significantly different than yields currently expected.

Net realized capital losses were recognized for 2005 compared to net realized capital gains for
2004. The significant components driving the changes in net realized capital gain and loss amounts
between 2005 and 2004 include lower net gains on the sale of fixed maturity securities, losses
associated with GMWB derivatives, Japanese fixed annuity contract hedges and periodic net coupon
settlements. These losses were offset in part by gains in Other, net which was primarily related
to changes in the value of non-qualifying foreign currency swaps. The circumstances giving rise to
the changes in these components are as follows:

•

The lower net gains on fixed maturity sales in 2005 were primarily
the result of rising interest rates and losses associated with a
major automotive manufacturer. See additional discussion of the
gross gains and losses on sales below. If interest rates remain
at current levels or rise during 2006, or credit spreads widen,
net realized capital gains on fixed maturity sales for 2006 will
likely be lower than the 2005 levels. The losses associated with
the GMWB derivatives were primarily driven by changes in the GMWB
rider valuation assumptions in the fourth quarter of 2005. For
further discussion of the GMWB rider valuation assumption, see the
Capital Markets Risk Management section of the MD&A under “Market
Risk-Life”.

•

The Japanese fixed annuity contract hedges amount consists of the
foreign currency transaction remeasurements associated with the
yen denominated fixed annuity contracts offered in Japan and the
corresponding offsetting cross currency swaps. Although the
Japanese fixed annuity contracts are economically hedged, the net
realized capital losses result from the mixed attribute accounting
model, which requires fixed annuity liabilities to be recorded at
cost but the associated derivatives to be reported at fair value.
The net realized capital losses in 2005 resulted from rising
Japanese interest rates, and in the first half of the year, a
decrease in U.S. interest rates. For additional discussion of the
Japanese fixed annuity contract hedges see the Capital Markets
Risk Management section of the MD&A under “Market Risk-Life” and
Note 4 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The
periodic net coupon settlements on credit derivatives and the
Japan fixed annuity cross currency swaps includes the net periodic
income/expense or coupon associated with the swap contracts. The
net loss for 2005 is associated with the Japan fixed annuity cross
currency swaps and results from the interest rate differential
between U.S. and Japanese interest rates. The Japanese fixed
annuity product was first offered by the Company in the fourth
quarter 2004. The adverse change in 2005 in comparison to 2004
primarily resulted from a full year of the Japanese fixed annuity
product swap accruals in 2005.

In 2005, gross gains were primarily within fixed maturities and included corporate, foreign
government securities and CMBS. Corporate securities were sold primarily to reduce the Company’s
exposure to certain lower credit quality issuers. The sale proceeds were primarily re-invested
into higher credit quality securities. The gains on sales of corporate securities were primarily
the result of credit spread tightening since the date of purchase. Foreign securities were sold
primarily to reduce the foreign currency exposure in the portfolio due to the expected near term
volatility in foreign exchange rates and to capture gains resulting from credit spread tightening
since the date of purchase. The CMBS sales resulted from a decision to divest securities that were
backed by a single asset due to the then scheduled expiration of the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act
at the end of 2005. Gains on these sales were realized as a result of an improved credit
environment and interest rate declines from the date of purchase.

In 2005, gross losses on sales were primarily within the corporate sector. Gross losses for 2005
included $27 of losses on sales of securities related to a major automotive manufacturer, that
primarily occurred during the second quarter. Sales related to actions taken to reduce issuer
exposure in light of a downward adjustment in earnings and cash flows of the issuer primarily due
to sluggish sales, rising employee and retiree benefit costs and an increased debt service interest
burden, and to reposition the portfolio into higher quality securities. For 2005, excluding sales
related to the automotive manufacturer noted above, there was no single security sold at a loss in
excess of $6 and the average loss as a percentage of the fixed maturity’s amortized cost was less
than 2%, which under the Company’s impairment policy was deemed to be depressed only to a minor
extent.

2004 Compared to 2003

— Net investment income, excluding income on policy loans and equity
securities held for trading, increased $859, or 47%, compared to the prior year. The increase in
net investment income was primarily due to income earned on a higher average invested assets base,
as compared to the prior year, and an increase in income from prepayment penalties primarily
associated with CMBS and yield adjustments related to changes in prepayment speeds associated with
MBS held at a premium or discount. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in the
average new invested assets yield and the repositioning of the portfolio into higher quality assets
as described below.

The increase in the average invested assets base, as compared to the prior year, was primarily the
result of separate account assets reclassified to the general account pursuant to the adoption of
SOP 03-1 and, to a lesser extent, assets acquired in the CNA acquisition and operating cash flows.
Income earned on separate account assets reclassified to the general account, excluding equity
securities held for trading, was $619 for 2004. Income earned on assets acquired in the CNA
transaction was $116 for 2004.

During 2004, the yield on average invested assets decreased from the prior year as a result of new
investment purchases at rates below the average portfolio yield due to the continued low interest
rate environment and decreased policy loan income. Since the Company
invests primarily in long-term fixed rate debt securities, changes in long-term interest rates
impact the yield on new asset purchases



and, therefore, have a gradual impact on the overall portfolio yield. The weighted average
yield on new invested asset purchases in 2004 of approximately 4.9%, before-tax, was below the
average portfolio yield.

Net realized capital gains during 2004 increased by $138 compared to the prior year, primarily the
result of lower other-than-temporary impairments. For further discussion of other-than-temporary
impairments, see the Other-Than-Temporary Impairments commentary in this section of the MD&A.

In 2004, gross gains were realized as fixed maturity credit spreads tightened and portions of the
Life investment portfolios were repositioned into higher quality assets where the Company believed
greater relative value existed. Credit spreads tightened primarily due to improved credit quality,
market liquidity and demand for higher yielding assets, as well as the relatively low interest rate
environment. It is expected that the higher quality assets will provide greater liquidity if the
credit environment and issuer default rates return to historical norms. In addition, foreign
government securities were sold, primarily in the first and fourth quarters of 2004, to reduce the
portfolios’ exposure to foreign holdings and realize gains associated with the decline in value of
the U.S. dollar against foreign currencies.

In 2004, securities sold at a loss were predominantly corporate securities, U.S. government
securities, certain ABS and CMBS with no single security sold at a loss in excess of $5 and an
average loss as a percentage of the fixed maturity’s amortized cost of less than 5%, which under
the Company’s impairment policy, were deemed to be depressed only to a minor extent. In 2003, no
single security was sold at a loss in excess of $8.

Separate Account Products

Separate account products are those for which a separate investment and liability account is
maintained on behalf of the policyholder. The Company’s separate accounts reflect two categories
of risk assumption: non-guaranteed separate accounts wherein the policyholder assumes substantially
all the risk and reward; and guaranteed separate accounts wherein the Company contractually
guarantees either a minimum return or the account value to the policyholder.

Investment objectives for non-guaranteed separate accounts, which consist of the participants’
account balances, vary by fund account type, as outlined in the applicable fund prospectus or
separate account plan of operations. Non-guaranteed separate account products include variable
annuities (except those sold in Japan), variable universal life insurance contracts and variable
corporate owned life insurance. The assets and liabilities associated with variable annuity
products sold in Japan do not meet the criteria to be recognized as a separate account because the
assets are not legally insulated from the Company. Therefore, these assets are included with the
Company’s general account assets effective January 1, 2004. As of December 31, 2005 and 2004, the
Company’s non-guaranteed separate accounts totaled $150.9 billion and $140.0 billion, respectively.

Guaranteed separate accounts primarily consist of modified guaranteed individual annuities and
modified guaranteed life insurance and generally include market value adjustment features and
surrender charges to mitigate the risk of disintermediation. The primary investment objective of
these assets is to maximize after-tax returns consistent with acceptable risk parameters, including
the management of the interest rate sensitivity of invested assets relative to that of policyholder
obligations, as discussed in the Capital Markets Risk Management section of the MD&A under “Market
Risk — Life”. Effective January 1, 2004, the guaranteed separate accounts are included with the
Company’s general account assets.

Property & Casualty

The primary investment objective for Property & Casualty’s Ongoing Operations segment is to
maximize economic value while generating sufficient after-tax income to meet policyholder and
corporate obligations. For Property & Casualty’s Other Operations segment, the investment
objective is to ensure the full and timely payment of all liabilities. Property & Casualty’s
investment strategies are developed based on a variety of factors including business needs,
regulatory requirements and tax considerations.

flow and a decrease in long-term interest rates, partially offset by an increase in short-term to
intermediate-term interest rates, credit spread widening and foreign currency depreciation in
comparison to the U.S. dollar for foreign denominated securities.

2005 Compared to 2004

— Before-tax net investment income increased $117, or 9%, and after-tax
net investment income increased $84, or 9%, compared to the prior year. The increases in net
investment income were primarily due to income earned on a higher average invested assets base as
well as higher partnership income. The increase in the average invested assets base, as compared
to the prior year, was primarily due to positive operating cash flows. The higher partnership
income was due to certain of the Company’s partnerships reporting higher market values and the
result of certain partnerships liquidating their underlying investment holdings in the favorable
market environment.

In 2005, the yield on average invested assets increased from the prior year as a result of higher
partnership income. Excluding partnership income, the yield on average invested assets for 2005
was relatively consistent with the prior year. Based upon forward interest rates as of December
31, 2005, Property & Casualty expects the average before-tax new investment yield for fixed rate
debt securities in 2006 to range from 5.1% to 5.3%, slightly below the current average portfolio
yield. However, any slight decline in the average fixed rate debt security yield is expected to be
offset by an average higher yield generated from diversifying into other asset types. Therefore,
excluding partnership income, Property & Casualty expects the yield on average invested assets for
2006 to be at or slightly higher than the 2005 level. If future interest rates differ from the
forward rates as of December 31, 2005, the actual average new investment yields may be
significantly different than yields currently expected.

Net realized capital gains for 2005 decreased $89 as compared to the prior year primarily due to
lower net realized gains on fixed maturity securities, lower periodic net coupon settlements on
credit derivatives, as well as net losses on non-qualifying derivatives in 2005 compared to net
gains in 2004. If interest rates remain at current levels or increase during 2006, or credit
spreads widen, net realized capital gains would likely be lower than the 2005 levels.

In 2005, gross gains on sales were primarily within fixed maturities and were concentrated in the
corporate and foreign government sectors and were the result of decisions to reposition the
portfolio due to credit spread tightening in certain sectors and changes in foreign currency
exchange rates. Certain lower quality corporate securities that had appreciated in value as a
result of an improved corporate credit environment were sold to reposition the corporate holdings
into higher quality securities. Foreign securities were sold to reduce the foreign currency
exposure in the portfolio due to the expected near term volatility in foreign exchange rates.
Also, certain foreign government securities appreciated in price and were sold to capture gains
resulting from credit spread tightening since the date of purchase.

In 2005, gross losses were primarily within corporate and foreign government securities. Included
in the corporate gross losses for 2005 are losses on sales of securities related to a major
automotive manufacturer of $10 that primarily occurred during the second quarter. Sales related to
actions taken to reduce issuer exposure in light of a downward adjustment in earnings and cash
flows of the issuer primarily due to sluggish sales, rising employee and retiree benefit costs and
an increased debt service interest burden, and to reposition the portfolio into higher quality
securities. For 2005, excluding sales related to the automotive manufacturer noted above, there
was no single security sold at a loss in excess of $3 and the average loss as a percentage of the
fixed maturity’s amortized cost was less than 2%, which under the Company’s impairment policy, was
deemed to be depressed only to a minor extent.

2004 Compared to 2003

— Before-tax net investment income increased $76, or 6%, and after-tax net
investment income increased $43, or 5%, compared to the prior year. The increases in net
investment income were primarily due to income earned on a higher average invested assets base in
2004, as compared to prior year, partially offset by a decrease in the average new invested assets
yield and the repositioning of the portfolio into higher quality assets as described below.

In 2004, the yield on average invested assets decreased slightly from the prior year as a result of
new investment purchases at rates below the average portfolio yield due to the continued low
interest rate environment. Since the Company invests primarily in long-term fixed rate debt
securities, changes in long-term interest rates impact the yield on new asset purchases and,
therefore, have a gradual impact on the overall portfolio yield. The weighted average yield on new
asset purchases in 2004 of approximately 4.9%, before-tax, was below the average portfolio yield.



Net realized capital gains for 2004 decreased $120 as compared to the prior year as a result of
lower net realized gains on sales of fixed maturity securities, partially offset by lower
other-than-temporary impairments. For further discussion of other-than-temporary impairments, see
the Other-Than-Temporary Impairments commentary in this section of the MD&A.

In 2004, gross gains were realized as fixed maturity credit spreads tightened and portions of the
Property & Casualty portfolios were repositioned into higher quality assets where HIMCO believed
greater relative value existed. Credit spreads tightened primarily due to improved credit quality,
market liquidity and demand for higher yielding assets, as well as the relatively low interest rate
environment. It is expected that the higher quality assets will provide greater liquidity if the
credit environment and issuer default rates return to historical norms. In addition, foreign
government securities were sold, primarily in the first and fourth quarters of 2004, to reduce the
portfolios’ exposure to foreign holdings and realize gains associated with the decline in value of
the U.S. dollar against foreign currencies.

In 2004, securities sold at a loss were predominantly corporate securities, U.S. government
securities, certain ABS and CMBS with no single security sold at a loss in excess of $5 and an
average loss as a percentage of the fixed maturity’s amortized cost of less than 5%, which under
the Company’s impairment policy were deemed to be depressed only to a minor extent. In 2003, no
Property & Casualty security was sold at a loss in excess of $10.

Corporate

The investment objective of Corporate is to raise capital through financing activities to support
the Life and Property & Casualty operations of the Company and to maintain sufficient funds to
support the cost of those financing activities including the payment of interest for The Hartford
Financial Services Group, Inc. (“HFSG”) issued debt and dividends to shareholders of The Hartford’s
common stock. As of December 31, 2005 and 2004, Corporate held $298 and $159, respectively, of
fixed maturity investments. In addition, Corporate held $7 of other investments as of December 31,
2004.

Investment Management Activities

HIMCO serves as collateral manager for four synthetic collateralized loan obligation trusts and a
recently issued continuously offered ERISA-eligible institutional fund (collectively, “synthetic
CLOs”) that invests in senior secured bank loans through total return swaps (“referenced bank loan
portfolios”). HIMCO assumed collateral manager responsibilities for two of the synthetic CLOs in
2004 and subsequently sponsored and issued three additional synthetic CLOs (one in 2004 and two in
2005). The outstanding notional value of the referenced bank loan portfolios from the five
synthetic CLOs was $1.7 billion and $1.1 billion as of December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively.

As of December 31, 2005 and 2004, the synthetic CLOs had issued approximately $290 and $185 of
notes and preferred shares (“CLO issuances”), respectively. The proceeds from the CLO issuances
are invested in collateral accounts consisting of high credit quality securities and/or bank loans
that are pledged to the referenced bank loan portfolios’ swap counterparties. Investors in the CLO
issuances receive the net proceeds from the referenced bank loan portfolios. Any principal losses
incurred by the swap counterparties associated with the referenced bank loan portfolios are borne
by the CLO issuances investors through the total return swaps. Approximately $240 and $170 of the
CLO issuances were held by third party investors as of December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively.
The third party investors in the synthetic CLOs have recourse only to the synthetic CLOs’ assets
and not to the general credit of the Company. Accordingly, the Company’s financial exposure to
these synthetic CLOs is limited to its direct investment in certain notes and preferred shares
issued by the synthetic CLOs and loss of management fees.

Pursuant to the requirements of Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation No. 46
(revised), “Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, an interpretation of ARB No. 51” (“FIN
46R”), the Company has concluded that the five synthetic CLOs are variable interest entities
(“VIEs”) and for two of the synthetic CLOs, the Company is the primary beneficiary and must
consolidate these synthetic CLOs. Accordingly, the Company has reflected the assets and
liabilities of two synthetic CLOs in its consolidated financial statements. As of December 31,
2005, the Company recorded $75 of cash and fixed maturities, total return swaps with a fair value
of $2 in other investments and $42 in other liabilities related to the CLO issuances in its
consolidated balance sheets. As of December 31, 2004, the Company recorded in the consolidated
balance sheets $65 of cash and fixed maturities, total return swaps with a fair value of $3 in
other investments and $52 related to the CLO issuances in other liabilities. The Company’s
investments and accrued management fees in the consolidated synthetic CLOs, which is its maximum
exposure to loss, was $35 and $14, as of December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively.

Under FIN 46R, the Company is not deemed to be the primary beneficiary of the other three synthetic
CLOs managed by HIMCO, one of which was issued in 2005. As a result, these synthetic CLOs are not
consolidated by the Company. The Company’s maximum exposure to loss from the non-consolidated
synthetic CLOs (consisting of the Company’s investments and accrued management fees) was
approximately $21 and $3 as of December 31, 2005 and 2004. The collateral management fees earned
by HIMCO for the three non-consolidated synthetic CLOs totaled $6 and $3 for the years ended
December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively, and are reported in other income in the consolidated
statements of operations.

The Company utilized qualitative and quantitative analyses to assess whether it was the primary
beneficiary of the VIEs. The qualitative considerations included the Company’s co-investment in
relation to the total CLO issuance. The quantitative analysis included calculating the variability
of the CLO issuance based upon statistical techniques utilizing historical normalized default and
recovery rates for the average credit quality of the initial referenced bank loan portfolio.



Other-Than-Temporary Impairments

The Company has a security monitoring process overseen by a committee of investment and accounting
professionals that, on a quarterly basis, identifies securities that could potentially be
other-than-temporarily impaired. When a security is deemed to be other-than-temporarily impaired,
its cost or amortized cost is written down to current market value and a realized loss is recorded
in the Company’s consolidated statements of operations. For further discussion regarding the
Company’s other-than-temporary impairment policy, see “Evaluation of Other-Than-Temporary
Impairments on Available-for-Sale Securities” included in the Critical Accounting Estimates section
of the MD&A and Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

The decrease in other-than-temporary impairments during 2004 and 2005 in comparison to 2003
levels is due to an improvement in the corporate credit environment, general economic conditions
and operating fundamentals, and improved pricing levels for ABS. In general, security issuers’
operating fundamentals have improved due to reduced company leverage, improved liquidity and the
successful implementation of various cost cutting measures. Improvement in pricing levels for ABS
has been driven by a general stabilization in the performance of the underlying collateral and an
increase in demand for these asset types due to improved economic and operating fundamentals of the
underlying security issuers, better market liquidity and attractive yields.

Future other-than-temporary impairment levels will depend primarily on economic fundamentals,
political stability, issuer and/or collateral performance and future movements in interest rates.
If interest rates continue to increase during 2006 or credit spreads widen, other-than-temporary
impairments for 2006 may be higher than the 2005 levels. For further discussion of risk factors
associated with sectors with significant unrealized loss positions, see the sector risk factor
commentary under the Consolidated Total Available-for-Sale Securities with Unrealized Loss Greater
than Six Months by Type table in the Investment Credit Risk section of the MD&A.

The following discussion provides an analysis of significant other-than-temporary impairments
recognized during 2005, 2004 and 2003, the related circumstances giving rise to the
other-than-temporary impairments and the potential impact such circumstances may have on other
material investments held.


During 2005 there were no significant other-than-temporary impairments (e.g. $15 or greater)
recorded on any single security or issuer. Other-than-temporary impairments recorded on ABS
primarily related to deterioration of the underlying collateral supporting several securities and
included $3 recorded on aircraft lease receivables related to one major U.S. carrier. These
receivables are secured by certain older aircraft that recently experienced a significant decline
in value. Other-than-temporary impairments recorded on equity securities primarily related to
variable rate perpetual preferred securities issued by one highly-rated financial services company.
These securities had sustained a decline in market value for an extended period of time as a
result of issuer credit spread widening. Other-than-temporary impairments recorded on corporate
securities were primarily the result of the Company’s uncertainty regarding its intent and ability
to retain the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for an anticipated recovery, not
to the Company’s expectations regarding the issuers’ payments based upon the contractual terms of
the securities. The circumstances giving rise to the decline in value of these corporate
securities since the date of purchase and potential impact on other material holdings of these
issuers are as follows:

•

Approximately $15 of other-than-temporary impairments recorded on
corporate securities related to three Canadian paper companies.
These companies’ operations have recently suffered from high
energy prices and falling demand, in part due to the appreciation
of the Canadian dollar in comparison to the U.S. dollar. These
investments continue to perform in accordance with the contractual
terms of the securities. As of December 31, 2005, the Company
held approximately $96 of securities issued by these three
companies in a total net unrealized loss position of $5.
Substantially all of the securities in an unrealized loss
position, as of December 31, 2005, were depressed only to a minor
extent and, as a result, the unrealized losses were deemed to be
temporary in nature.

•

Also included in the corporate securities other-than-temporary
impairment amount for 2005 was $9 recorded on securities related
to two major automotive manufacturers. The market values of these
securities had fallen due to a downward adjustment in earnings and
cash flow guidance primarily due to sluggish sales, rising
employee and retiree benefit costs and an increased debt service
burden. These investments continue to perform in accordance with
the contractual terms of the securities. As of December 31, 2005,
the Company held approximately $137 of securities issued by these
two companies in a total net unrealized loss position of $7.
Substantially all of the securities in an unrealized loss
position, as of December 31, 2005, were depressed only to a minor
extent and, as a result, the unrealized losses were deemed to be
temporary in nature.




During 2004 there were no significant other-than-temporary impairments (e.g. $15 or greater)
recorded on any single security or issuer. In aggregate, other-than-temporary impairments recorded
on ABS primarily related to the decline in market values of certain previously impaired securities.
Other-than-temporary impairments recorded on equity securities primarily related to variable rate
perpetual preferred securities issued by two highly rated financial services companies. These
securities are variable rate securities with unique structural interest rate reset characteristics
that have sustained a decline in market value for an extended period of time primarily as a result
of the increase in short-term interest rates after the security’s interest rate reset period. As
of December 31, 2004, the Company did not hold other perpetual preferred securities in an
unrealized loss position with similar interest rate reset characteristics.


During 2003, other-than-temporary impairments were primarily recorded on ABS, corporate fixed
maturities and equity securities. The ABS other-than-temporary impairments were primarily due to
the continued deterioration of the underlying collateral supporting the various transactions. A
significant portion of corporate fixed maturity other-than-temporary impairments during 2003
resulted from various issuers who experienced fraud or accounting irregularities. In addition,
during the first half of the year, corporate debt issuers in the transportation sector,
specifically issuers in the airline sector, deteriorated as a result of the continued decline in
airline travel. During 2003, there was one security for which a significant (e.g. $15 or greater)
other-than-temporary impairment was recorded, the circumstances of which are discussed in more
detail below.

•

Approximately $25 of impairments on corporate fixed maturities were within the food and
beverage sector and related to securities issued by the Italian dairy concern, Parmalat SpA.
Parmalat filed for bankruptcy in December 2003 due to liquidity problems when it was
discovered that 4 billion euros of liquid investments previously reported on its balance sheet
were non-existent.

The following list identifies ABS and equity impairment losses recognized in 2003 that by issuer
did not exceed $15 but did when combined with securities supported with similar collateral or
equity security types. The circumstances giving rise to those losses are as follows:

•

Within ABS other-than-temporary impairments, there were
approximately $31 of collateralized debt obligations (“CDOs”) and
$29 of aircraft lease receivables. The CDO impairments consisted
of approximately ten securities, the majority of which were
interests in the lower tranches of securities backed by high yield
corporate debt and were primarily the result of continued high
default rates in 2003 and lower recovery rates on the CDOs’
underlying collateral. The aircraft lease receivable impairments
primarily consisted of investments in lower tranches of five
transactions. These securities are supported by aircraft leases
and enhanced equipment trust certificates issued by multiple
airlines that had sustained a steep decline in market value and
adverse change in expected cash flows due to continued lower
aircraft lease rates, airline bankruptcies and the prolonged
decline in airline travel.

•

The $30 of the other-than-temporary impairments recorded on equity
securities primarily related to various diversified mutual funds.
The market values of these funds had fallen since the date of
purchase due to declines in primarily the equity markets and were
not expected to recover within a reasonable period of time. Due
to the severity of the price depression and length of time the
holdings were in an unrealized loss position, these securities
were deemed to be other-than-temporarily impaired.

INVESTMENT CREDIT RISK

The Company has established investment credit policies that focus on the credit quality of obligors
and counterparties, limit credit concentrations, encourage diversification and require frequent
creditworthiness reviews. Investment activity, including setting of policy and defining acceptable
risk levels, is subject to regular review and approval by senior management and by The Hartford’s
Board of Directors.

The Company invests primarily in securities which are rated investment grade and has established
exposure limits, diversification standards and review procedures for all credit risks including
borrower, issuer and counterparty. Creditworthiness of specific obligors is determined by
consideration of external determinants of creditworthiness, typically ratings assigned by
nationally recognized ratings agencies and is supplemented by an internal credit evaluation.
Obligor, asset sector and industry concentrations are subject to established Company limits and are
monitored on a regular basis.

The Company is not exposed to any credit concentration risk of a single issuer greater than 10% of
the Company’s stockholders’ equity other than certain U.S. government and government agencies. For
further discussion of concentration of credit risk, see the “Concentration of Credit Risk” section
in Note 4 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Derivative Instruments

The Company’s derivative counterparty exposure policy establishes market-based credit limits,
favors long-term financial stability and creditworthiness and typically requires credit
enhancement/credit risk reducing agreements. Credit risk is measured as the amount owed to the
Company based on current market conditions and potential payment obligations between the Company
and its counterparties. Credit exposures are generally quantified daily, netted by counterparty
for each legal entity of the Company, and collateral is pledged to and held by, or on behalf of,
the Company to the extent the current value of derivatives exceeds the exposure policy thresholds
which do not exceed $10. The Company also minimizes the credit risk in derivative instruments by
entering into transactions with high quality counterparties rated Aa/A or better, which are
monitored by the Company’s internal compliance unit and reviewed frequently by senior management.
In addition, the compliance unit monitors counterparty credit exposure on a monthly basis to ensure
compliance with Company policies and statutory limitations. The Company also maintains a policy of
requiring that all



derivative contracts, other than exchange traded contracts and currency forward
contracts, be governed by an International Swaps and
Dealers Association Master Agreement which is structured by legal entity and by counterparty and
permits right of offset. To date, the Company has not incurred any losses on derivative
instruments due to counterparty nonperformance.

In addition to counterparty credit risk, the Company periodically enters into swap agreements in
which the Company assumes credit exposure from or reduces credit exposure to a single entity,
referenced index or asset pool. Summaries of these derivatives are as follows:

•

Total return swaps and credit spreadlocks involve the periodic
exchange of payments with other parties, at specified intervals,
calculated using the agreed upon index and notional principal
amounts. Generally, no cash or principal payments are exchanged
at the inception of the contract. Typically, at the time a swap
is entered into, the cash flow streams exchanged by the
counterparties are equal in value. As of December 31, 2005 and
2004, the notional value of total return swaps and credit
spreadlocks totaled $1.9 billion and $1.5 billion, respectively,
and the fair value totaled $5 and $6, respectively.

•

Credit default swaps involve a transfer of credit risk from one
party to another in exchange for periodic payments. One party to
the contract will make a payment based on an agreed upon rate and
a notional amount. The second party, who assumes credit exposure,
will only make a payment when there is a credit event and such
payment will be equal to the notional value of the swap contract
less the value of the referenced security issuer debt obligation.
A credit event is generally defined as default on contractually
obligated interest or principal payments or bankruptcy. As of
December 31, 2005 and 2004, the notional value of these credit
default swaps, which exposed the Company to credit risk, totaled
$700 and $447, respectively, and the swap fair value totaled $(4)
and $3, respectively. As of December 31, 2005, the average S&P
rating for these referenced security issuer debt obligations is
A-.

•

The Company also uses credit default swaps to reduce its credit
exposure by entering into agreements in which the Company pays a
derivative counterparty a periodic fee in exchange for
compensation from the counterparty should a credit event occur on
the part of the referenced security issuer. Alternatively, the
derivative counterparty may be required to purchase the referenced
security at a predetermined value. The Company enters into these
agreements as an efficient means to reduce credit exposure to the
specified issuers. As of December 31, 2005 and 2004, the notional
value of these credit default swaps totaled $254 and $215,
respectively, and the swap fair value totaled $2 and $(1),
respectively. As of December 31, 2005, the average S&P rating for
these referenced securities issuers is BBB.

The Company’s fixed maturity portfolio gross unrealized gains and losses as of December 31,
2005, in comparison to December 31, 2004, were primarily impacted by changes in interest rates as
well as credit spread movements, changes in foreign currency exchange rates and security sales.
The Company’s fixed maturity gross unrealized gains decreased $1.6 billion and gross unrealized
losses increased $498 from December 31, 2004 to December 31, 2005, primarily due to an increase in
short-term through intermediate-term interest rates as well as credit spread widening and foreign
currency depreciation in comparison to the U.S. dollar for foreign denominated securities, offset
in part by a decrease in long-term interest rates and other-than-temporary impairments taken during
the year. Gross unrealized gains and losses were reduced by securities sold in a gain or loss
position, respectively.

For further discussion of risk factors associated with sectors with significant unrealized loss
positions, see the sector risk factor commentary under the Consolidated Total Available-for-Sale
Securities with Unrealized Loss Greater than Six Months by Type table in this section of the MD&A.

Investment sector allocations as a percentage of total fixed maturities have changed since December
31, 2004, with a shift from certain corporate and short-term securities to CMBS due to their
attractive yields relative to credit quality and MBS due to their relatively low risk profile and
attractive spreads. The shift from corporate securities was primarily a result of capturing gains
within the technology and communications sector due to credit spreads tightening as well as
divesting securities that could be adversely impacted by issuers recapitalizing, pushing the
Company’s interest lower in the repayment priority (e.g. leveraged buy-outs) or issuer capital uses
that would not benefit the Company’s debt holders position (e.g. share repurchases). Also, HIMCO
continues to overweight, in comparison to the Lehman Aggregate Index, ABS supported by diversified
pools of consumer loans (e.g. home equity and auto loans and credit card receivables) and CMBS due
to the securities’ attractive spread levels and underlying asset diversification and quality. In
general, CMBS have lower prepayment risk than MBS due to contractual fees.

As of December 31, 2005 and 2004, 22% and 19%, respectively, of the fixed maturities were invested
in private placement securities, including 15% and 12%, respectively, in Rule 144A offerings to
qualified institutional buyers. Private placement securities are generally less liquid than public
securities. Most of the private placement securities are rated by nationally recognized rating
agencies.

At the January 2006 Federal Open Market Committee (“FOMC”) meeting, the Federal Reserve increased
the target federal funds rate by 25 basis points to 4.50%, a 225 basis point increase from year-end
2004 levels. The FOMC stated that although recent economic data has been uneven, the expansion in
economic activity appears solid, core inflation has stayed relatively low in recent months and
longer-term inflation expectations remain contained. They noted that some further increases may be
needed to keep the risks to the attainment of both sustainable economic growth and price stability
roughly in balance. The Company believes the Federal Reserve is approaching the end of its rate
tightening cycle with an increase or two possible during the first half of 2006. Ultimately, the
level of rate increases will be largely dependent on future inflationary data. The risk of
inflation could increase for a number of reasons including an increase in energy and commodity
prices, an acceleration of wage rates, a slow down of productivity growth, an increase in U.S.
budget or trade deficits or the U.S. dollar significantly depreciating in comparison to foreign
currencies. Increases in future interest rates may result in lower fixed maturity valuations.

The following table identifies fixed maturities by credit quality on a consolidated basis as of
December 31, 2005 and 2004. The ratings referenced below are based on the ratings of a nationally
recognized rating organization or, if not rated, assigned based on the Company’s internal analysis
of such securities.

As of December 31, 2005 and 2004, the Company held no issuer of a BIG security with a fair
value in excess of 4% of the total fair value for BIG securities. Total BIG securities decreased
since December 31, 2004, as a result of a decision to reduce exposure to lower credit quality
assets resulting from the securities’ significant credit spread tightening and re-investment in
higher quality securities.

The increase in the unrealized loss amount since December 31, 2004, is primarily the result of
an increase in short-term through intermediate-term interest rates as well as credit spread
widening and foreign currency depreciation in comparison to the U.S. dollar for foreign denominated
securities offset in part by asset sales, a decrease in long-term interest rates and
other-than-temporary impairments taken during the year. For further discussion, see the economic
commentary under the Consolidated Fixed Maturities by Type table in this section of the MD&A.

The average security unrealized loss at December 31, 2005 and 2004, as a percentage of amortized
cost was less than 3% and 2%, respectively. As of December 31, 2005 and 2004, fixed maturities
represented $750, or 99%, and $252, or 95%, respectively, of the Company’s total unrealized loss
associated with securities classified as available-for-sale. There were no fixed maturities, as of
December 31, 2005 and 2004, with a fair value less than 80% of the security’s amortized cost basis
for six continuous months other than certain ABS and CMBS subject to EITF Issue No. 99-20.
Other-than-temporary impairments for certain ABS and CMBS are recognized if the fair value of the
security, as determined by external pricing sources, is less than its cost or amortized cost and
there has been a decrease in the present value of the expected cash flows since the last reporting
period. There were no ABS or CMBS included in the table above, as of December 31, 2005 and 2004,
for which management’s best estimate of future cash flows adversely changed during the reporting
period for which an impairment has not been recorded. For further discussion of the
other-than-temporary impairments criteria, see “Evaluation of Other-Than-Temporary Impairments on
Available-for-Sale Securities” included in the Critical Accounting Estimates section of the MD&A
and Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

The Company held no securities of a single issuer that were at an unrealized loss position in
excess of 6% and 5%, respectively, of the total unrealized loss amount as of December 31, 2005 and
2004.



The total securities classified as available-for-sale in an unrealized loss position for longer

The increase in total unrealized loss greater than six months since December 31, 2004, was
primarily driven by an increase in short-term through intermediate-term interest rates as well as
credit spread widening and foreign currency depreciation in comparison to the U.S. dollar for
foreign denominated securities, offset in part by security sales, a decrease in long-term interest
rates and other-than-temporary impairments taken during the year. With the exception of ABS
security types, the majority of the securities in an unrealized loss position for six months or
more as of December 31, 2005, were depressed primarily due to interest rate changes from the date
of purchase. The sectors with the most significant concentration of unrealized losses at December
31, 2005 were CMBS, ABS supported by aircraft lease receivables and corporate fixed maturities
primarily within the financial services sector. The Company’s current view of risk factors
relative to these fixed maturity types is as follows:

CMBS

— The CMBS in an unrealized loss position as of December 31, 2005, were primarily the result
of an increase in interest rates from the security’s purchase date. Substantially all of these
securities are investment grade securities priced at or greater than 90% of amortized cost as of
December 31, 2005. Additional changes in fair value of these securities are primarily dependent on
future changes in interest rates.

Aircraft lease receivables

— The Company’s holdings are ABS secured by leases on aircraft. The
decline in the fair values of these securities is primarily attributable to the high risk premium
associated with the increase in volatility of airline travel demand in recent years, lack of market
liquidity in this sector and long term to maturity of these securities. In recent years, aircraft
demand and lease rates have improved as a result of an increase in worldwide travel. However, the
continuing difficulties experienced by several major U.S. domestic airlines due to high operating
costs, including fuel and certain employee benefits costs, continue to weigh heavily on this
sector. Based on the Company’s projections of future cash flows under distressed scenarios, the
Company expects to recover the full contractual principal and interest payments of these
investments. However, future price recovery will depend on continued improvement in economic
fundamentals, political stability, airline operating performance and collateral value.

Financial services

— As of December 31, 2005, the Company held approximately 200 different
securities in the financial services sector that had been in an unrealized loss position for
greater than six months. Substantially all of these securities are investment grade securities
priced at or greater than 90% of amortized cost as of December 31, 2005. These positions are a
mixture of fixed and variable rate securities with extended maturity dates, which have been
adversely impacted by changes in interest rates after the purchase date. Additional changes in
fair value of these securities are primarily dependent on future changes in interest rates.

As part of the Company’s ongoing security monitoring process by a committee of investment and
accounting professionals, the Company has reviewed its investment portfolio and concluded that
there were no additional other-than-temporary impairments as of December 31, 2005 and 2004. Due to
the issuers’ continued satisfaction of the securities’ obligations in accordance with their
contractual terms and the expectation that they will continue to do so, management’s intent and
ability to hold these securities, as well as the evaluation of the fundamentals of the issuers’
financial condition and other objective evidence, the Company believes that the prices of the
securities in the sectors identified above were temporarily depressed.

The evaluation for other-than-temporary impairments is a quantitative and qualitative process,
which is subject to risks and uncertainties in the determination of whether declines in the fair
value of investments are other-than-temporary. The risks and uncertainties include changes in
general economic conditions, the issuer’s financial condition or near term recovery prospects and
the effects of changes in interest rates. In addition, for securitized financial assets with
contractual cash flows (e.g. ABS and CMBS), projections of expected future cash flows may change
based upon new information regarding the performance of the underlying



collateral. As of December 31, 2005 and 2004, management’s expectation of the discounted future
cash flows on these securities was in excess of the associated securities’ amortized cost. For a
further discussion, see “Evaluation of Other-Than-Temporary Impairments on Available-for-Sale

The increase in the BIG and equity security unrealized loss amount for securities classified
as available-for-sale from December 31, 2004 to December 31, 2005, was primarily the result of the
increase in short-term through intermediate-term interest rates as well as credit spread widening
and foreign currency depreciation in comparison to the U.S. dollar for foreign denominated
securities, offset in part by asset sales, a decrease in long-term interest rates and
other-than-temporary impairments taken during the year. For further discussion, see the economic
commentary under the Consolidated Fixed Maturities by Type table in this section of the MD&A.

The decrease in the consolidated available-for-sale BIG and equity securities greater than six
months unrealized loss amount since December 31, 2004, was primarily the result of
other-than-temporary impairments taken during the year, asset sales and a decrease in long-term
interest rates partially offset by the increase in short-term through intermediate-term interest
rates as well as credit spread widening and foreign currency depreciation in comparison to the U.S.
dollar for foreign denominated securities. For further discussion of risk factors associated with
sectors with significant unrealized loss positions, see the sector risk factor commentary under the
Consolidated Total Available-for-Sale Securities with Unrealized Loss Greater than Six Months by
Type table in this section of the MD&A.

CAPITAL MARKETS RISK MANAGEMENT

The Hartford has a disciplined approach to managing risks associated with its capital markets and
asset/liability management activities. Investment portfolio management is organized to focus
investment management expertise on the specific classes of investments, while asset/liability
management is the responsibility of a dedicated risk management unit supporting Life and Property &
Casualty operations. Derivative instruments are utilized in compliance with established Company
policy and regulatory requirements and are monitored internally and reviewed by senior management.



Market Risk

The Hartford is exposed to market risk, primarily relating to the market price and/or cash flow
variability associated with changes in interest rates, equity prices or foreign currency exchange
rates.

Interest Rate Risk

The Company’s exposure to interest rate risk relates to the market price and/or cash flow
variability associated with the changes in market interest rates. The Company manages its exposure
to interest rate risk through asset allocation limits, asset/liability duration matching and
through the use of derivatives. The Company analyzes interest rate risk using various models
including parametric models and cash flow simulation of the liabilities and the supporting
investments, including derivative instruments under various market scenarios. Measures the Company
uses to quantify its exposure to interest rate risk inherent in its invested assets and interest
rate sensitive liabilities include duration and key rate duration. Duration is the weighted
average term-to-maturity of a security’s cash flows, and is used to approximate the percentage
change in the price of a security for a 100 basis point change in market interest rates. For
example, a duration of 5 means the price of the security will change by approximately 5% for a 1%
change in interest rates. The key rate duration analysis considers the expected future cash flows
of assets and liabilities assuming non-parallel interest rate movements.

To calculate duration, projections of asset and liability cash flows are discounted to a present
value using interest rate assumptions. These cash flows are then revalued at alternative interest
rate levels to determine the percentage change in fair value due to an incremental change in rates.
Cash flows from corporate obligations are assumed to be consistent with the contractual payment
streams on a yield to worst basis. The primary assumptions used in calculating cash flow
projections include expected asset payment streams taking into account prepayment speeds, issuer
call options and contract holder behavior. ABS, CMOs and MBS are modeled based on estimates of the
rate of future prepayments of principal over the remaining life of the securities. These estimates
are developed using prepayment speeds provided in broker consensus data. Such estimates are
derived from prepayment speeds previously experienced at the interest rate levels projected for the
underlying collateral. Actual prepayment experience may vary from these estimates.

The Company is also exposed to interest rate risk based upon the discount rate assumption
associated with the Company’s pension and other postretirement benefit obligations. The discount
rate assumption is based upon an interest rate yield curve comprised of Aa with maturities between
zero and thirty years. Declines in long-term interest rates have had a negative impact on the
funded status of the plans. For a further discussion of interest rate risk associated with the
plans, see the Critical Accounting Estimates section of the MD&A under “Pension and Other
Postretirement Benefit Obligations” and Note 17 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

The Company believes that an increase in interest rates from the current levels is generally a
favorable development for the Company. Rate increases are expected to provide additional net
investment income, increase sales of fixed rate Life investment products, reduce the cost of the
GMWB hedging program, limit the potential risk of margin erosion due to minimum guaranteed
crediting rates in certain Life products and, if sustained, could reduce the Company’s prospective
pension expense. Conversely, a rise in interest rates will reduce the net unrealized gain position
of the investment portfolio, increase interest expense on the Company’s variable rate debt
obligations and, if long-term interest rates rise dramatically within a six to twelve month time
period, certain Life businesses may be exposed to disintermediation risk. Disintermediation risk
refers to the risk that policyholders will surrender their contracts in a rising interest rate
environment requiring the Company to liquidate assets in an unrealized loss position. In
conjunction with the interest rate risk measurement and management techniques, significant portions
of Life’s fixed income product offerings have market value adjustment provisions at contract
surrender.

Since the Company matches, and actively manages its assets and liabilities, an interest environment
with an inverted yield curve (i.e. short-term interest rates are higher than intermediate-term or
long-term interest rates) does not significantly impact the Company’s profits or operations. As
noted above, the absolute level of interest rates is more significant than the shape of the yield
curve.

Equity Risk

The Company does not have significant equity risk exposure from invested assets. The Company’s
primary exposure to equity risk relates to the potential for lower earnings associated with certain
of the Life’s businesses such as variable annuities where fee income is earned based upon the fair
value of the assets under management. In addition, Life offers certain guaranteed benefits,
primarily associated with variable annuity products, which increases the Company’s potential
benefit exposure as the equity markets decline. For a further discussion, see Life Equity Risk in
this section of the MD&A.

The Company is also subject to equity risk based upon the expected long-term rate of return
assumption associated with the Company’s pension and other postretirement benefit obligations. The
Company determines the long-term rate of return assumption for the plans’ portfolio based upon an
analysis of historical returns. Declines in equity returns have had a negative impact on the
funded status of the plans.

Foreign Currency Exchange Risk

The Company’s currency exchange risk is related to non—U.S. dollar denominated investments, which
primarily consist of fixed maturity investments, the investment in the Japanese Life operation, its
GMDB and GMIB benefits associated with its Japanese variable annuities, and a yen denominated
individual fixed annuity product. A significant portion of the Company’s foreign currency exposure
is mitigated through the use of derivatives.



Derivative Instruments

The Hartford utilizes a variety of derivative instruments, including swaps, caps, floors, forwards,
futures and options, in compliance with Company policy and regulatory requirements to mitigate
interest rate, equity market or foreign currency exchange rate risk or volatility.

Interest rate swaps involve the periodic exchange of payments with other parties, at specified
intervals, calculated using the agreed upon rates and notional principal amounts. Generally, no
cash or principal payments are exchanged at the inception of the contract. Typically, at the time
a swap is entered into, the cash flow streams exchanged by the counterparties are equal in value.

Interest rate cap and floor contracts entitle the purchaser to receive from the issuer at specified
dates, the amount, if any, by which a specified market rate exceeds the cap strike interest rate or
falls below the floor strike interest rate, applied to a notional principal amount. A premium
payment is made by the purchaser of the contract at its inception and no principal payments are
exchanged.

Forward contracts are customized commitments to either purchase or sell designated financial
instruments, at a future date, for a specified price and may be settled in cash or through delivery
of the underlying instrument.

Financial futures are standardized commitments to either purchase or sell designated financial
instruments, at a future date, for a specified price and may be settled in cash or through delivery
of the underlying instrument. Futures contracts trade on organized exchanges. Margin requirements
for futures are met by pledging securities, and changes in the futures’ contract values are settled
daily in cash.

Option contracts grant the purchaser, for a premium payment, the right to either purchase from or
sell to the issuer a financial instrument at a specified price, within a specified period or on a
stated date.

Foreign currency swaps exchange an initial principal amount in two currencies, agreeing to
re-exchange the currencies at a future date, at an agreed upon exchange rate. There may also be a
periodic exchange of payments at specified intervals calculated using the agreed upon rates and
exchanged principal amounts.

Derivative activities are monitored by an internal compliance unit and reviewed frequently by
senior management. The notional amounts of derivative contracts represent the basis upon which pay
or receive amounts are calculated and are not reflective of credit risk. Notional amounts
pertaining to derivative instruments used in the management of market risk at December 31, 2005 and
2004, were $62.9 billion and $54.1 billion, respectively. The increase in the derivative notional
amount during 2005 was primarily due to the embedded derivatives associated with the GMWB product
feature. For further information, see Note 4 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

The following discussions focus on the key market risk exposures within Life and Property &
Casualty portfolios.

Life

Life is responsible for maximizing economic value within acceptable risk parameters, including the
management of the interest rate sensitivity of invested assets while generating sufficient
after-tax income to support policyholder and corporate obligations. Life’s fixed maturity
portfolios and certain investment contracts and insurance product liabilities have material market
exposure to interest rate risk. In addition, Life’s operations are significantly influenced by
changes in the equity markets. Life’s profitability depends largely on the amount of assets under
management, which is primarily driven by the level of sales, equity market appreciation and
depreciation and the persistency of the in-force block of business. Life’s foreign currency
exposure is primarily related to non-U.S. dollar denominated fixed income securities, the
investment in the Japanese Life operation and certain foreign currency based individual fixed
annuity contracts, and its GMDB and GMIB benefits associated with its Japanese variable annuities.

Interest Rate Risk

Life’s exposure to interest rate risk relates to the market price and/or cash flow variability
associated with changes in market interest rates. Changes in interest rates can potentially impact
Life’s profitability. In certain scenarios where interest rates are volatile, Life could be
exposed to disintermediation risk and a reduction in net interest rate spread or profit margins.
The investments and liabilities primarily associated with interest rate risk are included in the
following discussion. Certain product liabilities, including those containing GMWB or GMDB, expose
the Company to interest rate risk but also have significant equity risk. These liabilities are
discussed as part of the Equity Risk section below.

Fixed Maturity Investments

Life’s investment portfolios primarily consist of investment grade fixed maturity securities,
including corporate bonds, ABS, CMBS, tax-exempt municipal securities and CMOs. The fair value of
Life’s fixed maturities was $50.8 billion and $50.5 billion at December 31, 2005 and 2004,
respectively. The fair value of Life’s fixed maturities and other invested assets fluctuates
depending on the interest rate environment and other general economic conditions. During periods
of declining interest rates, paydowns on MBS and CMOs increase as the underlying mortgages are
prepaid. During such periods, the Company generally will not be able to re-invest the proceeds of
any such prepayments at comparable yields. Conversely, during periods of rising interest rates,
the rate of prepayments generally declines, exposing the Company to the possibility of
asset/liability cash flow and yield mismatch. The weighted average



duration of the fixed maturity portfolio was approximately 5.3 and 5.0 years as of December 31,
2005 and 2004, respectively. In 2005, the duration of certain Life portfolios were modestly
lengthened, which generated additional interest income.

Liabilities

Life’s investment contracts and certain insurance product liabilities, other than non-guaranteed
separate accounts, include asset accumulation vehicles such as fixed annuities, guaranteed
investment contracts, other investment and universal life-type contracts and certain insurance
products such as long-term disability.

Asset accumulation vehicles primarily require a fixed rate payment, often for a specified period of
time. Product examples include fixed rate annuities with a market value adjustment feature and
fixed rate guaranteed investment contracts. The duration of these contracts generally range from
less than one year to ten years. In addition, certain products such as universal life contracts
and the general account portion of Life’s variable annuity products, credit interest to
policyholders subject to market conditions and minimum interest rate guarantees. The duration of
these products is short-term to intermediate-term.

While interest rate risk associated with many of these products has been reduced through the use of
market value adjustment features and surrender charges, the primary risk associated with these
products is that the spread between investment return and credited rate may not be sufficient to
earn targeted returns.

The Company also manages the risk of certain insurance liabilities similarly to investment type
products due to the relative predictability of the aggregate cash flow payment streams. Products
in this category may contain significant actuarial (including mortality and morbidity) pricing and
cash flow risks. Product examples include structured settlement contracts, on-benefit annuities
(i.e. the annuitant is currently receiving benefits thereon) and short-term and long-term
disability contracts. The cash outflows associated with these policy liabilities are not interest
rate sensitive but do vary based on the timing and amount of benefit payments. The primary risks
associated with these products are that the benefits will exceed expected actuarial pricing and/or
that the actual timing of the cash flows will differ from those anticipated, resulting in an
investment return lower than that assumed in pricing. Average contract duration can range from
less than one year to typically up to fifteen years.

Derivatives

Life utilizes a variety of derivative instruments to mitigate interest rate risk. Interest rate
swaps are primarily used to convert interest receipts or payments to a fixed or variable rate. The
use of such swaps enables the Company to customize contract terms and conditions to customer
objectives and satisfies the operation’s asset/liability duration matching policy. Occasionally,
swaps are also used to hedge the variability in the cash flow of a forecasted purchase or sale due
to changes in interest rates.

Interest rate caps and floors, swaptions and option contracts are primarily used to hedge against
the risk of liability contract holder disintermediation in a rising interest rate environment, and
to offset the changes in fair value of corresponding derivatives embedded in certain of the
Company’s fixed maturity investments.

At December 31, 2005 and 2004, notional amounts pertaining to derivatives utilized to manage
interest rate risk totaled $10.6 billion and $9.9 billion, respectively ($7.5 billion and $7.7
billion, respectively, related to investments and $3.1 billion and $2.2 billion, respectively,
related to life liabilities). The fair value of these derivatives was $(22) and $41 as of December
31, 2005 and 2004, respectively.

Calculated Interest Rate Sensitivity

The after-tax change in the net economic value of investment contracts (e.g. guaranteed investment
contracts) and certain other insurance product liabilities (e.g. short-term and long-term
disability contracts), for which the payment rates are fixed at contract issuance and the
investment experience is substantially absorbed by Life, are included in the following table along
with the corresponding invested assets. Also included in this analysis are the interest rate
sensitive derivatives used by Life to hedge its exposure to interest rate risk. Certain financial
instruments, such as limited partnerships, have been omitted from the analysis due to the fact that
the investments are accounted for under the equity method and generally lack sensitivity to
interest rate changes. Non-guaranteed separate account assets and liabilities and equity
securities held for trading and the corresponding liabilities associated with the variable annuity
products sold in Japan are excluded from the analysis because gains and losses in separate accounts
accrue to policyholders. The hypothetical calculation of the estimated change in net economic
value below assumes a 100 basis point upward and downward parallel shift in the yield curve.

The fixed liabilities included above represented approximately 45% and 50% of Life’s general
account liabilities as of December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The assets supporting the
fixed liabilities are monitored and managed within rigorous duration guidelines using scenario
simulation techniques, and are evaluated on an annual basis, in compliance with regulatory
requirements.

The after-tax change in fair value of the invested asset portfolios that support certain universal
life-type contracts and other insurance contracts are shown in the following table. The cash flows
associated with these liabilities are less predictable than fixed liabilities.



The Company identifies the most appropriate investment strategy based upon the expected
policyholder behavior and liability crediting needs. The hypothetical calculation of the estimated
change in fair value below assumes a 100 basis point upward and downward parallel shift in the
yield curve.

The selection of the 100 basis point parallel shift in the yield curve was made only as a
hypothetical illustration of the potential impact of such an event and should not be construed as a
prediction of future market events. Actual results could differ materially from those illustrated
above due to the nature of the estimates and assumptions used in the above analysis. The Company’s
sensitivity analysis calculation assumes that the composition of invested assets and liabilities
remain materially consistent throughout the year and that the current relationship between
short-term and long-term interest rates will remain constant over time. As a result, these
calculations may not fully capture the impact of portfolio re-allocations, significant product
sales or non-parallel changes in interest rates.

Equity Risk

The Company’s operations are significantly influenced by changes in the equity markets. The
Company’s profitability depends largely on the amount of assets under management, which is
primarily driven by the level of sales, equity market appreciation and depreciation and the
persistency of the in-force block of business. Prolonged and precipitous declines in the equity
markets can have a significant effect on the Company’s operations, as sales of variable products
may decline and surrender activity may increase, as customer sentiment towards the equity market
turns negative. Lower assets under management will have a negative effect on the Company’s
financial results, primarily due to lower fee income related to the Retail, Retirement Plans,
Institutional and International and, to a lesser extent, the Individual Life segment, where a heavy
concentration of equity linked products are administered and sold.

Furthermore, the Company may experience a reduction in profit margins if a significant portion of
the assets held in the variable annuity separate accounts move to the general account and the
Company is unable to earn an acceptable investment spread, particularly in light of the low
interest rate environment and the presence of contractually guaranteed minimum interest credited
rates, which for the most part are at a 3% rate.

In addition, prolonged declines in the equity market may also decrease the Company’s expectations
of future gross profits, which are utilized to determine the amount of DAC to be amortized in a
given financial statement period. A significant decrease in the Company’s future estimated gross
profits would require the Company to accelerate the amount of DAC amortization in a given period,
potentially causing a material adverse deviation in that period’s net income. Although an
acceleration of DAC amortization would have a negative effect on the Company’s earnings, it would
not affect the Company’s cash flow or liquidity position.

The Company sells variable annuity contracts that offer one or more benefit guarantees, the value
of which, generally increases with declines in equity markets. As is described in more detail
below, the Company manages the equity market risks embedded in these guarantees through
reinsurance, product design and hedging programs. The Company believes its ability to manage these
equity market risks by these means gives it a competitive advantage; and, in particular, its
ability to create innovative product designs that allow the Company to meet identified customer
needs while generating manageable amounts of equity market risk. The Company’s relative sales and
variable annuity market share have generally increased during periods when it has recently
introduced new products to the market. In contrast, the Company’s relative sales and market share
have generally decreased when competitors introduce products that cause an issuer to assume larger
amounts of equity and other market risk than the Company is confident it can prudently manage. The
Company believes its long-term success in the variable annuity market will continue to be aided by
successful innovation in both product design and in equity market risk management and that, in the
absence of this innovation, its market share could decline. Currently, the Company is experiencing
lower levels of U.S. variable annuity sales as competitors continue to introduce equity guarantees
of increasing risk and complexity. New product development is an ongoing process and during the
fourth quarter of 2005, the Company introduced a new living income benefit, which guarantees a
steady income stream for the life of the policyholder. Depending on customer acceptance and
competitor reaction to the Company’s product innovations, the Company’s future level of sales is
subject to a high level of uncertainty.

The accounting for various benefit guarantees offered with variable annuity contracts can be
significantly different. Those accounted for under SFAS No. 133 (such as GMWBs) are subject to
significant fluctuation in value, which is reflected in net income, due to changes in interest
rates, equity markets and equity market volatility as use of those capital market rates are
required in determining the liability’s fair value at each reporting date. Benefit guarantee
liabilities accounted for under SOP 03-1 (such as GMIBs and GMDBs) may also change in value;
however, the change in value is not immediately reflected in net income. Under SOP 03-1, the income
statement reflects the current period increase in the liability due to the deferral of a percentage
of current period revenues. The percentage is determined by dividing the present value of claims
by the present value of revenues using best estimate assumptions over a range of market scenarios.
Current period revenues are impacted by actual increases or decreases in account value. Claims
recorded against the liability have no immediate impact on the income statement unless those claims
exceed the liability. As a result of these significant accounting differences the liability for
guarantees recorded under SOP 03-1 may be significantly different if it was recorded under SFAS No.
133 and vice versa. In addition, the conditions in the capital markets in Japan vs. those in the
U.S. are sufficiently different that if the Company’s GMWB product currently offered in the U.S.
were offered in Japan, the capital market conditions in Japan would have a significant impact on
the valuation of the GMWB, irrespective of the accounting model. The same would hold true if the
Company’s GMIB product currently offered in Japan were to be offered in the U.S. Capital market
conditions in the U.S. would



have a significant impact on the valuation of the GMIB. Many benefit guarantees meet the
definition of an embedded derivative, under SFAS No. 133 (GMWB), and as such are recorded at fair
value with changes in fair value recorded in net income. However, certain contract features that
define how the contract holder can access the value of the guaranteed benefit change the accounting
from SFAS No. 133 to SOP 03-1. For contracts where the contract holder can only obtain the value
of the guaranteed benefit upon the occurrence of an insurable event such as death (GMDB) or by
making a significant initial net investment (GMIB), such as when one invests in an annuity, the
accounting for the benefit is prescribed by SOP 03-1.

In the U.S., the Company sells variable annuity contracts that offer various guaranteed death
benefits. The Company maintains a liability, under SOP 03-1, for the death benefit costs of $158,
as of December 31, 2005. Declines in the equity market may increase the Company’s net exposure to
death benefits under these contracts. The majority of the contracts with the guaranteed death
benefit feature are sold by the Retail Products Group segment. For certain guaranteed death
benefits, The Hartford pays the greater of (1) the account value at death; (2) the sum of all
premium payments less prior withdrawals; or (3) the maximum anniversary value of the contract, plus
any premium payments since the contract anniversary, minus any withdrawals following the contract
anniversary. For certain guaranteed death benefits sold with variable annuity contracts beginning
in June 2003, the Retail Products Group segment pays the greater of (1) the account value at death;
or (2) the maximum anniversary value; not to exceed the account value plus the greater of (a) 25%
of premium payments, or (b) 25% of the maximum anniversary value of the contract. The Company
currently reinsures a significant portion of these death benefit guarantees associated with its
in-force block of business.

The Company’s total gross exposure (i.e. before reinsurance) to these guaranteed death benefits as
of December 31, 2005 is $6.5 billion. Due to the fact that 82% of this amount is reinsured, the
Company’s net exposure is $1.2 billion. This amount is often referred to as the retained net
amount at risk. However, the Company will incur these guaranteed death benefit payments in the
future only if the policyholder has an in-the-money guaranteed death benefit at their time of
death.

In Japan, the Company offers certain variable annuity products with both a guaranteed death benefit
and a guaranteed income benefit. The Company maintains a liability for these death and income
benefits, under SOP 03-1, of $50 as of December 31, 2005. Declines in equity markets as well as a
strengthening of the Japanese Yen in comparison to the U.S. dollar may increase the Company’s
exposure to these guaranteed benefits. This increased exposure may be significant in extreme
market scenarios. For the guaranteed death benefits, the Company pays the greater of (1) account
value at death; (2) a guaranteed death benefit which, depending on the contract, may be based upon
the premium paid and/or the maximum anniversary value established no later than age 80, as adjusted
for withdrawals under the terms of the contract. The guaranteed income benefit guarantees to
return the contract holder’s initial investment, adjusted for any earnings withdrawals, through
periodic payments that commence at the end of a minimum deferral period of 10, 15 or 20 years as
elected by the contract holder.

The Company’s net amount at risk to the guaranteed death and income benefits offered in Japan was
$9 as of December 31, 2005. The Company will incur these guaranteed death or income benefits in
the future only if the contract holder has an in-the-money guaranteed benefit at either the time of
their death or if the account value is insufficient to fund the guaranteed living benefits. During
2005, the Company received regulatory approval and consummated a transaction to reinsure guaranteed
minimum income benefit risk associated with the sale of variable annuities in Japan to Hartford
Life and Annuity Insurance Company, a U.S. subsidiary.

In addition, the Company offers certain variable annuity products with a GMWB rider. GMWB is
accounted for under SFAS No. 133. Declines in the equity market may increase the Company’s
exposure to benefits under the GMWB contracts. For all contracts in effect through July 6, 2003,
the Company entered into a reinsurance arrangement to offset its exposure to the GMWB for the
remaining lives of those contracts. As of July 6, 2003, the Company exhausted all but a small
portion of the reinsurance capacity for new business under the current arrangement and has been
ceding only a very small number of new contracts subsequent to July 6, 2003. Substantially all new
contracts with the GMWB are not covered by reinsurance. These unreinsured contracts are expected
to generate volatility in net income as the underlying embedded derivative liabilities are recorded
at fair value each reporting period, resulting in the recognition of net realized capital gains or
losses in response to changes in certain critical factors including capital market conditions and
policyholder behavior. In order to minimize the volatility associated with the unreinsured GMWB
liabilities, the Company established an alternative risk management strategy. During the third
quarter of 2003, the Company began hedging its unreinsured GMWB exposure using interest rate
futures, Standard and Poor’s (“S&P”) 500 and NASDAQ index put options and futures contracts.
During the first quarter of 2004, the Company entered into Europe, Australasia and Far East
(“EAFE”) Index swaps to hedge GMWB exposure to international equity markets. The hedging program
involves a detailed monitoring of policyholder behavior and capital markets conditions on a daily
basis and rebalancing of the hedge position as needed. While the Company actively manages this
hedge position, hedge ineffectiveness may result due to factors including, but not limited to,
policyholder behavior, capital markets dislocation or discontinuity and divergence between the
performance of the underlying funds and the hedging indices.

During 2005, the Company periodically entered into forward starting Standard and Poor’s (“S&P”) 500
put options, as well as S&P index futures and interest rate swap contracts (“anticipated future
sales hedges”) to economically hedge the equity volatility risk exposure associated with
anticipated future sales of the GMWB rider. As of December 31, 2005, there were no open
anticipated future sales hedges and the net after-tax gain related to this hedge strategy was $8.

The net effect of the change in value of the embedded derivative net of the results of the hedging
program was a $46 loss and $8 gain before deferred policy acquisition costs and tax effects for the
years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. As of December 31, 2005, the notional and
fair value related to the embedded derivatives, the hedging strategy and reinsurance was $45.5
billion and $166, respectively. As of December 31, 2004, the notional and fair value related to
the embedded derivatives, the hedging strategy, and reinsurance was $37.7 billion and $170,
respectively.



The Company purchases one and two year S&P 500 Index put option contracts to economically hedge
certain liabilities that could increase if the equity markets decline. As of December 31, 2005 and
2004, the notional value related to this strategy was $1.1 billion and $1.9 billion, respectively,
while the fair value related to this strategy was $14 and $32, respectively. Because this strategy
is intended to partially hedge certain equity-market sensitive liabilities calculated under
statutory accounting (see Capital Resources and Liquidity), changes in the value of the put options
may not be closely aligned to changes in liabilities determined in accordance with Generally
Accepted Accounting Principles (“GAAP”), causing volatility in GAAP net income. The Company
anticipates employing similar strategies in the future, which could further increase volatility in
GAAP net income.

Foreign Currency Exchange Risk

Foreign currency exchange risk exists with respect to investments in non-U.S. dollar denominated
fixed maturities, primarily denominated in euro, sterling, yen and Canadian dollars, as well as
Life’s investment in foreign operations, primarily Japan, and the yen based individual fixed
annuity product and its GMDB and GMIB benefits associated with its Japanese
variable annuities.

The risk associated with the non-U.S. dollar denominated fixed maturities relates to potential
decreases in value and income resulting from unfavorable changes in foreign exchange rates. The
fair value of the non-U.S. dollar denominated fixed maturities at December 31, 2005 and 2004, were
approximately $1.9 billion and $2.5 billion, respectively. In order to manage its currency
exposures, Life enters into foreign currency swaps and forwards to hedge the variability in cash
flow associated with certain foreign denominated fixed maturities. These foreign currency swap
agreements are structured to match the foreign currency cash flows of the hedged foreign
denominated securities. At December 31, 2005 and 2004, the derivatives used to hedge currency
exchange risk related to non-U.S. dollar denominated fixed maturities had a total notional value of
$2.0 billion and $1.7 billion, respectively, and total fair value of $(232) and $(503),
respectively.

The functional currency of the Japanese operation is the Japanese yen. Accordingly, the premiums,
claims, commissions and investment income are paid or received in yen. In addition, most of the
Japanese operation’s investments are yen denominated. In 2003, Life had entered into yen
denominated forwards to hedge a substantial portion of the yen to U.S. dollar exchange rate
volatility related to the net investment in the Japanese operation. The net investment in the
Japanese operation was approximately $673 as of December 31, 2004. During the third quarter of
2005, the Company terminated its yen denominated forwards. The notional and fair value of the
contracts terminated during the third quarter of 2005 was $408 and $17, respectively. At December
31, 2004, the derivatives used to hedge the net investment in the Japanese operation had a total
notional and fair value of $401 and $(23), respectively. The after-tax net gains (losses) included
in the foreign currency transaction adjustment associated with the net investment hedge was $12,
$(14), and $(3) as of December 31, 2005, 2004, and 2003, respectively.

The yen based fixed annuity product is written by Hartford Life Insurance KK (“HLIKK”), a
wholly-owned Japanese subsidiary of Hartford Life, Inc. (“HLI”), and subsequently reinsured to
Hartford Life Insurance Company, a U.S. dollar based wholly-owned indirect subsidiary of HLI. The
underlying investment involves investing in U.S. securities markets, which offer favorable credit
spreads. The yen denominated fixed annuity product (“yen fixed annuities”) is recorded in the
consolidated balance sheets with invested assets denominated in dollars while policyholder
liabilities are denominated in yen and converted to U.S. dollars based upon the December 31, yen to
U.S. dollar spot rate. The difference between U.S. dollar denominated investments and yen
denominated liabilities exposes the Company to currency risk. The Company manages this currency
risk associated with the yen fixed annuities with primarily pay variable U.S. dollar receive fixed
yen, zero coupon currency swaps (“currency swaps”). As of December 31, 2005, the notional value
and fair value of the currency swaps were $1.7 billion and $(179), respectively. Although
economically an effective hedge, a divergence between the yen denominated fixed annuity product
liability and the currency swaps exists primarily due to the difference in the basis of accounting
between the liability and the derivative instruments (i.e. historical cost versus fair value). The
yen denominated fixed annuity product liabilities are recorded on a historical cost basis and are
only adjusted for changes in foreign spot rates and accrued income. The currency swaps are
recorded at fair value incorporating changes in value due to changes in forward foreign exchange
rates, interest rates and accrued income. An after-tax net loss of $23 and a net gain of $2 for
the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively, which includes the changes in value of
the currency swaps and the yen fixed annuity contract remeasurement, was recorded in net realized
capital gains and losses.

Based on the fair values of Life’s non-U.S. dollar denominated investments and derivative
instruments (including its yen based individual fixed annuity product) as of December 31, 2005 and
2004, management estimates that a 10% unfavorable change in exchange rates would decrease the fair
values by an after-tax total of $6 and $9, respectively. The estimated impact was based upon a 10%
change in December 31 spot rates. The selection of the 10% unfavorable change was made only for
hypothetical illustration of the potential impact of such an event and should not be construed as a
prediction of future market events. Actual results could differ materially from those illustrated
above due to the nature of the estimates and assumptions used in the above analysis.

Property & Casualty

Property & Casualty attempts to maximize economic value while generating appropriate after-tax
income and sufficient liquidity to meet policyholder and corporate obligations. Property &
Casualty’s investment portfolio has material exposure to interest rates. The Company continually
monitors these exposures and makes portfolio adjustments to manage these risks within established
limits.

Interest Rate Risk

The primary exposure to interest rate risk in Property & Casualty relates to its fixed maturity
securities, including corporate bonds, ABS, municipal bonds, CMBS and CMOs. The fair value of
these investments was $25.3 billion and $24.4 billion at December 31,



2005 and 2004, respectively. The fair value of these and Property & Casualty’s other invested
assets fluctuates depending on the interest rate environment and other general economic conditions.
During periods of declining interest rates, embedded call features within securities are exercised
with greater frequency and paydowns on MBS and CMOs increase as the underlying mortgages are
prepaid. During such periods, the Company generally will not be able to re-invest the proceeds of
any such prepayments at comparable yields. Conversely, during periods of rising interest rates,
the rate of prepayments generally decline. Derivative instruments such as swaps, caps and options
are used to manage interest rate risk and had a total notional amount as of December 31, 2005 and
2004 of $1.5 billion and fair value of $(9) and $7, respectively.

One of the measures Property & Casualty uses to quantify its exposure to interest rate risk
inherent in its invested assets is duration. The weighted average duration of the fixed maturity
portfolio was 4.6 years as of December 31, 2005 and 2004. In 2005, the duration of the Property &
Casualty portfolios were modestly shortened in anticipation of higher future interest rates.

Calculated Interest Rate Sensitivity

The following table provides an analysis showing the estimated after-tax change in the fair value
of Property & Casualty’s fixed income investments and related derivatives, assuming 100 basis point
upward and downward parallel shifts in the yield curve as of December 31, 2005 and 2004. Certain
financial instruments, such as limited partnerships, have been omitted from the analysis due to the
fact the investments are accounted for under the equity method and generally lack sensitivity to
interest rate changes.

As of December 31, 2005, a decrease in interest rates has a greater impact on the change in
fair value of the fixed income investments and related derivatives than an increase in interest
rates, as compared to December 31, 2004, due to the fact that there is greater positive convexity
in the portfolios as a result of increases in interest rates during 2005 as well as the prepayment
of certain asset classes, primarily municipalities.

The selection of the 100 basis point parallel shift in the yield curve was made only for
hypothetical illustration of the potential impact of such an event and should not be construed as a
prediction of future market events. Actual results could differ materially from those illustrated
above due to the nature of the estimates and assumptions used in the above analysis. The Company’s
sensitivity analysis calculation assumes that the composition of invested assets remains materially
consistent throughout the year and that the current relationship between short-term and long-term
interest rates will remain constant over time. As a result, these calculations may not fully
capture the impact of portfolio re-allocations or non-parallel changes in interest rates.

Foreign Currency Exchange Risk

Foreign currency exchange risk exists with respect to investments in non-U.S. dollar denominated
fixed maturities, primarily euro, sterling and Canadian dollar denominated securities. The risk
associated with these securities relates to potential decreases in value resulting from unfavorable
changes in foreign exchange rates. The fair value of these fixed maturity securities at December
31, 2005 and 2004 was $1.1 billion and $1.4 billion, respectively.

In order to manage its currency exposures, Property & Casualty enters into foreign currency swaps
and forward contracts to hedge the variability in cash flow associated with certain foreign
denominated securities. These foreign currency swap agreements are structured to match the foreign
currency cash flows of the hedged foreign denominated securities. At December 31, 2005 and 2004,
the derivatives used to hedge currency exchange risk had a total notional value of $515 and $370,
respectively, and total fair value of $(19) and $(70), respectively.

Based on the fair values of Property & Casualty’s non-U.S. dollar denominated securities and
derivative instruments as of December 31, 2005 and 2004, management estimates that a 10%
unfavorable change in exchange rates would decrease the fair values by an after-tax total of
approximately $50 and $63, respectively. The estimated impact was based upon a 10% change in
December 31 spot rates. The selection of the 10% unfavorable change was made only for hypothetical
illustration of the potential impact of such an event and should not be construed as a prediction
of future market events. Actual results could differ materially from those illustrated above due
to the nature of the estimates and assumptions used in the above analysis.

CAPITAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY

Capital resources and liquidity represent the overall financial strength of The Hartford and
its ability to generate strong cash flows from each of the business segments, borrow funds at
competitive rates and raise new capital to meet operating and growth needs.

Liquidity Requirements

The liquidity requirements of The Hartford have been and will continue to be met by funds from
operations as well as the issuance of commercial paper, common stock, debt securities and
borrowings from its credit facilities. Current and expected patterns of claim frequency and
severity may change from period to period but continue to be within historical norms and,
therefore, the Company’s current liquidity position is considered to be sufficient to meet
anticipated demands. However, if an unanticipated demand was placed on the Company it is likely
that the Company would either sell certain of its investments to fund claims which could result in
larger



than usual realized capital gains and losses or the Company would enter the capital markets to
raise further funds to provide the requisite liquidity. For a discussion and tabular presentation
of the Company’s current contractual obligations by period including those related to its Life and
Property & Casualty insurance refer to the Off-Balance Sheet and Aggregate Contractual Obligations
section below.

The Hartford endeavors to maintain a capital structure that provides financial and operational
flexibility to its insurance subsidiaries, ratings that support its competitive position in the
financial services marketplace (see the Ratings section below for further discussion), and strong
shareholder returns. As a result, the Company may from time to time raise capital from the
issuance of stock, debt or other capital securities. The issuance of common stock, debt or other
capital securities could result in the dilution of shareholder interests or reduced net income due
to additional interest expense.

On October 21, 2004, the Financial Services Authority (“FSA”), the Company’s primary regulator in
Japan, issued regulations concerning new reserving methodologies and Solvency Margin Ratio (“SMR”)
standards for variable annuity contracts. The regulations allow a “Standard” methodology and an
“Alternative” methodology to determine required reserve levels and SMR standards. On December 27,
2004, the FSA also issued administrative guidelines that describe the detailed requirements under
the two methodologies. The regulations became effective on April 1, 2005.

The new reserve methodologies and SMR standards only apply to capital requirements for Japanese
regulatory purposes, and are not directly related to results under accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States. The Company has decided to adopt the Standard methodology. It was
expected that the impact of adopting the Standard methodology, on the Company’s Japanese
operations, based on the Company’s assessment, could have required as much as $400 — $650 of
additional capital during 2005. During the third quarter of 2005, the Company received Connecticut
regulatory approval and consummated a transaction to reinsure guaranteed minimum income benefit
risk associated with the sale of variable annuities in Japan to Hartford Life and Annuity Insurance
Company, a U.S. subsidiary. This reinsurance strategy substantially eliminated the additional
capital requirement in Japan. The Company believes that optimization of its capital management
globally is a dynamic process. Therefore, management regularly evaluates its global capital
position and may make further adjustments using reinsurance, hedging and other strategies from time
to time.

As previously disclosed, the Company has been in the process of evaluating alternative capital
structures related to its Japanese life insurance operations that it believes in the long term
could result in improved financial flexibility. The Company’s Japanese life insurance operations
are conducted through Hartford Life Insurance K.K. (“HLIKK”), which, prior to September 1, 2005,
was a wholly owned subsidiary of Hartford Life and Accident Insurance Company (“HLA”), one of the
Company’s principal statutorily regulated operating subsidiaries. Prior to September 1, 2005, the
Company funded the capital needs of its Japanese operations through investments in the common stock
of HLIKK by HLA. This arrangement generally allowed some portion of the Company’s investment

in its Japanese operations to be included as part of the aggregate statutory capital (for the
purposes of regulatory and rating agency capital adequacy measures) of HLA.

During the second quarter of 2005, the Company sought and secured approval of a proposed plan to
change the ownership structure of HLIKK. The proposed plan provided for a change in the ownership
of HLIKK whereby the stock of HLIKK, an insurance operating company, would be transferred to
Hartford Life, Inc., HLA’s parent company. The proposed plan was approved by both the State of
Connecticut Insurance Department, HLA’s primary regulator, as well as the FSA, HLIKK’s primary
regulator. On September 1, 2005 this plan was executed and the stock of HLIKK was transferred from
HLA to Hartford Life, Inc. The transfer of the stock has been treated as a return of capital for
GAAP and statutory accounting purposes for the respective entities. This transaction had no effect
on the Company’s consolidated financial statements. The primary financial effect of the
transaction was to reduce the statutory capital of HLA by the amount of the carrying value of
HLIKK, which was $963 as of September 1, 2005. In addition, for certain capital adequacy ratios, a
corresponding reduction in required capital will occur, which will result in an improved capital
adequacy ratio. However, as previously disclosed, this action could potentially reduce certain
other capital adequacy ratios employed by regulators and rating agencies to assess the capital
growth of The Hartford’s life insurance operations. At the current time, taking into consideration
the effects of the transaction, the Company believes it has sufficient capital resources to
maintain capital solvency ratios consistent with all of its objectives.

The Company’s Board of Directors has authorized the repurchase of outstanding shares of its common
stock and equity units from time to time, in an aggregate amount not to exceed $1 billion. For
additional information regarding the Company’s authorization to repurchase its securities, please
see the “Stockholders’ Equity” section below.

HFSG and HLI are holding companies which rely upon operating cash flow in the form of dividends
from their subsidiaries, which enable them to service debt, pay dividends, and pay certain
business expenses.

Dividends to the Company from its insurance subsidiaries are restricted. The payment of dividends
by Connecticut-domiciled insurers is limited under the insurance holding company laws of
Connecticut. Under these laws, the insurance subsidiaries may only make their dividend payments
out of unassigned surplus. These laws require notice to and approval by the state insurance
commissioner for the declaration or payment of any dividend, which, together with other dividends
or distributions made within the preceding twelve months, exceeds the greater of (i) 10% of the
insurer’s policyholder surplus as of December 31 of the preceding year or (ii) net income (or net
gain from operations, if such company is a life insurance company) for the twelve-month period
ending on the thirty-first day of December last preceding, in each case determined under statutory
insurance accounting principles. In addition, if any dividend of a Connecticut-domiciled insurer
exceeds the insurer’s earned surplus, it requires the prior approval of the Connecticut Insurance
Commissioner. The insurance holding company laws of the other jurisdictions in which The
Hartford’s insurance subsidiaries are incorporated (or deemed commercially domiciled) generally
contain similar (although in certain instances somewhat more restrictive)



limitations on the payment of dividends. The Company’s insurance subsidiaries are permitted to pay
up to a maximum of approximately $1.9 billion in dividends to HFSG in 2006 without prior approval
from the applicable insurance commissioner. However, through August 31, 2006 HLA, comprising $667
of the $1.9 billion, will need prior approval from the insurance commissioner to pay dividends. In
2005, HFSG and HLI received a combined total of $1.9 billion
from their insurance subsidiaries, which
includes a $963 dividend of HLIKK to HLI.

The principal sources of operating funds are premium, fees and investment income, while investing
cash flows originate from maturities and sales of invested assets. The primary uses of funds are
to pay claims, policy benefits, operating expenses and commissions and to purchase new
investments. In addition, The Hartford has a policy of carrying a significant short-term
investment position and accordingly does not anticipate selling intermediate- and long-term fixed
maturity investments to meet any liquidity needs. (For a discussion of the Company’s investment
objectives and strategies, see the Investments and Capital Markets Risk Management sections.)

Sources of Liquidity

Shelf Registrations

On December 3, 2003, The Hartford’s shelf registration statement (Registration No. 333-108067) for
the potential offering and sale of debt and equity securities in an aggregate amount of up to $3.0
billion was declared effective by the Securities and Exchange Commission. The Registration
Statement allows for the following types of securities to be offered: (i) debt securities,
preferred stock, common stock, depositary shares, warrants, stock purchase contracts, stock
purchase units and junior subordinated deferrable interest debentures of the Company, and (ii)
preferred securities of any of one or more capital trusts organized by The Hartford (“The Hartford
Trusts”). The Company may enter into guarantees with respect to the preferred securities of any
of The Hartford Trusts. As of December 31, 2005, the Company had $2.4 billion remaining on its
shelf.

On May 15, 2001, HLI filed with the SEC a shelf registration statement (Registration No.
333-60944) for the potential offering and sale of up to $1.0 billion in debt and preferred
securities. The registration statement was declared effective on May 29, 2001. As of December
31, 2005, HLI had $1.0 billion remaining on its shelf.

[1] Replaced by $1.6 billion Five-Year Competitive Advance and Revolving Credit Facility
Agreement on September 7, 2005. For further information, see below.

On September 7, 2005, The Hartford and HLI entered into a $1.6 billion Five-Year Competitive
Advance and Revolving Credit Facility Agreement (the “Credit Agreement”) with a syndicate of
financial institutions. The Credit Agreement replaced (i) The Hartford’s $1.0 billion Second
Amended and Restated Five-Year Competitive Advance and Revolving Credit Facility Agreement dated as
of February 26, 2003, as amended, and (ii) The Hartford’s and HLI’s $490 Three-Year Competitive
Advance and Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, dated as of December 31, 2002, as amended.

The Credit Agreement provides for up to $1.6 billion of unsecured credit. Of the total availability
under the Credit Agreement, up to $250 is available to support borrowing by HLI alone, and up to
$100 is available to support letters of credit issued on behalf of The Hartford, HLI or other
subsidiaries of The Hartford.

As of December 31, 2005, the Company’s Japanese operation has a ¥2.0 billion yen, approximately $17,
line of credit with a Japanese bank with no outstanding borrowings
under this facility.

Under the revolving credit facility, the Company must maintain a minimum level of consolidated
statutory surplus. In addition, the Company must not exceed a maximum ratio of debt to
capitalization. Quarterly, the Company certifies compliance with the financial covenants for its
banks. As of December 31, 2005, the Company was in compliance with all such covenants.



Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Aggregate Contractual Obligations

The Company does not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that are reasonably likely to have a
material effect on the financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, or capital resources
of the Company, except for the following:

•

The Company has outstanding forward purchase contracts associated with the Company’s equity
units under which the Company will issue between 17.8 and 22.2 million shares of common stock,
depending on the stock price on the date of issuance, and receive proceeds of approximately $1.02
billion in 2006. See further disclosure in Notes 2 and 14 of Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements.

•

The Company has unfunded commitments to purchase investments in limited partnerships and
mortgage loans totaling $754 as disclosed in Note 12 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

[1] The following points are significant to understanding the cash flows estimated for
obligations under property and casualty contracts:

•

Reserves for Property & Casualty unpaid claim and claim adjustment expenses include case
reserves for reported claims and reserves for claims incurred but not reported (IBNR). While
payments due on claim reserves are considered contractual obligations because they relate to
insurance policies issued by the Company, the ultimate amount to be paid to settle both case
reserves and IBNR is an estimate, subject to significant uncertainty. The actual amount to be paid
is not determined until the Company reaches a settlement with the claimant. Final claim
settlements may vary significantly from the present estimates, particularly since many claims will
not be settled until well into the future.

•

In estimating the timing of future payments by year, the Company has assumed that its
historical payment patterns will continue. However, the actual timing of future payments will
likely vary materially from these estimates due to, among other things, changes in claim reporting
and payment patterns and large unanticipated settlements. In particular, there is significant
uncertainty over the claim payment patterns of asbestos and environmental claims. Also, estimated
payments in 2006 do not include payments that will be made on claims incurred in 2006 on policies
that were in force as of December 31, 2005. In addition, the table does not include future cash
flows related to the receipt of premiums that will be used, in part, to fund loss payments.

•

Under generally accepted accounting principles, the Company is only permitted to discount
reserves for claim and claim adjustment expenses in cases where the payment pattern and ultimate
loss costs are fixed and reliably determinable on an individual claim basis. For the Company, these
include claim settlements with permanently disabled claimants and certain structured settlement
contracts that fund loss runoffs for unrelated parties. As of December 31, 2005, the total
property and casualty reserves in the above table of $22,874 are gross of the reserve discount of
$608.

[2] Estimated life, annuity and disability obligations include death and disability claims, policy
surrenders, policyholder dividends and trail commissions offset by expected future deposits and
premiums on in-force contracts. Estimated contractual policyholder obligations are based on
mortality, morbidity and lapse assumptions comparable with Life’s historical experience, modified
for recent observed trends. Life has also assumed market growth and interest crediting consistent
with assumptions used in amortizing deferred acquisition costs. In contrast to this table, the
majority of Life’s obligations are recorded on the balance sheet at the current account values and
do not incorporate an expectation of future market growth, interest crediting, or future deposits.
Therefore, the estimated contractual policyholder obligations presented in this table significantly
exceed the liabilities recorded in reserve for future policy benefits and unpaid claims and claim
adjustment expenses, other policyholder funds and benefits payable and separate account
liabilities. Due to the significance of the assumptions used, the amounts presented could
materially differ from actual results. As separate account obligations are legally insulated from
general account obligations, the separate account obligations will be fully funded by cash flows
from separate account assets. Life expects to fully fund the general account obligations from cash
flows from general account investments and future deposits and
premiums.

[3] Includes contractual principal and interest payments. Payments exclude amounts associated with
fair-value hedges of certain of the Company’s long-term debt. All long-term debt obligations have
fixed rates of interest. Long-term debt obligations also includes principal and interest payments
of $700 and $2.4 billion, respectively, related to junior subordinated debentures which are
callable beginning in 2006. See Note 14 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for
additional discussion of long-term debt obligations.

[4]
Includes $1.3 billion in commitments to purchase investments
including $366 of limited
partnerships and $388 of mortgage loans. Outstanding commitments under these limited partnerships
and mortgage loans are included in payments due in less than 1 year since the timing of funding
these commitments cannot be estimated. The remaining $520 relates to payables for securities
purchased which are reflected on the Company’s consolidated
balance sheet.

[5] As of December 31, 2005, the Company has accepted cash collateral of $1.2 billion in connection
with the Company’s securities lending program and derivative instruments. Since the timing of the
return of the collateral is uncertain, the return of the collateral has been included in the
payments due in less than 1 year.

[6] Includes $42 in collateralized loan obligations (“CLOs”) issued to third-party investors by
consolidated investment management entities sponsored by the Company in connection with synthetic
CLO transactions. The CLO investors have no recourse to the Company’s assets other than the
dedicated assets collateralizing the CLOs. Refer to Note 4 of Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements for additional discussion of CLOs.

[7] Does not include estimated voluntary contribution of $200 to the Company’s pension plan in
2006.



Pension Plans and Other Postretirement Benefits

The Company made contributions to its pension plans of $504, $317 and $306 in 2005, 2004 and 2003,
respectively. The Company’s 2005 required minimum funding contribution was immaterial. The
Company presently anticipates contributing approximately $200 to its pension plans in 2006, based
upon certain economic and business assumptions. These assumptions include, but are not limited to,
equity market performance, changes in interest rates and the Company’s other capital requirements.
The Company’s 2006 required minimum funding contribution is expected to be immaterial.

Pension expense reflected in the Company’s net income was $137, $104 and $120 in 2005, 2004 and
2003, respectively. The Company estimates its 2006 pension expense will be approximately $147,
based on current assumptions.

As provided for under SFAS No. 87, the Company uses a five-year averaging method to determine the
market-related value of Plan assets, which is used to determine the expected return component of
pension expense. Under this methodology, asset gains/losses that result from returns that differ
from the Company’s long-term rate of return assumption are recognized in the market-related value
of assets on a level basis over a five year period. The difference in actual asset returns for the
Plan of $176 and $289 for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively, as compared to
expected returns of $221 and $201 for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively will
be fully reflected in the market-related value of Plan assets over the next five years using the
methodology described above. The level of unrecognized net losses continues to exceed the
allowable amortization corridor as defined under SFAS No. 87. Based on the 5.50% discount rate
selected as of December 31, 2005 and taking into account estimated future minimum funding, the
difference between actual and expected performance in 2005 will increase annual pension expense in
future years. The increase in pension expense will be approximately $2 in 2006 and will increase
ratably to an increase of approximately $8 in 2010.

Capitalization

Includes junior subordinated debentures of $691 and $704 and debt associated with
equity units of $1,020 and $1,020 as of December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively.

The Hartford’s total capitalization increased $925 as of December 31, 2005 as compared with
December 31, 2004. This increase was due to a $1.1 billion increase in equity partially offset by a
$162 decrease in debt. The increase in total stockholders’ equity is primarily due to net income
of $2.3 billion, partially offset by other comprehensive loss of $1.3 billion and repayments of debt
of $250.

In 2006, the Company’s equity unit notes will be remarketed and the underlying stock purchase
agreements will be exercised. For additional information regarding this remarketing, see Note 14
of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Debt

The following discussion describes the Company’s debt financing activities for 2005.

In December 2005, the Company issued $100 of commercial paper and used the proceeds, together with
other sources, to fund a $300 contribution to its defined benefit plan.

On June 15, 2005, HLI repaid $250 of 7.75% senior notes at maturity.

For additional information regarding debt, see Note 14 of Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements.

Stockholders’ Equity

Dividends

— On February 16, 2006, The Hartford’s Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend
of $0.40 per share payable on April 3, 2006 to shareholders of record as of March 1, 2006.

On October 20, 2005, The Hartford declared a dividend on its common stock of $0.30 per share
payable on January 3, 2006 to shareholders of record as of December 1, 2005.

The Hartford declared $350 and paid $345 in dividends to shareholders in 2005, declared $331 and
paid $325 in dividends to shareholders in 2004 and declared $300 and paid $291 in dividends to
shareholders in 2003.



Rights Agreement –

Pursuant to the terms of the Rights Agreement dated as of November 1, 1995
between The Hartford and The Bank of New York as Rights Agent, the shareholders’ rights associated
with The Hartford’s common stock expired on November 1, 2005.

AOCI

- AOCI decreased by $1.3 billion as of December 31, 2005 compared with December 31, 2004.
The decrease in AOCI is primarily due to the other comprehensive loss from change in unrealized
gain/loss on fixed maturities available-for-sale and minimum pension adjustment.

The funded status of the Company’s pension and postretirement plans is dependent upon many
factors, including returns on invested assets and the level of market interest rates. Declines in
the value of securities traded in equity markets coupled with declines in long-term interest rates
have had a negative impact on the funded status of the plans. As a result, the Company recorded a
minimum pension liability as of December 31, 2005, and 2004, which resulted in an after-tax
reduction of stockholders’ equity of $620 and $480 respectively. This minimum pension liability
did not affect the Company’s results of operations.

For additional information on stockholders’ equity and AOCI see Notes 15 and 16, respectively, of
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

2005 Compared to 2004 —

The increase in cash from operating activities was primarily the
result of the funding of $1.15 billion in settlement of the MacArthur litigation in 2004 and
increased net income as compared to the prior year period. Cash provided by financing activities
increased primarily due to higher net receipts from policyholder’s accounts related to investment
and universal life contracts and increased proceeds from stock option exercises in 2005 as compared
to the prior year period. Also contributing to the increase in cash provided by financing
activities was a decrease in debt repayments in 2005 as compared to the prior year period. Net
purchases of available-for-sale securities accounted for the majority of cash used for investing
activities.

2004 Compared to 2003 —

Cash from operating activities primarily reflects premium cash flows in
excess of claim payments. The decrease in cash provided by operating activities was due primarily
to the $1.15 billion settlement of the MacArthur litigation in 2004. Cash provided by financing
activities decreased primarily due to lower proceeds from investment and universal life-type
contracts as a result of the adoption of SOP 03-1, decreased capital raising activities, repayment
of commercial paper and early retirement of junior subordinated debentures in 2004. The decrease
in cash from financing activities and operating cash flows invested long-term accounted for the
majority of the change in cash used for investing activities.

Operating cash flows in each of the last three years have been adequate to meet liquidity
requirements.

Ratings

Ratings are an important factor in establishing the competitive position in the insurance and
financial services marketplace. There can be no assurance that the Company’s ratings will continue
for any given period of time or that they will not be changed. In the event the Company’s ratings
are downgraded, the level of revenues or the persistency of the Company’s business may be adversely
impacted.

These ratings are not a recommendation to buy or hold any of The Hartford’s securities and
they may be revised or revoked at any time at the sole discretion of the rating organization.

The agencies consider many factors in determining the final rating of an insurance company. One
consideration is the relative level of statutory surplus necessary to support the business written.
Statutory surplus represents the capital of the insurance company reported in accordance with
accounting practices prescribed by the applicable state insurance department.

The table below sets forth statutory surplus for the Company’s insurance companies.

Risk-based Capital

The National Association of Insurance Commissioners (“NAIC”) has regulations establishing minimum
capitalization requirements based on risk-based capital (“RBC”) formulas for both life and
property and casualty companies. The requirements consist of formulas, which identify companies
that are undercapitalized and require specific regulatory actions. The RBC formula for life
companies establishes capital requirements relating to insurance, business, asset and interest
rate risks. RBC is calculated for property and casualty companies after adjusting capital for
certain underwriting, asset, credit and off-balance sheet risks. As of December 31, 2005, each of
The Hartford’s insurance subsidiaries within Life and Ongoing Property & Casualty had more than
sufficient capital to meet the NAIC’s minimum RBC requirements.

NAIC Developments

Changes to the NAIC RBC Requirements for Variable Annuities with Guarantees – C-3 Phase II Capital

On October 14, 2005 the Executive Committee of the NAIC formally adopted the provisions of the C-3
Phase II Capital project with an effective date of December 31, 2005 for NAIC RBC purposes.

The C-3 Phase II Capital project addresses the equity, interest rate and expense recovery risks
associated with variable annuities and group annuities that contain death benefits or certain
living benefit guarantees including GMWBs. The capital requirements under C-3 Phase II are
principle-based, which represents a change from the current factor-based approach. Under the new
methodology, capital requirements are determined at a point in time using stochastic scenario
testing and give credit for risk management strategies employed such as hedging and reinsurance.
The Company expects the capital requirements to fluctuate primarily with changes in market levels
and returns.

As of December 31, 2005 the implementation of C-3 Phase II Capital requirements had a positive
impact on The Hartford’s life insurance companies’ NAIC RBC ratio.



Contingencies

Legal Proceedings

– For a discussion regarding contingencies related to The Hartford’s legal
proceedings, please see Item 3, “Legal Proceedings”.

Dependence on Certain Third Party Relationships

–

The Company distributes its annuity, life and
certain property and casualty insurance products through a variety of distribution channels,
including broker-dealers, banks, wholesalers, its own internal sales force and other third party
organizations. The Company periodically negotiates provisions and renewals of these relationships
and there can be no assurance that such terms will remain acceptable to the Company or such third
parties. An interruption in the Company’s continuing relationship with certain of these third
parties could materially affect the Company’s ability to market its products.

For a discussion regarding contingencies related to the manner in which The Hartford compensates
brokers and other producers, please see “Overview—Broker Compensation” above.

Regulatory Developments

– For a discussion regarding contingencies related to regulatory
developments that affect The Hartford, please see “Overview—Regulatory Developments” above.

Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of 2002

On December 22, 2005, the President signed the Terrorism Risk Insurance Extension Act of 2005
(“TRIEA”) extending the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of 2002 (“TRIA”) through the end of 2007.
TRIA provides a backstop for insurance-related losses resulting from any “act of terrorism”
certified by the Secretary of the Treasury, in concurrence with the Secretary of State and Attorney
General, that result in industry losses in excess of $50 in 2006 and $100 in 2007. Under the
program, the federal government would pay 90% of covered losses from a certified act of terrorism
in 2006 after an insurer’s losses exceed 17.5% of the Company’s eligible direct commercial earned
premiums in 2005, up to a combined annual aggregate limit for the federal government and all
insurers of $100 billion. In 2007, the federal government would pay 85% of covered losses from a
certified act of terrorism after an insurer’s losses exceed 20% of the Company’s eligible direct
commercial earned premiums in 2006, up to a combined annual aggregate limit for the federal
government and all insurers of $100 billion. If an act of terrorism or acts of terrorism result in
covered losses exceeding the $100 billion annual limit, insurers with losses exceeding their
deductibles will not be responsible for additional losses.

TRIA requires all property and casualty insurers, including The Hartford, to make terrorism
insurance available in all of their covered commercial property and casualty insurance policies (as
defined in TRIA and amended in TRIEA). TRIA applies to a significant portion of The Hartford’s
commercial property and casualty contracts, but it specifically excludes some of The Hartford’s
other insurance business, including commercial auto, surety, burglary and theft, farm owners
multi-peril, professional liability, livestock insurance, reinsurance and personal lines business.
TRIA also does not apply to group life insurance contracts.

TRIA is scheduled to expire on December 31, 2007. In the event terrorism reinsurance legislation
is not extended or renewed after December 2007, the Company may attempt to limit certain of its
writings or obtain supplemental reinsurance protection, if available. For a discussion of The
Hartford’s Risk Management processes as they relate to terrorism reinsurance legislation, please
see the “Property & Casualty—Risk Management Strategy” section of Management’s Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.

Legislative Initiatives

On May 26, 2005, the Senate Judiciary Committee approved legislation that provides for the creation
of a Federal asbestos trust fund in place of the current tort system for determining asbestos
liabilities. On February 6, 2006, the Senate began consideration of S. 852, “The Fairness in
Asbestos Injury Resolution Act of 2005”. However, the proponents were unable to secure the sixty
votes necessary to overcome a procedural budget objection. The prospects for enactment
and the ultimate details of any legislation creating a Federal asbestos trust fund remain very
uncertain. Depending on the provisions of any legislation which is ultimately enacted, the
legislation may have a material adverse effect on the Company.

Legislation introduced in Congress would provide for new retirement and savings vehicles designed
to simplify retirement plan administration and expand individual participation in retirement
savings plans. If enacted, these proposals could have a material effect on sales of the Company’s
life insurance and investment products. Prospects for enactment of this legislation in 2006 are
uncertain.

In addition, other tax proposals and regulatory initiatives which have been or are being considered
by Congress could have a material effect on the insurance business. These proposals and
initiatives include changes pertaining to the tax treatment of insurance companies and life
insurance products and annuities, repeal or reform of the estate tax and comprehensive federal tax
reform. The nature and timing of any Congressional action with respect to these efforts is unclear.

Congress is considering provisions regarding age discrimination in defined benefit plans,
transition relief for older and longer service workers affected by changes to traditional defined
benefit pension plans and the replacement of the interest rate used to determine pension plan
funding requirements. These changes could affect the Company’s pension plan.

Guaranty Fund and Other Insurance-related Assessments

In all states, insurers licensed to transact certain classes of insurance are required to become
members of a guaranty fund. In most states, in the event of the insolvency of an insurer writing
any such class of insurance in the state, members of the funds are assessed to



pay certain claims of the insolvent insurer. A particular state’s fund assesses its members based
on their respective written premiums in the state for the classes of insurance in which the
insolvent insurer was engaged. Assessments are generally limited for any year to one or two
percent of premiums written per year depending on the state. Such assessments paid by The Hartford
approximated $46 in 2005, $26 in 2004 and $26 in 2003.

The Hartford accounts for guaranty fund and other insurance assessments in accordance with
Statement of Position No. 97-3, “Accounting by Insurance and Other Enterprises for
Insurance-Related Assessments”. Liabilities for guaranty fund and other insurance-related
assessments are accrued when an assessment is probable, when it can be reasonably estimated, and
when the event obligating the Company to pay an imposed or probable assessment has occurred.
Liabilities for guaranty funds and other insurance-related assessments are not discounted and are
included as part of other liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of December 31, 2005
and 2004, the liability balance was $223 and $215, respectively. As of December 31, 2005 and 2004,
$20 and $14, respectively, related to premium tax offsets were included in other assets.

Item 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures

The Company’s principal executive officer and its principal financial officer, based on their
evaluation of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rule
13a-15(e)), have concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures are effective for
the purposes set forth in the definition thereof in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(e) as of December 31,
2005.

Management’s annual report on internal control over financial reporting

The management of The Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc. and its subsidiaries (“The Hartford”)
is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting
for The Hartford as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable
assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial
statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes policies and
procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and
fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide
reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, and
that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations
of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding
prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the company’s
assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or
detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are
subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that
the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

The Hartford’s management assessed its internal controls over financial reporting as of December
31, 2005 in relation to criteria for effective internal control over financial reporting described
in “Internal Control – Integrated Framework” issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of
the Treadway Commission. Based on this assessment under those criteria, The Hartford’s management
concluded that its internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2005.

Attestation report of the Company’s registered public accounting firm

The Hartford’s independent registered public accounting firm, Deloitte & Touche LLP, has issued
their attestation report on management’s assessment of internal control over financial reporting
which is set forth below.



REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of

The Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc.

Hartford, Connecticut

We have audited management’s assessment, included in the accompanying Management’s Annual Report on
Internal Control Over Financial Reporting, that The Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc. and its
subsidiaries (collectively, the “Company”) maintained effective internal control over financial
reporting as of December 31, 2005, based on the criteria established in

Internal Control—Integrated
Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. The
Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial
reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting.
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on management’s assessment and an opinion on the
effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was
maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal
control over financial reporting, evaluating management’s assessment, testing and evaluating the
design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing such other procedures as we
considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis
for our opinions.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the
supervision of, the company’s principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons
performing similar functions, and effected by the company’s board of directors, management, and
other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting
and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes
those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable
detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit
preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles,
and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with
authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance
regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the
possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to
error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Also, projections of any
evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods
are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions,
or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, management’s assessment that the Company maintained effective internal control over
financial reporting as of December 31, 2005, is fairly stated, in all material respects, based on
the criteria established in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained,
in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31,
2005, based on the criteria established in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

issued by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States), the consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedules as
of and for the year ended December 31, 2005 of the Company, and our report, dated February 22, 2006
expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements and financial statement schedules.

DELOITTE & TOUCHE LLP

Hartford, Connecticut

February 22, 2006



Changes in internal control over financial reporting

There was no change in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during
the Company’s fourth fiscal quarter of 2005 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely
to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.

Item 9B. Other Information

None.

subject to such awards (or the relevant portion thereof) shall be available for award under the
2005 Stock Plan and such shares shall be added to the total number of shares available under the

Summary Description of the 2000 PLANCO Non-Employee Option Plan

The Company’s Board of Directors adopted the PLANCO Plan on July 20, 2000, and amended it on
February 20, 2003 to increase the number of shares of the Company’s common stock subject to the
plan to 450,000 shares. The stockholders of the Company have not approved the PLANCO Plan. No
awards have been issued under the PLANCO Plan since 2003.

Eligibility – Any non-employee independent contractor serving on the wholesale sales force as an
insurance agent who is an exclusive agent of the Company or who derives more than 50% of his or her
annual income from the Company is eligible.

Terms of options – Nonqualified stock options (“NQSOs”) to purchase shares of common stock are
available for grant under the PLANCO Plan. The administrator of the PLANCO Plan, the Compensation
and Personnel Committee, (i) determines the recipients of options under the PLANCO Plan, (ii)
determines the number of shares of common stock covered by such options, (iii) determines the dates
and the manner in which options become exercisable (which is typically in three equal annual
installments beginning on the first anniversary of the date of grant), (iv) sets the exercise price
of options (which may be less than, equal to or greater than the fair market value of common stock
on the date of grant) and (v) determines the other terms and conditions of each option. Payment of
the exercise



price may be made in cash, other shares of the Company’s common stock or through a same day sale
program. The term of an NQSO may not exceed ten years and two days from the date of grant.

If an optionee’s required relationship with the Company terminates for any reason, other than for
cause, any exercisable options remain exercisable for a fixed period of four months, not to exceed
the remainder of the option’s term. Any options that are not exercisable at the time of such
termination are cancelled on the date of such termination. If the optionee’s required relationship
is terminated for cause, the options are canceled immediately.

Acceleration in Connection with a Change in Control – Upon the occurrence of a change in control,
each option outstanding on the date of such change in control, and which is not then fully vested
and exercisable, shall immediately vest and become exercisable. In general, a “Change in Control”
will be deemed to have occurred upon the acquisition of 20% or more of the outstanding voting stock
of the Company, a tender or exchange offer to acquire 15% or more of the outstanding voting stock
of the Company, certain mergers or corporate transactions resulting in the shareholders of the
Company before the transactions owning less than 55% of the entity surviving the transactions,
certain transactions involving a transfer of substantially all of the Company’s assets or a change
in greater than 50% of the Board members over a two year period. See Note 18 of Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of the 2005 Stock Plan and the ESPP.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of

The Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc.

Hartford, Connecticut

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of The Hartford Financial Services
Group, Inc

.

and its subsidiaries (collectively, the “Company”) as of December 31, 2005 and 2004,
and the related consolidated statements of operations, changes in stockholders’ equity,
comprehensive income, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31,
2005. Our audits also included the financial statement schedules listed in the Index at Item 15.
These financial statements and financial statement schedules are the responsibility of the
Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements
and financial statement schedules based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An
audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the
financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects,
the financial position of The Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc

.

and its subsidiaries as of
December 31, 2005 and 2004, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of
the three years in the period ended December 31, 2005, in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America. Also, in our opinion, such financial statement
schedules, when considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as a
whole, present fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein.

As discussed in Note 1 of the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed its method of
accounting and reporting for certain nontraditional long-duration contracts and for separate
accounts in 2004.

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States), the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting
as of December 31, 2005, based on the criteria established in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, and our report
dated February 22, 2006 expressed an unqualified opinion on management’s assessment of the
effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting and an unqualified opinion
on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.

THE HARTFORD FINANCIAL SERVICES GROUP, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(Dollar amounts in millions, except for per share data, unless otherwise stated)

1. Basis of Presentation and Accounting Policies

Basis of Presentation

The Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc. is a financial holding company for a group of
subsidiaries that provide investment products and life and property and casualty insurance to both
individual and business customers in the United States and internationally (collectively, “The
Hartford” or the “Company”).

The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the basis of accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America, which differ materially from the accounting
practices prescribed by various insurance regulatory authorities.

Consolidation

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of The Hartford Financial Services
Group, Inc., companies in which the Company directly or indirectly has a controlling financial
interest and those variable interest entities in which the Company is the primary beneficiary.
Entities in which The Hartford does not have a controlling financial interest but in which the
Company has significant influence over the operating and financing decisions are reported using the
equity method. All material intercompany transactions and balances between The Hartford and its
subsidiaries and affiliates have been eliminated.

In 2004, the Company sponsored and purchased an investment interest in a synthetic collateralized
loan obligation transaction, a variable interest entity for which the Company determined itself to
be the primary beneficiary. Accordingly, the assets, liabilities and results of operations of the
entity are included in the Company’s consolidated financial statements. In 2005, the Company
entered into a similar transaction and consolidated an additional variable interest entity. For
further discussion of the synthetic collateralized loan transactions see Note 4.

On December 31, 2003, the Company acquired the group life and accident, and short-term and
long-term disability business of CNA Financial Corporation. Revenues and expenses of this acquired
business are included in the Company’s results of operations subsequent to December 31, 2003. For
further discussion of the CNA Financial Corporation acquisition, see Note 20.

Use of Estimates

The preparation of financial statements, in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America, requires management to make estimates and assumptions
that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and
liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and
expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

The most significant estimates include those used in determining property and casualty reserves for
unpaid claims and claim adjustment expenses, net of reinsurance; Life deferred policy acquisition
costs and present value of future profits associated with variable annuity and other universal
life-type contracts; the evaluation of other-than-temporary impairments on investments in
available-for-sale securities; the valuation of guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefit derivatives;
pension and other postretirement benefit obligations; and contingencies relating to corporate
litigation and regulatory matters.

Reclassifications

Certain reclassifications have been made to prior year financial information to conform to the
current year presentation. The Company reclassified amounts assessed against certain
contractholder balances in 2004 from net investment income to fee income.

Adoption of New Accounting Standards

In March 2004, the Emerging Issues Task Force (“EITF”) reached a consensus on EITF Issue No. 03-1,
“The Meaning of Other-Than-Temporary Impairment and Its Application to Certain Investments” (“EITF
Issue No. 03-1”). EITF Issue No. 03-1 provided a model for determining when unrealized holding
losses on debt and equity securities should be deemed other-than-temporary impairments and the
impairments recognized as realized losses. In addition, EITF Issue No. 03-1 provided clarified
guidance on the subsequent accounting for debt securities that are other-than-temporarily impaired
and established certain disclosure requirements regarding investments in an unrealized loss
position. The disclosure requirements were retroactively effective for the year ended December 31,
2003, and are included in Note 4 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The Financial
Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) subsequently voted to delay the implementation of the other
provisions of EITF Issue No. 03-1 in order to redeliberate certain aspects.

In November 2005, the FASB released FASB Staff Position Nos. FAS 115-1 and FAS 124-1, “The Meaning
of Other-Than-Temporary Impairment and Its Application to Certain Investments” (“FSP 115-1”), which
effectively replaces EITF Issue No. 03-1. FSP 115-1 contains a three-step model for evaluating
impairments and carries forward the disclosure requirements in EITF Issue No. 03-1 pertaining to
securities in an unrealized loss position. Under the model, any security in an unrealized loss
position is considered impaired; an evaluation is made to determine whether the impairment is
other-than-temporary; and, if an impairment is considered

F-7


NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)

1.

Basis of Presentation and Accounting Policies (continued)

other-than-temporary, a realized loss is recognized to write the security’s cost or amortized
cost basis down to fair value. FSP 115-1 references existing other-than-temporary impairment
guidance for determining when an impairment is other-than-temporary and clarifies that subsequent
to the recognition of an other-than-temporary impairment loss for debt securities, an investor
shall account for the security using the constant effective yield method. FSP 115-1 is effective
for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2005, with earlier application permitted. The
Company adopted FSP 115-1 upon issuance. The adoption did not have a material effect on the
Company’s consolidated financial condition or results of operations.

In July 2003, the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (“AICPA”) issued Statement of
Position (“SOP”) 03-1, “Accounting and Reporting by Insurance Enterprises for Certain
Nontraditional Long-Duration Contracts and for Separate Accounts” (“SOP 03-1”). SOP 03-1 addresses
a wide variety of topics, some of which have a significant impact on the Company. The major
provisions of SOP 03-1 require:

•

Recognizing expenses for a variety of contracts and
contract features, including guaranteed minimum death
benefits (“GMDB”), certain death benefits on universal-life
type contracts and annuitization options, on an accrual basis
versus the previous method of recognition upon payment;

•

Reporting and measuring assets and liabilities of
certain separate account products as general account assets
and liabilities when specified criteria are not met;

•

Reporting and measuring the Company’s interest in its
separate accounts as general account assets based on the
insurer’s proportionate beneficial interest in the separate
account’s underlying assets; and

•

Capitalizing sales inducements that meet specified
criteria and amortizing such amounts over the life of the

In May 2003, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No. 150,
“Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Characteristics of both Liabilities and Equity”
(“SFAS 150”). SFAS 150 establishes standards for classifying and measuring as liabilities certain
financial instruments that embody obligations of the issuer and have characteristics of both
liabilities and equity. Generally, SFAS 150 requires liability classification for two broad
classes of financial instruments: (a) instruments that represent, or are indexed to, an obligation
to buy back the issuer’s shares regardless of whether the instrument is settled on a net-cash or
gross-physical basis and (b) obligations that (i) can be settled in shares but derive their value
predominately from another underlying instrument or index (e.g. security prices, interest rates,
and currency rates), (ii) have a fixed value, or (iii) have a value inversely related to the
issuer’s shares. Mandatorily redeemable equity and written options requiring the issuer to buyback
shares are examples of financial instruments that should be reported as liabilities under this new
guidance. SFAS 150 specifies accounting only for certain freestanding financial instruments and
does not affect whether an embedded derivative must be bifurcated and accounted for separately.
SFAS 150 was effective for instruments entered into or modified after May 31, 2003 and for all
other instruments beginning with the first interim reporting period beginning after June 15, 2003.
Adoption of this statement did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial
condition or results of operations.

In January 2003, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 46, “Consolidation of Variable Interest
Entities, an interpretation of ARB No. 51” (“FIN 46”), which required an enterprise to assess
whether consolidation of an entity is appropriate based upon its interests in a variable interest
entity (“VIE”). A VIE is an entity in which the equity investors do not have the characteristics
of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to
finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties. The
initial determination of whether an entity is a VIE shall be made on the date at which an
enterprise becomes involved with the entity. An enterprise shall consolidate a VIE if it has a
variable interest that will absorb a majority of the VIEs expected losses if they occur, receive a
majority of the entity’s expected residual returns if they occur or both. FIN 46 was effective
immediately for new VIEs established or purchased subsequent to January 31, 2003. For VIEs
established or purchased subsequent to January 31, 2003, the adoption of FIN 46 did not have a
material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial condition or results of operations as there
were no material VIEs which required consolidation.

In December 2003, the FASB issued a revised version of FIN 46 (“FIN 46R”), which incorporated a
number of modifications and changes made to the original version. FIN 46R replaced the previously
issued FIN 46 and, subject to certain special provisions, was effective no later than the end of
the first reporting period that ends after December 15, 2003 for entities considered to be
special-purpose entities and no later than the end of the first reporting period that ends after
March 15, 2004 for all other VIEs. Early

adoption was permitted. The Company adopted FIN 46R in the fourth quarter of 2003. The
adoption of FIN 46R did not result in the consolidation of any material VIEs but resulted in the
deconsolidation of VIEs that issued Mandatorily Redeemable Preferred Securities of Subsidiary
Trusts (“trust preferred securities”). The Company is not the primary beneficiary of the VIEs,
which issued the trust preferred securities. The Company does not own any of the trust preferred
securities which were issued to unrelated third parties. These trust preferred securities are
considered the principal variable interests issued by the VIEs. As a result, the VIEs, which the
Company previously consolidated, are no longer consolidated. The sole assets of the VIEs are
junior subordinated debentures issued by the Company with payment terms identical to the trust
preferred securities. Previously, the trust preferred securities were reported as a separate
liability on the Company’s consolidated balance sheets as “company obligated mandatorily redeemable
preferred securities of subsidiary trusts holding solely junior subordinated debentures”.

Future Adoption of New Accounting Standards

In February 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 155, “Accounting for Certain Hybrid Financial
Instruments—an amendment of FASB Statements No. 133 and 140” (“SFAS 155”). This statement amends
SFAS No. 133, “Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities” (“SFAS 133”), and SFAS
No. 140, “Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of
Liabilities” and resolves issues addressed in SFAS 133 Implementation Issue No. D1, “Application of
Statement 133 to Beneficial Interest in Securitized Financial Assets”. This Statement: (a) permits
fair value remeasurement for any hybrid financial instrument that contains an embedded derivative
that otherwise would require bifurcation; (b) clarifies which interest-only strips and
principal-only strips are not subject to the requirements of SFAS 133; (c) establishes a
requirement to evaluate beneficial interests in securitized financial assets to identify interests
that are freestanding derivatives or that are hybrid financial instruments that contain an embedded
derivative requiring bifurcation; (d) clarifies that concentrations of credit risk in the form of
subordination are not embedded derivatives; and, (e) eliminates restrictions on a qualifying
special-purpose entity’s ability to hold passive derivative financial instruments that pertain to
beneficial interests that are or contain a derivative financial instrument. The standard also
requires presentation within the financial statements that identifies those hybrid financial
instruments for which the fair value election has been applied and information on the income
statement impact of the changes in fair value of those instruments. The Company is required to
apply SFAS 155 to all financial instruments acquired, issued or subject to a remeasurement event
beginning January 1, 2007 although early adoption is permitted as of the beginning of an entity’s
fiscal year. The provisions of SFAS 155 are not expected to have an impact recorded at adoption;
however, the standard could affect the future income recognition for securitized financial assets
because there may be more embedded derivatives identified with changes in fair value recognized in
net income.

In September 2005, the AICPA issued Statement of Position 05-1, “Accounting by Insurance
Enterprises for Deferred Acquisition Costs (“DAC”) in Connection with Modifications or Exchanges of
Insurance Contracts”, (“SOP 05-1”). SOP 05-1 provides guidance on accounting by insurance
enterprises for DAC on internal replacements of insurance and investment contracts. An internal
replacement is a modification in product benefits, features, rights or coverages that occurs by the
exchange of a contract for a new contract, or by amendment, endorsement, or rider to a contract, or
by the election of a feature or coverage within a contract. Modifications that result in a
replacement contract that is substantially changed from the replaced contract should be accounted
for as an extinguishment of the replaced contract. Unamortized DAC, unearned revenue liabilities
and deferred sales inducements from the replaced contract must be written-off. Modifications that
result in a contract that is substantially unchanged from the replaced contract should be accounted
for as a continuation of the replaced contract. SOP 05-1 is effective for internal replacements
occurring in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006, with earlier adoption encouraged.
Initial application of SOP 05-1 should be as of the beginning of the entity’s fiscal year. The
Company is expected to adopt SOP 05-1 effective January 1, 2007. Adoption of this statement is
expected to have an impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements; however, the impact
has not yet been determined.

In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004), “Share-Based Payment” (“SFAS 123R”),
which replaces SFAS No. 123, “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation” (“SFAS 123”) and supercedes
APB Opinion No. 25, “Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees”. SFAS 123R requires all companies
to recognize compensation costs for share-based payments to employees based on the grant-date fair
value of the award for financial statements for reporting periods beginning after June 15, 2005.
In April 2005, the Securities and Exchange Commission deferred the required effective date for
adoption to

annual

periods beginning after June 15, 2005. The pro forma disclosures previously
permitted under SFAS 123 will no longer be an alternative to financial statement recognition. The
transition methods include prospective and retrospective adoption options. The prospective method
requires that compensation expense be recorded for all unvested stock-based awards including those
granted prior to adoption of the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS 123, at the beginning of
the first quarter of adoption of SFAS 123R; while the retrospective methods would record
compensation expense for all unvested stock-based awards beginning with the first period restated.
The Company will adopt SFAS 123R in the first quarter of fiscal 2006 using the prospective method.
In January 2003, the Company began expensing all stock-based compensation awards granted or
modified after January 1, 2003 under the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS 123 and;
therefore, the adoption is not expected to have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated
financial condition or results of operations. The Company expects to record a favorable $6 million
after-tax cumulative effect of adoption as of January 1, 2006 to reverse expense previously
recognized on awards expected to be forfeited, as required under SFAS 123R. In addition, the
Company expects that full year 2006 net income will be further improved by $5 million after tax due
to lower expense from anticipating

forfeitures, partially off-set by expensing awards issued prior to January 1, 2003 and higher
expense for immediately expensing awards to retirement-eligible employees who can retire and
receive automatic vesting.

Stock-Based Compensation

The Company has an incentive stock plan (the “2005 Stock Plan”) which permits the Company to grant
non-qualified or incentive stock options qualifying under Section 422A of the Internal Revenue
Code, stock appreciation rights, performance shares, restricted stock, or restricted stock units,
or any combination of the foregoing. In January 2003, the Company began expensing all stock-based
compensation awards granted or modified after January 1, 2003 under the fair value recognition
provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standard (“SFAS”) No. 123 “Accounting for
Stock-Based Compensation”. The fair value of stock-based awards granted during the years ended
December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003 were $42, $40 and $35, respectively, after-tax. The fair value of
these awards will be recognized as expense over the awards’ vesting periods, generally three years.

Prior to January 1, 2004, the Company used the Black-Scholes model to determine the fair value of
the Company’s stock-based compensation. For all awards granted or modified on or after January 1,
2004, the Company uses a hybrid lattice/Monte-Carlo based option valuation model (the “valuation
model”) that incorporates the possibility of early exercise of options into the valuation. The
valuation model also incorporates the Company’s historical forfeiture and exercise experience to
determine the option value. For these reasons, the Company believes the valuation model provides a
fair value that is more representative of actual experience than the value calculated under the
Black-Scholes model.

All stock-based awards granted or modified prior to January 1, 2003 continue to be valued using the
intrinsic value-based provisions set forth in Accounting Principles Board (“APB”) Opinion No. 25,
“Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees”. Under the intrinsic value method, compensation expense
is determined on the measurement date, which is the first date on which both the number of shares
the employee is entitled to receive and the exercise price are known. Compensation expense, if
any, is measured based on the award’s intrinsic value, which is the excess of the market price of
the stock over the exercise price on the measurement date, and is recognized over the award’s
vesting period. The expense, including non-option plans, related to stock-based employee
compensation included in the determination of net income for the years ended December 31, 2005,
2004 and 2003 is less than that which would have been recognized if the fair value method had been
applied to all awards since the effective date of SFAS No. 123. For further discussion of the
Company’s stock-based compensation plans, see Note 18.

The following table illustrates the effect on net income (loss) and earnings (loss) per share
(basic and diluted) as if the fair value method had been applied to all outstanding and unvested
awards in each period. The pro-forma fair values disclosed below related to awards granted prior
to 2004 were calculated using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model and were not recalculated
using the valuation model. The change in valuation methodology would have an immaterial impact on
the pro-forma net income amounts disclosed.

As a result of the net loss for the year ended December 31, 2003, SFAS No. 128, “Earnings Per Share”, requires the Company to use
basic weighted average common shares outstanding in the calculation of the year ended December 31, 2003 diluted earnings (loss)
per share, since the inclusion of options of 1.8 would have been antidilutive to the earnings per share calculation. In the
absence of the net loss, weighted average common shares outstanding and dilutive potential common shares would have totaled 274.2.

The assumptions used in the valuation model and the Black-Scholes model are noted in the table
below.

The valuation model incorporates ranges of assumptions for inputs, and therefore, those ranges are
disclosed. In the valuation model, the term structure of volatility is constructed utilizing
implied volatilities from exchange-traded options on the Company’s stock, historical volatility of
the Company’s stock and other factors. The Company uses historical data to estimate option
exercise and

employee termination within the valuation model, and accommodates variations in employee
preference and risk-tolerance by segregating the grantee pool into a series of behavioral cohorts
and conducting a fair valuation for each cohort individually. The expected term of options granted
is derived from the output of the option valuation model and represents, in a mathematical sense,
the period of time that options are expected to be outstanding. The risk-free rate for periods
within the contractual life of the option is based on the U.S. Constant Maturity Treasury yield
curve in effect at the time of grant.

The use of the fair value recognition method results in compensation expense being recognized
in the financial statements at different amounts and in different periods than the related income
tax deduction. Generally, the compensation expense recognized under SFAS No. 123 will result in a
deferred tax asset since the stock compensation expense is not deductible for tax until the option
is exercised. Deferred tax assets are evaluated as to future realizability to determine whether a
valuation allowance is necessary. For further discussion, see Note 13.

Investments

The Hartford’s investments in fixed maturities, which include bonds, redeemable preferred stock and
commercial paper; and certain equity securities, which include common and non-redeemable preferred
stocks, are classified as “available-for-sale” and accordingly, are carried at fair value with the
after-tax difference from cost or amortized cost, as adjusted for the effect of deducting the life
and pension policyholders’ share of the immediate participation guaranteed contracts; and certain
life and annuity deferred policy acquisition costs and reserve adjustments, reflected in
stockholders’ equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (“AOCI”). The equity
investments associated with the variable annuity products offered in Japan are recorded at fair
value and are classified as “trading” with changes in fair value recorded in net investment income.
Policy loans are carried at outstanding balance, which approximates fair value. Mortgage loans on
real estate are recorded at the outstanding principal balance adjusted for amortization of premiums
or discounts and net of valuation allowances, if any. Other investments primarily consist of
limited partnership interests and derivatives. Limited partnerships are accounted for under the
equity method and accordingly the Company’s share of partnership earnings are included in net
investment income. Derivatives are carried at fair value.

Valuation of Fixed Maturities

The fair value for fixed maturity securities is largely determined by one of three primary pricing
methods: independent third party pricing service market quotations, independent broker quotations
or pricing matrices, which use data provided by external sources. With the exception of short-term
securities for which amortized cost is predominantly used to approximate fair value, security
pricing is applied using a hierarchy or “waterfall” approach whereby prices are first sought from
independent pricing services with the remaining unpriced securities submitted to brokers for prices
or lastly priced via a pricing matrix.

Prices from independent pricing services are often unavailable for securities that are rarely
traded or are traded only in privately negotiated transactions. As a result, certain of the
Company’s asset-backed (“ABS”) and commercial mortgage-backed securities (“CMBS”) are priced via
broker quotations. A pricing matrix is used to price securities for which the Company is unable to
obtain either a price from an independent third party service or an independent broker quotation.
The pricing matrix begins with current treasury rates and uses credit spreads and issuer-specific
yield adjustments received from an independent third party source to determine the market price for
the security. The credit spreads, as assigned by a nationally recognized rating agency,
incorporate the issuer’s credit rating and a risk premium, if warranted, due to the issuer’s
industry and the security’s time to maturity. The issuer-specific yield adjustments, which can be
positive or negative, are updated twice annually, as of June 30 and December 31, by an independent
third party source and are intended to adjust security prices for issuer-specific factors. The
matrix-priced securities at December 31, 2005 and 2004, primarily consisted of non-144A private
placements and have an average duration of 5.0 and 4.8 years, respectively.

[1] Short-term investments are primarily valued at amortized cost, which approximates
fair value.

The fair value of a financial instrument is the amount at which the instrument could be
exchanged in a current transaction between knowledgeable, unrelated willing parties. As such, the
estimated fair value of a financial instrument may differ significantly from the amount that could
be realized if the security was sold immediately.

Other-Than-Temporary Impairments on Available-for-Sale Securities

One of the significant estimates inherent in the valuation of investments is the evaluation of
investments for other-than-temporary impairments. The evaluation of impairments is a quantitative
and qualitative process, which is subject to risks and uncertainties and is intended to determine
whether declines in the fair value of investments should be recognized in current period earnings.
The risks and uncertainties include changes in general economic conditions, the issuer’s financial
condition or near term recovery prospects and the effects of changes in interest rates. The
Company’s accounting policy requires that a decline in the value of a security below its cost or
amortized cost basis be assessed to determine if the decline is other-than-temporary. If the
security is deemed to be other-than-temporarily impaired, a charge is recorded in net realized
capital losses equal to the difference between the fair value and cost or amortized cost basis of
the security. In addition, for securities expected to be sold, an other-than-temporary impairment
charge is recognized if the Company does not expect the fair value of a security to recover to cost
or amortized cost prior to the expected date of sale. The fair value of the other-than-temporarily
impaired investment becomes its new cost basis. The Company has a security monitoring process
overseen by a committee of investment and accounting professionals (“the committee”) that
identifies securities that, due to certain characteristics, as described below, are subjected to an
enhanced analysis on a quarterly basis.

Securities not subject to EITF Issue No. 99-20 (“non-EITF Issue No. 99-20 securities”) that are in
an unrealized loss position, are reviewed at least quarterly to determine if an
other-than-temporary impairment is present based on certain quantitative and qualitative factors.
The primary factors considered in evaluating whether a decline in value for non-EITF Issue No.
99-20 securities is other-than-temporary include: (a) the length of time and the extent to which
the fair value has been less than cost or amortized cost, (b) the financial condition, credit
rating and near-term prospects of the issuer, (c) whether the debtor is current on contractually
obligated interest and principal payments and (d) the intent and ability of the Company to retain
the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for recovery. Non-EITF Issue No. 99-20
securities depressed by twenty percent or more for six months are presumed to be
other-than-temporarily impaired unless significant objective verifiable evidence supports that the
security price is temporarily depressed and is expected to recover within a reasonable period of
time. The evaluation of non-EITF Issue No. 99-20 securities depressed more than ten percent is
documented and discussed quarterly by the committee.

For certain securitized financial assets with contractual cash flows including ABS, EITF Issue No.
99-20 requires the Company to periodically update its best estimate of cash flows over the life of
the security. If the fair value of a securitized financial asset is less than its cost or
amortized cost and there has been a decrease in the present value of the estimated cash flows since
the last revised estimate, considering both timing and amount, an other-than-temporary impairment
charge is recognized. Estimating future cash flows is a quantitative and qualitative process that
incorporates information received from third party sources along with certain internal assumptions
and judgments regarding the future performance of the underlying collateral. As a result, actual
results may differ from current estimates. In addition, projections of expected future cash flows
may change based upon new information regarding the performance of the underlying collateral.

Mortgage Loan Impairments

Mortgage loans on real estate are considered to be impaired when management estimates that, based
upon current information and events, it is probable that the Company will be unable to collect all
amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement. For mortgage loans that are
determined to be impaired, a valuation allowance is established for the difference between the
carrying amount and the Company’s share of either (a) the present value of the expected future cash
flows discounted at the loan’s original effective interest rate, (b) the loan’s observable market
price or (c) the fair value of the collateral. Changes in valuation allowances are recorded in net
realized capital gains and losses.

Net Realized Capital Gains and Losses

Net realized capital gains and losses from investment sales, after deducting the life and pension
policyholders’ share for certain products, are reported as a component of revenues and are
determined on a specific identification basis. Net realized capital gains and losses also result
from fair value changes in derivatives contracts (both free-standing and embedded) that do not
qualify, or are not designated, as a hedge for accounting purposes, and the change in value of
derivatives in certain fair-value hedge relationships. Impairments are recognized as net realized
capital losses when investment losses in value are deemed other-than-temporary. Foreign currency
transaction remeasurements are also recognized within net realized capital gains and losses. Net
realized capital gains and losses on security transactions associated with the Company’s immediate
participation guaranteed contracts are recorded and offset by amounts owed to policyholders and
were less than $1 for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, and were $1 for the year ended
December 31, 2003. Under the terms of the contracts, the net realized capital gains and losses
will be credited to policyholders in future years as they are entitled to receive them.

Net Investment Income

Interest income from fixed maturities and mortgage loans on real estate is recognized when earned
on the constant effective yield method based on estimated principal repayments, if applicable. For
fixed maturities subject to prepayment risk, yields are recalculated and adjusted periodically to
reflect historical and/or estimated future principal repayments. These adjustments are accounted
for using the retrospective method for highly-rated fixed maturities, and the prospective method
for non-highly rated securitized financial assets. Prepayment fees on fixed maturities and
mortgage loans are recorded in net investment income when earned. For partnership investments, the
equity method of accounting is used to recognize the Company’s share of partnership earnings. For
investments that have had an other-than-temporary impairment loss, income is earned on the constant
effective yield method based upon the new cost basis and the amount and timing of future estimated
cash flows.

Net investment income on equity securities held for trading includes dividend income and the
changes in market value of the securities associated with the variable annuity products sold in
Japan. The returns on these policyholder-directed investments inure to the benefit of the variable
annuity policyholders but the underlying funds do not meet the criteria for separate account
reporting as provided in SOP 03-1. Accordingly, these assets are reflected in the Company’s
general account and the returns credited to the policyholders are reflected in interest credited, a
component of benefits, claims and claim adjustment expenses.

Derivative Instruments

Overview

The Company utilizes a variety of derivative instruments, including swaps, caps, floors, forwards,
futures and options through one of four Company-approved objectives: to hedge risk arising from
interest rate, equity market, price or currency exchange rate volatility; to manage liquidity; to
control transaction costs; or to enter into replication transactions. For a further discussion of
derivative instruments, see the Derivative Instruments section of Note 4.

The Company’s derivative transactions are used in strategies permitted under the derivatives use
plans filed and/or approved, as applicable, by the State of Connecticut, the State of Illinois and
the State of New York insurance departments. The Company does not make a market or trade in these
instruments for the express purpose of earning short-term trading profits.

Accounting and Financial Statement Presentation of Derivative Instruments and Hedging
Activities

Derivatives are recognized on the balance sheet at fair value. Other than the guaranteed minimum
withdrawal benefit (“GMWB”) rider and the associated reinsurance contracts, which are discussed
below, approximately 81% and 69% of derivatives, based upon notional values, were priced via
valuation models, while the remaining 19% and 31% of derivatives were priced via broker quotations,
as of December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The derivative contracts are reported as assets or
liabilities in other investments and other liabilities, respectively, in the consolidated balance
sheets, excluding embedded derivatives and GMWB reinsurance contracts. Embedded derivatives are
recorded in the consolidated balance sheets with the associated host instrument. GMWB reinsurance
contract amounts are recorded in reinsurance recoverables in the consolidated balance sheets.

On the date the derivative contract is entered into, the Company designates the derivative as (1) a
hedge of the fair value of a recognized asset or liability (“fair-value” hedge), (2) a hedge of the
variability in cash flows of a forecasted transaction or of amounts to be received or paid related
to a recognized asset or liability (“cash-flow” hedge), (3) a foreign-currency fair value or
cash-flow hedge (“foreign-currency” hedge), (4) a hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation
or (5) held for other investment and risk management purposes, which primarily involve managing
asset or liability related risks which do not qualify for hedge accounting.

Fair-Value Hedges

Changes in the fair value of a derivative that is designated and qualifies as a fair-value hedge,
along with the changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability that is attributable to
the hedged risk, are recorded in current period earnings with any differences between the net
change in fair value of the derivative and the hedged item representing the hedge ineffectiveness.
Periodic derivative

net coupon settlements are recorded in net investment income with the exception of hedges of
Company issued debt which are recorded in interest expense.

Cash-Flow Hedges

Changes in the fair value of a derivative that is designated and qualifies as a cash-flow hedge are
recorded in AOCI and are reclassified into earnings when the variability of the cash flow of the
hedged item impacts earnings. Gains and losses on derivative contracts that are reclassified from
AOCI to current period earnings are included in the line item in the consolidated statements of
operations in which the cash flows of the hedged item are recorded. Any hedge ineffectiveness is
recorded immediately in current period earnings as net realized capital gains and losses. Periodic
derivative net coupon settlements are recorded in net investment income.

Foreign-Currency Hedges

Changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as foreign-currency hedges
are recorded in either current period earnings or AOCI, depending on whether the hedged transaction
is a fair-value hedge or a cash-flow hedge, respectively. Any hedge ineffectiveness is recorded
immediately in current period earnings as net realized capital gains and losses. Periodic
derivative net coupon settlements are recorded in net investment income.

Net Investment in a Foreign Operation Hedges

Changes in fair value of a derivative used as a hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation,
to the extent effective as a hedge, are recorded in the foreign currency translation adjustments
account within AOCI. Cumulative changes in fair value recorded in AOCI are reclassified into
earnings upon the sale or complete or substantially complete liquidation of the foreign entity.
Any hedge ineffectiveness is recorded immediately in current period earnings as net realized
capital gains and losses. Periodic derivative net coupon settlements are recorded in net
investment income.

Other Investment and Risk Management Activities

The Company’s other investment and risk management activities primarily relate to strategies used
to reduce economic risk, enhance income, or replicate permitted fixed income investments, and do
not receive hedge accounting treatment. Changes in the fair value, including periodic net coupon
settlements, of derivative instruments held for other investment and risk management purposes are
reported in current period earnings as net realized capital gains and losses.

Hedge Documentation and Effectiveness Testing

To qualify for hedge accounting treatment, a derivative must be highly effective in mitigating the
designated changes in value or cash flow of the hedged item. At hedge inception, the Company
formally documents all relationships between hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as its
risk-management objective and strategy for undertaking each hedge transaction. The documentation
process includes linking derivatives that are designated as fair-value, cash-flow, foreign-currency
or net investment hedges to specific assets or liabilities on the balance sheet or to specific
forecasted transactions. The Company also formally assesses, both at the hedge’s inception and on
an ongoing basis, whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly
effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of hedged items. In addition, certain
hedging relationships are considered highly effective if the changes in the fair value or
discounted cash flows of the hedging instrument are within a ratio of 80-125% of the inverse
changes in the fair value or discounted cash flows of the hedged item. Hedge ineffectiveness is
measured using qualitative and quantitative methods. Qualitative methods may include comparison of
critical terms of the derivative to the hedged item. Depending on the hedging strategy,
quantitative methods may include the “Change in Variable Cash Flows Method”, the “Change in Fair
Value Method”, the “Hypothetical Derivative Method” and the “Dollar Offset Method”.

Discontinuance of Hedge Accounting

The Company discontinues hedge accounting prospectively when (1) it is determined that the
derivative is no longer highly effective in offsetting changes in the fair value or cash flows of a
hedged item; (2) the derivative is dedesignated as a hedging instrument; or (3) the derivative
expires or is sold, terminated or exercised.

When hedge accounting is discontinued because it is determined that the derivative no longer
qualifies as an effective fair-value hedge, the derivative continues to be carried at fair value on
the balance sheet with changes in its fair value recognized in current period earnings.

When hedge accounting is discontinued because the Company becomes aware that it is not probable
that the forecasted transaction will occur, the derivative continues to be carried on the balance
sheet at its fair value, and gains and losses that were accumulated in AOCI are recognized
immediately in earnings.

Basis of Presentation and Accounting Policies (continued)

In other situations in which hedge accounting is discontinued on a cash-flow hedge, including
those where the derivative is sold, terminated or exercised, amounts previously deferred in AOCI
are reclassified into earnings when earnings are impacted by the variability of the cash flow of
the hedged item.

Embedded Derivatives

The Company purchases and issues financial instruments and products that contain embedded
derivative instruments. When it is determined that (1) the embedded derivative possesses economic
characteristics that are not clearly and closely related to the economic characteristics of the
host contract, and (2) a separate instrument with the same terms would qualify as a derivative
instrument, the embedded derivative is bifurcated from the host for measurement purposes. The
embedded derivative, which is reported with the host instrument in the consolidated balance sheets,
is carried at fair value with changes in fair value reported in net realized capital gains and
losses.

Credit Risk

The Company’s derivatives counterparty exposure policy establishes market-based credit limits,
favors long-term financial stability and creditworthiness, and typically requires credit
enhancement/credit risk reducing agreements. By using derivative instruments, the Company is
exposed to credit risk, which is measured as the amount owed to the Company based on current market
conditions and potential payment obligations between the Company and its counterparties. When the
fair value of a derivative contract is positive, this indicates that the counterparty owes the
Company and, therefore, exposes the Company to credit risk. Credit exposures are generally
quantified daily, netted by counterparty for each legal entity of the Company, and then collateral
is pledged to and held by, or on behalf of, the Company to the extent the current value of
derivatives exceeds exposure policy thresholds. The Company also minimizes the credit risk in
derivative instruments by entering into transactions with high quality counterparties that are
monitored by the Company’s internal compliance unit and reviewed frequently by senior management.
In addition, the compliance unit monitors counterparty credit exposure on a monthly basis to ensure
compliance with Company policies and statutory limitations. The Company also maintains a policy of
requiring that all derivative contracts, with the exception of exchange-traded contracts and
currency forward purchase or sale contracts, be governed by an International Swaps and Dealers
Association Master Agreement which is structured by legal entity and by counterparty and permits
the right of offset. In addition, the Company periodically enters into swap agreements in which
the Company assumes credit exposure from a single entity, referenced index or asset pool.

Product Derivatives and Risk Management

The Company offers certain variable annuity products with a guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefit
(“GMWB”) rider. The GMWB provides the policyholder with a guaranteed remaining balance (“GRB”) if
the account value is reduced to zero through a combination of market declines and withdrawals. The
GRB is generally equal to premiums less withdrawals. However, annual withdrawals that exceed a
specific percentage of the premiums paid may reduce the GRB by an amount greater than the
withdrawals and may also impact the guaranteed annual withdrawal amount that subsequently applies
after the excess annual withdrawals occur. For certain of the withdrawal benefit features, the
policyholder also has the option, after a specified time period, to reset the GRB to the
then-current account value, if greater. In addition, the Company has recently added a feature,
available to new contract holders, that allows the policyholder the option to receive the
guaranteed annual withdrawal amount for as long as they are alive. In this new feature, in all
cases the contract holder or their beneficiary will receive the GRB and the GRB is reset on an
annual basis to the maximum anniversary account value subject to a cap. The GMWB represents an
embedded derivative in the variable annuity contracts that is required to be reported separately
from the host variable annuity contract. It is carried at fair value and reported in other
policyholder funds. The fair value of the GMWB obligation is calculated based on actuarial and
capital market assumptions related to the projected cash flows, including benefits and related
contract charges, over the lives of the contracts, incorporating expectations concerning
policyholder behavior. Because of the dynamic and complex nature of these cash flows, stochastic
techniques under a variety of market return scenarios and other best estimate assumptions are used.
Estimating these cash flows involves numerous estimates and subjective judgments including those
regarding expected market rates of return, market volatility, correlations of market returns and
discount rates. At each valuation date, the Company assumes expected returns based on risk-free
rates as represented by the current LIBOR forward curve rates; market volatility assumptions for
each underlying index based on a blend of observed market “implied volatility” data and annualized
standard deviations of monthly returns using the most recent 20 years of observed market
performance; correlations of market returns across underlying indices based on actual observed
market returns and relationships over the ten years preceding the valuation date; and current
risk-free spot rates as represented by the current LIBOR spot curve to determine the present value
of expected future cash flows produced in the stochastic projection process. During the 4th
quarter of 2005, the Company reflected a newly reliable market input for volatility on Standard and
Poor’s (“S&P”) 500 index options. The impact of reflecting the newly reliable market input for the
S&P 500 index volatility resulted in a decrease to the GMWB asset of $83. The impact to net income
including other changes in assumptions, after DAC amortization and taxes was a loss of $18.

In valuing the embedded derivative, the Company attributes to the derivative a portion of the fees
collected from the contract holder equal to the present value of future GMWB claims (the
“Attributed Fees”). All changes in the fair value of the embedded derivative are recorded in net
realized capital gains and losses. The excess of fees collected from the contract holder for the
GMWB over the Attributed Fees are associated with the host variable annuity contract recorded in
fee income.

Basis of Presentation and Accounting Policies (continued)

For contracts issued prior to July 2003, the Company has a reinsurance arrangement in place to
transfer its risk of loss due to GMWB. This arrangement is recognized as a derivative and carried
at fair value in reinsurance recoverables. Changes in the fair value of both the derivative assets
and liabilities related to the reinsured GMWB are recorded in net realized capital gains and
losses. As of July 2003, the Company had substantially exhausted all of its reinsurance capacity,
with respect to contracts issued after July 2003, and began hedging its exposure to the GMWB rider
using a sophisticated program involving interest rate futures, Standard and Poor’s (“S&P”) 500 and
NASDAQ index put options and futures contracts and Europe, Australasia and Far East (“EAFE”) Index
swaps to hedge GMWB exposure to international equity markets. For the years ended December 31,
2005, 2004 and 2003, net realized capital gains and losses included the change in market value of
the embedded derivative related to the GMWB liability, the derivative reinsurance arrangement and
the related derivative contracts that were purchased as economic hedges, the net effect of which
was a $46 loss, $8 gain and $6 gain, before deferred policy acquisition costs and tax effects,
respectively.

A contract is ‘in the money’ if the contract holder’s GRB is greater than the account value. For
contracts that were ‘in the money’, the Company’s
exposure as of December 31, 2005, was $8.
However, the only ways the contract holder can monetize the excess of the GRB over the account
value of the contract is upon death or if their account value is reduced to zero through a
combination of a series of withdrawals that do not exceed a specific percentage of the premiums
paid per year and market declines. If the account value is reduced to zero, the contract holder will receive a period
certain annuity equal to the remaining GRB. As the amount of the excess of the GRB over the
account value can fluctuate with equity market returns on a daily basis the ultimate amount to be
paid by the Company, if any, is uncertain and could be significantly
more or less than $8.

Separate Accounts

The Company maintains separate account assets and liabilities, which are reported at fair value.
Separate accounts reflect two categories of risk assumption: non-guaranteed separate accounts,
wherein the policyholder assumes the investment risk, and guaranteed separate accounts, wherein the
Company contractually guarantees either a minimum return or account value to the policyholder.
Non-guaranteed separate account assets are segregated from other investments and investment income
and gains and losses accrue directly to the policyholder.

Deferred Policy Acquisition Costs and Present Value of Future Profits

Life —

Life policy acquisition costs include commissions and certain other expenses that vary with
and are primarily associated with acquiring business. Present value of future profits is an
intangible asset recorded upon applying purchase accounting in an acquisition of a life insurance
company. Deferred policy acquisition costs and the present value of future profits intangible
asset are amortized in the same way. Both are amortized over the estimated life of the contracts
acquired, generally 20 years. Within the following discussion, deferred policy acquisition costs
and the present value of future profits intangible asset will be referred to as “DAC”. At December
31, 2005 and 2004, the carrying value of the Company’s Life DAC asset was $8.6 billion and $7.4
billion, respectively.

The Company amortizes DAC related to traditional policies (term, whole life and group insurance)
over the premium-paying period in proportion to the present value of annual expected premium
income. The Company amortizes DAC related to investment contracts and universal life-type
contracts (including individual variable annuities) using the retrospective deposit method. Under
the retrospective deposit method, acquisition costs are amortized in proportion to the present
value of estimated gross profits (“EGPs”). The Company uses other measures for amortizing DAC,
such as gross costs, as a replacement for EGPs when EGPs are expected
to be negative for multiple years of the contract’s life. The Company also adjusts the DAC balance, through other comprehensive
income, by an amount that represents the amortization of DAC that would have been required as a
charge or credit to operations had unrealized gains and losses on investments been realized.
Actual gross profits, in a given reporting period, that vary from management’s initial estimates
result in increases or decreases in the rate of amortization, commonly referred to as a “true-up”,
which are recorded in the current period. The true-up recorded for the years ended December 31,
2005, 2004 and 2003, was an increase to amortization of $18, $16 and $38, respectively.

Each year, the Company develops future EGPs for the products sold during that year. The EGPs for
products sold in a particular year are aggregated into cohorts. Future gross profits are projected
for the estimated lives of the contracts, generally 20 years and are, to a large extent, a function
of future account value projections for individual variable annuity products and to a lesser extent
for variable universal life products. The projection of future account values requires the use of
certain assumptions. The assumptions considered to be important in the projection of future
account value, and hence the EGPs, include separate account fund performance, which is impacted by
separate account fund mix, less fees assessed against the contract holder’s account balance,
surrender and lapse rates, interest margin, and mortality. The assumptions are developed as part
of an annual process and are dependent upon the Company’s current best estimates of future events
which are likely to be different for each year’s cohort. For example, upon completion of a study
during the fourth quarter of 2005, the Company, in developing projected account values and the
related EGP’s for the 2005 cohorts, used a separate account
return assumption of 7.6% (after fund fees, but before mortality and
expense charges) for U.S.
products and 4.3% (after fund fees, but before mortality and
expense charges) for Japanese products. (Although the Company used a separate account return
assumption of 4.3% for the 2005 cohort, based on the relative fund mix of all variable products
sold in Japan, the weighted average rate on the entire Japan block is 5.0%.) For prior year
cohorts, the Company’s separate account return assumption, at the time those cohorts’ account
values and related EGPs were projected, was 9.0% for U.S. products and 5.4% for Japanese products.

Unlock Analysis

EGPs that are used as the basis for determining amortization of DAC are evaluated regularly to
determine if actual experience or other evidence suggests that earlier estimates should be revised.
Assumptions used to project account values and the related EGPs, are not revised unless the EGPs
in the DAC amortization model fall outside of a reasonable range. In the event that the Company
was to revise assumptions used for prior year cohorts, thereby changing its estimate of projected
account value, and the related EGPs, in the DAC amortization model, the cumulative DAC amortization
would be adjusted to reflect such changes, in the period the revision was determined to be
necessary, a process known as “unlocking”.

To determine the reasonableness of the prior assumptions used and their impact on previously
projected account values and the related EGPs, the Company evaluates, on a quarterly basis, its
previously projected EGPs. The Company’s process to assess the reasonableness of its EGPs involves
the use of internally developed models, which run a large number of stochastically determined
scenarios of separate account fund performance. Incorporated in each scenario are the Company’s
current best estimate assumptions with respect to separate account returns, lapse rates, mortality,
and expenses. These scenarios are run for individual variable annuity business in the U.S. and
independently for individual variable annuity business in Japan and are used to calculate
statistically significant ranges of reasonable EGPs. The statistical ranges produced from the
stochastic scenarios are compared to the present value of EGPs used in the respective DAC
amortization models. If EGPs used in the DAC amortization model fall outside of the statistical
ranges of reasonable EGPs, a revision to the assumptions in prior year cohorts used to project
account value and the related EGPs, in the DAC amortization model would be necessary. A similar
approach is used for variable universal life business.

As of
December 31, 2005, the present value of the EGPs used in the DAC
amortization models, for variable annuities and variable universal
life business, fell
within the statistical range of reasonable EGPs. Therefore, the Company did not revise the
separate account return assumption, the account value or any other
assumptions, in those DAC
amortization models, for 2004 and prior cohorts.

Aside from absolute levels and timing of market performance, additional factors that will influence
the unlock determination include the degree of volatility in separate account fund performance and
shifts in asset allocation within the separate account made by policyholders. The overall return
generated by the separate account is dependent on several factors, including the relative mix of
the underlying sub-accounts among bond funds and equity funds as well as equity sector weightings.
The Company’s overall U.S. separate account fund performance has been reasonably correlated to the
overall performance of the S&P 500 Index (which closed at 1,248 on December 31, 2005), although no
assurance can be provided that this correlation will continue in the future.

The overall recoverability of the DAC asset is dependent on the future profitability of the
business. The Company tests the aggregate recoverability of the DAC asset by comparing the amounts
deferred to the present value of total EGPs. In addition, the Company routinely stress tests its
DAC asset for recoverability against severe declines in its separate account assets, which could
occur if the equity markets experienced another significant sell-off, as the majority of
policyholders’ funds in the separate accounts is invested in the equity market.

Property & Casualty

— The Property & Casualty operations also incur costs including commissions,
premium taxes and certain underwriting and policy issuance costs that vary with and are related
primarily to the acquisition of property and casualty insurance business and are deferred and
amortized ratably over the period the related premiums are earned. Deferred acquisition costs are
reviewed to determine if they are recoverable from future income, and if not, are charged to
expense. Anticipated investment income is considered in the determination of the recoverability of
deferred policy acquisition costs. For the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, no
material amounts of deferred policy acquisition costs were charged to expense based on the
determination of recoverability.

Reserve for Future Policy Benefits and Unpaid Claims and Claim Adjustment Expenses

Life —

Liabilities for the Company’s group life and disability contracts as well its individual
term life insurance policies include amounts for unpaid claims and future policy benefits.
Liabilities for unpaid claims include estimates of amounts to fully settle known reported claims as
well as claims related to insured events that the Company estimates have been incurred but have not
yet been reported. Liabilities for future policy benefits are calculated by the net level premium
method using interest, withdrawal and mortality assumptions appropriate at the time the policies
were issued. The methods used in determining the liability for unpaid claims and future policy
benefits are standard actuarial methods recognized by the American Academy of Actuaries. For the
tabular reserves, discount rates are based on the Company’s earned investment yield and the
morbidity/mortality tables used are standard industry tables modified to reflect the Company’s
actual experience when appropriate. In particular, for the Company’s group disability known claim
reserves, the morbidity table for the early durations of claim is based exclusively on the
Company’s experience, incorporating factors such as sex, elimination period and diagnosis. These
reserves are computed such that they are expected to meet the Company’s future policy obligations.
Future policy benefits are computed at amounts that, with additions from estimated premiums to be
received and with interest on such reserves compounded annually at certain assumed rates, are
expected to be sufficient to meet the Company’s policy obligations at their maturities or in the
event of an insured’s death. Changes in or deviations from the assumptions used for mortality,
morbidity, expected future premiums and interest can significantly affect the Company’s reserve
levels and related future operations and, as such, provisions for adverse deviation are built into
the long-tailed liability assumptions.

Basis of Presentation and Accounting Policies (continued)

Certain contracts classified as universal life-type may also include additional death or other
insurance benefit features, such as guaranteed minimum death or income benefits offered with
variable annuity contracts or no lapse guarantees offered with universal life insurance contracts.
An additional liability is established for these benefits by estimating the expected present value
of the benefits in excess of the projected account value in proportion to the present value of
total expected assessments. Excess benefits are accrued as a liability as actual assessments are
recorded. Determination of the expected value of excess benefits and assessments are based on a
range of scenarios and assumptions including those related to market rates of return and
volatility, contract surrender rates and mortality experience.

Property & Casualty —

The Hartford establishes property and casualty reserves to provide for the
estimated costs of paying claims under insurance policies written by the Company. These reserves
include estimates for both claims that have been reported and those that have been incurred but not
reported, and include estimates of all expenses associated with processing and settling these
claims. Estimating the ultimate cost of future claims and claim adjustment expenses is an uncertain
and complex process. This estimation process is based significantly on the assumption that past
developments are an appropriate predictor of future events, and
involves a variety of
actuarial techniques that analyze experience, trends and other relevant factors. The uncertainties
involved with the reserving process have become increasingly difficult due to a number of complex
factors including social and economic trends and changes in the concepts of legal liability
and damage awards. Accordingly, final claim settlements may vary from the present estimates,
particularly when those payments may not occur until well into the future.

The Hartford regularly reviews the adequacy of its estimated claims and claim adjustment expense
reserves by line of business within the various operating segments. Adjustments to previously
established reserves are reflected in the operating results of the period in which the adjustment
is determined to be necessary. Such adjustments could possibly be significant, reflecting any
variety of new and adverse or favorable trends.

Most of the Company’s property and casualty reserves are not discounted. However, certain
liabilities for unpaid claims for permanently disabled claimants have been discounted to present
value using an average interest rate of 4.5% in 2005 and 4.6% in 2004. As of December 31, 2005 and
2004, such discounted reserves totaled $680 and $646 respectively (net of discounts of $505, and
$440, respectively). In addition, certain structured settlement contracts, that fund loss run-offs
for unrelated parties having payment patterns that are fixed and determinable, have been discounted
to present value using an average interest rate of 5.5%. At December 31, 2005 and 2004, such
discounted reserves totaled $264 and $257, respectively (net of discounts of $103 and $116,
respectively). Accretion of these discounts did not have a material effect on net income during
2005 or 2004.

Other Policyholder Funds and Benefits Payable

The Company has classified its fixed and variable annuities, 401(k), certain governmental
annuities, private placement life insurance (“PPLI”), variable universal life insurance, universal
life insurance and interest sensitive whole life insurance as universal life-type contracts. The
liability for universal life-type contracts is equal to the balance that accrues to the benefit of
the policyholders as of the financial statement date (commonly referred to as the account value),
including credited interest, amounts that have been assessed to compensate the Company for services
to be performed over future periods, and any amounts previously assessed against policyholders that
are refundable on termination of the contract.

The Company has classified its institutional and governmental products, without life contingencies,
including funding agreements, certain structured settlements and guaranteed investment contracts,
as investment contracts. The liability for investment contracts is equal to the balance that
accrues to the benefit of the contract holder as of the financial statement date, which includes
the accumulation of deposits plus credited interest, less withdrawals and amounts assessed through
the financial statement date. Contract holder funds include funding agreements held by Variable
Interest Entities issuing medium-term notes.

Revenue Recognition

Life

— For investment and universal life-type contracts, the amounts collected from policyholders
are considered deposits and are not included in revenue. Fee income for investment and universal
life-type contracts consists of policy charges for policy administration, cost of insurance charges
and surrender charges assessed against policyholders’ account balances and are recognized in the
period in which services are provided. The Company’s traditional life and group disability
products are classified as long duration contracts, and premiums are recognized as revenue when due
from policyholders.

Property & Casualty

— Property and casualty insurance premiums are earned principally on a pro
rata basis over the lives of the policies and include accruals for ultimate premium revenue
anticipated under auditable and retrospectively rated policies. Unearned premiums represent the
portion of premiums written applicable to the unexpired terms of policies in force. Unearned
premiums also include estimated and unbilled premium adjustments related to a small percentage of
the Company’s loss-sensitive workers’ compensation business. An estimated allowance for doubtful
accounts is recorded on the basis of periodic evaluations of balances due from insurers,
management’s experience and current economic conditions

.

The allowance for doubtful accounts
included in premiums receivable and agents’ balances in the consolidated balance sheets was $120
and $139 as of December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Other revenue consists primarily of
revenues associated with the Company’s servicing businesses.

Foreign Currency Translation

Foreign currency translation gains and losses are reflected in stockholders’ equity as a component
of accumulated other comprehensive income. The Company’s foreign subsidiaries’ balance sheet
accounts are translated at the exchange rates in effect at each year end and income statement
accounts are translated at the average rates of exchange prevailing during the year. Gains and
losses on foreign currency transactions are reflected in earnings. The national currencies of the
international operations are their functional currencies.

Dividends to Policyholders

Policyholder dividends are accrued using an estimate of the amount to be paid based on underlying
contractual obligations under policies and applicable state laws.

Life

— Participating life insurance in force accounted for 3%, 5% and 6% as of December 31, 2005,
2004 and 2003, respectively, of total life insurance in force. Dividends to policyholders were
$37, $29 and $63 for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. There
were no additional amounts of income allocated to participating policyholders. If limitations
exist on the amount of net income from participating life insurance contracts that may be
distributed to stockholders, the policyholder’s share of net income on those contracts that cannot
be distributed is excluded from stockholders’ equity by a charge to operations and a credit to a
liability.

Property & Casualty

— Net written premiums for participating property and casualty insurance
policies represented 10%, 8% and 9% of total net written premiums for the years ended December 31,
2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Dividends to policyholders were $11, $12 and $34 for the years
ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.

Mutual Funds

The Company maintains a retail mutual fund operation, whereby the Company, through wholly-owned
subsidiaries, provides investment management and administrative services to The Hartford Mutual
Funds, Inc. and The Hartford Mutual Funds II, Inc. (“The Hartford mutual funds”), families of 48
mutual funds and 1 closed end fund. The Company charges fees to the shareholders of the mutual
funds, which are recorded as revenue by the Company. Investors can purchase “shares” in the mutual
funds, all of which are registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), in
accordance with the Investment Company Act of 1940. The mutual funds are owned by the shareholders
of those funds and not by the Company. As such, the mutual fund assets and liabilities and related
investment returns are not reflected in the Company’s consolidated financial statements since they
are not assets, liabilities and operations of the Company.

Reinsurance

Through both facultative and treaty reinsurance agreements, the Company cedes a share of the risks
it has underwritten to other insurance companies. Assumed reinsurance refers to the Company’s
acceptance of certain insurance risks that other insurance companies have underwritten.

Reinsurance accounting is followed for ceded and assumed transactions when the risk transfer
provisions of SFAS 113, “Accounting and Reporting for Reinsurance of Short-Duration and
Long-Duration Contracts,” have been met. To meet risk transfer requirements, a reinsurance
contract must include insurance risk, consisting of both underwriting and timing risk, and a
reasonable possibility of a significant loss to the reinsurer.

Earned premiums and incurred claim and claim adjustment expenses reflect the net effects of ceded
and assumed reinsurance transactions. Included in other assets are prepaid reinsurance premiums,
which represent the portion of premiums ceded to reinsurers applicable to the unexpired terms of
the reinsurance contracts. Reinsurance recoverables include balances due from reinsurance
companies for paid and unpaid claim and claim adjustment expenses and are presented net of an
allowance for uncollectible reinsurance. The allowance for uncollectible reinsurance was $413 and
$374 as of December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively.

Income Taxes

The Company recognizes taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred taxes for the
tax consequences of differences between the financial reporting and tax basis of assets and
liabilities. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to
apply to taxable income in the years the temporary differences are expected to reverse.

Property and Equipment

Property and equipment is carried at cost net of accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is based
on the estimated useful lives of the various classes of property and equipment and is determined
principally on the straight-line method. Accumulated depreciation as of December 31, 2005 and 2004
was $1.2 billion and $1.1 billion, respectively.
Depreciation expense was $206, $156 and $167 for
the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.

ended December 31, 2003 diluted earnings (loss) per share, since the inclusion of shares from
stock compensation plans of 1.8 would have been antidilutive to the earnings per share
calculation. In the absence of the net loss, weighted average common shares outstanding and
dilutive potential common shares would have totaled 274.2.

Basic earnings (loss) per share are computed based on the weighted average number of shares
outstanding during the year. Diluted earnings (loss) per share include the dilutive effect of
stock compensation plans and the Company’s equity units, if any, using the treasury stock method.
Under the treasury stock method for stock compensation plans, shares are assumed to be issued and
then reduced for the number of shares repurchaseable with theoretical proceeds at the average
market price for the period. Contingently issuable shares are included for the number of shares
issuable assuming the end of the reporting period was the end of the contingency period, if
dilutive. Theoretical proceeds include option exercise price payments, unamortized stock
compensation expense and tax benefits realized in excess of the tax benefit recognized in net
income. The difference between the number of shares assumed issued and number of shares purchased
represents the dilutive shares. Under the treasury stock method for the equity units, the number
of shares of common stock used in calculating diluted earnings per share is increased by the
excess, if any, of the number of shares issuable upon settlement of the purchase contracts, over
the number of shares that could be purchased by The Hartford in the market using the proceeds
received upon settlement. The number of issuable shares is based on the average market price for
the last 20 trading days of the period. The number of shares purchased is based on the average
market price during the entire period.

Upon exercise of outstanding options or vesting of other stock compensation plan awards, the
additional shares issued and outstanding are included in the calculation of the Company’s weighted
average shares from the date of exercise. Similarly, upon settlement of the purchase contracts
associated with the Company’s equity units, the associated common shares are added to the Company’s
issued and outstanding shares. Accordingly, assuming The Hartford’s common stock price exceeds
$56.875 per share and assuming operation of the equity unit purchase contracts in the ordinary
course, on August 16, 2006, 12.1 million common shares will be added to the Company’s issued and
outstanding shares and will be included in the calculation of the Company’s weighted average shares
for the period the shares are outstanding. Additionally, assuming The Hartford’s common stock
price exceeds $57.645 per share and assuming operation of the equity unit purchase contracts in the
ordinary course, on November 16, 2006, 5.7 million common shares will be added to the Company’s
issued and outstanding shares and will be included in the calculation of the Company’s weighted
average shares for the period the shares are outstanding. For further discussion of the Company’s
equity units offerings, see Note 14.

3. Segment Information

The Hartford is organized into two major operations: Life and Property & Casualty, each
containing reporting segments. In the quarter ended December 31, 2005, and as more fully described
below, the Company changed its reporting segments to reflect the current manner by which its chief
operating decision maker views and manages the business. All segment data for prior reporting
periods have been adjusted to reflect the current segment reporting. Within the Life and Property
& Casualty operations, The Hartford conducts business principally in ten operating segments.
Additionally, Corporate primarily includes all of the Company’s debt financing and related
interest expense, as well as certain capital raising activities and purchase accounting
adjustments.

Life

Life’s business is conducted by Hartford Life, Inc. (“Hartford Life” or “Life”), an indirect
subsidiary of The Hartford, headquartered in Simsbury, Connecticut, and is a leading financial
services and insurance organization. Life has realigned its reportable operating segments during
2005 to include six reportable operating segments: Retail Products Group (“Retail”), Retirement
Plans, Institutional Solutions Group (“Institutional”), Individual Life, Group Benefits and
International.

Retail offers individual variable and fixed market value adjusted (“MVA”) annuities, retail mutual
funds, 529 college savings plans, Canadian and offshore investment products.

Retirement Plans provides products and services to corporations pursuant to Section 401(k),
previously included in Retail, and products and services to municipalities and not-for-profit
organizations pursuant to Section 457 and 403(b), previously included in Institutional.

Institutional offers institutional liability products, including stable value products, structured
settlements and institutional annuities (primarily terminal funding cases), as well as variable
Private Placement Life Insurance (“PPLI”) owned by corporations and high net worth individuals.

Individual Life sells a variety of life insurance products, including variable universal life,
universal life, interest sensitive whole life and term life insurance.

Group Benefits provides employers, associations, affinity groups and financial institutions with
group life, accident and disability coverage, along with other products and services, including
voluntary benefits, group retiree health and medical stop loss.

International, which primarily has operations located in Japan, Brazil, Ireland and the United
Kingdom, provides investments, retirement savings and other insurance and savings products to
individuals and groups outside the United States and Canada.

Life also includes in an Other category its leveraged PPLI product line of business; corporate
items not directly allocated to any of its reportable operating segments; net realized capital
gains and losses on fixed maturity sales generated from movements in interest rates, less
amortization of those gains or losses back to the reportable segments; net realized capital gains
and losses generated from credit related events, less a credit risk fee charged to the reportable
segments; net realized capital gains and losses from non-qualifying derivative strategies
(including embedded derivatives) other than the net periodic coupon settlements on credit
derivatives and the net periodic coupon settlements on the cross currency swap used to economically
hedge currency and interest rate risk generated from sales of the Life’s yen based fixed annuity,
which are allocated to the reportable segments; the mark-to-market adjustment for the equity
securities held for trading reported in net investment income and the related change in interest
credited reported as a component of benefits, claims and claim adjustment expenses since these
items are not considered by Life’s chief operating decision maker in evaluating the International
results of operations; and intersegment eliminations.

The accounting policies of the reportable operating segments are the same as those described in the
summary of significant accounting policies in Note 1. Life evaluates performance of its segments
based on revenues, net income and the segment’s return on allocated capital. The Company charges
direct operating expenses to the appropriate segment and allocates the majority of indirect
expenses to the segments based on an intercompany expense arrangement. Intersegment revenues
primarily occur between Life’s Other category and the operating segments. These amounts primarily
include interest income on allocated surplus, interest charges on excess separate account
surplus, the allocation of net realized capital gains and losses and the allocation of credit risk
charges. Each operating segment is allocated corporate surplus as needed to support its business.
Portfolio management is a corporate function and net realized capital gains and losses on invested
assets are recognized in Life’s Other category. Those net realized capital gains and losses that
are interest rate related are subsequently allocated back to the operating segments in future
periods, with interest, over the average estimated duration of the operating segment’s investment
portfolios, through an adjustment to each respective operating segment’s realized capital gains and
losses, with an offsetting adjustment in the Other category. Net realized capital gains and losses
from non-qualifying derivative strategies, including embedded derivatives, are retained by
Corporate and reported in the Other category. International reports net periodic coupon
settlements on the cross currency swap used to economically hedge currency and interest rate risk
generated from sales of the Company’s yen-based fixed annuity. Net realized capital gains and
losses generated from credit related events, other than net periodic coupon settlements on credit
derivatives, are retained by Corporate. However, in exchange for retaining credit related losses,
the Other category charges each operating segment a “credit-risk” fee through realized capital
gains and losses.

F-21


NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)

3. Segment Information (continued)

The “credit-risk” fee covers fixed income assets included in each operating segment’s general
account and guaranteed separate accounts. The “credit-risk” fee is based upon historical default
rates in the corporate bond market, the Company’s actual default experience and estimates of future
losses. The Company’s revenues are primarily derived from customers within the United States. The
Company’s long-lived assets primarily consist of deferred policy acquisition costs and deferred tax
assets from within the United States.

The positive (negative) impact on realized gains and losses of the segments for allocated interest
rate related realized gains and losses and the credit-risk fees were as follows:

Property & Casualty

Property & Casualty is organized into four reportable operating segments: the underwriting segments
of Business Insurance, Personal Lines, and Specialty Commercial (collectively “Ongoing
Operations”); and the Other Operations segment.

Business Insurance provides standard commercial insurance coverage to small commercial and middle
market commercial businesses primarily throughout the United States. This segment offers workers’
compensation, property, automobile, liability, umbrella and marine coverages. Commercial risk
management products and services are also provided.

Personal Lines provides automobile, homeowners’ and home-based business coverages to the members of
AARP through a direct marketing operation; to individuals who prefer local agent involvement
through a network of independent agents in the standard personal lines market; and through the Omni
Insurance Group, a subsidiary of the Company, in the non-standard automobile market. Personal
Lines also operates a member contact center for health insurance products offered through AARP’s
Health Care Options. AARP accounts for earned premiums of $2.3 billion, $2.1 billion and $2.0
billion in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively, which represented 23%, 23% and 22% of total Property
& Casualty earned premiums in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.

The Specialty Commercial segment offers a variety of customized insurance products and risk
management services. Specialty Commercial provides standard commercial insurance products
including workers’ compensation, automobile and liability coverages to large-sized companies.
Specialty Commercial also provides bond, professional liability, specialty casualty and livestock
coverages, as well as core property and excess and surplus lines coverages not normally written by
standard lines insurers.

Alternative markets within Specialty Commercial, provides insurance products and services primarily
to captive insurance companies, pools and self-insurance groups. In addition, Specialty Commercial
provides third party administrator services for claims administration, integrated benefits,
loss control and performance measurement through Specialty Risk Services, a subsidiary of the
Company.

The Other Operations segment consists of certain property and casualty insurance operations of The
Hartford which have discontinued writing new business and includes substantially all of the
Company’s asbestos and environmental exposures.

Financial
Measures and Other Segment Information

The measure of profit or loss used by The Hartford’s management in evaluating the performance of
its Life segments is net income. Net income is the measure of profit or loss used in evaluating
the performance of Ongoing Operations and the Other Operations segment. Within Ongoing Operations,
the underwriting segments of Business Insurance, Personal Lines and Specialty Commercial are
evaluated by The Hartford’s management primarily based upon underwriting results. Underwriting
results represent premiums

F-22


NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)

3. Segment Information (continued)

earned less incurred claims, claim adjustment expenses and underwriting expenses. The sum of
underwriting results, net investment income, net realized capital gains and losses, other expenses,
and related income taxes is net income (loss).

Certain transactions between segments occur during the year that primarily relate to tax
settlements, insurance coverage, expense reimbursements, services provided, security transfers and
capital contributions. In addition, certain reinsurance stop loss arrangements exist between the
segments which specify that one segment will reimburse another for losses incurred in excess of a
predetermined limit. Also, one segment may purchase group annuity contracts from another to fund
pension costs and annuities to settle casualty claims. In addition, certain intersegment
transactions occur in Life. These transactions include interest income on allocated surplus and
the allocation of certain net realized capital gains and losses through net investment income
utilizing the duration of the segment’s investment portfolios. Consolidated Life net investment
income and net realized capital gains and losses are unaffected by such transactions. During the
year ended December 31, 2003, $1.8 billion of securities were sold by the Property & Casualty
operation to the Life operation (“transferred securities”). For segment reporting, the net gains
on the sale of the transferred securities were deferred and are being recognized by the Property &
Casualty operation in net investment income over the remaining term to maturity of the transferred
securities. When one of the transferred securities is sold by the Life operation, any remaining
deferred gain is recognized immediately by the Property & Casualty operation as a realized capital
gain. The Property & Casualty segments entered into a contract with a subsidiary, whereby
reinsurance is provided to the Property & Casualty operation. This reinsurance program enables
Property & Casualty to purchase reinsurance at the overall Property & Casualty operation level
rather than by the individual segment. The Property & Casualty segments have a contract with a
subsidiary, whereby reinsurance is provided to the Property & Casualty operation. This reinsurance
program enables Property & Casualty to purchase reinsurance at the overall Property & Casualty
operation level rather than by the individual segment. The financial results of this reinsurance
program is included in the Specialty Commercial segment.

The following tables present revenues and net income (loss). Underwriting results are
presented for the Business Insurance, Personal Lines and Specialty Commercial segments, while net
income is presented for each of Life’s reportable segments, total Property & Casualty Ongoing
Operations, Property & Casualty Other Operations and Corporate. Segment information for the
previous periods have been adjusted to reflect the change in composition of reportable operating
segments.

at the interest rate levels projected for the applicable underlying collateral. Actual prepayment

Concentration of Credit Risk

The Company aims to maintain a diversified investment portfolio including issuer, sector and
geographic stratification, where applicable, and has established certain exposure limits,
diversification standards and review procedures to mitigate credit risk.

The Company is not exposed to any concentration of credit risk of a single issuer greater than 10%
of the Company’s stockholders’ equity other than certain U.S. government and government agencies.
Other than U.S. government and government agencies, the Company’s top three exposures by issuer as
of December 31, 2005 were the State of California, AT&T Inc. and the State of Massachusetts which
comprise 0.4%, 0.3% and 0.3%, respectively, of total invested assets and as of December 31, 2004
were the JPMorgan Chase & Co., State of California and Cingular Wireless which comprised 0.7%, 0.4%
and 0.4%, respectively, of total invested assets.

The Company’s top three exposures by industry sector as of December 31, 2005 and 2004 were
financial services, technology and communications and utilities which comprised approximately 9%,
4% and 4%, respectively, of total invested assets as of December 31, 2005 and comprised
approximately 9%, 6% and 4%, respectively, of total invested assets as of December 31, 2004.

The Company’s investments in states, municipalities and political subdivisions are geographically
dispersed throughout the United States, with the largest concentrations as of December 31, 2005 and
2004 in California, New York and Texas which comprise approximately 1% each of total invested
assets as of December 31, 2005 and 2004.

Trading Securities

Equity investments classified as trading are primarily associated with the variable annuity
products offered in Japan and are recorded at fair value. As of December 31, 2005 and 2004,
trading portfolio investments were $24,034 and $13,634, respectively.

Security Unrealized Loss Aging

The Company has a security monitoring process overseen by a committee of investment and accounting
professionals that, on a quarterly basis, identifies securities in an unrealized loss position that
could potentially be other-than-temporarily impaired. For further discussion regarding the
Company’s other-than-temporary impairment policy, see the Investments section of Note 1. Due to
the issuers’ continued satisfaction of the securities’ obligations in accordance with their
contractual terms and the expectation that they will continue to do so, management’s intent and
ability to hold these securities for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated
recovery in market value, as well as the evaluation of the fundamentals of the issuers’ financial
condition and other objective evidence, the Company believes that the prices of the securities in
the sectors identified in the tables below were temporarily depressed as of December 31, 2005 and
2004.

As of December 31, 2005, fixed maturities represented approximately 99% of the Company’s total
unrealized loss amount, which was comprised of approximately 4,000 different securities. The
Company held no securities as of December 31, 2005, that were in an unrealized loss position in
excess of $12. There were no fixed maturities or equity securities as of December 31, 2005, with a
fair value less than 80% of the security’s cost or amortized cost for six continuous months other
than certain ABS and CMBS. Other-than-temporary impairments for certain ABS and CMBS are
recognized if the fair value of the security, as determined by external pricing sources, is less
than its cost or amortized cost and there has been a decrease in the present value of the expected
cash flows since the last reporting period. Based on management’s best estimate of future cash
flows, there were no such ABS and CMBS in an unrealized loss position as of December 31, 2005 that
were deemed to be other-than-temporarily impaired.

Securities in an unrealized loss position for less than twelve months were comprised of over 3,300
securities of which 94%, or $500 of the unrealized loss, were comprised of securities with fair
value to amortized cost ratios at or greater than 90%. The majority of these securities are
investment grade fixed maturities depressed due to changes in interest rates from the date of
purchase.

The securities depressed for twelve months or more as of December 31, 2005 were comprised of over
700 securities, with the majority of the unrealized loss amount relating to ABS, CMBS and corporate
fixed maturities within the financial services sector. A description of the events contributing to
the security types’ unrealized loss position and the factors considered in determining that
recording an other-than-temporary impairment was not warranted are outlined below.

ABS

— The ABS in an unrealized loss position for twelve months or more were primarily supported by
aircraft lease receivables that had suffered a decrease in value in recent years. The Company’s
holdings are ABS secured by leases on aircraft. The decline in the fair values of these securities
is primarily attributable to the high risk premium associated with the increase in volatility of
airline travel demand in recent years, lack of market liquidity in this sector and long term to
maturity of these securities. In recent years, aircraft demand and lease rates have improved as a
result of an increase in worldwide travel. However, the continuing difficulties experienced by
several major U.S. domestic airlines due to high operating costs, including fuel and certain
employee benefits costs, continue to weigh heavily on this sector. Based on the Company’s
projections of future cash flows under distressed scenarios, the Company expects to recover the
full contractual principal and interest payments of these investments. However, future price
recovery will depend on continued improvement in economic fundamentals, political stability,
airline operating performance and collateral value.

CMBS

— The CMBS in an unrealized loss position as of December 31, 2005, were primarily the result
of an increase in interest rates from the security’s purchase date. Substantially all of these
securities are investment grade securities priced at or greater than 90% of amortized cost as of
December 31, 2005. Additional changes in fair value of these securities are primarily dependent on
future changes in interest rates.

F-29


NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)

4. Investments and Derivative Instruments (continued)

Financial services

— Financial services represents approximately $29 of the corporate
securities in an unrealized loss position for twelve months or more. Substantially all of these
securities are investment grade securities priced at or greater than 90% of amortized cost. These
positions are a mixture of fixed and variable rate securities with extended maturity dates, which
have been adversely impacted by changes in interest rates after the purchase date. Additional
changes in fair value of these securities are primarily dependent on future changes in interest
rates.

The remaining balance of $94 in the twelve months or more unrealized loss category is comprised of
approximately 400 securities, substantially all of which were depressed only to a minor extent with
fair value to amortized cost ratios at or greater than 90% as of December 31, 2005. The decline in
market value for these securities is primarily attributable to changes in interest rates.

The following table presents amortized cost, fair value and unrealized losses for the Company’s
fixed maturity and available-for-sale equity securities, aggregated by investment category and
length of time that individual securities have been in a continuous unrealized loss position as of

Mortgage Loans

The carrying value of mortgage loans was $1.7 billion and $1.2 billion for the years ended December
31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The Company’s mortgage loans are collateralized by a variety of
commercial and agricultural properties. The largest concentrations by property type at December
31, 2005 and 2004, are office buildings (approximately 39% and 42%, respectively), retail stores
(approximately 22% and 22%, respectively) and hotels (approximately 15% and 16%, respectively).
The properties collateralizing mortgage loans are geographically dispersed throughout the United
States, with the largest concentration in California (approximately 18% and 25% at December 31,
2005 and 2004, respectively). At December 31, 2005 and 2004, the Company held no impaired,
restructured, delinquent or in-process-of-foreclosure mortgage loans. The Company had no valuation
allowance for mortgage loans at December 31, 2005 and 2004.

Investment Management Activities

Hartford Investment Management Company (“HIMCO”) serves as collateral manager for four synthetic
collateralized loan obligation trusts and a recently issued continuously offered ERISA-eligible
institutional fund (collectively, “synthetic CLOs”) that invest in senior secured bank loans
through total return swaps (“referenced bank loan portfolios”). HIMCO assumed collateral manager
responsibilities for two of the synthetic CLOs in 2004 and subsequently sponsored and issued three
additional synthetic CLOs (one in 2004 and two in 2005). The outstanding notional value of the
referenced bank loan portfolios from the five synthetic CLOs was $1.7 billion and $1.1 billion as
of December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively.

As of December 31, 2005 and 2004, the synthetic CLOs had issued approximately $290 and $185 of
notes and preferred shares (“CLO issuances”), respectively. The proceeds from the CLO issuances
are invested in collateral accounts consisting of high credit quality securities and/or bank loans
that are pledged to the referenced bank loan portfolios’ swap counterparties. Investors in the CLO
issuances receive the net proceeds from the referenced bank loan portfolios. Any principal losses
incurred by the swap

F-30


NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)

4. Investments and Derivative Instruments (continued)

counterparties associated with the referenced bank loan portfolios are borne by the CLO
issuances investors through the total return swaps. Approximately $240 and $170 of the CLO
issuances were held by third party investors as of December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The
third party investors in the synthetic CLOs have recourse only to the synthetic CLOs’ assets and
not to the general credit of the Company. Accordingly, the Company’s financial exposure to these
synthetic CLOs is limited to its direct investment in certain notes and preferred shares issued by
the synthetic CLOs and loss of management fees.

Pursuant to the requirements of FIN 46R, the Company has concluded that the five synthetic CLOs are
variable interest entities (“VIEs”) and for two of the synthetic CLOs, the Company is the primary
beneficiary and must consolidate these synthetic CLOs. Accordingly, the Company has reflected the
assets and liabilities of two synthetic CLOs in its consolidated financial statements. As of
December 31, 2005, the Company recorded $75 of cash and fixed maturities, total return swaps with a
fair value of $2 in other investments and $42 in other liabilities related to the CLO issuances in
its consolidated balance sheets. As of December 31, 2004, the Company recorded in the consolidated
balance sheets $65 of cash and fixed maturities, total return swaps with a fair value of $3 in
other investments and $52 related to the CLO issuances in other liabilities. The Company’s
investments and accrued management fees in the consolidated synthetic CLOs, which is its maximum
exposure to loss, was $35 and $14, as of December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively.

Pursuant to FIN 46R, the Company has concluded that it is not the primary beneficiary of the other
three synthetic CLOs managed by HIMCO, one of which was issued in 2005. As a result, these
synthetic CLOs are not consolidated by the Company. The Company’s maximum exposure to loss from
the non-consolidated synthetic CLOs (consisting of the Company’s investments and accrued management
fees) was approximately $21 and $3 as of December 31, 2005 and 2004. The collateral management
fees earned by HIMCO for the three non-consolidated synthetic CLOs totaled $6 and $3 for the years
ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively, and are reported in other income in the
consolidated statements of operations.

The Company utilized qualitative and quantitative analyses to assess whether it was the primary
beneficiary of the VIEs. The qualitative considerations included the Company’s co-investment in
relation to the total CLO issuance. The quantitative analysis included calculating the variability
of the CLO issuance based upon statistical techniques utilizing historical normalized default and
recovery rates for the average credit quality of the initial referenced bank loan portfolio.

Derivative Instruments

Cash-Flow Hedges

Interest rate swaps

Interest rate swaps are primarily used to convert
interest receipts on floating-rate fixed maturity
securities to fixed rates. These derivatives are
predominantly used to better match cash receipts
from assets with cash disbursements required to fund
liabilities. The Company also enters into forward
starting swap agreements to hedge the interest rate
exposure on anticipated fixed-rate asset purchases
due to changes in the benchmark interest rate,
London-Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”). These
derivatives were structured to hedge interest rate
exposure inherent in the assumptions used to price
primarily certain long-term disability products.

Interest rate swaps are also used to hedge a portion
of the Company’s floating rate guaranteed investment
contracts. These derivatives convert the floating
rate guaranteed investment contract payments to a
fixed rate to better match the cash receipts earned
from the supporting investment portfolio.

Other Investment and Risk Management Activities

Interest rate caps and swaption contracts

The Company is exposed to policyholder
surrenders during a rising interest rate
environment. Interest rate cap and
swaption contracts are used to mitigate the
Company’s loss in a rising interest rate
environment. The increase in yield from
the cap and swaption contract in a rising
interest rate environment may be used to
raise credited rates, thereby increasing
the Company’s competitiveness and reducing
the policyholder’s incentive to surrender.
These derivatives are also used to reduce
the duration risk in certain investment
portfolios. These derivative instruments
are structured to hedge the durations of
fixed maturity investments to match certain
life products in accordance with the
Company’s asset and liability management
policy.

The Company also uses an interest rate cap
as an economic hedge of the interest rate
risk related to Company issued debt. In a
rising interest rate environment, the cap
will limit the net interest expense on the
hedged fixed rate debt.

Credit default and total return swaps

The Company enters into swap agreements in
which the Company assumes credit exposure
of an individual entity, referenced index
or asset pool. The Company assumes credit
exposure to individual entities through
credit default swaps. These contracts
entitle the company to receive a periodic
fee in exchange for an obligation to
compensate the derivative counterparty
should a credit event occur on the part of
the referenced security issuer. Credit
events typically include failure on the
part of the referenced security issuer to
make a fixed dollar amount of contractual
interest or principal payments or
bankruptcy. The maximum potential future
exposure to the Company is the notional
value of the swap contracts, $455 and $291,
after-tax, as of December 31, 2005 and
2004, respectively.

The Company also assumes exposure to the
change in value of indices or asset pools
through total return swaps and credit
spreadlocks. As of December 31, 2005 and
2004, the maximum potential future exposure
to the Company from such contracts is $899
and $809, after-tax, respectively.

The Company enters into credit default swap
agreements, in which the Company pays a
derivative counterparty a periodic fee in
exchange for compensation from the
counterparty should a credit event occur on

The Company entered into these agreements
as an efficient means to reduce credit
exposure to specified issuers or sectors.
In addition, the Company enters into option
contracts to receive protection should a
credit event occur on the part of the
referenced security issuer.

Options

The Company writes option contracts for a premium to

the then fair value of the bond in excess of the
strike value, which is expected to be entirely
offset by the appreciation in the value of the

Product derivatives

The Company offers certain variable annuity products
with a GMWB rider. The GMWB is a bifurcated
embedded derivative that provides the policyholder
with a GRB if the account value is reduced to zero
through a combination of market declines and
withdrawals. The GRB is generally equal to premiums
less withdrawals. The policyholder also has the
option, after a specified time period, to reset the
GRB to the then-current account value, if greater.
For a further discussion, see the Derivative
Instruments section of Note 1. The notional value

Derivative change in value includes hedge ineffectiveness for cash-flow, fair-value and net
investment hedges and total change in value of other investment and risk management
activities.

The increase in notional amount since December 31, 2004, is primarily due to an increase in
derivatives associated with GMWB product sales, as well as an increase in yen fixed annuity hedging
instruments. The increase in net fair value of derivative instruments since December 31, 2004, was
primarily due to an increase in market value of derivatives hedging foreign bonds as a result of
the strengthening of the U.S. dollar in comparison to foreign currencies and an increase in GMWB
related derivatives resulting from the increase in equity market volatility, partially offset by a
decline in market value of yen fixed annuity hedging instruments due to the strengthening of the
U.S. dollar against the yen.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)

4. Investments and Derivative Instruments (continued)

For the year ended December 31, 2003, the after-tax net gains and losses representing the
total ineffectiveness on all fair value, cash flow and net investment hedges were less than $1.

The yen denominated fixed annuity product (“yen fixed annuities”) is recorded in the consolidated
balance sheets in other policyholder funds and benefits payable in U.S. dollars based upon the
December 31, 2005 yen to U.S. dollar spot rate. During 2004 and the first six months of 2005, the
Company managed the yen currency risk associated with the yen fixed annuities with pay fixed U.S.
dollar receive fixed yen, zero coupon currency swaps (“fixed currency swaps”). In order to
mitigate the U.S. interest rate exposure, the fixed currency swaps, with a notional value of $1.2
billion, were closed or restructured in June 2005. The Company then entered into pay variable U.S.
dollar receive fixed yen, zero coupon currency swaps (“currency swaps”) associated with the yen
fixed annuities. As of December 31, 2005, the notional value and fair value of the currency swaps
were $1.7 billion and $(179), respectively.

Although economically an effective hedge, a divergence between the yen denominated fixed annuity
product liability and the currency swaps exists primarily due to the difference in the basis of
accounting between the liability and the derivative instruments (i.e. historical cost versus fair
value). The yen denominated fixed annuity product liabilities are recorded on a historical cost
basis and are only adjusted for changes in foreign spot rates and accrued income. The currency
swaps are recorded at fair value incorporating changes in value due to changes in foreign exchange
rates, Japanese and U.S. interest rates and accrued income. An after-tax net loss of $23 and a net
gain of $2 for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively, which includes the changes
in value of the currency swaps, fixed currency swaps and the yen fixed annuity contract
remeasurement, was recorded in net realized capital gains and losses.

During the third quarter of 2005, the Company terminated its yen denominated forwards that were
used to hedge the yen to U.S. dollar exchange rate volatility related to the net investment in the
Japanese Life subsidiary (Hartford Life Insurance KK). The notional and fair value of the
contracts terminated during the third quarter of 2005 were $408 and $17, respectively. The
after-tax net gains (losses) included in the foreign currency transaction adjustment associated
with the net investment hedge was $12, $(14) and $(3) as of December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003,
respectively.

As of December 31, 2005 and 2004, the after-tax deferred net gains on derivative instruments
accumulated in AOCI that are expected to be reclassified to earnings during the next twelve months
are $1 and $7, respectively. This expectation is based on the anticipated interest payments on
hedged investments in fixed maturity securities that will occur over the next twelve months, at
which time the Company will recognize the deferred net gains (losses) as an adjustment to interest
income over the term of the investment cash flows. The maximum term over which the Company is
hedging its exposure to the variability of future cash flows (for all forecasted transactions,
excluding interest payments on variable-rate debt) is twenty-four months. For the years ended
December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, the Company had less than $1 of net reclassifications from AOCI
to earnings resulting from the discontinuance of cash-flow hedges due to the forecasted
transactions that were no longer probable of occurring.

Securities Lending and Collateral Arrangements

The Company participates in a securities lending program to generate additional income, whereby
certain domestic fixed income securities are loaned for a short period of time from the Company’s
portfolio to qualifying third parties, via two lending agents. Borrowers of these securities
provide collateral of 102% of the market value of the loaned securities. Acceptable collateral may
be in the form of cash or U.S. Government securities. The market value of the loaned securities is
monitored and additional collateral is obtained if the market value of the collateral falls below
100% of the market value of the loaned securities. Under the terms of the securities lending
program, the lending agent indemnifies the Company against borrower defaults. As of December 31,
2005 and 2004, the fair value of the loaned securities was approximately $1.2 billion and $1.5
billion, respectively, and was included in fixed maturities in the consolidated balance sheets.
The Company retains a portion of the income earned from the cash collateral or receives a fee from
the borrower. The Company recorded before-tax income from securities lending transactions, net of
lending fees, of $3 and $2 for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively, which was
included in net investment income.

The Company enters into various collateral arrangements in connection with its derivative
instruments, which require both the pledging and accepting of collateral. As of December 31, 2005
and 2004, collateral pledged of $282 and $337, respectively, was included in fixed maturities in
the consolidated balance sheets.

As of December 31, 2005 and 2004, the Company had accepted collateral relating to the securities
lending program and derivative instruments consisting of cash, U.S. Government and U.S. Government
agency securities with a fair value of $1.4 billion and $1.7 billion, respectively. At December
31, 2005 and 2004, cash collateral of $1.2 billion and $1.6 billion, respectively, was invested and
recorded in the consolidated balance sheets in fixed maturities with a corresponding amount
recorded in other liabilities. The Company is only permitted by contract to sell or repledge the
noncash collateral in the event of a default by the counterparty and none of the collateral has
been sold or repledged at December 31, 2005 and 2004. As of December 31, 2005 and 2004, all
collateral accepted was held in separate custodial accounts.

As discussed in the Investment Management Activities section above, the Company manages and invests
in certain synthetic CLOs. Also, for certain of these synthetic CLOs, the Company is the primary
beneficiary and must consolidate the CLOs. These CLOs have entered into various collateral
arrangements with third party swap counterparties. For further discussion, see the Investment
Management Activities above.

Securities on Deposit with States

The Company is required by law to deposit securities with government agencies in states where it
conducts business. As of December 31, 2005 and 2004, the fair value of securities on deposit was
approximately $1.1 billion and $1.3 billion, respectively.

5. Fair Value of Financial Instruments

SFAS No. 107, “Disclosures about Fair Value of Financial Instruments”, requires disclosure of
fair value information of financial instruments.

For certain financial instruments where quoted market prices are not available, other independent
valuation techniques and assumptions are used. Because considerable judgment is used, these
estimates are not necessarily indicative of amounts that could be realized in a current market
exchange. SFAS No. 107 excludes certain financial instruments from disclosure, including insurance
contracts, other than financial guarantees and investment contracts.

The Hartford uses the following methods and assumptions in estimating the fair value of each class
of financial instrument. Fair value for fixed maturities and marketable equity securities
approximates those quotations published by applicable stock exchanges or received from other
reliable sources.

For policy loans, carrying amounts approximate fair value.

For mortgage loans, fair values were estimated using discounted cash flow calculations based
on current incremental lending rates for similar type loans.

Fair value of limited partnerships and trusts is based on external market valuations from
partnership and trust management.

Derivative instruments are reported at fair value based upon internally established valuations that
are consistent with external valuation models, quotations furnished by dealers in such instrument
or market quotations.

Other policyholder funds and benefits payable fair value information is determined by estimating
future cash flows, discounted at the current market rate. For further discussion of other
policyholder funds and derivatives, see Note 1.

For commercial paper, carrying amounts approximate fair value.

Fair value for long-term debt is based on market quotations from independent third party
pricing services.

6. Reinsurance

The Hartford cedes insurance to other insurers in order to limit its maximum losses and to
diversify its exposures. Such transfers do not relieve The Hartford of its primary liability under
policies it wrote and, as such, failure of reinsurers to honor their obligations could result in
losses to The Hartford. The Hartford also is a member of and participates in several reinsurance
pools and associations. The Hartford evaluates the financial condition of its reinsurers and
monitors concentrations of credit risk. The Hartford’s property and casualty reinsurance is placed
with reinsurers that meet strict financial criteria established by a credit committee. As of
December 31, 2005 and 2004, The Hartford had no reinsurance-related concentrations of credit risk
greater than 10% of the Company’s stockholders’ equity.

Life

In accordance with normal industry practice, Life is involved in both the cession and assumption of
insurance with other insurance and reinsurance companies. As of December 31, 2005, the Company’s
current policy for the largest amount of life insurance retained on any one life by any one of the
life operations was approximately $5.0, which increased from $2.9 as of December 31, 2004. In
addition, the Company reinsures the majority of minimum death benefit guarantees as well as the
guaranteed withdrawal benefits on contracts issued prior to July 2003 offered in connection with
its variable annuity contracts.

Life insurance fees, earned premiums and other were comprised of the following:

$

$

$

Life reinsures certain of its risks to other reinsurers under yearly renewable term,
coinsurance, and modified coinsurance arrangements. Yearly renewable term and coinsurance
arrangements result in passing a portion of the risk to the reinsurer. Generally, the reinsurer
receives a proportionate amount of the premiums less an allowance for commissions and expenses and
is liable for a corresponding proportionate amount of all benefit payments. Modified coinsurance
is similar to coinsurance except that the cash and investments that support the liabilities for
contract benefits are not transferred to the assuming company, and settlements are made on a net
basis between the companies.

Life also purchases reinsurance covering the death benefit guarantees on a portion of its variable
annuity business. On March 16, 2003, a final decision and award was issued in the previously
disclosed arbitration between subsidiaries of the Company and one of their primary reinsurers
relating to policies with death benefits written from 1994 to 1999. (For further discussion of
this arbitration, see Note 12.)

F-37


NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)

6. Reinsurance (continued)

The cost of reinsurance related to long-duration contracts is accounted for over the life of
the underlying reinsured policies using assumptions consistent with those used to account for the
underlying policies. Life insurance recoveries on ceded reinsurance contracts, which reduce death
and other benefits, were $351, $478 and $541 for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003,
respectively. Life also assumes reinsurance from other insurers.

Property and Casualty

In managing property and casualty risk, The Hartford utilizes
reinsurance to transfer exposures to well-established and financially
secure reinsurers. Reinsurance is used to manage aggregate exposures
as well as specific risks based on accumulated property and casualty
liabilities in certain geographic zones. All treaty purchases related
to the Company’s property and casualty operations are
administered by a centralized function to support a consistent
strategy and ensure that the reinsurance activities are fully
integrated into the organization’s risk management processes.

A variety of traditional reinsurance products are used as part of the
Company’s risk management strategy, including excess of loss
occurrence-based products that protect aggregate property and
workers’
compensation exposures, and individual risk or quota share products,
that protect specific classes or lines of business. There are no
significant finite risk contracts in place and the statutory surplus
benefit from all such prior year contracts is immaterial.
Facultative reinsurance is also used to manage policy-specific risk
exposures based on established underwriting guidelines. The Hartford
also participates in governmentally administered reinsurance
facilities such as the Florida Hurricane Catastrophe Fund
(“FHCF”), the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program established
under The Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of 2002 and other reinsurance
programs relating to particular risks or specific lines of
business.

The Company has several catastrophe reinsurance programs, including
reinsurance treaties that cover property and workers’
compensation losses aggregating from single catastrophe events.

The effect of reinsurance on property and casualty premiums written and earned was as follows:

Ceded losses which reduce claims and claim adjustment expenses incurred, were $1.7 billion,
$960 and $2.1 billion for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.

Reinsurance recoverables include balances due from reinsurance companies for paid and unpaid
claim and claim adjustment expenses and are presented net of an allowance for uncollectible
reinsurance. The reinsurance recoverables balance includes an estimate of the amount of gross
claim and claim adjustment expense reserves that may be ceded under the terms of the reinsurance
agreements, including incurred but not reported unpaid losses. The Company’s estimate of claim and
claim adjustment expense reserves ceded to reinsurers is based on assumptions that are consistent
with those used in establishing the gross reserves for business ceded to the reinsurance contracts.
The Company calculates its ceded reinsurance projection based on the terms of any applicable
facultative and treaty reinsurance, including an estimate of how incurred but not reported losses
will ultimately be ceded by reinsurance agreement. Accordingly, the Company’s estimate of
reinsurance recoverables is subject to similar risks and uncertainties as the estimate of the gross
reserve for unpaid claim and claim adjustment expenses.

The allowance for uncollectible reinsurance was $413 and $374 as of December 31, 2005 and 2004,
respectively. The allowance for uncollectible reinsurance reflects management’s current estimate
of reinsurance cessions that may be uncollectible in the future due to reinsurers’ unwillingness or
inability to pay and contemplates recoveries under ceded reinsurance contracts and settlements of
disputes that could be different than the ceded liabilities. The Company analyzes recent
developments in commutation activity between reinsurers and cedants, recent trends in arbitration
and litigation outcomes in disputes between reinsurers and cedants and the overall credit quality
of the Company’s reinsurers. Where its contracts permit, the Company secures future claim
obligations with various forms of collateral, including irrevocable letters of credit, secured
trusts, funds held accounts and group-wide offsets.

Due to the inherent uncertainties as to collection and the length of time before reinsurance
recoverables become due, it is possible that future adjustments to the Company’s reinsurance
recoverables, net of the allowance, could be required, which could have a material adverse effect
on the Company’s consolidated results of operations or cash flows in a particular quarter or annual
period.

9. Separate Accounts, Death Benefits and Other Insurance Benefit Features

The Hartford records the variable portion of individual variable annuities, 401(k),
institutional, governmental, private placement life and variable life insurance products within
separate account assets and liabilities, which are reported at fair value. Separate account assets
are segregated from other investments. Investment income and gains and losses from those separate
account assets, which accrue directly to, and whereby investment risk is borne by the policyholder,
are offset by the related liability changes within the same line item in the statement of income.
The fees earned for administrative and contract holder maintenance services performed for these
separate accounts are included in fee income. During 2005, there were no gains or losses on
transfers of assets from the general account to the separate account. The Company had recorded
certain market value adjusted (“MVA”) fixed annuity products and modified guarantee life insurance
(primarily the Company’s Compound Rate Contract (“CRC”) and associated assets) as separate account
assets and liabilities through December 31, 2003. Notwithstanding the market value adjustment
feature in this product, all of the investment performance of the separate account assets is not
being passed to the contract holder. Therefore, it does not meet the conditions for separate
account reporting under SOP 03-1. Separate account assets and liabilities related to CRC of $11.7
billion were reclassified to, and revalued in, the general account upon adoption of SOP 03-1 on
January 1, 2004.

Prior to the adoption of SOP 03-1, the Company had also recorded its variable annuity products
offered in Japan in separate account assets and liabilities through December 31, 2003. These
assets are not legally insulated from general creditors and therefore did not meet the conditions
for separate account reporting under SOP 03-1. On January 1, 2004, separate account assets and
liabilities in Japan of $6.2 billion were reclassified to the general account with no change in
value. The investment assets were recorded at fair value in a trading securities portfolio. As of
December 31, 2005, due to additional sales of Japan variable annuity products and positive
performance of the Japanese equity markets these assets had increased to $24.6 billion.

9. Separate Accounts, Death Benefits and Other Insurance Benefit Features (continued)

Many of the variable annuity contracts issued by the Company offer various guaranteed minimum
death, withdrawal and income benefits. Guaranteed minimum death and income benefits are offered in
various forms as described in the footnotes to the table below. The Company currently reinsures a
significant portion of the death benefit guarantees associated with its in-force block of business.
Changes in the gross U.S. guaranteed minimum death benefit (“GMDB”) and Japan GMDB/guaranteed
minimum income benefit (“GMIB”) liability balance sold with annuity products are as follows:

The reinsurance recoverable asset related to the U.S. GMDB was $108 upon adoption of SOP
03-1 and $64 as of December 31, 2004.

The net GMDB and GMIB liability is established by estimating the expected value of net
reinsurance costs and death and income benefits in excess of the projected account balance. The
excess death and income benefits and net reinsurance costs are recognized ratably over the
accumulation period based on total expected assessments. The GMDB and GMIB liabilities are recorded
in Future Policy Benefits on the Company’s balance sheet. Changes in the GMDB and GMIB liability
are recorded in Benefits, Claims and Claims Adjustment Expenses in the Company’s statement of
operations. The Company regularly evaluates estimates used and adjusts the additional liability
balances, with a related charge or credit to benefit expense, if actual experience or other
evidence suggests that earlier assumptions should be revised.

The determination of the GMDB and GMIB liabilities and related GMDB reinsurance recoverable is
based on models that involve a range of scenarios and assumptions, including those regarding
expected market rates of return and volatility, contract surrender rates and mortality experience.
The following assumptions were used to determine the GMDB and GMIB liabilities as of December 31,
2005 and 2004:

the most recent five to seven year anniversary account value before age 80 (adjusted for
withdrawals).

[7]

Return of premium: the death benefit is the greater of current account value and net
premiums paid.

[8]

Death benefits include a Return of Premium and MAV (before age 75) as described above and
income benefits include a guarantee to return initial investment, adjusted for earnings
liquidity, through a fixed annuity, after a minimum deferral period of 10, 15, or 20 years.
The guaranteed remaining balance related to the Japan GMIB was $15.2 billion and $7.3 billion
as of December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively.

The Company offers certain variable annuity products with a guaranteed minimum withdrawal
benefit (“GMWB”) rider. The GMWB provides the policyholder with a guaranteed remaining balance
(“GRB”) if the account value is reduced to zero through a combination of market declines and
withdrawals. The GRB is generally equal to premiums less withdrawals. However, annual withdrawals
that exceed a specific percentage of the premiums paid may reduce the GRB by an amount greater than
the withdrawals and may also impact the guaranteed annual withdrawal amount that subsequently
applies after the excess annual withdrawals occur. For certain of the withdrawal benefit features,
the policyholder also has the option, after a specified time period, to reset the GRB to the
then-current account value, if greater. In addition, the Company has recently added a feature,
available to new contract holders, that allows the policyholder the option to receive the
guaranteed annual withdrawal, amount for as long as they are alive. In this new feature, in all
cases the contract holder or their beneficiary will receive the GRB and the GRB is reset on an
annual basis to the maximum anniversary account value subject to a cap. The GMWB represents an
embedded derivative in the variable annuity contracts that is required to be reported separately
from the host variable annuity contract. It is carried at fair value and reported in other
policyholder funds. The fair value of the GMWB obligation is calculated based on actuarial and
capital market assumptions related to the projected cash flows, including benefits and related
contract charges, over the lives of the contracts, incorporating expectations concerning
policyholder behavior. Because of the dynamic and complex nature of these cash flows, stochastic
techniques under a variety of market return scenarios and other best estimate assumptions are used.
Estimating these cash flows involves numerous estimates and subjective judgments including those
regarding expected market rates of return, market volatility, correlations of market returns and
discount rates. At each valuation date, the Company assumes expected returns based on risk-free
rates as represented by the current LIBOR forward curve rates; market volatility assumptions for
each underlying index based on a blend of observed market “implied volatility” data and annualized
standard deviations of monthly returns using the most recent 20 years of observed market
performance; correlations of market returns across underlying indices based on actual observed
market returns and relationships over the ten years preceding the valuation date; and current
risk-free spot rates as represented by the current LIBOR spot curve to determine the present value
of expected future cash flows produced in the stochastic projection process. During the 4th
quarter of 2005, the Company reflected a newly reliable market input for volatility on Standard and
Poor’s (“S&P”) 500 index options. The impact of reflecting the newly reliable market input for the
S&P 500 index volatility resulted in a decrease to the GMWB asset of $83. The impact to net income
including other changes in assumptions, after DAC amortization and taxes was a loss of $18.

9. Separate Accounts, Death Benefits and Other Insurance Benefit Features (continued)

As of December 31, 2005 and December 31, 2004, the embedded derivative asset recorded for
GMWB, before reinsurance or hedging, was $8 and $129, respectively. During 2005, 2004 and 2003,
the increase (decrease) in value of the GMWB, before reinsurance and hedging, reported in realized
gains was $(64) and $54 and $178, respectively. There were no payments made for the GMWB during
2005, 2004 or 2003.

As of December 31, 2005 and December 31, 2004, $26.4 billion, or 69%, and $18.1 billion, or 61%,
respectively, of account value representing substantially all of the contracts written after July
2003, with the GMWB feature were unreinsured. In order to minimize the volatility associated with
the unreinsured GMWB liabilities, the Company has established an alternative risk management
strategy. In 2003, the Company began hedging its unreinsured GMWB exposure using interest rate
futures, and Standard and Poor’s (“S&P”) 500 and NASDAQ index options and futures contracts.
During 2004, the Company began using Europe, Australasia and Far East (“EAFE”) Index swaps to
hedge GMWB exposure to international equity markets. The GRB as of December 31, 2005 and 2004
was $31.8 billion and $25.4 billion, respectively.

A contract is ‘in the money’ if the contract holder’s GRB is greater than the account value. For
contracts that were ‘in the money’, the Company’s
exposure as of December 31, 2005, was $8.
However, the only ways the contract holder can monetize the excess of the GRB over the account
value of the contract is upon death or if their account value is reduced to zero through a
combination of a series of withdrawals that do not exceed a specific percentage of the premiums
paid per year and market declines. If the account value is reduced to zero, the contract holder will receive a period
certain annuity equal to the remaining GRB. As the amount of the excess of the GRB over the
account value can fluctuate with equity market returns on a daily basis the ultimate amount to be
paid by the Company, if any, is uncertain and could be significantly
more or less than $8.

Account balances of contracts with guarantees were invested in variable separate accounts as
follows:

As of December 31, 2005

Equity securities (including mutual funds)

$

94,419

Cash and cash equivalents

As of December 31, 2005, approximately 16% of the equity securities above were invested in
fixed income securities through these funds and approximately 84% were invested in equity
securities.

The Individual Life segment sells universal life-type contracts with and without certain secondary
guarantees, such as a guarantee that the policy will not lapse, even if the account value is
reduced to zero, as long as the policyholder makes sufficient premium payments to meet the
requirements of the guarantee. The cumulative effect on net income upon recording additional
liabilities for universal life-type contracts and the related secondary guarantees, in accordance
with SOP 03-1, was not material. As of December 31, 2005, the liability for secondary guarantees
as well as the amounts incurred and paid during the year was immaterial.

10. Sales Inducements

The Company currently offers enhanced crediting rates or bonus payments to contract holders on
certain of its individual and group annuity products. Through December 31, 2003, the expense
associated with offering certain of these bonuses was deferred and amortized over the contingent
deferred sales charge period. Others were expensed as incurred. Effective January 1, 2004, upon
the Company’s adoption of SOP 03-1, the expense associated with offering a bonus is deferred and
amortized over the life of the related contract in a pattern consistent with the amortization of
deferred policy acquisition costs. Also, effective January 1, 2004, amortization expense
associated with expenses previously deferred is recorded over the remaining life of the contract
rather than over the contingent deferred sales charge period.

Changes in deferred sales inducement activity were as follows for the year ended December 31:

11. Reserves for Claims and Claim Adjustment Expenses

As described in Note 1, The Hartford establishes reserves for claims and claim adjustment
expenses on reported and unreported claims. These reserve estimates are based on known facts and
interpretations of circumstances, and consideration of various internal factors including The
Hartford’s experience with similar cases, historical trends involving claim payment patterns, loss
payments, pending levels of unpaid claims, loss control programs and product mix. In addition, the
reserve estimates are influenced by consideration of various external factors including court
decisions, economic conditions and public attitudes. The effects of inflation are implicitly
considered in the reserving process.

The establishment of appropriate reserves, including reserves for catastrophes and asbestos and
environmental claims, is inherently uncertain. The Hartford regularly updates its reserve
estimates as new information becomes available and events unfold that may have an impact on
unsettled claims. Changes in prior year reserve estimates, which may be material, are reflected in
the results of operations in the period such changes are determined to be necessary. For further
discussion of asbestos and environmental claims, see Note 12.

The favorable prior year claim development in 2005 is principally due to continued strong
disability claims management as well as favorable development on the experience rated financial
institutions block. The favorable loss experience on the financial institutions block inversely
impacts the commission expenses incurred. For the year ended December 31, 2004, incurred and paid
expenses increased from 2003 due to the acquisition of CNA. The favorable prior year claim
development in 2004 was primarily due to favorable claims experience.

11. Reserves for Claims and Claim Adjustment Expenses (continued)

In the opinion of management, based upon the known facts and current law, the reserves
recorded for The Hartford’s property and casualty businesses at December 31, 2005 represent the
Company’s best estimate of its ultimate liability for claims and claim adjustment expenses related
to losses covered by policies written by the Company. Based on information or trends that are not
presently known, future reserve reestimates may result in adjustments to these reserves. Such
adjustments could possibly be significant, reflecting any variety of new and adverse or favorable
trends. Because of the significant uncertainties surrounding environmental and particularly
asbestos exposures, it is possible that management’s estimate of the ultimate liabilities for these
claims may change and that the required adjustment to recorded reserves could exceed the currently
recorded reserves by an amount that could be material to The Hartford’s results of operations,
financial condition and liquidity. For a further discussion see Note 12.

Examples of current trends include increases in medical cost inflation rates, changes in internal
claim practices, changes in the legislative and regulatory environment over workers’ compensation
claims, evolving exposures to claims asserted against religious institutions and other
organizations relating to molestation or abuse and other mass torts. In the case of the reserves
for asbestos exposures, factors contributing to the high degree of uncertainty include inadequate
development patterns, plaintiffs’ expanding theories of liability, the risks inherent in major
litigation, and inconsistent emerging legal doctrines. In the case of the reserves for
environmental exposures, factors contributing to the high degree of uncertainty include expanding
theories of liabilities and damages; the risks inherent in major litigation; inconsistent decisions
concerning the existence and scope of coverage for environmental claims; and uncertainty as to the
monetary amount being sought by the claimant from the insured.

The prior year provision of $248 in 2005 includes reserve strengthening for workers’ compensation
claim payments expected to emerge after 20 years of development, assumed casualty reinsurance,
adverse development in environmental reserves, the 2004 hurricanes and general liability reserves
for accident years 2000 to 2003. This strengthening was partially offset by reserve releases for
allocated loss adjustment expenses and workers’ compensation reserves for accident years 2003 and
2004. The prior year provision of $414 in 2004 includes reserve strengthening for construction
defects claims, assumed casualty reinsurance and environmental claims as well as a reduction in the
reinsurance recoverable asset associated with older, long-term casualty liabilities. The 2004
reserve strengthening was partially offset by a reduction in September 11 reserves. The prior year
provision in 2003 is primarily due to reserve strengthening of $2.6 billion based on a ground up
study of asbestos reserves. The ground up study confirmed the Company’s view of the existence of a
substantial long-term deterioration in the asbestos litigation environment.

12. Commitments and Contingencies

Litigation

The Hartford is involved in claims litigation arising in the ordinary course of business, both as a
liability insurer defending third-party claims brought against insureds and as an insurer defending
coverage claims brought against it. The Hartford accounts for such activity through the
establishment of unpaid claim and claim adjustment expense reserves. Subject to the uncertainties
discussed below under the caption “Asbestos and Environmental Claims,” management expects that the
ultimate liability, if any, with respect to such ordinary-course claims litigation, after
consideration of provisions made for potential losses and costs of defense, will not be material to
the consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash flows of The Hartford.

The Hartford is also involved in other kinds of legal actions, some of which assert claims for
substantial amounts. These actions include, among others, putative state and federal class actions
seeking certification of a state or national class. Such putative class actions have alleged, for
example, underpayment of claims or improper underwriting practices in connection with various kinds
of insurance policies, such as personal and commercial automobile, property, and inland marine;
improper sales practices in connection with the sale of life insurance and other investment
products; improper fee arrangements in connection with mutual funds; and unfair settlement
practices in connection with the settlement of asbestos claims. The Hartford also is involved in
individual actions in which punitive damages are sought, such as claims alleging bad faith in the
handling of insurance claims. Like many other insurers, The Hartford also has been joined in
actions by asbestos plaintiffs asserting that insurers had a duty to protect the public from the
dangers of asbestos. Management expects that the ultimate liability, if any, with respect to such
lawsuits, after consideration of provisions made for estimated losses, will not be material to the
consolidated financial condition of The Hartford. Nonetheless, given the large or indeterminate
amounts sought in certain of these actions, and the inherent unpredictability of litigation, it is
possible that an adverse outcome in certain matters could, from time to time, have a material
adverse effect on the Company’s consolidated results of operations or cash flows in particular
quarterly or annual periods.

Broker
Compensation Litigation

— On October 14, 2004, the New York Attorney General’s Office filed
a civil complaint (the “NYAG Complaint”) against Marsh Inc. and Marsh & McLennan Companies, Inc.
(collectively, “Marsh”) alleging, among other things, that certain insurance companies, including
The Hartford, participated with Marsh in arrangements to submit inflated bids for business
insurance and paid contingent commissions to ensure that Marsh would direct business to them. The
Hartford was not joined as a defendant in the action, which has since settled. Since the filing of
the NYAG Complaint, several private actions have been filed against the Company asserting claims
arising from the allegations of the NYAG Complaint.

F-47


NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)

12. Commitments and Contingencies (continued)

Two securities class actions, now consolidated, have been filed in the United States District
Court for the District of Connecticut alleging claims against the Company and certain of its
executive officers under Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act and SEC Rule 10b-5. The
consolidated amended complaint alleges on behalf of a putative class of shareholders that the
Company and the four named individual defendants, as control persons of the Company, failed to
disclose to the investing public that The Hartford’s business and growth was predicated on the
unlawful activity alleged in the NYAG Complaint. The class period alleged is August 6, 2003
through October 13, 2004, the day before the NYAG Complaint was filed. The complaint seeks damages
and attorneys’ fees. Defendants filed a motion to dismiss in June 2005, and the Court heard oral
argument on December 22, 2005. The Company and the individual defendants dispute the allegations
and intend to defend these actions vigorously.

Two corporate derivative actions, now consolidated, also have been filed in the same court. The
consolidated amended complaint, brought by a shareholder on behalf of the Company against its
directors and an executive officer, alleges that the defendants knew adverse non-public information
about the activities alleged in the NYAG Complaint and concealed and misappropriated that
information to make profitable stock trades, thereby breaching their fiduciary duties, abusing
their control, committing gross mismanagement, wasting corporate assets, and unjustly enriching
themselves. The complaint seeks damages, injunctive relief, disgorgement, and attorneys’ fees.
Defendants filed a motion to dismiss in May 2005, and the plaintiffs thereafter agreed to stay
further proceedings pending resolution of the motion to dismiss the securities class action. All
defendants dispute the allegations and intend to defend these actions vigorously.

Three consolidated putative class actions filed in the same court on behalf of participants in the
Company’s 401(k) plan, alleging that the Company and other plan fiduciaries breached their
fiduciary duties to plan participants by, among other things, failing to inform them of the risk
associated with investment in the Company’s stock as a result of the activity alleged in the NYAG
Complaint, have been voluntarily dismissed by the plaintiffs without payment.

The Company is also a defendant in a multidistrict litigation in federal district court in New
Jersey. There are two consolidated amended complaints filed in the multidistrict litigation, one
related to alleged conduct in connection with the sale of property-casualty insurance and the other
related to alleged conduct in connection with the sale of group benefits products. The Company and
various of its subsidiaries are named in both complaints. The actions assert, on behalf of a class
of persons who purchased insurance through the broker defendants, claims under the Sherman Act, the
Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (“RICO”), state law, and in the case of the
group benefits complaint, claims under ERISA arising from conduct similar to that alleged in the
NYAG Complaint. The class period alleged is 1994 through the date of class certification, which
has not yet occurred. The complaints seek treble damages, injunctive and declaratory relief, and
attorneys’ fees. The Company also has been named in two similar actions filed in state courts,
which the defendants have removed to federal court. Those actions currently are transferred to the
court presiding over the multidistrict litigation. In addition, the Company was joined as a
defendant in an action by the California Commissioner of Insurance alleging similar conduct by
various insurers in connection with the sale of group benefits products. The Commissioner’s action
asserts claims under California insurance law and seeks injunctive relief only. The Company
disputes the allegations in all of these actions and intends to defend the actions vigorously.

Additional complaints may be filed against the Company in various courts alleging claims under
federal or state law arising from the conduct alleged in the NYAG Complaint. The Company’s
ultimate liability, if any, in the pending and possible future suits is highly uncertain and
subject to contingencies that are not yet known, such as how many suits will be filed, in which
courts they will be lodged, what claims they will assert, what the outcome of investigations by the
New York Attorney General’s Office and other regulatory agencies will be, the success of defenses
that the Company may assert, and the amount of recoverable damages if liability is established. In
the opinion of management, it is possible that an adverse outcome in one or more of these suits
could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s consolidated results of operations or cash
flows in particular quarterly or annual periods.

Fair Credit Reporting Act Putative Class Action

– In October 2001, a complaint was filed in the
United States District Court for the District of Oregon, on behalf of a putative nationwide class
of homeowners and automobile policyholders from 1999 to the present, alleging that the Company
willfully violated the Fair Credit Reporting Act (“FCRA”) by failing to send appropriate notices to
new customers whose initial rates were higher than they would have been had the customer had a more
favorable credit report. In July 2003, the district court granted summary judgment for the
Company, holding that FCRA’s adverse action notice requirement did not apply to the rate first
charged for an initial policy of insurance.

The plaintiff appealed and, in August 2005, a panel of the United States Court of Appeals for
the Ninth Circuit reversed the district court, holding that the adverse action notice requirement
applies to new business and that the Company’s notices, even when sent, contained inadequate
information. Although no court previously had decided the notice requirements applicable to
insurers under FCRA, and the district court had not addressed whether the Company’s alleged
violations of FCRA were willful because it had agreed with the Company’s interpretation of FCRA and
found no violation, the Court of Appeals further held, over a dissent by one of the judges, that
the Company’s failure to send notices conforming to the Court’s opinion constituted a willful
violation of FCRA as a matter of law. FCRA provides for a statutory penalty of $100 to $1,000 per
willful violation. Simultaneously, the Court of Appeals issued decisions in related cases against
four other insurers, reversing the district court and holding that those insurers also

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)

had violated FCRA in similar ways.On October 3, 2005, the Court of Appeals withdrew its
opinion in the Hartford case and issued a revised opinion, which changed certain language of the
opinion but not the outcome.

On October 31, 2005, the Company timely filed a petition for rehearing and for rehearing en banc in
the Ninth Circuit. While that petition was pending, on January 25, 2006, the Court of Appeals
again withdrew its opinion in the Hartford case and issued a second revised opinion. The new
opinion vacated the Court’s earlier ruling that the Company had willfully violated FCRA as a matter
of law and remanded the case to the district court for further proceedings. On remand, the Company
will have an opportunity to present evidence that its conduct was not willful. If the Company is
found not to have acted willfully, statutory penalties will not be available, and the plaintiff
will have to prove actual damages.

No class has been certified, and the Company intends to continue to defend this action vigorously.
The Company’s ultimate liability, if any, in this action is highly uncertain and subject to
contingencies that are not yet known. In the opinion of management, it is possible that an adverse
outcome in this action could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s consolidated results
of operations or cash flows.

Blanket Casualty Treaty Litigation

– The Company is engaged in pending litigation in
Connecticut Superior Court against certain of its upper-layer reinsurers under its Blanket Casualty
Treaty (“BCT”). The BCT is a multi-layered reinsurance program providing excess-of-loss coverage
in various amounts from the 1930s through the 1980s. The upper layers were first placed in 1950,
predominantly with London Market reinsurers, including Lloyd’s syndicates. The action seeks, among
other relief, damages for the reinsurer defendants’ failure to pay certain billings for asbestos
and pollution claims.

In December 2003, the Company entered into a global settlement with MacArthur Company, an asbestos
insulation distributor and installer then in bankruptcy, for $1.15 billion. The Company then billed
the reinsurer defendants under the BCT for $117 of the settlement amount. After the reinsurers
refused to pay the MacArthur billing, the Company amended its complaint to add, among other things,
claims related to that billing. Most of the reinsurer defendants counterclaimed, seeking a
declaration that they did not owe reinsurance for the MacArthur settlement.

The litigation concerns under what circumstances losses arising from multiple claims against a
single insured may be combined and ceded as a single “accident” under the BCT so as to reach the
upper layers of the program. The BCT contains a unique definition of “accident.” The application
of this definition to the ceded losses is the crux of the dispute.

In April 2005, the Superior Court phased the proceedings, providing for a trial of the MacArthur
billing first, in April 2006, with other billings to follow in subsequent trial settings. In
September 2005, the London Market reinsurer defendants moved for summary judgment on the
MacArthur-related claims. After briefing and oral argument, the Superior Court issued a decision
on December 13, 2005, granting the defendants’ motion. The Company has noticed an appeal to the
Connecticut Appellate Court and intends to prosecute its appeal vigorously.

The outcome of the appeal is uncertain. If the decision of the Superior Court is affirmed on
appeal, the Company may be unable to collect not only its billing for the MacArthur settlement but
also other current and future billings to which the same relevant facts and legal analysis would
apply. The Company has recorded gross reinsurance recoveries of asbestos and pollution losses under the BCT of $586. The Company
has considered the risk of non-collection of these recoveries in its allowance of $335 as of
December 31, 2005 for all uncollectible reinsurance recoverables associated with older, long-term
casualty liabilities reported in the Other Operations segment. If the Company ultimately is unable
to collect asbestos and pollution recoveries under the BCT, an adjustment to decrease the Company’s
net reinsurance recoverables would be required in an amount that would have a material adverse
effect on the Company’s consolidated results of operations or cash flows in a particular quarterly
or annual period.

Asbestos and Environmental Claims

The Company continues to receive asbestos and environmental claims. Asbestos claims relate
primarily to bodily injuries asserted by people who came in contact with asbestos or products
containing asbestos. Environmental claims relate primarily to pollution and related clean-up costs.

The Company wrote several different categories of insurance contracts that may cover asbestos and
environmental claims. First, the Company wrote primary policies providing the first layer of
coverage in an insured’s liability program. Second, the Company wrote excess policies providing
higher layers of coverage for losses that exhaust the limits of underlying coverage. Third, the
Company acted as a reinsurer assuming a portion of those risks assumed by other insurers writing
primary, excess and reinsurance coverages. Fourth, subsidiaries of the Company participated in the
London Market, writing both direct insurance and assumed reinsurance business.

With regard to both environmental and particularly asbestos claims, significant uncertainty
limits the ability of insurers and reinsurers to estimate the ultimate reserves necessary for
unpaid losses and related expenses. Traditional actuarial reserving techniques cannot reasonably
estimate the ultimate cost of these claims, particularly during periods where theories of law are
in flux. The degree of

variability of reserve estimates for these exposures is significantly greater than for other
more traditional exposures. In particular, the Company believes there is a high degree of
uncertainty inherent in the estimation of asbestos loss reserves.

In the case of the reserves for asbestos exposures, factors contributing to the high degree of
uncertainty include inadequate loss development patterns, plaintiffs’ expanding theories of
liability, the risks inherent in major litigation, and inconsistent emerging legal doctrines.
Furthermore, over time, insurers, including the Company, have experienced significant changes in
the rate at which asbestos claims are brought, the claims experience of particular insureds, and
the value of claims, making predictions of future exposure from past experience uncertain. For
example, in the past few years, insurers in general, including the Company, have experienced an
increase in the number of asbestos-related claims due to, among other things, plaintiffs’ increased
focus on new and previously peripheral defendants and an increase in the number of insureds seeking
bankruptcy protection as a result of asbestos-related liabilities. Plaintiffs and insureds have
sought to use bankruptcy proceedings, including “pre-packaged” bankruptcies, to accelerate and
increase loss payments by insurers. In addition, some policyholders have asserted new classes of
claims for coverages to which an aggregate limit of liability may not apply. Further uncertainties
include insolvencies of other carriers and unanticipated developments pertaining to the Company’s
ability to recover reinsurance for asbestos and environmental claims. Management believes these
issues are not likely to be resolved in the near future.

In the case of the reserves for environmental exposures, factors contributing to the high degree of
uncertainty include expanding theories of liability and damages; the risks inherent in major
litigation; inconsistent decisions concerning the existence and scope of coverage for environmental
claims; and uncertainty as to the monetary amount being sought by the claimant from the insured.

It is also not possible to predict changes in the legal and legislative environment and their
effect on the future development of asbestos and environmental claims. It is unknown whether
potential Federal asbestos-related legislation will be enacted or what its effect would be on the
Company’s aggregate asbestos liabilities.

The reporting pattern for assumed reinsurance claims, including those related to asbestos and
environmental claims, is much longer than for direct claims. In many instances, it takes months or
years to determine that the policyholder’s own obligations have been met and how the reinsurance in
question may apply to such claims. The delay in reporting reinsurance claims and exposures adds to
the uncertainty of estimating the related reserves.

Given the factors and emerging trends described above, the Company believes the actuarial tools and
other techniques it employs to estimate the ultimate cost of claims for more traditional kinds of
insurance exposure are less precise in estimating reserves for its asbestos and environmental
exposures. For this reason, the Company relies on exposure-based analysis to estimate the ultimate
costs of these claims and regularly evaluates new information in assessing its potential asbestos
and environmental exposures.

As of December 31, 2005 and December 31, 2004, the Company reported $2.3 billion and $2.5 billion
of net asbestos reserves and $366 and $394 of net environmental reserves, respectively. The
Company believes that its current asbestos and environmental reserves are appropriate. However,
analyses of future developments could cause The Hartford to change its estimates and ranges of its
asbestos and environmental reserves, and the effect of these changes could be material to the
Company’s consolidated operating results, financial condition, and liquidity.

Regulatory Developments

In June 2004, the Company received a subpoena from the New York Attorney General’s Office in
connection with its inquiry into compensation arrangements between brokers and carriers. In
mid-September 2004 and subsequently, the Company has received additional subpoenas from the New
York Attorney General’s Office, which relate more specifically to possible anti-competitive
activity among brokers and insurers. Since the beginning of October 2004, the Company has received
subpoenas or other information requests from Attorneys General and regulatory agencies in more than
a dozen jurisdictions regarding broker compensation and possible anti-competitive activity. The
Company may receive additional subpoenas and other information requests from Attorneys General or
other regulatory agencies regarding similar issues. In addition, the Company has received a
request for information from the New York Attorney General’s Office concerning the Company’s
compensation arrangements in connection with the administration of workers compensation plans. The
Company intends to continue cooperating fully with these investigations, and is conducting an
internal review, with the assistance of outside counsel, regarding broker compensation issues in
its Property & Casualty and Group Benefits operations.

On October 14, 2004, the New York Attorney General’s Office filed a civil complaint against Marsh &
McLennan Companies, Inc., and Marsh, Inc. (collectively, “Marsh”). The complaint alleges, among
other things, that certain insurance companies, including the Company, participated with Marsh in
arrangements to submit inflated bids for business insurance and paid contingent commissions to
ensure that Marsh would direct business to them. The Company was not joined as a defendant in the
action, which has since settled. Although no regulatory action has been initiated against the
Company in connection with the allegations described in the civil complaint, it is possible that
the New York Attorney General’s Office or one or more other regulatory agencies may pursue action
against the Company or one or more of its employees in the future. The potential timing of any
such action is difficult to predict. If such an action is brought, it could have a material
adverse effect on the Company.

On October 29, 2004, the New York Attorney General’s Office informed the Company that the
Attorney General is conducting an investigation with respect to the timing of the previously
disclosed sale by Thomas Marra, a director and executive officer of the Company, of 217,074 shares
of the Company’s common stock on September 21, 2004. The sale occurred shortly after the issuance
of two additional subpoenas dated September 17, 2004 by the New York Attorney General’s Office.
The Company has engaged outside counsel to review the circumstances related to the transaction and
is fully cooperating with the New York Attorney General’s Office. On the basis of the review, the
Company has determined that Mr. Marra complied with the Company’s applicable internal trading
procedures and has found no indication that Mr. Marra was aware of the additional subpoenas at the
time of the sale.

There continues to be significant federal and state regulatory activity relating to financial
services companies, particularly mutual funds companies. These regulatory inquiries have focused
on a number of mutual fund issues, including market timing and late trading, revenue sharing and
directed brokerage, fees, transfer agents and other fund service providers, and other mutual-fund
related issues. The Company has received requests for information and subpoenas from the SEC,
subpoenas from the New York Attorney General’s Office, a subpoena from the Connecticut Attorney
General’s Office, requests for information from the Connecticut Securities and Investments Division
of the Department of Banking, and requests for information from the New York Department of
Insurance, in each case requesting documentation and other information regarding various mutual
fund regulatory issues. The Company continues to cooperate fully with these regulators in these
matters.

The SEC’s Division of Enforcement and the New York Attorney General’s Office are investigating
aspects of the Company’s variable annuity and mutual fund operations related to market timing. The
Company continues to cooperate fully with the SEC and the New York Attorney General’s Office in
these matters. The Company’s mutual funds are available for purchase by the separate accounts of
different variable universal life insurance policies, variable annuity products, and funding
agreements, and they are offered directly to certain qualified retirement plans. Although existing
products contain transfer restrictions between subaccounts, some products, particularly older
variable annuity products, do not contain restrictions on the frequency of transfers. In addition,
as a result of the settlement of litigation against the Company with respect to certain owners of
older variable annuity contracts, the Company’s ability to restrict transfers by these owners has,
until recently, been limited. The Company has executed an agreement with the parties to the
previously settled litigation which, together with separate agreements between these contract
owners and their broker, has resulted in the exchange or surrender of substantially all of the
variable annuity contracts that were the subject of the previously settled litigation. Pursuant to
an agreement in principle reached in February 2005 with the Board of Directors of the mutual funds,
the Company has indemnified the affected mutual funds for material harm deemed to have been caused
to the funds by frequent trading by these owners for the period from January 2, 2004 through
December 31, 2005. The Company does not expect to incur additional costs pursuant to this
agreement in principle in light of the exchange or surrender of these variable annuity contracts.

The SEC’s Division of Enforcement also is investigating aspects of the Company’s variable annuity
and mutual fund operations related to directed brokerage and revenue sharing. The Company
discontinued the use of directed brokerage in recognition of mutual fund sales in late 2003. The
Company continues to cooperate fully with the SEC in these matters.

The Company has received subpoenas from the New York Attorney General’s Office and the Connecticut
Attorney General’s Office requesting information relating to the Company’s group annuity products,
including single premium group annuities used in maturity or terminal funding programs. These
subpoenas seek information about how various group annuity products are sold, how the Company
selects mutual funds offered as investment options in certain group annuity products, and how
brokers selling the Company’s group annuity products are compensated. The Company continues to
cooperate fully with these regulators in these matters.

To date, none of the SEC’s and New York Attorney General’s market timing investigation, the SEC’s
directed brokerage investigation, or the New York Attorney General’s and Connecticut Attorney
General’s single premium group annuity investigation has resulted in the initiation of any formal
action against the Company by these regulators. However, the Company believes that the SEC, the
New York Attorney General’s Office, and the Connecticut Attorney General’s Office are likely to
take some action against the Company at the conclusion of the respective investigations. The
Company is engaged in active discussions with the SEC, the New York Attorney General’s Office and
the Connecticut Attorney General’s Office. The potential timing of any resolution of any of these
matters or the initiation of any formal action by any of these regulators is difficult to predict.
The Company recorded a charge of $66 to establish a reserve for the market timing and directed
brokerage matters in the first quarter of 2005. Based on recent developments, the Company recorded
an additional charge of $36, after tax, in the fourth quarter of 2005 to increase the reserve for the market
timing, directed brokerage and single premium group annuity matters. This reserve is an estimate;
in view of the uncertainties regarding the outcome of these regulatory investigations, as well as
the tax-deductibility of payments, it is possible that the ultimate cost to the Company of these
matters could exceed the reserve by an amount that would have a material adverse effect on the
Company’s consolidated results of operations or cash flows in a particular quarterly or annual
period.

On May 24, 2005, the Company received a subpoena from the Connecticut Attorney General’s Office
seeking information about the Company’s participation in finite reinsurance transactions in which
there was no substantial transfer of risk between the parties. The Company is cooperating fully
with the Connecticut Attorney General’s Office in this matter.

F-51

On June 23, 2005, the Company received a subpoena from the New York Attorney General’s Office
requesting information relating to purchases of the Company’s variable annuity products, or
exchanges of other products for the Company’s variable annuity products, by New York residents who
were 65 or older at the time of the purchase or exchange. On August 25, 2005, the Company received
an additional subpoena from the New York Attorney General’s Office requesting information relating
to purchases of or exchanges into the Company’s variable annuity products by New York residents
during the past five years where the purchase or exchange was funded using funds from a
tax-qualified plan or where the variable annuity purchased or exchanged for was a sub-account of a
tax-qualified plan or was subsequently put into a tax-qualified plan. The Company is cooperating
fully with the New York Attorney General’s Office in these matters.

On July 14, 2005, the Company received an additional subpoena from the Connecticut Attorney
General’s Office concerning the Company’s structured settlement business. This subpoena requests
information about the Company’s sale of annuity products for structured settlements, and about the
ways in which brokers are compensated in connection with the sale of these products. The Company is
cooperating fully with the New York Attorney General’s Office and the Connecticut Attorney
General’s Office in these matters.

The Company has received a request for information from the New York Attorney General’s Office
about issues relating to the reporting of workers’ compensation premium. The Company is
cooperating fully with the New York Attorney General’s Office in this matter.

Lease Commitments

Total rental expense on operating leases was $206 in 2005, $193 in 2004 and $158 in 2003. Future
minimum lease commitments are as follows:


$

On June 30, 2003, the Company entered into a sale-leaseback of certain furniture and fixtures
with a net book value of $40. The sale-leaseback resulted in a gain of $15, which was deferred and
will be amortized into earnings over the initial lease term of three years. The lease qualifies as
an operating lease for accounting purposes. At the end of the initial lease term, the Company has
the option to purchase the leased assets, renew the lease for two one-year periods or return the
leased assets to the lessor. If the Company elects to return the assets to the lessor at the end
of the initial lease term, the assets will be sold, and the Company has guaranteed a residual value
on the furniture and fixtures of $20. If the fair value of the furniture and fixtures were to
decline below the residual value, the Company would have to make up the difference under the
residual value guarantee. Under the sale-leaseback, the Company must maintain a minimum level of
consolidated statutory surplus and risk based capital ratios. In addition, the Company must not exceed a maximum ratio of debt to capitalization. As of December 31, 2005,
the Company was in compliance with all such covenants. As of December 31, 2005 and 2004, no
liability was recorded for this guarantee, as the expected fair value of the furniture and fixtures
at the end of the initial lease term was greater than the residual value guarantee.

In December 2005 the Company exercised its option to extend the lease contract until June 30, 2007.

Tax Matters

The Company’s federal income tax returns are routinely audited by the Internal Revenue Service
(“IRS). The IRS began its audit of the 2002-2003 tax years in 2005 and is in the examination
phase. Management believes that adequate provision has been made in the financial statements for
any potential assessments that may result from future tax examinations and other tax-related
matters for all open tax years. During 2004, the IRS completed its examination of the 1998-2001
tax years, and the IRS and the Company agreed upon all adjustments. As a result, during 2004 the
Company booked a $216 tax benefit to reflect the impact of the audit settlement on tax years
covered by the examination as well as all other tax years prior to 2004. The benefit relates
primarily to the separate account DRD and interest.

The separate account DRD is estimated for the current year using information from the most recent
year-end, adjusted for projected equity market performance. The estimated DRD is generally updated
in the third quarter for the provision-to-filed-return adjustments, and in the fourth quarter based
on known actual mutual fund distributions and fee income from The Hartford’s variable insurance
products. The actual current year DRD can vary from the estimates based on, but not limited to,
changes in eligible dividends received by the mutual funds, amounts of distributions from these
mutual funds, appropriate levels of taxable income as well as the utilization of capital loss carry
forwards at the mutual fund level.

Unfunded Commitments

At December 31, 2005, The Hartford has outstanding commitments totaling $754, of which $366 is
committed to fund limited partnership investments. These capital commitments can be called by the
partnership during the commitment period (on average two to five years) to fund the purchase of new
investments and partnership expenses. Once the commitment period expires, the Company is under no
obligation to fund the remaining unfunded commitment but may elect to do so. The remaining $388 of
outstanding commitments are primarily related to various funding obligations associated with
investments in mortgage and construction loans. These have a commitment period of one month to
three years.

Guaranty Fund and Other Insurance-related Assessments

In all states, insurers licensed to transact certain classes of insurance are required to become
members of a guaranty fund. In most states, in the event of the insolvency of an insurer writing
any such class of insurance in the state, members of the funds are assessed to pay certain claims
of the insolvent insurer. A particular state’s fund assesses its members based on their respective
written premiums in the state for the classes of insurance in which the insolvent insurer was
engaged. Assessments are generally limited for any year to one or two percent of premiums written
per year depending on the state. Such assessments paid by The Hartford approximated $46 in 2005,
$26 in 2004 and $26 in 2003.

The Hartford accounts for guaranty fund and other insurance assessments in accordance with
Statement of Position No. 97-3, “Accounting by Insurance and Other Enterprises for
Insurance-Related Assessments”. Liabilities for guaranty fund and other insurance-related
assessments are accrued when an assessment is probable, when it can be reasonably estimated, and
when the event obligating the Company to pay an imposed or probable assessment has occurred.
Liabilities for guaranty funds and other insurance-related assessments are not discounted and are
included as part of other liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of December 31, 2005
and 2004, the liability balance was $223 and $215, respectively. As of December 31, 2005 and 2004,
$20 and $14, respectively, related to premium tax offsets were included in other assets.

13. Income Tax (continued)

In management’s judgment, the net deferred tax asset will more likely than not be realized as
reductions of future taxes paid except as otherwise noted. Included in the deferred tax asset is
the expected tax benefit attributable to net operating losses of $1.3 billion, consisting of U.S.
losses of $0.9 billion, which expire from 2015-2023, and foreign losses of $0.4 billion, which
expire from 2006-2012. A valuation allowance of $28 million has been recorded which consists of
$18 million related primarily to U.S. net operating losses of $47 million and $10 million related
to a new valuation allowance set up primarily for U.K. net operating losses of $29 million.

Prior to the Tax Reform Act of 1984, the Life Insurance Company Income Tax Act of 1959
permitted the deferral from taxation of a portion of statutory income under certain circumstances.
In these situations, the deferred income was accumulated in a “Policyholders’ Surplus Account” and
would be taxable only under conditions which management considered to be remote; therefore, no
federal income taxes have been provided on the balance in this account, which for tax return
purposes was $88 as of December 31, 2005. The American Jobs Creation Act of 2004, which
was enacted in October 2004, allows distributions to be made from the Policyholders’ Surplus Account free of tax in 2005 and 2006. The Company
anticipates, based on currently available information, that it will distribute the entire balance
in the account, thereby permanently eliminating the potential tax of $31.

Equity Units Offerings

On May 23, 2003, The Hartford issued 12.0 million 7% equity units at a price of fifty dollars per
unit and received net proceeds of $582. Subsequently, on May 30, 2003, The Hartford issued an
additional 1.8 million 7% equity units at a price of fifty dollars per unit and received net
proceeds of $87.

Each equity unit offered initially consists of a corporate unit with a stated amount of fifty
dollars per unit. Each corporate unit consists of one purchase contract for the sale of a certain
number of shares of the Company’s stock and a 5% ownership interest in one thousand dollars
principal amount of senior notes due August 16, 2008.

The corporate unit may be converted by the holder into a treasury unit consisting of the purchase
contract and a 5% undivided beneficial interest in a zero-coupon U.S. Treasury security with a
principal amount of one thousand dollars that matures on August 15, 2006. The holder of an equity
unit owns the underlying senior notes or treasury securities but has pledged the senior notes or
treasury securities to the Company to secure the holder’s obligations under the purchase contract.

The purchase contract obligates the holder to purchase, and obligates The Hartford to sell, on
August 16, 2006, for fifty dollars, a variable number of newly issued common shares of The
Hartford. The number of The Hartford’s shares to be issued will be determined at the time the
purchase contracts are settled based upon the then current applicable market value of The
Hartford’s common stock. If the applicable market value of The Hartford’s common stock is equal to
or less than $45.50, then the Company will deliver 1.0989 shares to the holder of the equity unit,
or an aggregate of 15.2 million shares. If the applicable market value of The Hartford’s common
stock is greater than $45.50 but less than $56.875, then the Company will deliver the number of
shares equal to fifty dollars divided by the then current applicable market value of The Hartford’s
common stock to the holder. Finally, if the applicable market value of The Hartford’s common stock
is equal to or greater than $56.875, then the Company will deliver 0.8791 shares to the holder, or
an aggregate of 12.1 million shares. Accordingly, upon settlement of the purchase contracts on
August 16, 2006, The Hartford will receive proceeds of approximately $690 and will deliver between
12.1 million and 15.2 million common shares in the aggregate. Had the settlement date been
December 31, 2005, the Company would have issued 12.1 million common shares based on applicable
market value of the Company’s common stock. The proceeds will be credited to stockholders’ equity
and allocated between the common stock and additional paid-in capital accounts. The Hartford will
make quarterly contract adjustment payments to the equity unit holders at a rate of 4.44% of the
stated amount per year until the purchase contract is settled.

Each corporate unit also includes a 5% ownership interest in one thousand dollars principal amount
of senior notes that will mature on August 16, 2008. The aggregate maturity value of the senior
notes is $690. The notes are pledged by the holders to secure their obligations under the purchase
contracts. The Hartford will make quarterly interest payments to the holders of the notes
initially at an annual rate of 2.56%. On May 11, 2006, the notes will be remarketed. At that
time, The Hartford’s remarketing agent will have the ability to reset the interest rate on the
notes in order to generate sufficient remarketing proceeds to satisfy the holder’s obligation under
the purchase contract. If the initial remarketing is unsuccessful, the remarketing agent will
attempt to remarket the notes, as necessary, on June 13, 2006, July 12, 2006 and August 11, 2006.
If all remarketing attempts are unsuccessful, the Company will exercise its rights as a secured
party to obtain and extinguish the notes.

14. Debt (continued)

The total distributions payable on the equity units are at an annual rate of 7%, consisting of
interest (2.56%) and contract adjustment payments (4.44%). The corporate units are listed on the
New York Stock Exchange under the symbol “HIG PrD”.

On September 13, 2002, The Hartford issued 6.6 million 6% equity units at a price of fifty dollars
per unit and received net proceeds of $319. Each equity unit offered initially consists of a
corporate unit with a stated amount of fifty dollars per unit. Each corporate unit consists of one
purchase contract for the sale of a certain number of shares of the Company’s stock and fifty
dollars principal amount of senior notes due November 16, 2008.

The corporate unit may be converted by the holder into a treasury unit consisting of the purchase
contract and a 5% undivided beneficial interest in a zero-coupon U.S. Treasury security with a
principal amount of one thousand dollars that matures on November 15, 2006. The holder of an
equity unit owns the underlying senior notes or treasury portfolio but has pledged the senior notes
or treasury portfolio to the Company to secure the holder’s obligations under the purchase
contract.

The purchase contract obligates the holder to purchase, and obligates The Hartford to sell, on
November 16, 2006, for fifty dollars, a variable number of newly issued common shares of The
Hartford. The number of The Hartford’s shares to be issued will be determined at the time the
purchase contracts are settled based upon the then current applicable market value of The
Hartford’s common stock. If the applicable market value of The Hartford’s common stock is equal to
or less than $47.25, then the Company will deliver 1.0582 shares to the holder of the equity unit,
or an aggregate of 7.0 million shares. If the applicable market value of The Hartford’s common
stock is greater than $47.25 but less than $57.645, then the Company will deliver the number of
shares equal to fifty dollars divided by the then current applicable market value of The Hartford’s
common stock to the holder. Finally, if the applicable market value of The Hartford’s common stock
is equal to or greater than $57.645, then the Company will deliver 0.8674 shares to the holder, or
an aggregate of 5.7 million shares. Accordingly, upon settlement of the purchase contracts on
November 16, 2006, The Hartford will receive proceeds of approximately $330 and will deliver
between 5.7 million and 7.0 million common shares in the aggregate. Had the settlement date been
December 31, 2005, the company would have issued 5.7 million common shares based on applicable
market value of the Company’s common stock. The proceeds will be credited to stockholders’ equity
and allocated between the common stock and additional paid-in capital accounts. The Hartford will
make quarterly contract adjustment payments to the equity unit holders at a rate of 1.90% of the
stated amount per year until the purchase contract is settled.

Each corporate unit also includes fifty dollars principal amount of senior notes that will mature
on November 16, 2008. The aggregate maturity value of the senior notes is $330. The notes are
pledged by the holders to secure their obligations under the purchase contracts. The Hartford will
make quarterly interest payments to the holders of the notes initially at an annual rate of 4.10%.
On August 11, 2006, the notes will be remarketed. At that time, The Hartford’s remarketing agent
will have the ability to reset the interest rate on the notes in order to generate sufficient
remarketing proceeds to satisfy the holder’s obligation under the purchase contract. In the event
of an unsuccessful remarketing, the Company will exercise its rights as a secured party to obtain
and extinguish the notes.

The total distributions payable on the equity units are at an annual rate of 6.0%, consisting of
interest (4.10%) and contract adjustment payments (1.90%). The corporate units are listed on the
New York Stock Exchange under the symbol “HIG PrA”.

For a discussion of the impact to earnings (loss) per share from the equity unit offerings, see
Note 2.

Shelf Registrations

On December 3, 2003, The Hartford’s shelf registration statement (Registration No. 333-108067) for
the potential offering and sale of debt and equity securities in an aggregate amount of up to $3.0
billion was declared effective by the SEC. The Registration Statement allows for the following
types of securities to be offered: (i) debt securities, preferred stock, common stock, depositary
shares, warrants, stock purchase contracts, stock purchase units and junior subordinated deferrable
interest debentures of the Company, and (ii) preferred securities of any of one or more capital
trusts organized by The Hartford (“The Hartford Trusts”). The Company may enter into guarantees
with respect to the preferred securities of any of The Hartford Trusts. As of December 31, 2005,
the Company had $2.4 billion remaining on its shelf.

On May 15, 2001, HLI filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) a shelf registration
statement for the potential offering and sale of up to $1.0 billion in debt and preferred
securities. The registration statement was declared effective on May 29, 2001. As of December 31,
2005, the Company had $1.0 billion remaining on its shelf.

Replaced by $1.6 billion Five-Year Competitive Advance and Revolving Credit Facility
Agreement on September 7, 2005. For further information, see below.

On September 7, 2005, The Hartford and HLI entered into a $1.6 billion Five-Year Competitive
Advance and Revolving Credit Facility Agreement (the “Credit Agreement”) with a syndicate of
financial institutions. The Credit Agreement replaced (i) The Hartford’s $1.0 billion Second
Amended and Restated Five-Year Competitive Advance and Revolving Credit Facility Agreement dated as
of February 26, 2003, as amended, and (ii) The Hartford’s and HLI’s $490 Three-Year Competitive
Advance and Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, dated as of December 31, 2002, as amended.

The Credit Agreement provides for up to $1.6 billion of unsecured credit. Of the total availability
under the Credit Agreement, up to $250 is available to support borrowing by HLI alone, and up to
$100 is available to support letters of credit issued on behalf of The Hartford, HLI or other
subsidiaries of The Hartford.

As of December 31, 2005, the Company’s Japanese operation has a ¥2.0 billion yen, approximately
$17, line of credit with a Japanese bank with no outstanding
borrowings under this facility.

Under the revolving credit facility, the Company must maintain a minimum level of consolidated
statutory surplus. In addition, the Company must not exceed a maximum ratio of debt to
capitalization. Quarterly, the Company certifies compliance with the financial covenants for its
banks. As of December 31, 2005, the Company was in compliance with all such covenants.

Junior Subordinated Debentures

The Hartford and its subsidiary, HLI, have formed statutory business trusts, which exist for the
exclusive purposes of (i) issuing Trust Securities representing undivided beneficial interests in
the assets of the Trust; (ii) investing the gross proceeds of the Trust Securities in Junior
Subordinated Deferrable Interest Debentures (“Junior Subordinated Debentures”) of The Hartford or
HLI; and (iii) engaging in only those activities necessary or incidental thereto. Prior to the
adoption of FIN 46R, the trust preferred securities were reported as mandatory redeemable preferred
securities of subsidiary trusts. In accordance with the adoption of FIN 46R, the Company has
deconsolidated the trust preferred securities. For further discussion of the adoption of FIN 46R,
see Note 1.

For each of the respective debentures, The Hartford or HLI, has the right at any time, and
from time to time, to defer payments of interest on the Junior Subordinated Debentures for a
period not exceeding 20 consecutive quarters up to the debentures’ maturity date. During any
such period, interest will continue to accrue and The Hartford or HLI may not declare or pay
any cash dividends or distributions on, or purchase, The Hartford’s or HLI’s capital stock nor
make any principal, interest or premium payments on or repurchase any debt securities that
rank equally with or junior to the Junior Subordinated Debentures. The Hartford or HLI will
have the right at any time to dissolve the Trust and cause the Junior Subordinated Debentures
to be distributed to the holders of the Preferred Securities.

[2]

The Hartford Junior Subordinated Debentures are unsecured and rank junior and subordinate in
right of payment to all senior debt of The Hartford and are effectively subordinated to all
existing and future liabilities of its subsidiaries.

[3]

The Hartford has guaranteed, on a subordinated basis, all of the Hartford Capital III
obligations under the Hartford Series C Preferred Securities, including to pay the redemption
price and any accumulated and unpaid distributions to the extent of available funds and upon
dissolution, winding up or liquidation, but only to the extent that Hartford Capital III has
funds to make such payments.

15. Stockholders’ Equity

Common Stock

In September 2004, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized the Company to repurchase up to $1
billion of its securities. The Company’s repurchase authorization permits purchases of common
stock and equity units, which may be in the open market or through privately negotiated
transactions. The Company also may enter into derivative transactions to facilitate future
repurchases of common stock and equity units. As of December 31, 2005, the Company has made no
repurchases under this program.

On January 22, 2004, The Hartford issued approximately 6.3 million shares of common stock pursuant
to an underwritten offering at a price to the public of $63.25 per share and received net proceeds
of $388. Subsequently, on January 30, 2004, The Hartford issued approximately 377 thousand shares
of common stock pursuant to an underwritten offering at a price to the public of $63.25 per share
and received net proceeds of $23. The Company used the proceeds from these issuances to repay $411
of commercial paper issued in connection with the acquisition of the group life and
accident, and short-term and long-term disability businesses of CNA Financial Corporation. (For
further discussion of this acquisition, see Note 20.)

Preferred Stock

The Company has 50,000,000 shares of preferred stock authorized, none of which have been
issued.

Statutory Results

The domestic insurance subsidiaries of HFSG prepare their statutory financial statements in
accordance with accounting practices prescribed or permitted by the applicable state insurance
department which vary materially from GAAP. Prescribed statutory accounting practices include
publications of the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (“NAIC”), as well as state
laws, regulations and general administrative rules. The differences between statutory financial
statements and financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP vary between domestic and
foreign jurisdictions. The principal differences are that statutory financial statements do not
reflect deferred policy acquisition costs and limit deferred income taxes, accounting for life
benefit reserves and for statutory reporting, bonds are generally carried at amortized cost and
reinsurance assets and liabilities are presented net of reinsurance. The Company’s use of
permitted statutory accounting practices does not have a significant impact on statutory surplus.

Japan Life Operation was valued in accordance with prescribed statutory accounting
practices. Prior to September 1, 2005, Japan Life Operations was included in Life Operations.

Dividends to the Company from its insurance subsidiaries are restricted. The payment of
dividends by Connecticut-domiciled insurers is limited under the insurance holding company laws of
Connecticut. Under these laws, the insurance subsidiaries may only make their dividend payments
out of unassigned surplus. These laws require notice to and approval by the state insurance
commissioner for the declaration or payment of any dividend, which, together with other dividends
or distributions made within the preceding twelve months, exceeds the greater of (i) 10% of the
insurer’s policyholder surplus as of December 31 of the preceding year or (ii) net income (or net
gain from operations, if such company is a life insurance company) for the twelve-month period
ending on the thirty-first day of December last preceding, in each case determined under statutory
insurance accounting principles. In addition, if any dividend of a Connecticut-domiciled insurer
exceeds the insurer’s earned surplus, it requires the prior approval of the Connecticut Insurance
Commissioner. The insurance holding company laws of the other jurisdictions in which The
Hartford’s insurance subsidiaries are incorporated (or deemed commercially domiciled) generally
contain similar (although in certain instances somewhat more restrictive) limitations on the
payment of dividends. The Company’s insurance subsidiaries are permitted to pay up to a maximum of
approximately $1.9 billion in dividends to HFSG in 2006 without prior approval from the applicable
insurance commissioner. However, through August 31, 2006, Hartford Life and Accident Insurance
Company (“HLA”), comprising $667 of the $1.9 billion, will need prior approval from the insurance
commissioner to pay dividends. In 2005, HFSG and HLI received a combined total of $1.9 billion
from their insurance subsidiaries, which includes a $963 dividend of Hartford Life Insurance K.K
(“HLIKK”) to HLI.

16.
Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income, Net of Tax

Comprehensive income is defined as all changes in stockholders’ equity, except those arising from
transactions with stockholders. Comprehensive income includes net income (loss) and other
comprehensive income (loss), which for the Company consists of changes in net unrealized
appreciation or depreciation of available-for-sale investments carried at market value, changes in
gains or losses on cash-flow hedging instruments, changes in foreign currency translation gains or
losses and changes in the Company’s minimum pension liability.

17. Pension Plans and Postretirement Health Care and Life Insurance Benefit Plans

The Company maintains a U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plan (“the Plan”) that covers
substantially all employees. Effective for all employees who joined the Company on or after
January 1, 2001, a new component or formula was applied under the Plan referred to as the “cash
balance formula”. As of January 1, 2009, the cash balance formula will be used to calculate future
pension benefits for services rendered on or after January 1, 2009 for all employees hired before
January 1, 2001. These amounts are in addition to amounts earned by those employees through
December 31, 2008 under the traditional final average pay formula.

The Company also maintains unfunded excess plans to provide benefits in excess of amounts permitted
to be paid to participants of the Plan under the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code.

The Company provides certain health care and life insurance benefits for eligible retired
employees. The Company’s contribution for health care benefits will depend upon the retiree’s date
of retirement and years of service. In addition, the plan has a defined dollar cap for certain
retirees which limits average Company contributions. The Hartford has prefunded a portion of the
health care obligations through a trust fund where such prefunding can be accomplished on a tax
effective basis. Effective January 1, 2002, retiree medical, retiree dental and retiree life
insurance benefits were eliminated for employees with original hire dates with the Company on or
after January 1, 2002

The Company adopted FSP FAS No. 106-2 “Accounting and Disclosure Requirements Related to the
Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003”, (“FSP 106-2”) as of
December 31, 2004. The adoption of FSP 106-2 did not have a material effect on either the
Company’s consolidated financial condition or results of operations.

The funded status of the Company’s defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans is

rates. Declines in long-term interest rates have had a negative impact on the funded status of the

of December 31, 2005 and 2004.

The overall goal of the Plan is to maximize total investment returns to provide sufficient funding
for present and anticipated future benefit obligations within the constraints of a prudent level of
portfolio risk and diversification. Investment decisions are approved by the Company’s Pension
Fund Trust and Investment Committee. The Company believes that the asset allocation decision will
be the single most important factor determining the long-term performance of the Plan.

Divergent market performance among different asset classes may, from time to time, cause the asset
allocation to deviate from the desired asset allocation ranges. The asset allocation mix is
reviewed on a periodic basis. If it is determined that an asset allocation mix rebalancing is
required, future portfolio additions and withdrawals will be used, as necessary, to bring the
allocation within tactical ranges.

In order to minimize risk, the Plan maintains a listing of permissible and prohibited investments.
In addition, the Plan has certain concentration limits and investment quality requirements imposed
on permissible investment options. The Company employs a duration overlay program to
adjust the duration of the fixed income component in the Plan assets to better match the duration
of the benefit obligation. The portfolio will invest primarily in U.S. Treasury notes and bond
futures contracts to maintain the duration within +/- 0.75 year of target duration.

2006 (best estimate)

The Company presently anticipates contributing approximately $200 to its pension plans in
2006, based upon certain economic and business assumptions. These assumptions include, but are not
limited to, equity market performance, changes in interest rates and the Company’s other capital
requirements. The Company’s 2006 required minimum funding contribution is expected to be
immaterial.

Employer contributions in 2005 were made in cash and did not include contributions of the Company’s
common stock.

Benefit Payments

The following table sets forth amounts of benefits expected to be paid over the next ten years from

18. Stock Compensation Plans

On May 18, 2005 at the Company’s Annual Meeting of Shareholders, the shareholders of The
Hartford approved The Hartford 2005 Incentive Stock Plan (the “2005 Stock Plan”), which superseded
and replaced The Hartford Incentive Stock Plan and The Hartford Restricted Stock Plan for
Non-employee Directors. The terms of the 2005 Stock Plan are substantially similar to the terms of
these superseded plans.

The 2005 Stock Plan provides for awards to be granted in the form of non-qualified or incentive
stock options qualifying under Section 422A of the Internal Revenue Code, stock appreciation
rights, performance shares, restricted stock, or restricted stock units, or

F-63

any combination of the foregoing. The aggregate number of shares of stock, which may be
awarded, is subject to a maximum limit of 7,000,000 shares applicable to all awards for the
ten-year duration of the 2005 Stock Plan. To the extent that any awards under The Hartford
Incentive Stock Plan and The Hartford Restricted Stock Plan for Non-employee Directors are
forfeited, terminated, expire unexercised or are settled for cash in lieu of stock, the shares
subject to such awards (or the relevant portion thereof) shall be available for awards under the
2005 Stock Plan and shall be added to the total number of shares available under the 2005 Stock
Plan.

Under the 2005 Stock Plan, all options granted have an exercise price equal to the market price of
the Company’s common stock on the date of grant, and an option’s maximum term is ten years and two
days. Certain options become exercisable over a three year period commencing one year from the
date of grant, while certain other options become exercisable upon the attainment of specified
market price appreciation of the Company’s common shares. For any year, no individual employee may
receive an award of options for more than 1,000,000 shares. As of December 31, 2005, The Hartford
had not issued any incentive stock options under any plans.

Performance awards of common stock granted under the 2005 Stock Plan become payable upon the
attainment of specific performance goals achieved over a period of not less than one nor more than
five years, and the restricted stock granted is subject to a restriction period. On a cumulative
basis, no more than 20% of the aggregate number of shares which may be awarded under the 2005 Stock
Plan are available for performance shares, restricted stock awards, or restricted stock unit
awards. Also, the maximum award of performance shares, restricted stock awards, or restricted
stock unit awards for any individual employee in any year is 200,000 shares or units. In 2005, the
Company granted 704,738 shares of common stock with a weighted average price of $71.62 related to
performance shares, restricted stock awards, and restricted stock unit awards. In 2004 and 2003,
the Company granted shares of common stock of 315,452 and 333,712 with weighted average prices of
$64.93 and $38.13, respectively, related to performance share and restricted stock awards.

In 1996, the Company established The Hartford Employee Stock Purchase Plan (“ESPP”). Under this
plan, eligible employees of The Hartford may purchase common stock of the Company at a 15% discount
from the lower of the closing market price at the beginning or end of the quarterly offering
period. The Company may sell up to 5,400,000 shares of stock to eligible employees under the ESPP.
In 2005, 2004 and 2003, 328,276, 345,262 and 443,467 shares were sold, respectively. The per
share weighted average fair value of the discount under the ESPP was $10.77, $9.31, and $11.96 in
2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Additionally, during 1997, The Hartford established employee
stock purchase plans for certain employees of the Company’s international subsidiaries. Under
these plans, participants may purchase common stock of The Hartford at a fixed price at the end of
a three-year period. The activity under these programs is not material.

A summary of the status of non-qualified options included in the Company’s Stock Plan as of
December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003 and changes during the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and
2003 is presented below:

19. Investment and Savings Plan

Substantially all U.S. employees are eligible to participate in The Hartford’s Investment and
Savings Plan under which designated contributions may be invested in common stock of The Hartford
or certain other investments. These contributions are matched, up to 3% of base salary, by the
Company. In addition, the Company allocates at least 0.5% of base salary to the plan for each
eligible employee. In 2005, the Company allocated 1.5% of base salary to the plan for eligible
employees who received compensation of less than ninety thousand dollars during the prior year.
The cost to The Hartford for this plan was approximately $52, $50 and $36 for 2005, 2004 and 2003,
respectively.

20. Acquisitions

During the second quarter of 2004, the Company finalized its December 31, 2003, acquisition of
CNA Financial Corporation’s group life and accident, and short-term and long-term disability
businesses. The acquisition was consummated to increase the scale of the Company’s group life and
disability operations and to expand and enhance the distribution and delivery of those products and
related services. The final purchase price was $543. Through the acquisition, assets, comprised
primarily of fixed maturities and short-term investments, increased $2.6 billion and liabilities,
comprised primarily of future policy benefits and unpaid claims and claim adjustments expense
increased by $2.0 billion. The Company did not record any goodwill or other intangibles, including
present value of future profits as a result of the acquisition. As the acquisition was completed
on December 31, 2003, the results of operations of the acquired business are included in the
Company’s statement of operations for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004.
