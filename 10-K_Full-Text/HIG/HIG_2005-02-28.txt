PART I

Item 1. BUSINESS

(Dollar
amounts in millions, except for per share data, unless otherwise
stated)

General

The Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc. (together with its subsidiaries, “The Hartford” or the
“Company”) is a diversified insurance and financial services company. The Hartford, headquartered
in Connecticut, is among the largest providers of investment products, individual life, group life
and group disability insurance products, and property and casualty insurance products in the United
States. Hartford Fire Insurance Company, founded in 1810, is the oldest of The Hartford’s
subsidiaries. The Hartford writes insurance in the United States and internationally. At December
31, 2004, total assets and total stockholders’ equity of The Hartford were $259.7 billion and $14.2
billion, respectively.

Organization

The Hartford strives to maintain and enhance its position as a market leader within the financial
services industry and to maximize shareholder value. The Company pursues a strategy of developing
and selling diverse and innovative products through multiple distribution channels, continuously
developing and expanding those distribution channels, achieving cost efficiencies through economies
of scale and improved technology, maintaining effective risk management and prudent underwriting
techniques and capitalizing on its brand name and customer recognition of The Hartford Stag Logo,
one of the most recognized symbols in the financial services industry.

As a holding company that is separate and distinct from its subsidiaries, The Hartford Financial
Services Group, Inc. has no significant business operations of its own. Therefore, it relies on
the dividends from its insurance companies and other subsidiaries as the principal source of cash
flow to meet its obligations. Additional information regarding the cash flow and liquidity needs
of The Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc. may be found in the Capital Resources and Liquidity
section of Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
(“MD&A”).

The Company maintains a retail mutual fund operation, whereby the Company, through wholly-owned
subsidiaries, provides investment management and administrative services to The Hartford Mutual
Funds, Inc. and The Hartford Mutual Funds II, Inc. (“The Hartford mutual funds”), families of 40
mutual funds. Investors can purchase “shares” in The Hartford mutual funds, all of which are
registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission in accordance with the Investment Company
Act of 1940. The Hartford mutual funds are owned by the shareholders of those funds and not by the
Company.

Reporting Segments

The Hartford is organized into two major operations: Life and Property & Casualty. In the quarter
ended March 31, 2004, and as more fully described below, the Company changed its reporting
segments to reflect the current manner by which its chief operating decision maker views and
manages the business. All segment data for prior reporting periods have been adjusted to reflect
the current segment reporting. Within the Life and Property & Casualty operations, The Hartford
conducts business principally in eight operating segments. Additionally, Corporate includes all
of the Company’s debt financing and related interest expense, as well as certain capital raising
activities and purchase accounting adjustments.

Life changed its reportable operating segments in 2004 from Investment Products, Individual Life,
Group Benefits and Corporate Owned Life Insurance (“COLI”) to Retail Products Group (“Retail”),
Institutional Solutions Group (“Institutional”), Individual Life and Group Benefits.

Retail offers individual variable and fixed annuities, mutual funds, retirement plan products and
services to corporations under Section 401(k) plans and other investment products.

Institutional primarily offers retirement plan products and services to municipalities under
Section 457 plans, other institutional investment products, structured settlements, and private
placement life insurance (formerly referred to as COLI).

Individual Life sells a variety of life insurance products, including variable universal life,
universal life, interest sensitive whole life and term life insurance.

The Group Benefits segment provides employers and associations with group life, accident and
disability coverage, along with other products and services, including voluntary benefits, employee
assistance programs, travel assistance, group retiree health, and medical stop loss.

Life includes in an Other category its international operations, which are primarily located in
Japan and Brazil; net realized capital gains and losses other than periodic net coupon settlements
on non-qualifying derivatives and net realized capital gains and losses related to guaranteed
minimum withdrawal benefits; corporate items not directly allocated to any of its reportable
operating segments; and intersegment eliminations. Periodic net coupon settlements on
non-qualifying derivatives and net realized capital gains and losses related to guaranteed minimum
withdrawal benefits are reflected in each applicable segment in net realized capital gains and
losses.



Property & Casualty is now organized into four reportable operating segments: the underwriting
segments of Business Insurance, Personal Lines, and Specialty Commercial (collectively “Ongoing
Operations”); and the Other Operations segment. Prior to the first quarter of 2004, Property &
Casualty had also included a Reinsurance segment (“HartRe assumed reinsurance”). With the
discontinuance of writing new domestic assumed reinsurance business, HartRe assumed
reinsurance business is now included in the Other Operations segment for all periods
presented.

Business Insurance provides standard commercial insurance coverage to small commercial and middle
market commercial businesses primarily throughout the United States. This segment offers workers’
compensation, property, automobile, liability, umbrella and marine coverages. Commercial risk
management products and services are also provided.

Personal Lines provides automobile, homeowners’ and home-based business coverages to the members of
AARP through a direct marketing operation; to individuals who prefer local agent involvement
through a network of independent agents in the standard personal lines market; and through the Omni
Insurance Group in the non-standard automobile market. Personal Lines also operates a member
contact center for health insurance products offered through AARP’s Health Care Options.

The Specialty Commercial segment offers a variety of customized insurance products and risk
management services. Specialty Commercial provides standard commercial insurance products
including workers’ compensation, automobile and liability coverages to large-sized companies.
Specialty Commercial also provides bond, professional liability, specialty casualty and
agricultural coverages, as well as core property and excess and surplus lines coverages not
normally written by standard lines insurers. Alternative markets, within Specialty Commercial,
provides insurance products and services primarily to captive insurance companies, pools and
self-insurance groups. In addition, Specialty Commercial provides third party administrator
services for claims administration, integrated benefits, loss control and performance measurement
through Specialty Risk Services, a subsidiary of the Company.

The Other Operations segment consists of certain property and casualty insurance operations of The
Hartford which have discontinued writing new business and includes substantially all of the
Company’s asbestos and environmental exposures.

The measure of profit or loss used by The Hartford’s management in evaluating the performance of
its Life segments is net income. The Property & Casualty segments are evaluated by The Hartford’s
management primarily based upon underwriting results. Underwriting results represent premiums
earned less incurred claims, claim adjustment expenses and underwriting expenses. The sum of
underwriting results, net investment income, net realized capital gains and losses, other expenses,
and related income taxes is net income (loss).

Life

Life’s business is conducted by Hartford Life, Inc. (“Hartford Life” or “Life”), an indirect
subsidiary of The Hartford, headquartered in Simsbury, Connecticut, and is a leading financial
services and insurance organization. Hartford Life provides (i) retail and institutional
investment products, including variable annuities, fixed market value adjusted (“MVA”) annuities,
mutual funds, private placement life insurance, which includes life insurance products purchased by
a company on the lives of its employees, and retirement plan services for the savings and
retirement needs of over 5.0 million customers, (ii) life insurance for wealth protection,
accumulation and transfer needs for approximately 738,000 customers, (iii) group benefits products
such as group life and group disability insurance for the benefit of millions of individuals, and
(iv) fixed and variable annuity products through its international operations. Life is one of the
largest sellers of individual variable annuities, variable universal life insurance and group
disability insurance in the United States. Life’s strong position in each of its core businesses
provides an opportunity to increase the sale of Life’s products and services as individuals
increasingly save and plan for retirement, protect themselves and their families against the
financial uncertainties associated with disability or death and engage in estate planning.

Hartford Life is among the largest consolidated life insurance groups in the United States based on
statutory assets as of December 31, 2004. In the past year, Life’s total assets under management,
which include $28.1 billion of third-party assets invested in Life’s mutual funds and 529 College
Savings Plans, increased 18% to $248.5 billion at December 31, 2004 from $210.1 billion at December
31, 2003. Life generated revenues of $11.4 billion, $8.1 billion, and $6.9 billion in 2004, 2003
and 2002, respectively. Additionally, Life generated net income of $1.4 billion, $845, and $630 in
2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively.

Customer Service, Technology and Economies of Scale

Life maintains advantageous economies of scale and operating efficiencies due to its growth,
attention to expense and claims management and commitment to customer service and technology.
These advantages allow Life to competitively price its products for its distribution network and
policyholders. In addition, Life utilizes computer technology to enhance communications within
Life and throughout its distribution network in order to improve Life’s efficiency in marketing,
selling and servicing its products and, as a result, provides high-quality customer service. In
recognition of excellence in customer service for individual annuities, Hartford Life was awarded
the 2004 Annuity Service Award by DALBAR Inc., a recognized independent financial services research
organization, for the ninth consecutive year. Hartford Life is the only company to receive this
prestigious award in every year of the award’s existence. Also, in 2004 Life earned its second
DALBAR Award for Mutual Fund and Retirement Plan Service which recognizes Hartford Life as the No.
1 service provider of mutual funds and retirement plans in the industry. Additionally, Life’s
Individual Life segment won its fourth consecutive DALBAR award for service of life insurance
customers and its third consecutive DALBAR Financial Intermediary Service Award in 2004.



Risk Management

Life’s product designs, prudent underwriting standards and risk management techniques are
structured to protect it against disintermediation risk, greater than expected mortality and
morbidity experience and, for certain product features, specifically the guaranteed minimum death
benefit (“GMDB”) and guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefit (“GMWB”) offered with variable annuity
products, equity market volatility. As of December 31, 2004, Life had limited exposure to
disintermediation risk on approximately 97% of its domestic life insurance and annuity liabilities
through the use of non-guaranteed separate accounts, MVA features, policy loans, surrender charges
and non-surrenderability provisions. Life effectively utilizes prudent underwriting to select and
price insurance risks and regularly monitors mortality and morbidity assumptions to determine if
experience remains consistent with these assumptions and to ensure that its product pricing remains
appropriate. Life also enforces disciplined claims management to protect itself against greater
than expected morbidity experience. Life uses reinsurance structures and has modified benefit
features to mitigate the mortality exposure associated with GMDB. Life also uses reinsurance in
combination with derivative instruments to minimize the volatility associated with the GMWB
liability.

Retail Products Group

The Retail segment focuses, through the sale of individual variable and fixed annuities, mutual
funds, retirement plan services and other investment products, on the savings and retirement needs
of the growing number of individuals who are preparing for retirement or who have already retired.
This segment’s assets under management grew to $144.4 billion at December 31, 2004 from $123.6
billion at December 31, 2003. Retail generated revenues of $3.2 billion, $2.2 billion and $1.9
billion in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively, of which individual annuities accounted for $2.6
billion, $1.8 billion, and $1.5 billion for 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Net income in the
Retail Products Group segment was $526, $430 and $356 in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively.

Life sells both variable and fixed individual annuity products through a wide distribution network
of national and regional broker-dealer organizations, banks and other financial institutions and
independent financial advisors. Life is a market leader in the annuity industry with sales of
$15.7 billion, $16.5 billion, and $11.6 billion in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Life was the
largest seller of individual retail variable annuities in the United States with sales of $15.0
billion, $15.7 billion, and $10.3 billion in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. In addition, Life
continues to be the largest seller of individual retail variable annuities through banks in the
United States.

Life’s total account value related to individual annuity products was $111.0 billion as of December
31, 2004. Of this total account value, $99.6 billion, or 90%, related to individual variable
annuity products and $11.4 billion, or 10%, related primarily to fixed MVA annuity products. At
December 31, 2003, Life’s total account value related to individual annuity products was $97.7
billion. Of this total account value, $86.5 billion, or 89%, related to individual variable
annuity products and $11.2 billion, or 11%, related primarily to fixed MVA annuity products.

In addition to its leading position in individual annuities, Life continues to emerge as a
significant participant in the mutual fund business. As of December 31, 2004, retail mutual fund
assets were $25.2 billion. Life is also among the top providers of retirement products and
services, including asset management and plan administration sold to small and medium size
corporations pursuant to Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (referred
to as “401(k)”).

Principal Products

Individual Variable Annuities

— Life earns fees, based on policyholders’ account values, for
managing variable annuity assets and maintaining policyholder accounts. Life uses specified
portions of the periodic deposits paid by a customer to purchase units in one or more mutual funds
as directed by the customer, who then assumes the investment performance risks and rewards. As a
result, variable annuities permit policyholders to choose aggressive or conservative investment
strategies, as they deem appropriate, without affecting the composition and quality of assets in
Life’s general account. These products offer the policyholder a variety of equity and fixed income
options, as well as the ability to earn a guaranteed rate of interest in the general account of
Life. Life offers an enhanced guaranteed rate of interest for a specified period of time (no
longer than twelve months) if the policyholder elects to dollar-cost average funds from Life’s
general account into one or more non-guaranteed separate accounts. Additionally, the Retail
Products Group segment sells variable annuity contracts that offer various guaranteed minimum death
and withdrawal benefits.

Policyholders may make deposits of varying amounts at regular or irregular intervals and the value
of these assets fluctuates in accordance with the investment performance of the funds selected by
the policyholder. To encourage persistency, many of Life’s individual variable annuities are
subject to withdrawal restrictions and surrender charges. Surrender charges range up to 8% of the
contract’s deposits less withdrawals, and reduce to zero on a sliding scale, usually within seven
years from the deposit date. Individual variable annuity account values of $99.6 billion as of
December 31, 2004, have grown from $86.5 billion as of December 31, 2003, due to strong net cash
flow, resulting from high levels of sales, low levels of surrenders and equity market appreciation.
Approximately 83% and 80% of the individual variable annuity account values were held in
non-guaranteed separate accounts as of December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively.

The assets underlying Life’s variable annuities are managed both internally and by independent
money managers, while Life provides all policy administration services. Life utilizes a select
group of money managers, such as Wellington Management Company, LLP (“Wellington”); Hartford
Investment Management Company (“Hartford Investment Management”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of The



Hartford; Putnam Financial Services, Inc. (“Putnam”); American Funds; MFS Investment Management
(“MFS”); Franklin Templeton
Group; and AIM Investments (“AIM”). All have an interest in the continued growth in sales of
Life’s products and enhance the marketability of Life’s annuities and the strength of its product
offerings. Hartford Leaders, which is a multi-manager variable annuity that combines the product
manufacturing, wholesaling and service capabilities of Life with the investment management
expertise of four of the nation’s most successful investment management organizations: American
Funds, Franklin Templeton Group, AIM and MFS, has emerged as the industry leader in terms of retail
sales. In addition, the Director variable annuity, which is managed in part by Wellington, ranks
second in the industry in terms of retail sales.

Fixed MVA Annuities

— Fixed MVA annuities are fixed rate annuity contracts which guarantee a
specific sum of money to be paid in the future, either as a lump sum or as monthly income. In the
event that a policyholder surrenders a policy prior to the end of the guarantee period, the MVA
feature increases or decreases the cash surrender value of the annuity in respect of any interest
rate decreases or increases, respectively, thereby protecting Life from losses due to higher
interest rates at the time of surrender. The amount of payment will not fluctuate due to adverse
changes in Life’s investment return, mortality experience or expenses. Life’s primary fixed MVA
annuities have terms varying from one to ten years with an average term to maturity of
approximately four years. Account values of fixed MVA annuities were $11.4 billion and $11.2
billion as of December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively.

Mutual Funds

—

Life launched a family of retail mutual funds for which Life provides investment
management and administrative services. The fund family has grown significantly from 8 funds at
inception to the current offering of 40 funds, including the addition of the Hartford Equity Income
Fund introduced in 2003. Life’s funds are managed by Wellington and Hartford Investment
Management. Life has entered into agreements with over 960 financial services firms to distribute
these mutual funds.

Life charges fees to the shareholders of the mutual funds, which are recorded as revenue by Life.
Investors can purchase shares in the mutual funds, all of which are registered with the Securities
and Exchange Commission, in accordance with the Investment Company Act of 1940. The mutual funds
are owned by the shareholders of those funds and not by Life. As such, the mutual fund assets and
liabilities, as well as related investment returns, are not reflected in The Hartford’s
consolidated financial statements. Total retail mutual fund assets under management were $25.2
billion and $20.3 billion as of December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively.

401(k)

— Life sells retirement plan products and services to corporations under Section 401(k)
plans targeting the small and medium case markets. Life believes these markets are
under-penetrated in comparison to the large case market. As of December 31, 2004, Life
administered over 8,200 Section 401(k) plans. Total assets under management were $7.3 billion and
$5.2 billion as of December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively.

Marketing and Distribution

The Retail Products Group segment distribution network is based on management’s strategy of
utilizing multiple and competing distribution channels to achieve the broadest distribution to
reach target customers. The success of Life’s marketing and distribution system depends on its
product offerings, fund performance, successful utilization of wholesaling organizations, quality
of customer service, and relationships with national and regional broker-dealer firms, banks and
other financial institutions, and independent financial advisors (through which the sale of Life’s
retail investment products to customers is consummated).

Life maintains a distribution network of approximately 1,500 broker-dealers and approximately 500
banks. As of December 31, 2004, Life was selling products through the 25 largest retail banks in
the United States. Life periodically negotiates provisions and terms of its relationships with
unaffiliated parties, and there can be no assurance that such terms will remain acceptable to Life
or such third parties. Life’s primary wholesaler of its individual annuities is PLANCO Financial
Services, Inc. and its affiliate, PLANCO, Incorporated (collectively “PLANCO”) a wholly owned
subsidiary of Hartford Life and Accident Insurance Company (“HLA”). PLANCO is one of the nation’s
largest wholesalers of individual annuities and has played a significant role in The Hartford’s
growth over the past decade. As a wholesaler, PLANCO distributes Life’s fixed and variable
annuities, and 401(k) plans, mutual funds and 529 plans by providing sales support to registered
representatives, financial planners and broker-dealers at brokerage firms and banks across the
United States. Owning PLANCO secures an important distribution channel for Life and gives Life a
wholesale distribution platform which it can expand in terms of both the number of individuals
wholesaling its products and the portfolio of products which they wholesale. In addition, Life uses
internal personnel with extensive experience in the Section 401(k) market, to sell its products and
services in the retirement plan market.

Competition

The Retail segment competes with numerous other insurance companies as well as certain banks,
securities brokerage firms, independent financial advisors and other financial intermediaries
marketing annuities, mutual funds and other retirement-oriented products. Product sales are
affected by competitive factors such as investment performance ratings, product design, visibility
in the marketplace, financial strength ratings, distribution capabilities, levels of charges and
credited rates, reputation and customer service.

Institutional Solutions Group

Life is among the top providers of retirement products and services, including asset management and
plan administration sold to municipalities pursuant to Section 457 and 403(b) of the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (referred to as “Section 457” and



“403(b)”, respectively). Life
also provides structured settlement contracts, institutional annuities, institutional mutual funds
and stable value investment products such as funding agreements and guaranteed investment contracts
(“GICs”).

Additionally, Life is a leader in the private placement life insurance (“PPLI”) market, which
includes life insurance policies purchased by a company or a trust on the lives of employees, with
Life or a trust sponsored by Life named as the beneficiary under the policy. Until the passage of
Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”), Life sold two principal
types of PPLI, leveraged COLI and variable products.

Life has recently introduced two products for the High Net Worth markets. One is a specialized life
insurance contract for ultra-wealthy, High Net Worth investors, the other is a hedge fund designed
to leverage the strengths of The Hartford’s award winning customer service and distribution
capability.

Life’s total account values related to institutional investment products were $14.6 billion and
$12.7 billion as of December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Governmental account values were
$10.0 billion and $9.0 billion as of December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Variable PPLI
products account values were $22.5 billion and $21.0 billion as of December 31, 2004 and 2003,
respectively. Leveraged COLI account values were $2.5 billion as of December 31, 2004 and 2003. The
Institutional segment generated revenues of $1.8 billion, $2.1 billion and $1.8 billion for the
years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively and net income of $124, $83 and $108 in
2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively.

Principal Products

Institutional Investment Products

— Life sells the following institutional investment products:
structured settlements, institutional mutual funds, GICs and other short-term funding agreements,
and other annuity contracts for special purposes such as funding of terminated defined benefit
pension plans (institutional annuities arrangements).

Structured Settlements

— Structured settlement annuity contracts provide for periodic payments to
an injured person or survivor for a generally determinable number of years, typically in settlement
of a claim under a liability policy in lieu of a lump sum settlement.

Institutional Mutual Funds

— Life sells its institutional mutual funds, the Hartford HLS Funds and
the Hartford HLS Series II Funds, to qualified retirement plans (i.e., section 401(k) and 457
plans) on an “investment only” basis. That means that the funds are sold individually, with no
recordkeeping services included and not as a part of any bundled retirement program. The
Hartford’s wholly-owned subsidiary, HL Investment Advisors, LLC, serves as the investment advisor
to these funds and contracts with sub-advisors to perform the day-to-day management of the funds.
The two primary sub-advisors to the Hartford HLS Funds are Wellington Management Company, LLP, of
Boston, Massachusetts for most of the equity funds and Hartford Investment Management for the fixed
income funds.

Stable
Value Products

— GICs are group annuity contracts issued to
sponsors of qualified pension or profit-sharing plans or stable value pooled fund managers. Under
these contracts, the client deposits a lump sum with The Hartford for a specified period of time
for a guaranteed interest rate. At the end of the specified period, the client receives principal
plus interest earned. Funding agreements are investment contracts that perform a similar function
for non-qualified assets. Also during 2004, the Company began issuing fixed rate funding
agreements to Hartford Life Global Funding trusts, that, in turn, issue registered notes to
institutional and retail investors.

Institutional Annuities

— Institutional annuities arrangements are group annuity contracts used to
fund pension liabilities that exist when a qualified retirement plan sponsor decides to terminate
an existing defined benefit pension plan. Group annuity contracts are very long-term in nature,
since they must pay the pension liabilities typically on a monthly basis to all participants
covered under the pension plan which is being terminated.

Governmental

— Life sells retirement plan products and services to municipalities under Section 457
plans. Life offers a number of different investment products, including variable annuities and
fixed products, to the employees in Section 457 plans. Generally, with the variable products, Life
manages the fixed income funds and certain other outside money managers act as advisors to the
equity funds offered in Section 457 plans administered by Life. As of December 31, 2004, Life
administered over 3,600 plans under Sections 457 and 403(b).

Variable PPLI Products

— Private Placement Variable Life Insurance (“PPVLI”) products continue to
be used by employers to fund non-qualified benefits or other post-employment benefit liabilities. A
key advantage to plan sponsors is the opportunity to select from a range of tax deferred investment
allocations. Recent clarifications in regulatory policy have made PPVLI products particularly
attractive to banks with postretirement medical obligations. PPVLI has also been widely used in
the high net worth marketplace due to its low costs, range of investment choices and ability to
accommodate a fund of funds management style. This institutionally priced hedge fund product is
aimed at the rapidly growing market composed of affluent investors unable to participate in the
higher minimums of some hedge funds.

Leveraged COLI

— Leveraged COLI is a fixed premium life insurance policy owned by a company or a
trust sponsored by a company. HIPAA phased out the deductibility of interest on policy loans under
leveraged COLI at the end of 1998, virtually eliminating all future sales of leveraged COLI.



Marketing and Distribution

In the Section 457 market, the Institutional segment distribution network uses internal personnel
with extensive experience to sell its products and services in the retirement plan and
institutional markets. The success of Life’s marketing and distribution system depends on its
product offerings, fund performance, successful utilization of wholesaling organizations, quality
of customer service, and relationships with national and regional broker-dealer firms, banks and
other financial institutions.

In the structured settlement market, the Institutional segment sells individual fixed immediate
annuity products through a small number of specialty brokerage firms that work closely with The
Hartford’s property and casualty claim operations. Life also works directly with the brokerage
firms on cases that do not involve The Hartford’s Property & Casualty operations.

In the institutional mutual fund market, the Institutional segment typically sells it products
through investment consulting firms employed by retirement plan sponsors. Institutional’s products
are also sold through 401(k) record keeping firms that offer a “platform” of mutual funds to their
plan sponsor clients. A third sales channel is direct sales to qualified plan sponsors, using
registered representatives employed by Hartford Equity Sales Company, Inc.

In the stable value marketplace, the Institutional segment sells GICs, funding agreements, and
investor notes to retirement plan sponsors either through investment management firms or directly,
using Hartford employees.

In the institutional annuities market, Life sells its group annuity products to retirement plan
sponsors through three different channels (1) a small number of specialty brokers, (2) large
benefits consulting firms and (3) directly, using Hartford employees.

In the PPVLI market, specialized strategic alliance partners with expertise in the large case
market assist in the placement of many cases. High net worth PPVLI is often placed with the
assistance of investment banking and wealth management specialists.

The hedge fund of funds product is positioned to be sold through family offices, wealth management
platforms and other specialists in the mass-affluent market.

Competition

The Institutional segment competes with numerous other insurance companies as well as certain
banks, securities brokerage firms, independent financial advisors and other financial
intermediaries marketing annuities, mutual funds and other retirement-oriented products. Product
sales are affected by competitive factors such as investment performance ratings, product design,
visibility in the marketplace, financial strength ratings, distribution capabilities, levels of
charges and credited rates, reputation and customer service.

For institutional product lines offering fixed annuity products (i.e., institutional annuities,
structured settlements and stable value), financial strength, stability and credit ratings are key
buying factors. As a result, the competitors in those marketplaces tend to be other large,
long-established insurance companies.

For product lines offering mutual funds – either unbundled (institutional mutual funds) or wrapped
in a variable annuity or mutual fund retirement program (government markets) – the variety of
available funds and their performance is most important to plan sponsors. The competitors tend to
be the major mutual fund companies.

For PPVLI, competition in the large case market comes from other insurance carriers, and from
specialized agents with expertise in the benefit funding marketplace. For high net worth programs,
the competition is often from other investment banking firms allied with other insurance carriers.

The hedge fund of funds product competes against a range of similar products from respected
vendors, including investment banking firms and wire houses. It is distributed by former members
of the PLANCO team which assisted in The Hartford’s successful annuity business.

Individual Life

The Individual Life segment provides life insurance solutions to a wide array of partners to solve
the wealth protection, accumulation and transfer needs of its affluent, emerging affluent and
business insurance clients. As of December 31, 2004, life insurance in force increased 7% to
$139.9 billion, from $130.8 billion as of December 31, 2003. Account values increased 9% to $9.5
billion as of December 31, 2004 from $8.7 billion as of December 31, 2003. Revenues were $1,048,
$982 and $958 for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Net income in
the Individual Life segment was $153, $145 and $133 for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and
2002, respectively.

Principal Products

Life holds a significant market share in the variable universal life product market and was the
number one seller of variable universal life insurance, according to the Tillinghast VALUE
Survey, in 2004, for the third year in a row.  In
2004, Life’s sales of individual life insurance were 50% variable universal life, 44% universal
life and other, and 6% term life insurance.



Variable Universal Life

— Variable universal life provides life insurance with a return linked to
an underlying investment portfolio and Life allows policyholders to determine their desired asset
mix among a variety of underlying mutual funds. As the return on the investment portfolio
increases or decreases, the surrender value of the variable universal life policy will increase or
decrease, and, under certain policyholder options or market conditions, the death benefit may also
increase or decrease. Life’s second-to-die products are distinguished from other products in that
two lives are insured rather than one, and the policy proceeds are paid upon the death of both
insureds. Second-to-die policies are frequently used in estate planning for a married couple.
Variable universal life account values were $5.4 billion and $4.7 billion as of December 31, 2004
and 2003, respectively.

Universal Life and Interest Sensitive Whole Life

— Universal life and interest sensitive whole life
insurance coverages provide life insurance with adjustable rates of return based on current
interest rates. Universal life provides policyholders with flexibility in the timing and amount of
premium payments and the amount of the death benefit, provided there are sufficient policy funds to
cover all policy charges for the coming period, unless guaranteed no-lapse coverage is in effect.
At December 31, 2004, guaranteed no-lapse universal life represents less than 2% of life insurance
in-force. Life also sells second-to-die universal life insurance policies. Universal life and
interest sensitive whole life account values were $3.4 billion and $3.3 billion as of December 31,
2004 and 2003, respectively.

Marketing and Distribution

Consistent with Life’s strategy to access multiple distribution outlets, the Individual Life
distribution organization has been developed to penetrate a multitude of retail sales channels.
Life sells both variable and fixed individual life products through a wide distribution network of
national and regional broker-dealer organizations, banks and independent financial advisors. Life
is a market leader in selling individual life insurance through national stockbroker and financial
institutions channels. In addition, Life distributes individual life products through independent
life and property-casualty agents and Woodbury Financial Services, a subsidiary retail broker
dealer. To wholesale Life’s products, Life has a group of highly qualified life insurance
professionals with specialized training in sophisticated life insurance sales. These individuals
are generally employees of Life who are managed through a regional sales office system.

Competition

The Individual Life segment competes with approximately 1,200 life insurance companies in the
United States, as well as other financial intermediaries marketing insurance products. Competitive
factors related to this segment are primarily the breadth and quality of life insurance products
offered, pricing, relationships with third-party distributors, effectiveness of wholesaling
support, pricing and availability of reinsurance, and the quality of underwriting and customer
service.

Group Benefits

The Group Benefits segment provides employers, associations, affinity groups and financial
institutions with group life, accident and disability coverage, along with other products and
services, including voluntary benefits, employee assistance programs, travel assistance, group
retiree health, and medical stop loss. The Hartford’s Group Benefits segment ranks number two in
fully-insured group disability premium and number five in fully-insured life premium of U.S. group
carriers according to LIMRA. The Company also offers disability underwriting, administration,
claims processing services and reinsurance to other insurers and self-funded employer plans.
Generally, policies sold in this segment are term insurance. This allows the Company to adjust the
rates or terms of its policies in order to minimize the adverse effect of various market trends,
including declining interest rates and other factors. Typically policies are sold with one, two or
three year rate guarantees depending upon the product. In the disability market, the Company
focuses on its risk management expertise and on efficiencies and economies of scale to derive a
competitive advantage. The Group Benefits segment generated fully insured ongoing premiums of $3.6
billion for the year ended December 31, 2004, and $2.3 billion for the years ended December 31,
2003 and 2002, respectively, of which group disability insurance accounted for $1.6 billion, $963,
and $961 in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively, and group life insurance accounted for $1.7 billion,
$984 and $965 for the year ended December 31, 2004, 2003, and 2002, respectively. The Company held
group disability reserves of $4.2 billion and $4.0 billion and group life reserves of $1.3 billion
and $1.3 billion, as of December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Net income in the Group Benefits
segment was $229, $148 and $128 for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively.

Life acquired the group life and accident, and short-term and long-term disability businesses of
CNA Financial Corporation on December 31, 2003. This acquisition increased the scale of Life’s
group life, disability and accident operations, expanded Life’s distribution and enhanced Life’s
capability to deliver outstanding products and services.

Principal Products

Group Disability

— Life is one of the largest carriers in the “large case” market of the group
disability insurance business. The large case market, as defined by Life, generally consists of
group disability policies covering over 5,000 employees in a particular company. Life is
continuing its focus on the “small case” and “medium case” group markets, as well as its
association/affinity market, emphasizing name recognition and reputation, financial strength and
stability and Life’s functional approach to claims management. Life also offers voluntary, or
employee-paid, short-term and long-term disability group benefits. Life’s efforts in the group
disability market focus on early intervention, return-to-work programs and successful
rehabilitation, offering the support to help claimants return



to an active, productive life after a disability. Life also works with disability claimants to
improve their approval rate for Social Security Assistance (i.e., reducing payment of benefits by
the amount of Social Security payments received).

Life’s short-term disability benefit plans provide a weekly benefit amount (typically 60% to 70% of
the insured’s earned income up to a specified maximum benefit) to insureds when they are unable to
work due to an accident or illness. Long-term disability insurance provides a monthly benefit for
those extended periods of time not covered by a short-term disability benefit plan when insureds
are unable to work due to disability. Insureds may receive total or partial disability benefits.
Most of these policies begin providing benefits following a 90 or 180 day waiting period and
generally continue providing benefits until the insured reaches age 65. Long-term disability
benefits are paid monthly and are limited to a portion, generally 50-70%, of the insured’s earned
income up to a specified maximum benefit.

Group Life and Accident

— Group term life insurance provides term coverage to employees and members
of associations, affinity groups and financial institutions and their dependents for a specified
period and has no accumulation of cash values. Life offers options for its basic group life
insurance coverage, including portability of coverage and a living benefit and critical illness
option, whereby terminally ill policyholders can receive death benefits in advance. Life also
offers voluntary, or employee-paid, life group benefits and accidental death and dismemberment
coverage either packaged with life insurance or on a stand-alone basis.

Other

— Life offers a host of other products and services, such as Family and Medical Leave Act
Administration, Travel Assistance, GuidanceResources (an enhanced employee assistance and work/life
program), group retiree health, and specialized insurance products for physicians. Life provides
excess of loss medical coverage (known as stop loss insurance) to employers who self-fund their
medical plans and pay claims using the services of a third party administrator. Life also provides
travel accident, hospital indemnity, supplemental health insurance for military personnel and their
families and other coverages to individual members of various associations, affinity groups,
financial institutions and employee groups.

Marketing and Distribution

Life uses an experienced group of Company employees, managed through a regional sales office
system, to distribute its group insurance products and services through a variety of distribution
outlets, including brokers, consultants, third-party administrators and trade associations. Life
increased its distribution channel in 2004 through the acquisition of CNA Group Benefits and
intends to continue to expand the system in areas that offer the highest growth potential.

Competition

The Group Benefits business remains highly competitive. Competitive factors primarily affecting
Group Benefits are the variety and quality of products and services offered, the price quoted for
coverage and services, Life’s relationships with its third-party distributors, and the quality of
customer service. Group Benefits competes with numerous other insurance companies and other
financial intermediaries marketing insurance products. However, many of these businesses have
relatively high barriers to entry and there have been very few new entrants into the group benefits
insurance market over the past few years.

Other

Life includes in an Other category its international operations, which are primarily located in
Japan and Brazil; net realized capital gains and losses other than periodic net coupon settlements
on non-qualifying derivatives and net realized capital gains and losses related to guaranteed
minimum withdrawal benefits; corporate items not directly allocated to any of its reportable
operating segments; and intersegment eliminations. Periodic net coupon settlements on
non-qualifying derivatives and net realized capital gains and losses related to guaranteed minimum
withdrawal benefits are reflected in each applicable segment in net realized capital gains and
losses.

Life sells variable individual annuity products through a wide distribution network of Japan’s
broker-dealer organizations, banks and other financial institutions and independent financial
advisors. Life’s Japanese operation achieved $7.3 billion, $3.7 billion and $1.4 billion in
variable annuity sales for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. During
the third quarter of 2004 Life introduced MVA fixed annuity products to provide a diversified
product portfolio to customers in Japan. Japan fixed annuity sales for the year ended December 31,
2004 were $522. The growth in sales was the primary reason for the increased account values
related to Japan, which grew to $14.7 billion as of December 31, 2004 up from $6.2 billion as of
December 31, 2003.

In addition to the established operations in Japan and Brazil, Life has started a European
operation, which is called Hartford Life Limited that will focus on selling investment and
retirement accumulation products known as unit-linked bonds in the U.K. in the later part of 2005.
Unit-linked bonds are similar to variable annuities marketed in the United States and Japan.
Hartford Life has established operations in London, as well as Dublin, Ireland to help market and
service its new business.

Property & Casualty

Property & Casualty provides (1) workers’ compensation, property, automobile, liability, umbrella,
specialty casualty, marine, agricultural and bond coverages to commercial accounts primarily
throughout the United States; (2) professional liability coverage and directors and officers
liability coverage, as well as excess and surplus lines business not normally written by standard
commercial lines insurers; (3) automobile, homeowners and home-based business coverage to
individuals throughout the United States; and (4) insurance related services.



The Hartford seeks to distinguish itself in the property and casualty market through its balance
sheet strength, product depth and innovation, distribution capacity, customer service expertise,
and technology for ease of doing business. The Hartford is the eleventh largest property and
casualty insurance operation in the United States based on written premiums for the year ended
December 31, 2003 according to A.M. Best Company, Inc. (“A.M. Best”). Property & Casualty
generated revenues of $11.3 billion, $10.7 billion and $9.5 billion in 2004, 2003 and 2002,
respectively. Revenues include earned premiums, servicing revenue, net investment income and net
realized capital gains and losses. Earned premiums for 2004, 2003 and 2002 were $9.5 billion,
$8.8 billion and $8.1 billion, respectively. Additionally, net income (loss) was $910, $(745) and
$543 for 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The net loss for 2003 includes the after-tax effect
of the asbestos charge of $1,701. Total assets for Property & Casualty were $38.0 billion and
$37.2 billion as of December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively.

Business Insurance

Business Insurance provides standard commercial insurance coverage to small and middle market
commercial businesses primarily throughout the United States. This segment also provides
commercial risk management products and services as well as marine coverage. Earned premiums for
2004, 2003 and 2002 were $4.3 billion, $3.7 billion and $3.1 billion, respectively. The segment
had underwriting income of $360, $158 and $94 in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively.

Principal Products

The Business Insurance segment offers workers’ compensation, property, automobile, liability,
umbrella and marine coverages under several different products. Among these products, the Company
has achieved growth through its Select Xpand product, which is designed to meet the needs of
businesses with $5 to $15 in revenues and serves businesses in the upper end of the small business
market and lower end of the middle commercial market. Commercial risk management products and
services are also provided.

Marketing and Distribution

Business Insurance provides insurance products and services through its home office located in
Hartford, Connecticut, and multiple domestic regional office locations and insurance centers. The
segment markets its products nationwide utilizing brokers and independent agents and involving
trade associations and employee groups. Brokers and independent agents are not employees of The
Hartford.

Competition

The commercial insurance industry is a highly competitive environment regarding product, price,
service and technology. The Hartford competes with other stock companies, mutual companies,
alternative risk sharing groups and other underwriting organizations. These companies sell through
various distribution channels and business models, across a broad array of product lines, and with
a high level of variation regarding geographic, marketing and customer segmentation. The Hartford
is the tenth largest commercial lines insurer in the United States based on written premiums for
the year ended December 31, 2003 according to A.M. Best. The relatively large size and
underwriting capacity of The Hartford provide opportunities not available to smaller companies. In
addition, the marketplace is affected by available capacity of the insurance industry as measured
by policyholders’ surplus. Surplus expands and contracts primarily in conjunction with profit
levels generated by the industry. While investment yields are beginning to increase, underwriting
decisions are still critical given the relatively low level of investment returns compared to
historical averages. National carriers are becoming more focused on core segments and continue to
compete for the same business, while regional carriers are broadening their target market and
distribution.

Personal Lines

Personal Lines provides automobile, homeowners’ and home-based business coverages to the members of
AARP through a direct marketing operation; to individuals who prefer local agent involvement
through a network of independent agents in the standard personal lines market; and through the
Company’s Omni Insurance Group, Inc. (“Omni”) subsidiary in the non-standard automobile market.
Personal Lines also operates a member contact center for health insurance products offered through
AARP’s Health Care Options. The Hartford’s exclusive licensing arrangement with AARP, which was
renewed during the fourth quarter of 2001, continues through January 1, 2010 for automobile,
homeowners and home-based business. The Health Care Options agreement continues through 2007.
These agreements provide Personal Lines with an important competitive advantage. Personal lines
had earned premiums of $3.4 billion, $3.2 billion and $3.0 billion in 2004, 2003 and 2002,
respectively. Underwriting income (loss) for 2004, 2003 and 2002 was $138, $130 and $(31),
respectively. AARP had earned premiums of $2.1 billion, $2.0 billion and $1.7 billion in 2004, 2003
and 2002, respectively.

Principal Products

Personal Lines provides standard and non-standard automobile, homeowners and home-based business
coverages to individuals across the United States, including a special program designed exclusively
for members of AARP. During 2004, the Company continued the rollout of its new Dimensions
automobile and homeowners class plans for insurance sold through independent agents and brokers.
The new Dimensions class plans use a large number of interactive rating variables to determine a
rate that most accurately reflects the customer’s individual characteristics.



Marketing and Distribution

Personal Lines reaches diverse markets through multiple distribution channels including brokers,
independent agents, direct mail, the internet and advertising in publications. This segment
provides customized products and services to customers through a network of independent agents in
the standard personal lines market, and in the non-standard automobile market through Omni.
Brokers and independent agents are not employees of The Hartford. Personal Lines has an important
relationship with AARP and markets directly to its over 35 million members.

Competition

The personal lines automobile and homeowners businesses continue to remain highly competitive.
Personal lines insurance is written by insurance companies of varying sizes that sell products
through various distribution channels, including independent agents, captive agents and directly to
the consumer. The personal lines market competes on the basis of price; product; service,
including claims handling; stability of the insurer and name recognition. The market is
competitive with some carriers beginning to file rate decreases while others focus on acquiring
business through other means, such as increases in advertising and effective utilization of
technology. The Hartford is the twelfth largest personal lines insurer in the United States based
on written premiums for the year ended December 31, 2003 according to A.M. Best. Effective
utilization of technology is becoming increasingly important. A major competitive advantage of The
Hartford is the exclusive licensing arrangement with AARP to provide personal automobile,
homeowners and home-based business insurance products to its members. This arrangement is in
effect through January 1, 2010. Management expects favorable “baby boom” demographics to increase
AARP membership during this period. In addition, The Hartford provides customer service for all
health insurance products offered through AARP’s Health Care Options, with an agreement that
continues through 2007.

Specialty Commercial

Specialty Commercial provides a wide variety of property and casualty insurance products and
services through retailers and wholesalers to large commercial clients and insureds requiring a
variety of specialized coverages. Excess and surplus lines coverages not normally written by
standard line insurers are also provided, primarily through wholesale brokers. Specialty
Commercial had earned premiums of $1.7 billion, $1.5 billion and $1.2 billion in 2004, 2003 and
2002, respectively. Underwriting income (loss) was $(53), $10 and $6 in 2004, 2003 and 2002,
respectively.

Principal Products

Specialty Commercial offers a variety of customized insurance products and risk management
services. Specialty Commercial provides standard commercial insurance products including workers’
compensation, automobile and liability coverages to large-sized companies. Specialty Commercial
also provides bond, professional liability, specialty casualty and agricultural coverages, as well
as core property and excess and surplus lines coverages not normally written by standard lines
insurers. Alternative markets, within Specialty Commercial, provides insurance products and
services primarily to captive insurance companies, pools and self-insurance groups. In addition,
Specialty Commercial provides third-party administrator services for claims administration,
integrated benefits, loss control and performance measurement through Specialty Risk Services, LLC,
a subsidiary of the Company.

Marketing and Distribution

Specialty Commercial provides insurance products and services through its home office located in
Hartford, Connecticut and multiple domestic office locations. The segment markets its products
nationwide utilizing a variety of distribution networks including independent agents and brokers as
well as wholesalers. Brokers and independents agents are not employees of The Hartford.

Competition

The commercial insurance industry is a highly competitive environment regarding product, price,
service and technology. Specialty Commercial is comprised of a diverse group of businesses that are
unique to commercial lines. Each line of business operates independently with its own set of
business objectives, and focuses on the operational dynamics of their specific industry. These
businesses, while somewhat interrelated, have a unique business model and operating cycle.
Specialty Commercial is considered a transactional business and, therefore, competes with other
companies for business primarily on an account by account basis due to the complex nature of each
transaction. Specialty Commercial competes with other stock companies, mutual companies,
alternative risk sharing groups and other underwriting organizations. The relatively large size
and underwriting capacity of The Hartford provide opportunities not available to smaller companies.

Other Operations

The Other Operations segment includes operations that are under a single management structure,
Heritage Holdings, which is responsible for two related activities. The first activity is the
management of certain subsidiaries and operations of The Hartford that have discontinued writing
new business. The second is the management of claims (and the associated reserves) related to
asbestos and environmental exposures. Effective January 1, 2004,
the financial results of HartRe assumed reinsurance are reported in Other Operations, and 2003 and 2002
financial results have been restated to include these operations.



Life Reserves

Life insurance subsidiaries of Life establish and carry as liabilities, predominantly, three types
of reserves: (1) a liability equal to the balance that accrues to the benefit of the policyholder
as of the financial statement date, otherwise known as the account value, (2) a liability for
unpaid claims, including those that have been incurred but not yet reported, and (3) a liability
for future policy benefits, representing the present value of future benefits to be paid to or on
behalf of policyholders less the present value of future net premiums. The liabilities for unpaid
claims and future policy benefits are calculated based on actuarially recognized methods using
morbidity and mortality tables, which are modified to reflect Life’s actual experience when
appropriate. Liabilities for unpaid claims include estimates of amounts to fully settle known
reported claims as well as claims related to insured events that the Company estimates have been
incurred but have not yet been reported. Future policy benefit reserves are computed at amounts
that, with additions from estimated premiums to be received and with interest on such reserves
compounded annually at certain assumed rates, are expected to be sufficient to meet Life’s policy
obligations at their maturities or in the event of an insured’s disability or death. Other
insurance liabilities include those for unearned premiums and benefits in excess of account value.
Reserves for assumed reinsurance are computed in a manner that is comparable to direct insurance
reserves. Additional information on reserves may be found in the Critical Accounting Estimates
section of the MD&A under “Reserves”.

Property & Casualty Reserves

The Hartford establishes property and casualty reserves to provide for the estimated costs of
paying claims under insurance policies written by The Hartford. These reserves include estimates
for both claims that have been reported and those that have been incurred but not reported to The
Hartford and include estimates of all expenses associated with processing and settling these
claims. This estimation process involves a variety of actuarial techniques and is primarily based
on historical experience and consideration of current trends. Examples of current trends include
increases in medical cost inflation rates, changes in the tort environment in various
jurisdictions, changes in internal claim practices, changes in the legislative and regulatory
environment over workers’ compensation claims, evolving exposures to mass torts and the potential
for further adverse development of asbestos and environmental claims.

The Hartford continues to receive claims that assert damages from asbestos-related and
environmental-related exposures. Asbestos claims relate primarily to bodily injuries asserted by
those who came in contact with asbestos or products containing asbestos. Environmental claims
relate primarily to pollution related clean-up costs. As discussed further in the Critical
Accounting Estimates and Other Operations sections of the MD&A, significant uncertainty limits the
Company’s ability to estimate the ultimate reserves necessary for unpaid losses and related
expenses with regard to environmental and particularly asbestos claims.

Most of the Company’s property and casualty reserves are not discounted. However, certain
liabilities for unpaid claims for permanently disabled claimants have been discounted to present
value using an average interest rate of 4.6% in 2004 and 4.7% in 2003. As of December 31, 2004 and
2003, such discounted reserves totaled $707 and $666, respectively (net of discounts of $440 and
$429, respectively). In addition, certain structured settlement contracts that fund loss run-offs
for unrelated parties and have payment patterns that are fixed and determinable, have been
discounted to present value using an average interest rate of 5.5%. At December 31, 2004 and 2003,
such discounted reserves totaled $257 and $245, respectively (net of discounts of $116 and $127,
respectively). Accretion of these discounts did not have a material effect on net income during
either 2004 or 2003.

As of December 31, 2004, net property and casualty reserves for claims and claim adjustment
expenses reported under Generally Accepted
Accounting Principles (“GAAP”) exceeded net reserves
reported on a statutory basis by $108. The difference primarily results from  a portion of the GAAP
provision for uncollectible reinsurance and the required exclusion
from statutory reserves of assumed retroactive reinsurance, partially offset by the discounting of GAAP-basis workers’
compensation reserves at risk-free interest rates, which exceeded the statutory discount rates set
by regulators.

Further discussion on The Hartford’s property and casualty reserves, including asbestos and
environmental claims reserves, may be found in the Reserves section of the MD&A– Critical
Accounting Estimates.



A reconciliation of liabilities for unpaid claims and claim adjustment expenses is herein
referenced from Note 11 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. A table depicting the
historical development of the liabilities for unpaid claims and claim adjustment expenses, net of
reinsurance, follows.

The largest impacts of net reserve re-estimates are shown in the “1994 and Prior” accident
years. The reserve re-estimates in calendar years 1996 and 2003, include increases in reserves of
$785 in 1996 and $2.6 billion in 2003 related to reserve strengthening based on ground-up studies
of environmental and asbestos reserves. The ground up study that led to the strengthening in
calendar year 2003 confirmed the Company’s view of the existence of a substantial long-term
deterioration in the asbestos litigation environment. Before the $2.6 billion of reserve
strengthening for asbestos during 2003 and the $785 of reserve strengthening for asbestos and
environmental during 1996, over the past ten years, reserve re-estimates for total Property &
Casualty ranged from (1.3%) to 3.0% of total recorded reserves.

Reserves for accident years 1995-1997 show the effects of favorable reestimation in subsequent
years. A contributing factor to this improvement, spread over several calendar years, was an
unexpected improvement in the environment for workers’ compensation. With the benefit of
hindsight, annual changes in loss cost trends were very low during this period as compared to
historical experience. Because it took several years for this improvement to emerge in the data,
it similarly took several years for this to be recognized in the Company’s estimates of
liabilities.

There was also reserve deterioration, spread over several calendar years, on accident years
1998-2000. HartRe assumed casualty reinsurance contributed in part to this deterioration.
Numerous actuarial assumptions on assumed casualty reinsurance turned out to be low, including loss
cost trends, particularly on excess of loss business, and the impact of deteriorating terms and
conditions. Workers’ compensation also contributed to this deterioration, as medical inflation
trends were above initial expectations.

Calendar
year 2004 reserve development included reserve releases in accident years 2001 through 2003
and reserve strengthening in accident years 2000 and prior. The 2004 reserve releases in accident
year 2001 relate primarily to releases in reserves related to September 11. The 2004 reserve
releases in accident years 2002 and 2003 come largely from short-tail lines of business, where
results emerge quickly and actual reported losses are predictive of ultimate losses. Reserve
strengthening in 2004 related to accident years prior to 2001 relate primarily to reserve
strengthening for construction defect losses, HartRe assumed casualty reinsurance, environmental
exposures and uncollectible reinsurance. See Property & Casualty MD&A for further discussion.

Ceded Reinsurance

Consistent with industry practice, The Hartford cedes insurance risk to reinsurance companies. For
Property & Casualty operations, these reinsurance arrangements are intended to provide greater
diversification of business and limit The Hartford’s maximum net loss arising from large risks or
catastrophes.

A major portion of The Hartford’s property and casualty reinsurance is effected under general
reinsurance contracts known as treaties, or, in some instances, is negotiated on an individual risk
basis, known as facultative reinsurance. The Hartford also has in-force excess of loss contracts
with reinsurers that protect it against a specified part or all of certain losses over stipulated
amounts.

Reinsurance does not relieve The Hartford of its primary liability and, as such, failure of
reinsurers to honor their obligations could result in losses to The Hartford. The Hartford
evaluates the financial condition of its reinsurers and monitors concentrations of credit risk.
The Company’s monitoring procedures include careful initial selection of its reinsurers,
structuring agreements to provide collateral funds where possible, and regularly monitoring the
financial condition and ratings of its reinsurers.



In accordance with normal industry practice, Life is involved in both the cession and assumption of
insurance with other insurance and reinsurance companies. As of December 31, 2004, the largest
amount of life insurance retained on any one life by any one of the life operations was
approximately $2.9. In addition, Life has reinsured the majority of the minimum death benefit
guarantees as well as the guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefits on contracts issued prior to July
2003 offered in connection with its variable annuity contracts. Life also assumes reinsurance from
other insurers. Life evaluates the financial condition of its reinsurers and monitors
concentrations of credit risk. For the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, Life did not
make any significant changes in the terms under which reinsurance is ceded to other insurers except
for Life’s 2003 recapture of a block of business previously reinsured with an unaffiliated
reinsurer. For further discussion see Note 6 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Investment Operations

The Hartford’s investment portfolios are primarily divided between Life and Property & Casualty.
The investment portfolios of Life and Property & Casualty are managed by Hartford Investment
Management Company (“HIM”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of The Hartford. HIM manages the portfolios
to maximize economic value, while attempting to generate the income necessary to support the
Company’s various product obligations, within internally established objectives, guidelines and
risk tolerances. The portfolio objectives and guidelines are developed based upon the
asset/liability profile, including duration, convexity and other characteristics within specified
risk tolerances. The risk tolerances considered include, for example, asset and credit issuer
allocation limits, maximum portfolio below investment grade (“BIG”) holdings and foreign currency
exposure. The Company attempts to minimize adverse impacts to the portfolio and the results of
operations due to changes in economic conditions through asset allocation limits, asset/liability
duration matching and through the use of derivatives. (For further discussion of HIM’s portfolio
management approach, see the Investments General section of the MD&A.)

In addition to managing the general account assets of the Company, HIM is also a Securities and
Exchange Commission (“SEC”) registered investment advisor for third party institutional clients, a
sub-advisor for certain fixed income mutual funds offered by Hartford Life and serves as the
sponsor and collateral manager for synthetic collateralized loan obligations. HIM specializes in
fixed income investment management that incorporates proprietary research and active management
within a disciplined risk framework to provide value added returns versus peers and benchmarks.
The fair value of HIM’s total assets under management was approximately $101.9 billion and $104.1
billion as of December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively.

Regulation and Premium Rates

Insurance companies are subject to comprehensive and detailed regulation and supervision throughout
the United States. The extent of such regulation varies, but generally has its source in statutes
which delegate regulatory, supervisory and administrative powers to state insurance departments.
Such powers relate to, among other things, the standards of solvency that must be met and
maintained; the licensing of insurers and their agents; the nature of and limitations on
investments; establishing premium rates; claim handling and trade practices; restrictions on the
size of risks which may be insured under a single policy; deposits of securities for the benefit of
policyholders; approval of policy forms; periodic examinations of the affairs of companies; annual
and other reports required to be filed on the financial condition of companies or for other
purposes; fixing maximum interest rates on life insurance policy loans and minimum rates for
accumulation of surrender values; and the adequacy of reserves and other necessary provisions for
unearned premiums, unpaid claims and claim adjustment expenses and other liabilities, both reported
and unreported.

Most states have enacted legislation that regulates insurance holding company systems such as The
Hartford. This legislation provides that each insurance company in the system is required to
register with the insurance department of its state of domicile and furnish information concerning
the operations of companies within the holding company system which may materially affect the
operations, management or financial condition of the insurers within the system. All transactions
within a holding company system affecting insurers must be fair and equitable. Notice to the
insurance departments is required prior to the consummation of transactions affecting the ownership
or control of an insurer and of certain material transactions between an insurer and any entity in
its holding company system. In addition, certain of such transactions cannot be consummated
without the applicable insurance department’s prior approval. In most jurisdictions in which the
Company’s insurance company subsidiaries are domiciled, the acquisition of more than 10% of The
Hartford’s outstanding common stock would require the acquiring party to make various regulatory
filings. In some instances, an acquiring party would be required to obtain various regulatory
approvals prior to acquiring more than 10% of The Hartford’s outstanding common stock.

The extent of insurance regulation on business outside the United States varies significantly among
the countries in which The Hartford operates. Some countries have minimal regulatory requirements,
while others regulate insurers extensively. Foreign insurers in many countries are faced with
greater restrictions than domestic competitors domiciled in that particular jurisdiction. The
Hartford’s international operations are comprised of insurers licensed in their respective
countries and, therefore, are subject to the generally less restrictive domestic insurance
regulations.

Employees

The Hartford had approximately 30,000 employees as of December 31, 2004.



Available Information

The Hartford makes available free of charge on or through its Internet website
(http://www.thehartford.com) The Hartford’s annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form
10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to
Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act as soon as reasonably practicable after The Hartford
electronically files such material with, or furnishes it to, the SEC.

Item 2. PROPERTIES

The Hartford owns the land and buildings comprising its Hartford location and other properties
within the greater Hartford, Connecticut area which total approximately 1.9 million of the 2.2
million square feet owned. In addition, The Hartford leases approximately 5.3 million square feet
throughout the United States and approximately 130 thousand square feet in other countries. All of
the properties owned or leased are used by one or more of all eight operating segments, depending
on the location. (For more information on operating segments see Part 1, Item 1, Business of The
Hartford – Reporting Segments.) The Company believes its properties and facilities are suitable
and adequate for current operations.

Item 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

The Hartford is involved in claims litigation arising in the ordinary course of business, both
as a liability insurer defending third-party claims brought against insureds and as an insurer
defending coverage claims brought against it. The Hartford accounts for such activity through the
establishment of unpaid claim and claim adjustment expense reserves. Subject to the uncertainties
discussed below under the caption “Asbestos and Environmental Claims,” management expects that the
ultimate liability, if any, with respect to such ordinary-course claims litigation, after
consideration of provisions made for potential losses and costs of defense, will not be material to
the consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash flows of The Hartford.

The Hartford is also involved in other kinds of legal actions, some of which assert claims for
substantial amounts. These actions include, among others, putative state and federal class actions
seeking certification of a state or national class. Such putative class actions have alleged, for
example, underpayment of claims or improper underwriting practices in connection with various kinds
of insurance policies, such as personal and commercial automobile, property, and inland marine;
improper sales practices in connection with the sale of life insurance and other investment
products; and improper fee arrangements in connection with mutual funds. The Hartford also is
involved in individual actions in which punitive damages are sought, such as claims alleging bad
faith in the handling of insurance claims. Like many other insurers, The Hartford also has been
joined in actions by asbestos plaintiffs asserting that insurers had a duty to protect the public
from the dangers of asbestos. Management expects that the ultimate liability, if any, with respect
to such lawsuits, after consideration of provisions made for estimated losses, will not be material
to the consolidated financial condition of The Hartford. Nonetheless, given the large or
indeterminate amounts sought in certain of these actions, and the inherent unpredictability of
litigation, it is possible that an adverse outcome in certain matters could, from time to time,
have a material adverse effect on the Company’s consolidated results of operations or cash flows in
particular quarterly or annual periods.

Broker Compensation Litigation

– On October 14, 2004, the New York Attorney General’s Office filed
a civil complaint (the “NYAG Complaint”) against Marsh Inc. and Marsh & McLennan Companies, Inc.
(collectively, “Marsh”) alleging, among other things, that certain insurance companies, including
The Hartford, participated with Marsh in arrangements to submit inflated bids for business
insurance and paid contingent commissions to ensure that Marsh would direct business to them. The
Hartford is not joined as a defendant in the action. Since the filing of the NYAG Complaint,
several private actions have been filed against the Company asserting claims arising from the
allegations of the NYAG Complaint.

Two securities class actions have been filed in the United States District Court for the District
of Connecticut alleging claims against the Company and five of its executive officers under Section
10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act and SEC Rule 10b-5. The complaints allege on behalf of a
putative class of shareholders that the Company and the five named individual defendants, as
control persons of the Company, “disseminated false and misleading financial statements” by
concealing that “the Company was paying illegal and concealed ‘contingent commissions’ pursuant to
illegal ‘contingent commission agreements.’” The class period alleged is November 5, 2003 through
October 13, 2004, the day before the NYAG Complaint was filed. The complaints seek damages and
attorneys’ fees. The Company and the individual defendants dispute the allegations and intend to
defend these actions vigorously.

In addition, three putative class actions have been filed in the same court on behalf of
participants in the Company’s 401(k) plan against The Hartford, Hartford Fire Insurance Company,
the Company’s Pension Fund Trust and Investment Committee, the Company’s Pension Administration
Committee, the Company’s Chief Financial Officer, and John/Jane Does 1-15. The suits assert
claims under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (“ERISA”), alleging
that the Company and the other named defendants breached their fiduciary duties to plan
participants by, among other things, failing to inform them of the risk associated with investment
in the Company’s stock as a result of the activity alleged in the NYAG Complaint. The class
period alleged is November 5, 2003 through the present. The complaints seek restitution of losses
to the plan, declaratory and injunctive relief, and attorneys’ fees. All defendants dispute the
allegations and intend to defend these actions vigorously.



Two corporate derivative actions also have been filed in the same court. The complaints, brought
in each case by a shareholder on behalf of the Company against its directors and an executive
officer, allege that the defendants knew adverse non-public information about the activities
alleged in the NYAG Complaint and concealed and misappropriated that information to make profitable
stock trades, thereby breaching their fiduciary duties, abusing their control, committing gross
mismanagement, wasting corporate assets, and unjustly enriching themselves. The complaints seek
damages, injunctive relief, disgorgement, and attorneys’ fees. All defendants dispute the
allegations and intend to defend these actions vigorously.

Seven putative class actions also have been filed by alleged
policyholders in federal district courts, one in the Southern District of New York, two in
the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, three in the Northern District of Illinois, and one in the Northern
District of California, against several brokers and insurers, including the Company. These actions assert,
on behalf of a class of persons who purchased insurance through the broker defendants, claims under
the Sherman Act and state law, and in some cases the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act
(“RICO”), arising from the conduct alleged in the NYAG Complaint.
The class period alleged is 1994 through the date of class certification, which has not yet
occurred. The complaints seek treble damages, injunctive and
declaratory relief, and attorneys’ fees. Putative class actions also have been
filed in the Circuit Court for Cook County, Illinois, Chancery Division and in the Circuit Court for Seminole
County, Florida, Civil Division, on behalf of a class of all persons who purchased insurance from a class of
defendant insurers. These state court actions assert unjust enrichment claims and violations of state
unfair trade practices acts arising from the conduct alleged in the NYAG Complaint and seek remedies including restitution of premiums,
and, in the Cook County action, imposition of a constructive trust, and declaratory and injunctive relief. The class period alleged
is 1994 through the present. The Company has removed the Cook County action to the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois.
Pursuant to an order of the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation, it is likely that most or all of these actions will be transferred to the United States District
Court for the District of New Jersey. The Company disputes the allegations in all of these actions and intends to defend
the actions vigorously.

Additional complaints may be filed against the Company in various courts alleging claims under
federal or state law arising from the conduct alleged in the NYAG Complaint. The Company’s
ultimate liability, if any, in the pending and possible future suits is highly uncertain and
subject to contingencies that are not yet known, such as how many suits will be filed, in which
courts they will be lodged, what claims they will assert, what the outcome of investigations by the
New York Attorney General’s Office and other regulatory agencies will be, the success of defenses
that the Company may assert, and the amount of recoverable damages if liability is established. In
the opinion of management, it is possible that an adverse outcome in one or more of these suits
could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s consolidated results of operations or cash
flows in particular quarterly or annual periods.

Asbestos and Environmental Claims

– As discussed in Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations under the caption
“Other Operations (Including Asbestos and Environmental Claims)”, The Hartford
continues to receive asbestos and environmental claims that involve significant uncertainty
regarding policy coverage issues. Regarding these claims, The Hartford continually reviews its
overall reserve levels and reinsurance coverages, as well as the methodologies it uses to estimate
its exposures. Because of the significant uncertainties that limit the ability of insurers and
reinsurers to estimate the ultimate reserves necessary for unpaid losses and related expenses,
particularly those related to asbestos, the ultimate liabilities may exceed the currently recorded
reserves. Any such additional liability cannot be reasonably estimated now but could be material
to The Hartford’s future consolidated operating results, financial condition and liquidity.

Item 4. SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS

No matter was submitted to a vote of security holders of The Hartford during the fourth
quarter of 2004.

As of February 15, 2005, the Company had approximately 180,000 shareholders. The closing
price of The Hartford’s common stock on the NYSE on February 15, 2005 was $72.56.

On February 17, 2005, The Hartford’s Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.29 per
share payable on April 1, 2005 to shareholders of record as of March 1, 2005. Dividend decisions
are based on and affected by a number of factors, including the operating results and financial
requirements of The Hartford and the impact of regulatory restrictions discussed in the Capital
Resources and Liquidity section of the MD&A under “Liquidity Requirements”.

There are also various legal and regulatory limitations governing the extent to which The
Hartford’s insurance subsidiaries may extend credit, pay dividends or otherwise provide funds to
The Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc. as discussed in the Capital Resources and Liquidity
section of the MD&A under “Liquidity Requirements”.

OVERVIEW

The Hartford is a diversified insurance and financial services company with operations dating
back to 1810. The Company is headquartered in Connecticut and is organized into two major
operations: Life and Property & Casualty, each containing reporting segments. In the quarter
ended March 31, 2004, and as more fully described below, the Company changed its reporting
segments to reflect the current manner by which its chief operating decision maker views and
manages the business. All segment data for prior reporting periods have been adjusted to reflect
the current segment reporting. Within the Life and Property & Casualty operations, The Hartford
conducts business principally in eight operating segments. Additionally, Corporate includes all
of the Company’s debt financing and related interest expense, as well as certain capital raising
activities and purchase accounting adjustments.

Life includes four reportable operating segments: Retail Products Group, Institutional Solutions
Group, Individual Life and Group Benefits. Through Life the Company provides investment and
retirement products such as variable and fixed annuities, mutual funds and retirement plan
services; other institutional investment products; structured settlements; private placement life
insurance; individual life insurance products including variable universal life, universal life,
interest sensitive whole life and term life; and group benefit products, such as group life and
group disability insurance.



Property & Casualty is organized into four reportable operating segments: the underwriting segments
of Business Insurance, Personal Lines and Specialty Commercial (collectively “Ongoing Operations”),
and the Other Operations segment. Through Property & Casualty the Company provides a number of
coverages, as well as insurance-related services, to businesses throughout the United States,
including workers’ compensation, property, automobile, liability, umbrella, specialty casualty,
marine, agriculture, bond, professional liability and director’s and officer’s liability coverages.
Property & Casualty also provides automobile, homeowners, and home-based business coverage to
individuals throughout the United States, as well as insurance-related services to businesses.

Many of the principal factors that drive the profitability of The Hartford’s Life and Property &
Casualty operations are separate and distinct. Management considers this diversification to be a
strength of The Hartford that distinguishes the Company from its peers. To present its operations
in a more meaningful and organized way, management has included separate overviews within the Life
and Property & Casualty sections of MD&A. For further overview of Life’s profitability and
analysis, see page 34. For further overview of Property & Casualty’s profitability and analysis,
see page 44.

Regulatory Developments

In June 2004, the Company received a subpoena from the New York Attorney General’s Office in
connection with its inquiry into compensation arrangements between brokers and carriers. In
mid-September 2004 and subsequently, the Company has received additional subpoenas from the New
York Attorney General’s Office, which relate more specifically to possible anti-competitive
activity among brokers and insurers. Since the beginning of October
2004, the Company has received
subpoenas or other information requests from Attorneys General and regulatory agencies in more than
a dozen jurisdictions regarding broker compensation and possible anti-competitive activity. The
Company may receive additional subpoenas and other information requests from Attorneys General or
other regulatory agencies regarding similar issues. The Company also has received a subpoena from
the New York Attorney General’s Office requesting information related to the Company’s underwriting
practices with respect to legal professional liability insurance. In addition, the Company has
received a request for information from the New York Attorney General’s Office concerning the
Company’s compensation arrangements in connection with the administration of workers compensation
plans. The Company intends to continue cooperating fully with these investigations, and is
conducting an internal review, with the assistance of outside counsel, regarding the issues under
investigation.

On October 14, 2004, the New York Attorney General’s Office filed a civil complaint against Marsh &
McLennan Companies, Inc., and Marsh, Inc. (collectively, “Marsh”). The complaint alleges, among
other things, that certain insurance companies, including the Company, participated with Marsh in
arrangements to submit inflated bids for business insurance and paid contingent commissions to
ensure that Marsh would direct business to them. The Company is not joined as a defendant in the
action. Although no regulatory action has been initiated against the Company in connection with
the allegations described in the civil complaint, it is possible that the New York Attorney
General’s Office or one or more other regulatory agencies may pursue action against the Company or
one or more of its employees in the future. The potential timing of any such action is difficult
to predict. If such an action is brought, it could have a material adverse effect on the Company.

On October 29, 2004, the New York Attorney General’s Office informed the Company that the Attorney
General is conducting an investigation with respect to the timing of the previously disclosed sale
by Thomas Marra, a director and executive officer of the Company, of 217,074 shares of the
Company’s common stock on September 21, 2004. The sale occurred shortly after the issuance of two
additional subpoenas dated September 17, 2004 by the New York Attorney General’s Office. The
Company has engaged outside counsel to review the circumstances related to the transaction and is
fully cooperating with the New York Attorney General’s Office. On the basis of the review, the
Company has determined that Mr. Marra complied with the Company’s applicable internal trading
procedures and has found no indication that Mr. Marra was aware of the additional subpoenas at the
time of the sale.

There continues to be significant federal and state regulatory activity relating to financial
services companies, particularly mutual funds companies. These regulatory inquiries have focused
on a number of mutual fund issues, including market timing and late trading, revenue sharing and
directed brokerage, fees, transfer agents and other fund service providers, and other mutual-fund
related issues. The Company has received requests for information and subpoenas from the
Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), subpoenas from the New York Attorney General’s Office,
requests for information from the Connecticut Securities and Investments Division of the Department
of Banking, and requests for information from the New York Department of Insurance, in each case
requesting documentation and other information regarding various mutual fund regulatory issues.

The SEC’s Division of Enforcement and the New York Attorney General’s Office are investigating
aspects of the Company’s variable annuity and mutual fund operations related to market timing. The
Company’s mutual funds are available for purchase by the separate accounts of different variable
universal life insurance policies, variable annuity products, and funding agreements, and they are
offered directly to certain qualified retirement plans. Although existing products contain
transfer restrictions between subaccounts, some products, particularly older variable annuity
products, do not contain restrictions on the frequency of transfers. In addition, as a result of
the settlement of litigation against the Company with respect to certain owners of older variable
annuity products, the Company’s ability to restrict transfers by
these owners is limited. In February 2005, the Company agreed in
principle with the Boards of Directors of the mutual funds to
indemnify the mutual funds for any material harm caused to the funds
from frequent trading by these owners. The specific terms of the
indemnification have not been determined. The
SEC’s Division of Enforcement also is investigating aspects of the Company’s variable annuity and
mutual fund operations related to directed brokerage and revenue sharing. The Company discontinued
the use of directed brokerage in recognition of mutual fund sales in late 2003. The Company also
has received a subpoena from the New York Attorney General’s Office requesting information related
to the Company’s group annuity products. The Company continues to cooperate fully with the SEC,
the New York Attorney General’s Office and other regulatory agencies.



A number of companies have announced settlements of enforcement actions with various regulatory
agencies, primarily the SEC and the New York Attorney General’s Office, which have included a range
of monetary penalties and restitution. While no such action has been initiated against the
Company, the SEC, and the New York Attorney General’s Office are likely to take some action at the
conclusion of the on-going investigations related to market timing and directed brokerage. The
potential timing of any such action is difficult to predict, and the Company’s ultimate liability,
if any, from any such action is not reasonably estimable at this time. If such an action is
brought, it could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s consolidated results of
operations or cash flows in particular quarterly or annual periods.

Broker Compensation

As the Company has disclosed previously, the Company pays brokers and independent agents
commissions and other forms of incentive compensation in connection with the sale of many of the
Company’s insurance products. Since the New York Attorney General’s Office filed a civil complaint
against Marsh & McLennan Companies, Inc. and Marsh, Inc. (collectively, “Marsh”) on October 14,
2004, several of the largest national insurance brokers, including Marsh, have announced that they
have discontinued the use of contingent compensation arrangements. Other industry participants may
make similar, or different, determinations in the future. In addition, legal, legislative,
regulatory, business or other developments may require changes to industry practices relating to
incentive compensation. At this time, it is not possible to predict the effect of these announced
or potential changes on the Company’s business or distribution strategies .

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES

The preparation of financial statements, in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”), requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent
assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues
and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

The Company has identified the following estimates as critical in that they involve a higher degree
of judgment and are subject to a significant degree of variability: insurance reserves; Life
operations deferred policy acquisition costs and present value of future profits; the valuation of
investments and derivative instruments and the evaluation of other-than-temporary impairments;
pension and other postretirement benefits; and contingencies. In developing these estimates
management makes subjective and complex judgments that are inherently uncertain and subject to
material change as facts and circumstances develop. Although variability is inherent in these
estimates, management believes the amounts provided are appropriate based upon the facts available
upon compilation of the financial statements.

Reserves

Life

The Company’s life insurance subsidiaries establish and carry as liabilities, predominantly, three
types of reserves: (1) a liability for amounts that accrue to the benefit of the policyholder as of
the financial statement date, (2) a liability for unpaid claims, including those that have been
incurred but not yet reported, and (3) a liability for future policy benefits. Reserves also
include amounts for unearned premiums. Reserves for assumed reinsurance are computed in a manner
that is comparable to direct insurance reserves.

The Company has classified its fixed and variable annuities, 401(k), certain governmental
annuities, private placement life insurance, variable universal life insurance, universal life
insurance and interest sensitive whole life insurance as universal life-type contracts. The
liability for universal life-type contracts is equal to the balance that accrues to the benefit of
the policyholders as of the financial statement date (commonly referred to as the account value),
including credited interest, amounts that have been assessed to compensate the Company for services
to be performed over future periods, and any amounts previously assessed against policyholders that
are refundable on termination of the contract. Certain contracts classified as universal life-type
may also include additional death or other insurance benefit features, such as guaranteed minimum
death or income benefits offered with variable annuity contracts or no lapse guarantees offered
with universal life insurance contracts. An additional liability is established for these benefits
by estimating the expected present value of the benefits in excess of the projected account value
in proportion to the present value of total expected assessments. Excess benefits are accrued as a
liability as actual assessments are recorded. Determination of the expected value of excess
benefits and assessments are based on a range of scenarios and assumptions including those related
to market rates of return and volatility, contract surrender rates and mortality experience.

The Company has classified its institutional and governmental products, without life contingencies,
including funding agreements, structured settlements and guaranteed investment contracts, as
investment contracts. The liability for investment contracts is equal to the balance that accrues
to the benefit of the contract holder as of the financial statement date, which includes the
accumulation of deposits plus credited interest, less withdrawals and amounts assessed through the
financial statement date.

Liabilities for the Company’s group life and disability contracts as well its individual term life
insurance policies include amounts for unpaid claims and future policy benefits. Liabilities for
unpaid claims include estimates of amounts to fully settle known reported claims as well as claims
related to insured events that the Company estimates have been incurred but have not yet been
reported. Liabilities for future policy benefits are calculated by estimating the present value of
future policy benefits to be paid to or on behalf of policyholders less the estimated present value
of future net premiums. The methods used in determining the liability for unpaid



claims and future policy benefits are standard actuarial methods recognized by the American Academy
of Actuaries. For the tabular reserves, discount rates are based on the Company’s earned
investment yield and the morbidity/mortality tables used are standard industry tables modified to
reflect the Company’s actual experience when appropriate. In particular, for the Company’s group
disability known claim reserves, the morbidity table for the early durations of claim is based
exclusively on the Company’s experience, incorporating factors such as sex, elimination period and
diagnosis. These reserves are computed such that they are expected to meet the Company’s future
policy obligations. Future policy benefits are computed at amounts that, with additions from
estimated premiums to be received and with interest on such reserves compounded annually at certain
assumed rates, are expected to be sufficient to meet the Company’s policy obligations at their
maturities or in the event of an insured’s death. Changes in or deviations from the assumptions
used for mortality, morbidity, expected future premiums and interest can significantly affect the
Company’s reserve levels and related future operations and, as such, provisions for adverse
deviation are built into the long-tailed liability assumptions.

Property & Casualty

The Hartford establishes property and casualty reserves to provide for the estimated costs of
paying claims under insurance policies written by the Company. These reserves include estimates
for both claims that have been reported and those that have been incurred but not reported, and
include estimates of all expenses associated with processing and settling these claims. Estimating
the ultimate cost of future claims and claim adjustment expenses is an uncertain and complex
process. This estimation process is based largely on the assumption that past developments are an
appropriate predictor of future events and involves a variety of actuarial techniques that analyze
experience, trends and other relevant factors. Reserve estimates can change over time because of
unexpected changes in the external environment. Potential external factors include (1) changes in
the inflation rate for goods and services related to covered damages such as medical care, hospital
care, auto parts, wages and home repair, (2) changes in the general economic environment that could
cause unanticipated changes in the claim frequency per unit insured, (3) changes in the litigation
environment as evidenced by changes in claimant attorney representation in the claims negotiation
and settlement process, (4) changes in the judicial environment regarding the interpretation of
policy provisions relating to the determination of coverage and/or the amount of damages awarded
for certain types of damages, (5) changes in the social environment regarding the general attitude
of juries in the determination of liability and damages, (6) changes in the legislative environment
regarding the definition of damages and (7) new types of injuries caused by new types of injurious
exposure: past examples include breast implants, lead paint and construction defects. Reserve
estimates can also change over time because of changes in internal company operations. Potential
internal factors include (1) periodic changes in claims handling procedures, (2) growth in new
lines of business where exposure and loss development patterns are not well established or (3)
changes in the quality of risk selection in the underwriting process. In the case of assumed
reinsurance, all of the above risks apply. In addition, changes in ceding company case reserving
and reporting patterns can create additional factors that need to be considered in estimating the
reserves. Due to the inherent complexity of the assumptions used, final claim settlements may vary
significantly from the present estimates, particularly when those settlements may not occur until
well into the future.

The Hartford, like other insurance companies, categorizes and tracks its insurance reserves for its
segments by “line of business”, such as property, auto physical damage, auto liability, commercial
multi-peril package business, workers’ compensation, general liability and professional liability.
Furthermore, The Hartford regularly reviews the appropriateness of reserve levels at the line of
business level, taking into consideration the variety of trends that impact the ultimate settlement
of claims for the subsets of claims in each particular line of business. In addition, within the
Other Operations segment, the Company has reserves for asbestos and environmental (A&E) claims.
Adjustments to previously established reserves, which may be material, are reflected in the
operating results of the period in which the adjustment is determined to be necessary. In the
judgment of management, information currently available has been properly considered in the
reserves established for claims and claim adjustment expenses.

Incurred but not reported (IBNR) reserves represent the difference between the estimated
ultimate cost of all claims and the actual reported loss and loss adjustment expenses (“reported
losses”). Reported losses represent cumulative loss and loss adjustment expenses paid plus case
reserves for outstanding reported claims. Company actuaries evaluate the total reserves (IBNR and
case reserves) on an accident year basis. An accident year is the calendar year in which a loss is
incurred, or, in the case of claims-made policies, the calendar year in which a loss is reported.

Reserving for non-A&E reserves within Ongoing and Other Operations:

How non-A&E reserves are set

Reserves are set by line of business within the various operating segments. As indicated in the
above table, a single line of business may be written in one or more of the segments. Case
reserves are established by a claims handler on each individual claim and are adjusted as new
information becomes known during the course of handling the claim. Lines of business for which loss
data (e.g. paid losses and case reserves) emerge (i.e. is reported) over a long period of time are
referred to as long-tail lines of business. Lines of business for which loss data emerge more
quickly are referred to as short-tail lines of business. Within the Company’s Ongoing Operations
the shortest-tail lines of business are property and auto physical damage. The longest tail lines
of business within Ongoing Operations include workers’ compensation, general liability, and
professional liability. HartRe assumed reinsurance, which is within Other Operations, is also
long-tail business.

Company actuaries regularly review reserves for both current and prior accident years using the
most current claim data. These quarterly reserve reviews incorporate a variety of actuarial
methods and judgments and involve rigorous analysis. For most lines of business, a variety of
actuarial methods are reviewed and the actuaries select methods and specific assumptions
appropriate for each line of business based on the current circumstances affecting that line of
business. These selections incorporate input from claims personnel, pricing actuaries and
operating management on reported loss cost trends and other factors that could affect the reserve
estimates.

For short-tail lines of business, emergence of paid loss and case reserves is credible and likely
indicative of ultimate losses. The method used to set reserves for these lines incorporates two
key assumptions. The first key assumption is an expected loss ratio for the current accident year.
This loss ratio is determined through a review of prior accident years’ loss ratios and expected
changes to earned pricing, loss costs, mix of business, ceded reinsurance and other factors that
are expected to impact the loss ratio for the current accident year. The second key assumption is
a development pattern for reported losses (also referred to as the loss emergence pattern). IBNR
reserves for the current year are set as the product of the expected loss ratio for the period,
earned premium for the period and the proportion of losses expected to be reported in future
calendar periods for the current accident period. IBNR reserves for prior accident years are
similarly determined, again relying on an expected development pattern for reported losses.

For long-tail lines of business, emergence of paid losses and case reserves is less credible in the
early periods and, accordingly may not be indicative of ultimate losses. For these lines,
methods which incorporate a development pattern assumption are given less weight in calculating
IBNR reserves for the early stages of loss emergence because such a low percentage of ultimate
losses are reported in that time frame. Accordingly, for any given accident year, the rate at
which losses emerge in the early periods is generally not as reliable an indication of the ultimate
loss costs as it would be for shorter-tail lines of business. The estimation of reserves for these
lines of business in the early stages of loss emergence is therefore largely influenced by prior
accident years’ loss ratios and expected changes to earned pricing, loss costs, mix of business,
ceded reinsurance and other factors that are expected to affect the loss ratio. For later periods
of loss emergence, methods which incorporate a development pattern assumption are given more weight
in estimating ultimate losses.



Based on the results of the quarterly reserve reviews, the Company will determine the appropriate
reserve adjustments, if any, to record. Recorded reserve estimates are changed after consideration
of numerous factors, including but not limited to, the magnitude of the difference between the
actuarial indication and the recorded reserves, improvement or deterioration of actuarial
indications in the
period, the maturity of the accident year, trends observed over the recent past and the level of
volatility within a particular line of business. In general, changes are made more quickly to more
mature accident years and less volatile lines of business. At year-end 2004, total recorded
reserves excluding asbestos and environmental were within 0.2% of the actuarial indication.
Annually, as part of the statutory reporting requirements, IBNR is allocated to accident year by
statutory line of business. This work forms the basis for the loss development table and reserve
re-estimates table shown in the “Business” section.

During 2004 there were numerous changes to reserve estimates. Among other loss developments in
2004, these changes included a reduction in estimated ultimate losses associated with September 11
and increases in estimated ultimate losses associated with construction defect claims and HartRe
assumed reinsurance. Changes in 2004 also included increases in the estimated ultimate losses for
auto liability and package business in Business Insurance, as well as a reduction in the expected
loss ratio for accident year 2004 for Bond within Specialty Commercial. See “Reserves” within the
Property and Casualty MD&A for further discussion of reserve developments.

Current trends contributing to reserve uncertainty

The Hartford is a multi-line company in the property and casualty business. The Hartford is
therefore subject to reserve uncertainty stemming from a number of conditions, including but not
limited to those noted above, any of which could be material at any point in time for any segment.
Certain issues may become more or less important over time as conditions change. As various market
conditions develop, management must assess whether those conditions constitute a long-term trend
that should result in a reserving action (i.e. increasing or decreasing the reserve). Below is a
discussion of certain market conditions that Company management has observed during 2004.

Within the commercial segments and the Other Operations segment, the Company has exposure to
claims asserted for bodily injury as a result of long-term or continuous exposure to harmful
products or substances. Examples include, but are not limited to, pharmaceutical products, latex
gloves, silica and lead paint. The Company also has exposure to claims from construction defects,
where property damage or bodily injury from negligent construction is alleged. The Company also
has exposure to claims asserted against religious institutions and other organizations relating to
molestation or abuse. Such exposures may involve potentially long latency periods and may
implicate coverage in multiple policy periods. These factors make reserves for such claims more
uncertain than other bodily injury or property damage claims. With regard to these exposures, the
Company is monitoring trends in litigation, the external environment, the similarities to other
mass torts and the potential impact on the Company’s reserves.

In Personal Lines, reserving estimates are generally less variable than for the Company’s other
property and casualty segments. This is largely due to the coverages having relatively shorter
periods of loss emergence. Estimates, however, can still vary due to a number of factors,
including interpretations of frequency and severity trends and their impact on recorded reserve
levels. Severity trends can be impacted by changes in internal claim handling and reserving
practices in addition to changes in the external environment. These changes in claim practices
increase the uncertainty in the interpretation of case reserve data, which increases the
uncertainty in recorded reserve levels.

In Business Insurance, workers’ compensation is the Company’s single biggest line of business and
the line of business with the longest pattern of loss emergence. Reserve estimates for workers’
compensation are particularly sensitive to assumptions about medical inflation, which has been
increasing steadily over the past few years. In addition, changes in state legislative and
regulatory environments impact the Company’s estimates. In particular, the California environment
has been very volatile, in part due to reforms intended to reduce loss costs. It is still
uncertain how these reforms will ultimately impact the timing of future payments and the needed
amount of reserves.

In the Specialty Commercial segment, many lines of insurance, such as excess insurance and
deductible workers’ compensation insurance are “long-tail” lines of insurance. For long-tail
lines, the period of time between the incidence of the insured loss and either the reporting of
the claim to the insurer, the settlement of the claim, or the payment of the claim can be
substantial, and in some cases, several years. As a result of this extended period of time for
losses to emerge, reserve estimates for these lines are more uncertain (i.e. more variable) than
reserve estimates for shorter-tail lines of insurance. Estimating required reserve levels for
deductible workers’ compensation insurance is further complicated by the uncertainty of whether
losses that are attributable to the deductible amount can be paid by the insured; if such losses
are not paid by the insured due to financial difficulties, the Company would be contractually
liable. Another example of reserve variability relates to reserves for directors and officers
insurance. There is uncertainty in the required level of reserves due to the impact of recent
allegations within the financial services industry, including those in the mutual fund, investment
banking and insurance industries, as well as due to various highly-publicized bankruptcies.

Impact of changes in key assumptions on reserve volatility

As stated above, the Company’s practice is to estimate reserves using a variety of methods,
assumptions and data elements. Within its reserve estimation process for reserves other than
asbestos and environmental, the Company does not derive statistical loss distributions or
confidence levels around its reserve estimate and, as a result, do not have reserve range
estimates to disclose.



The reserve estimation process includes explicit assumptions about a number of factors in the
internal and external environment. Across most lines of business, the most important assumptions
are future loss development factors applied to paid or reported losses to date. For most lines,
the reported loss development factor is most important. In workers’ compensation, paid loss
development
factors are also important. The trend in loss costs is also a key assumption, particularly in the
most recent accident years, where loss development factors are less credible.

The following discussion includes disclosure of possible variation from current estimates of loss
reserves due to a change in certain key assumptions. Each of the impacts described below is
estimated individually, without consideration for any correlation among key assumptions or among
lines of business. Therefore, it would be inappropriate to take each of the amounts described
below and add them together in an attempt to estimate volatility for the Company’s reserves in
total. The estimated variation in reserves due to changes in key assumptions is a reasonable
estimate of possible variation that may occur in the future, likely over a period of several
calendar years. It is important to note that the variation discussed is not meant to be a
worst-case scenario, and therefore, it is possible that future variation may be more than amounts
discussed below.

Recorded reserves for workers’ compensation, net of reinsurance, are $4.3 billion, across Business
Insurance and Specialty Commercial. The two most important assumptions for workers’ compensation
reserves are loss development factors and loss cost trends, particularly medical cost inflation.
The Company has reviewed the historical variation in paid loss development patterns. If the paid
loss development patterns change by 3%, a change that is within historical variation, the
estimated reserve need would change by $300, in either direction. Approximately half of the
workers’ compensation net reserves are related to future medical costs. A review of National
Council on Compensation Insurance (“NCCI”) data suggests that the annual growth in industry
medical claim costs has varied from -2% to +12% since 1991. Across the entire reserve base, a 1
point change in calendar year medical inflation would change the estimated net reserve by $350, in
either direction. A change in calendar year medical inflation will impact paid loss development
patterns, so the individual variation amounts shown above for a 3% change in paid loss development
patterns and a 1 point change in medical inflation should not be added together to determine the
combined impact of both changes.

Recorded reserves for auto liability, net of reinsurance, are $2.1 billion across all lines, $1.5
billion of which is in Personal Lines. Personal auto liability reserves are shorter-tailed than
other lines of business (such as workers’ compensation) and, therefore, less volatile. However,
the size of the reserve base means that future changes in estimate could be material to the
Company’s results of operations in any given period. The key assumption for Personal Lines auto
liability is the annual loss cost trend, particularly the severity trend component of loss costs.
A review of Insurance Services Office (“ISO”) data suggests that annual growth in industry
severity since 1999 has varied from +1% to +6%. A 2.5 point change in assumed annual severity for
the two most recent accident years would change the estimated net reserve need by $60, in either
direction.

Recorded reserves for general liability, net of reinsurance, are $1.8 billion across Business
Insurance and Specialty Commercial. Reported loss development patterns are a key assumption for
this line of business, particularly for more mature accident years. Historically, assumptions on
reported loss development patterns have been impacted by, among other things, emergence of new
types of claims (e.g. construction defect claims) or a shift in the mixture between smaller, more
routine claims and larger, more complex claims. The Company has reviewed the historical variation
in reported loss development patterns. If the reported loss development patterns change by 7%, a
change that is within historical variation, the estimated net reserve need would change by $200,
in either direction.

Similar to general liability, HartRe assumed casualty reinsurance is affected by
reported loss development pattern assumptions. In addition to the items identified above that
would affect both direct and reinsurance liability claim development patterns, there is also an
impact to assumed reporting patterns for any changes in claim notification from ceding companies to
the reinsurer. Recorded net reserves for HartRe assumed reinsurance business, excluding asbestos
and environmental liabilities, within Other Operations were $1.3 billion as of
December 31, 2004. If the development patterns underlying the Company’s net reserves for HartRe
assumed casualty reinsurance are incorrect by 10 points, the estimated net reserve need would
change by $270, in either direction.

Reserving for Asbestos and Environmental Claims within Other Operations

How A&E reserves are set

The Hartford continues to receive claims that assert damages from asbestos-related and
environmental-related exposures. Asbestos claims relate primarily to bodily injuries asserted by
those who came in contact with asbestos or products containing asbestos. Environmental claims
relate primarily to pollution and related clean-up costs.

The Hartford wrote several different categories of insurance coverage to which asbestos and
environmental claims may apply. First, The Hartford wrote primary policies providing the first
layer of coverage in an insured’s liability program. Second, The Hartford wrote excess policies
providing higher layers of coverage for losses that exhaust the limits of underlying coverage.
Third, The Hartford acted as a reinsurer assuming a portion of risks previously assumed by other
insurers writing primary, excess and reinsurance coverages. Fourth, The Hartford participated in
the London Market, writing both direct insurance and assumed reinsurance business.

In establishing reserves for asbestos claims, The Hartford evaluates each insured’s estimated
liability for such claims using a ground-up approach. The Hartford considers a variety of factors,
including the jurisdictions where underlying claims have been brought, past,



pending and
anticipated future claim activity, disease mix, past settlement values of similar claims, dismissal
rates, allocated claim adjustment expense, and potential bankruptcy impact.

Similarly, a ground-up exposure review approach is used to establish environmental reserves. The
Hartford’s evaluation of each insured’s estimated liability for environmental claims involves
consideration of several factors, including historical values of similar claims, the number of
sites involved, the insured’s alleged activities at each site, the alleged environmental damage at
each site, the respective shares of liability of potentially responsible parties at each site, the
appropriateness and cost of remediation at each site, the nature of governmental enforcement
activities at each site, and potential bankruptcy impact.

Having evaluated the insured’s probable liability for asbestos and/or environmental claims, The
Hartford then evaluates each insured’s insurance coverage program for such claims. The Hartford
considers each insured’s total available insurance coverage, including the coverage issued by The
Hartford. The Hartford also considers relevant judicial interpretations of policy language and
applicable coverage defenses or determinations, if any.

Evaluation of both the insured’s estimated liability and The Hartford’s exposure to the insured
depends heavily on an analysis of the relevant legal issues and litigation environment. This
analysis is conducted by the Company’s lawyers and is subject to applicable privileges.

For both asbestos and environmental reserves, The Hartford also compares its historical direct net
loss and expense paid and incurred experience, and net loss and expense paid and incurred
experience year by year, to assess any emerging trends, fluctuations or characteristics suggested
by the aggregate paid and incurred activity.

Once the gross ultimate exposure for indemnity and allocated claim adjustment expense is determined
for each insured by each policy year, The Hartford calculates its ceded reinsurance projection
based on any applicable facultative and treaty reinsurance and the Company’s experience with
reinsurance collections.

Uncertainties Regarding Adequacy of Asbestos and Environmental Reserves

With regard to both environmental and particularly asbestos claims, significant uncertainty limits
the ability of insurers and reinsurers to estimate the ultimate reserves necessary for unpaid
losses and related expenses. Traditional actuarial reserving techniques cannot reasonably estimate
the ultimate cost of these claims, particularly during periods where theories of law are in flux.
The degree of variability of reserve estimates for these exposures is significantly greater than
for other more traditional exposures. In particular, The Hartford believes there is a high degree
of uncertainty inherent in the estimation of asbestos loss reserves.

In the case of the reserves for asbestos exposures, factors contributing to the high degree of
uncertainty include inadequate loss development patterns, plaintiffs’ expanding theories of
liability, the risks inherent in major litigation, and inconsistent emerging legal doctrines.
Furthermore, over time, insurers, including The Hartford, have experienced significant changes in
the rate at which asbestos claims are brought, the claims experience of particular insureds, and
the value of claims, making predictions of future exposure from past experience uncertain. For
example, in the past few years, insurers in general, including The Hartford, have experienced an
increase in the number of asbestos-related claims due to, among other things, plaintiffs’ increased
focus on new and previously peripheral defendants, and an increase in the number of insureds
seeking bankruptcy protection as a result of asbestos-related liabilities. Plaintiffs and insureds
have sought to use bankruptcy proceedings, including “pre-packaged” bankruptcies, to accelerate and
increase loss payments by insurers. In addition, some policyholders have asserted new classes of
claims for so-called “non-products” coverages to which an aggregate limit of liability may not
apply. Further uncertainties include insolvencies of other carriers and unanticipated
developments pertaining to The Hartford’s ability to recover reinsurance for asbestos and
environmental claims. Management believes these issues are not likely to be resolved in the near
future.

In the case of the reserves for environmental exposures, factors contributing to the high degree of
uncertainty include expanding theories of liabilities and damages; the risks inherent in major
litigation; inconsistent decisions concerning the existence and scope of coverage for environmental
claims; and uncertainty as to the monetary amount being sought by the claimant from the insured.

It is also not possible to predict changes in the legal and legislative environment and their
impact on the future development of asbestos and environmental claims. It is unknown whether
potential Federal asbestos-related legislation will be enacted, and if so, what its effect will be
on The Hartford’s aggregate asbestos liabilities.

The reporting pattern for assumed reinsurance claims is much longer than for direct claims. In many
instances, it takes months or years to determine that the policyholder’s own obligations have been
met and how the reinsurance in question may apply to such claims. The delay in reporting
reinsurance claims and exposures adds to the uncertainty of estimating the related reserves.

Given the factors and emerging trends described above, The Hartford believes the actuarial tools
and other techniques it employs to estimate the ultimate cost of claims for more traditional kinds
of insurance exposure are less precise in estimating reserves for its asbestos and environmental
exposures. For this reason, The Hartford relies on an exposure-based analysis to estimate the
ultimate costs of these claims and regularly evaluates new information in assessing its potential
asbestos and environmental exposures.

The variability of estimates for asbestos and environmental reserves is affected by a number of
factors including assumptions with respect to the frequency of claims, the average severity of
those claims settled with payment, the dismissal rate of claims with no payment and the expense to
indemnity ratio. The uncertainty with respect to the underlying reserve assumptions for asbestos
and



environmental adds a greater degree of variability and risk to these reserve estimates than
reserve estimates for more traditional exposures. While this variability is reflected in part in
the size of the range of reserves developed by the Company, that range may still not be indicative
of the potential variance between the ultimate outcome and the recorded reserves. The recorded net
reserves as of December 31, 2004 of $2.9 billion ($2.5 billion and $394 for asbestos and environmental,
respectively) is within an estimated range, unadjusted for covariance, of $2.4 billion to $3.4
billion. The process of estimating asbestos and environmental reserves remains subject to a wide
variety of uncertainties, which are detailed in Note 12 of Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements. Due to these uncertainties, further developments could cause The Hartford to change
its estimates and ranges of its asbestos and environmental reserves, and the effect of these changes
could be material to the Company’s consolidated operating results, financial condition and
liquidity.

In the opinion of management, based upon the known facts and current law, the reserves recorded for
The Hartford’s property and casualty businesses at December 31, 2004 represent the Company’s best
estimate of its ultimate liability for claims and claim adjustment expenses related to losses
covered by policies written by the Company. However, because of the significant uncertainties
surrounding environmental, and particularly asbestos exposures, it is possible that management’s
estimate of the ultimate liabilities for these claims may change and that the required adjustment
to recorded reserves could exceed the currently recorded reserves by an amount that could be
material to The Hartford’s results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.

Valuation of Investments and Derivative Instruments and Evaluation of Other-Than-Temporary
Impairments

The Hartford’s investments in fixed maturities, which include bonds, redeemable preferred stock and
commercial paper; and certain equity securities, which include common and non-redeemable preferred
stocks, are classified as “available-for-sale” as defined in Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards (“SFAS”) No. 115, “Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities”
(“SFAS No. 115”). Accordingly, these securities are carried at fair value with the after-tax
difference from amortized cost, as adjusted for the effect of deducting the life and pension
policyholders’ share of the immediate participation guaranteed contracts and certain life and
annuity deferred policy acquisition costs, reflected in stockholders’ equity as a component of
accumulated other comprehensive income (“AOCI”). The equity investments associated with the
variable annuity products offered in Japan are recorded at fair value and are classified as
“trading” as defined in SFAS No. 115, with changes in fair value recorded in net investment income.
Policy loans are carried at outstanding balance, which approximates fair value. Other investments
primarily consist of limited partnership interests, derivatives and mortgage loans. The limited
partnerships are accounted for under the equity method and accordingly the Company’s share of
partnership earnings are included in net investment income. Derivatives are carried at fair value
and mortgage loans on real estate are recorded at the outstanding principal balance adjusted for
amortization of premiums or discounts and net of valuation allowances, if any.

Valuation of Fixed Maturities

The fair value for fixed maturity securities is largely determined by one of three primary pricing
methods: independent third party pricing service market quotations, independent broker quotations
or pricing matrices, which use data provided by external sources. With the exception of short-term
securities for which amortized cost is predominantly used to approximate fair value, security
pricing is applied using a hierarchy or “waterfall” approach whereby prices are first sought from
independent pricing services with the remaining unpriced securities submitted to brokers for prices
or lastly priced via a pricing matrix.

Prices from independent pricing services are often unavailable for securities that are rarely
traded or are traded only in privately negotiated transactions. As a result, certain of the
Company’s asset-backed and commercial mortgage-backed securities are priced via broker quotations.
A pricing matrix is used to price securities for which the Company is unable to obtain either a
price from an independent third party service or an independent broker quotation. The pricing
matrix begins with current treasury rates and uses credit spreads and issuer-specific yield
adjustments received from an independent third party source to determine the market price for the
security. The credit spreads incorporate the issuer’s credit rating as assigned by a nationally
recognized rating agency and a risk premium, if warranted, due to the issuer’s industry and the
security’s time to maturity. The issuer-specific yield adjustments, which can be positive or
negative, are updated twice annually, as of June 30 and December 31, by an independent third party
source and are intended to adjust security prices for issuer-specific factors. The matrix-priced
securities at December 31, 2004 and 2003, primarily consisted of non-144A private placements and
have an average duration of 4.8 and 4.5, respectively.

The following table identifies the fair value of fixed maturity securities by pricing source as of
December 31, 2004 and 2003:

The fair value of a financial instrument is the amount at which the instrument could be
exchanged in a current transaction between knowledgeable, unrelated willing parties. As such, the
estimated fair value of a financial instrument may differ significantly from the amount that could
be realized if the security was sold immediately.

Valuation of Derivative Instruments

Derivative instruments are reported at fair value based upon either independent market quotations
or pricing valuation models which utilize independent third party data as inputs. Other than the
guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefit (“GMWB”) and the associated reinsurance contracts, which are
discussed below, approximately 69% of derivatives, based upon notional values, were priced via
valuation models and the remaining 31% of derivatives were priced via independent market
quotations.

Other-Than-Temporary Impairments

One of the significant estimations inherent in the valuation of investments is the evaluation of
other-than-temporary impairments. The evaluation of impairments is a quantitative and qualitative
process, which is subject to risks and uncertainties and is intended to determine whether declines
in the fair value of investments should be recognized in current period earnings. The risks and
uncertainties include changes in general economic conditions, the issuer’s financial condition or
near term recovery prospects and the effects of changes in interest rates. The Company’s
accounting policy requires that a decline in the value of a security below its amortized cost basis
be assessed to determine if the decline is other-than-temporary. If the security is deemed to be
other-than-temporarily impaired, a charge is recorded in net realized capital losses equal to the
difference between the fair value and amortized cost basis of the security. In addition, for
securities expected to be sold, an other-than-temporary impairment charge is recognized if the
Company does not expect the fair value of a security to recover to amortized cost prior to the
expected date of sale. The fair value of the other-than-temporarily impaired investment becomes
its new cost basis. The Company has a security monitoring process overseen by a committee of
investment and accounting professionals (“the committee”) that identifies securities that, due to
certain characteristics, as described below, are subjected to an enhanced analysis on a quarterly
basis.

Securities not subject to Emerging Issues Task Force (“EITF”) Issue No. 99-20, “Recognition of
Interest Income and Impairment on Purchased and Retained Beneficial Interests in Securitized
Financial Assets” (“non-EITF Issue No. 99-20 securities”), that are in an unrealized loss position,
are reviewed at least quarterly to determine if an other-than-temporary impairment is present based
on certain quantitative and qualitative factors. The primary factors considered in evaluating
whether a decline in value for non-EITF Issue No. 99-20 securities is other-than-temporary include:
(a) the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than cost, (b) the
financial condition, credit rating and near-term prospects of the issuer, (c) whether the debtor is
current on contractually obligated interest and principal payments and (d) the intent and ability
of the Company to retain the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for recovery.
Non-EITF Issue No. 99-20 securities depressed by twenty percent or more for six months are presumed
to be other-than-temporarily impaired unless significant objective verifiable evidence supports
that the security price is temporarily depressed and is expected to recover within a reasonable
period of time. The evaluation of non-EITF Issue No. 99-20 securities depressed more than ten
percent is documented and discussed quarterly by the committee.

For certain securitized financial assets with contractual cash flows (including asset-backed
securities), EITF Issue No. 99-20 requires the Company to periodically update its best estimate of
cash flows over the life of the security. If the fair value of a securitized financial asset is
less than its carrying amount and there has been a decrease in the present value of the estimated
cash flows since the last revised estimate, considering both timing and amount, then an
other-than-temporary impairment charge is recognized. Estimating future cash flows is a
quantitative and qualitative process that incorporates information received from third party
sources along with certain internal assumptions and judgments regarding the future performance of
the underlying collateral. As a result, actual results may differ from current estimates. In
addition, projections of expected future cash flows may change based upon new information regarding
the performance of the underlying collateral.

Once an impairment charge has been recorded, the Company continues to review the
other-than-temporarily impaired securities for additional other-than-temporary impairments. As
discussed in Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, the Financial Accounting
Standards Board (“FASB”) voted to delay the implementation of the impairment measurement and
recognition guidance contained in paragraphs 10-20 of EITF Issue No. 03-1, “The Meaning of
Other-Than-Temporary Impairments and Its Application to Certain Investments” (“EITF Issue No.
03-1”), in order to redeliberate certain aspects of the consensus. The ultimate completion of EITF
Issue No. 03-1 may impact the Company’s current other-than-temporary impairment evaluation process.

Valuation of Guaranteed Minimum Withdrawal Benefit Derivatives

An embedded derivative instrument is reported at fair value based upon internally established
valuations that are consistent with external valuation models, quotations furnished by dealers in
such instruments or market quotations. The Company has calculated the fair value of the guaranteed
minimum withdrawal benefit (“GMWB”) embedded derivative based on actuarial assumptions related to
the projected cash flows, including benefits and related contract charges, over the lives of the
contracts, incorporating expectations concerning policyholder behavior. Because of the dynamic and
complex nature of these cash flows, stochastic techniques under a variety of market return
scenarios and other best estimate assumptions are used. Estimating these cash flows involves
numerous estimates and subjective judgments including those regarding expected market rates of
return, market volatility, correlations of market returns and discount rates. At each valuation
date, the Company assumes expected returns based on risk-free rates as represented by the current
LIBOR forward curve rates; market volatility assumptions for each underlying index based on a blend
of observed market



“implied volatility” data and annualized standard deviations of monthly returns
using the most recent 20 years of observed market
performance; correlations of market returns across underlying indices based on actual observed
market returns and relationships over the ten years preceding the valuation date; and current
risk-free spot rates as represented by the current LIBOR spot curve to determine the present value
of expected future cash flows produced in the stochastic projection process.

Life Deferred Policy Acquisition Costs and Present Value of Future Profits

Policy acquisition costs include commissions and certain other expenses that vary with and are
primarily associated with acquiring business. Present value of future profits is an intangible
asset recorded upon applying purchase accounting in an acquisition of a life insurance company.
Deferred policy acquisition costs and the present value of future profits intangible asset are
amortized in the same way. Both are amortized over the estimated life of the contracts acquired,
usually 20 years. Within the following discussion, deferred policy acquisition costs and the
present value of future profits intangible asset will be referred to as “DAC”. At December 31,
2004 and 2003, the carrying value of Life’s DAC was $7.4 billion and $6.6 billion, respectively.
For statutory accounting purposes, such costs are expensed as incurred.

DAC related to traditional policies are amortized over the premium-paying period in proportion to
the present value of annual expected premium income. DAC related to investment contracts and
universal life-type contracts are deferred and amortized using the retrospective deposit method.
Under the retrospective deposit method, acquisition costs are amortized in proportion to the
present value of estimated gross profits (“EGPs”), arising principally from projected investment,
mortality and expense margins and surrender charges. The attributable portion of the DAC
amortization is allocated to realized gains and losses on investments. The DAC balance is also
adjusted through other comprehensive income by an amount that represents the amortization of
deferred policy acquisition costs that would have been required as a charge or credit to operations
had unrealized gains and losses on investments been realized. Actual gross profits can vary from
management’s estimates, resulting in increases or decreases in the rate of amortization.

Life regularly evaluates its EGPs to determine if actual experience or other evidence suggests that
earlier estimates should be revised. In the event that Life were to revise its EGPs, the
cumulative DAC amortization would be adjusted to reflect such revised EGPs in the period the
revision was determined to be necessary. Several assumptions considered to be significant in the
development of EGPs include separate account fund performance, surrender and lapse rates, estimated
interest spread and estimated mortality. The separate account fund performance assumption is
critical to the development of the EGPs related to Life’s variable annuity and to a lesser extent,
variable universal life insurance businesses. The average annual long-term rate of assumed
separate account fund performance (before mortality and expense charges) used in estimating gross
profits for the variable annuity and variable universal life business was 9% for the years ended
December 31, 2004 and 2003. For other products including fixed annuities and other universal
life-type contracts, the average assumed investment yield ranged from 5.7% to 7.9% for both years
ended December 31, 2004 and 2003.

Life had developed models to evaluate its DAC asset, which allowed it to run a large number of
stochastically determined scenarios of separate account fund performance. These scenarios were
then utilized to calculate a statistically significant range of reasonable estimates of EGPs. This
range was then compared to the present value of EGPs currently utilized in the DAC amortization
model. As of December 31, 2004, the present value of the EGPs utilized in the DAC amortization
model fall within a reasonable range of statistically calculated present value of EGPs. As a
result, Life does not believe there is sufficient evidence to suggest that a revision to the EGPs
(and therefore, a revision to the DAC) as of December 31, 2004 is necessary; however, if in the
future the EGPs utilized in the DAC amortization model were to fall outside of the margin of the
reasonable range of statistically calculated EGPs, a revision could be necessary. Furthermore,
Life has estimated that the present value of the EGPs is likely to remain within a reasonable range
if overall separate account returns decline by 25% or less over the next twelve months, and if
certain other assumptions that are implicit in the computations of the EGPs are achieved.

Additionally, Life continues to perform analyses with respect to the potential impact of a revision
to future EGPs. If such a revision to EGPs were deemed necessary, Life would adjust, as
appropriate, all of its assumptions for products accounted for in accordance with Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No. 97, “Accounting and Reporting by Insurance Enterprises
for Certain Long-Duration Contracts and for Realized Gains and Losses from the Sale of
Investments”, and reproject its future EGPs based on current account values at the end of the
quarter in which a revision is deemed to be necessary. To illustrate the effects of this process,
assume Life had concluded that a revision of Life’s EGPs was required at December 31, 2004. If
Life assumed a 9% average long-term rate of growth from December 31, 2004 forward along with other
appropriate assumption changes in determining the revised EGPs, Life estimates the cumulative
decrease to amortization would be approximately $60-$65, after-tax. If instead Life were to assume
a long-term growth rate of 8% in determining the revised EGPs, the adjustment would be
approximately $20-$25, after-tax. Any such adjustment would not affect statutory income or
surplus, due to the prescribed accounting for such amounts that is discussed above.

Aside from absolute levels and timing of market performance assumptions, additional factors that
will influence this determination include the degree of volatility in separate account fund
performance and shifts in asset allocation within the separate account made by policyholders. The
overall return generated by the separate account is dependent on several factors, including the
relative mix of the underlying sub-accounts among bond funds and equity funds as well as equity
sector weightings. Life’s overall separate account fund performance has been reasonably correlated
to the overall performance of the S&P 500 Index (which closed at 1,212 on December 31, 2004),
although no assurance can be provided that this correlation will continue in the future.

The overall recoverability of the DAC asset is dependent on the future profitability of the
business. Life tests the aggregate recoverability of the DAC asset by comparing the amounts
deferred to the present value of total EGPs. In addition, Life routinely



stress tests its DAC
asset for recoverability against severe declines in its separate account assets, which could occur
if the equity
markets experienced another significant sell-off, as the majority of policyholders’ funds in the
separate accounts is invested in the equity market. As of December 31, 2004, Life believed
variable annuity separate account assets could fall by at least 45% before portions of its DAC
asset would be unrecoverable.

Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit Obligations

Pursuant to accounting principles related to the Company’s pension and other postretirement
benefit obligations to employees under its various benefit plans, the Company is required to make
a significant number of assumptions in order to estimate the related liabilities and expenses each
period. The two economic assumptions that have the most impact on pension expense are the
discount rate and the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. In determining the
discount rate assumption, the Company utilizes current market information provided by its plan
actuaries, including a discounted cash flow analysis of the Company’s pension obligation and
general movements in the current market environment. In particular, the Company uses an interest
rate yield curve developed by its plan actuaries. The yield curve is comprised of bonds rated AA
or higher with maturities primarily between zero and thirty years. Based on all available
information, it was determined that 5.75% was the appropriate discount rate as of December 31,
2004 to calculate the Company’s accrued benefit liability. Accordingly, the 5.75% discount rate
will also be used to determine the Company’s 2005 pension expense. At December 31, 2003, the
discount rate was 6.25%.

The Company determines the long-term rate of return assumption for the pension plan’s asset
portfolio based on analysis of the portfolio’s historical rates of return balanced with future
long-term return expectations. Based on its long-term outlook with respect to the markets, the
Company maintained its long-term rate of return assumption at 8.50% as of December 31, 2004.

To illustrate the impact of these assumptions on annual pension expense for 2005 and going forward,
a 25 basis point change in the discount rate will increase/decrease pension expense by
approximately $13 and a 25 basis point change in the long-term asset return assumption will
increase/decrease pension expense by approximately $6.

Contingencies

Management follows the requirements of SFAS No. 5 “Accounting for Contingencies”. This statement
requires management to evaluate each contingent matter separately. A loss is recorded if estimable
and probable. Management establishes reserves for these contingencies at its “best estimate”, or,
if no one number within the range of possible losses is more probable than any other, the Company
records an estimated reserve at the low end of the range of losses. The majority of contingencies
currently being evaluated by the Company relate to litigation matters, which are inherently
difficult to evaluate and subject to significant changes.

Operating Results

2004 Compared to 2003

- Net income for the year ended December 31, 2004 increased $2.2 billion,
compared to the prior year which reflected a $1.7 billion after-tax charge to strengthen net
asbestos reserves based on a ground up study. Also contributing to the increase was a $216 tax
benefit, of which $190 was recorded in Life and $26 was recorded in Property & Casualty, primarily
consisting of the benefit related to the separate account dividends-received deduction (“DRD”) and
interest. For further discussion, see Note 12 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Also
contributing to the change in net income was growth in all of Life’s segments and improved
underwriting results in the Business Insurance segment. Offsetting these increases were increased
Property & Casualty catastrophe losses, primarily related to hurricanes Charley, Frances, Ivan and
Jeanne.

Revenues for the year ended December 31, 2004 increased $4.0 billion over the comparable 2003
period. The primary contributors to this increase were higher earned premiums in the Group
Benefits, Business Insurance, Personal Lines and Specialty Commercial segments; increased fee
income in the Retail Products Group segment; and an increase in net investment income. The
increase in earned premiums for Group Benefits was driven by primarily the CNA acquisition, sales
growth and favorable persistency. The increase in earned premiums in the Business Insurance,
Personal Lines and Specialty Commercial segments was due to earned pricing increases and growth in
new business premiums out pacing non-renewals for Personal Lines and Business Insurance. The
increase in



fee income for Retail Products resulted from an increase in variable annuity average
account values. The increase in net investment
income was due primarily to the adoption of Statement of Position 03-1, “Accounting and Reporting
by Insurance Enterprises for Certain Nontraditional Long-Duration Contracts and for Separate
Accounts” (“SOP 03-1”), which resulted in $1.6 billion of net investment income.

2003 Compared to 2002 —

Revenues for the year ended December 31, 2003 increased $2.3 billion over
the comparable 2002 period. Revenues increased due to earned premium growth within the Business
Insurance, Specialty Commercial and Personal Lines segments, primarily as a result of earned
pricing increases, higher earned premiums and net investment income in the Retail Products segment
and net realized capital gains in 2003 as compared to net realized capital losses in 2002.

Total benefits, claims and expenses increased $3.9 billion for the year ended December 31, 2003
over the comparable prior year period primarily due to the Company’s $2.6 billion asbestos reserve
strengthening during the first quarter of 2003 and due to increases in the Retail Products segment
associated with the growth in the individual annuity and institutional investments businesses.

The net loss for the year ended December 31, 2003 was primarily due to the Company’s first quarter
2003 asbestos reserve strengthening of $1.7 billion, after-tax. Included in net loss for the year
ended December 31, 2003 are $40 of after-tax expense related to the settlement of litigation with
Bancorp Services, LLC (“Bancorp”) and $27 of severance charges, after-tax, in Property & Casualty.
Included in net income for the year ended December 31, 2002 are the $8 after-tax benefit recognized
by Hartford Life, Inc. (“HLI”) related to the reduction of HLI’s reserves associated with September
11 and $11 of after-tax expense related to litigation with Bancorp.

Income Taxes

The effective tax rate for 2004, 2003 and 2002 was 15%, 83% and 6%, respectively. The principal
causes of the difference between the effective rates and the U.S. statutory rate of 35% were
tax-exempt interest earned on invested assets, the dividends-received deduction, the tax benefit
associated with the settlement of the 1998-2001 IRS audit in 2004 and the tax benefit associated
with the settlement of the 1996-1997 IRS audit in 2002. Income taxes paid (received) in 2004, 2003
and 2002 were $32, ($107) and ($102) respectively. For additional information, see Note 13 of Notes
to Consolidated Financial Statements.

As a result of the net loss for the year ended December 31, 2003, SFAS No. 128, “Earnings Per

calculation of the year ended December 31, 2003 diluted earnings (loss) per share, since the
inclusion of options of 1.8 would have been antidilutive to the earnings per share
calculation. In the absence of the net loss, weighted average common shares outstanding and

LIFE

Executive Overview

The Company provides investment and retirement products such as variable and fixed annuities,
mutual funds and retirement plan services and other institutional products; individual and
corporate owned life insurance; and, group benefit products, such as group life and group
disability insurance.

The Company derives its revenues principally from: (a) fee income, including asset management
fees, on separate account and mutual fund assets and mortality and expense fees, as well as cost of
insurance charges; (b) net investment income on general account assets; (c) fully insured premiums;
and (d) certain other fees. Asset management fees and mortality and expense fees are primarily
generated from separate account assets, which are deposited with the Company through the sale of
variable annuity and variable universal life products and from mutual funds. Cost of insurance
charges are assessed on the net amount at risk for investment-oriented life insurance products.
Premium revenues are derived primarily from the sale of group life, and group disability and
individual term insurance products.

The Company’s expenses essentially consist of interest credited to policyholders on general account
liabilities, insurance benefits provided, amortization of the deferred policy acquisition costs,
expenses related to the selling and servicing the various products offered by the Company,
dividends to policyholders, and other general business expenses.



The Company’s profitability in its variable annuity, mutual fund and to a lesser extent, variable
universal life businesses depends largely on the amount of the contract holder account value or
assets under management on which it earns fees and the level of fees
charged. Changes in account value or assets under management are driven by two main factors: net
flows, which measure the success of the Company’s asset gathering and retention efforts, and the
market return of the funds, which is heavily influenced by the return on the equity markets. Net
flows are comprised of new sales and other deposits less surrenders, death benefits, policy charges
and annuitizations of investment type contracts, for instance, variable annuity contracts. In the
mutual fund business, net flows are known as net sales. Net sales are comprised of new sales less
redemptions of mutual fund customers. The Company uses the average daily value of the S&P 500
Index as an indicator for evaluating market returns of the underlying account portfolios in the
United States. Relative profitability of variable products is highly correlated to the growth in
account values or assets under management since these products generally earn fee income on a daily
basis. Thus, a prolonged downturn in the financial markets could reduce revenues and potentially
raise the possibility of a charge against deferred policy acquisition costs.

The profitability of the Company’s fixed annuities and other spread based products depends largely
on its ability to earn target spreads between earned investment rates on its general account assets
and interest credited to policyholders. Profitability is also influenced by operating expense
management including the benefits of economies of scale in the administration of its United States
variable annuity businesses in particular. In addition, the size and persistency of gross profits
from these businesses is an important driver of earnings as it affects the rate of amortization of
the deferred policy acquisition costs.

The Company’s profitability in its individual life insurance and group benefits businesses depends
largely on the size of its in force block, the adequacy of product pricing and underwriting
discipline, actual mortality and morbidity experience, and the efficiency of its claims and expense
management.

Performance Measures

Fee Income

Fee income is largely driven from amounts collected as a result of contractually defined
percentages of assets under management on investment type contracts. These fees are generally
collected on a daily basis from the contract holder’s account. For individual life insurance
products, fees are contractually defined percentages based on levels of insurance, age, premiums
and deposits collected and contractholder account value. Life insurance fees are generally
collected on a monthly basis. Therefore, the growth in assets under management either through
positive net flows or net sales and favorable equity market performance will have a favorable
impact on fee income. Conversely, negative net flows or net sales and unfavorable equity market
performance will reduce fee income generated from investment type contracts.

Net Investment Income and Interest Credited

Certain investment type contracts such as fixed annuities and other spread-based contracts generate
deposits that the Company collects and invests to earn investment income. In addition, insurance
type contracts such as those sold by the Group Benefits segment collect premiums (discussed below)
for protection from losses specified in the particular insurance contract. These deposits and
premiums together comprise the majority of the assets of the general account that are invested to
generate investment income for the Company. The investment type contracts use this investment
income to credit the contract holder an amount of interest specified in the respective contract.
As discussed in the overview, the amount of investment income earned in excess of the interest
credited to the contract holder is the spread income earned by the Company. For insurance type
contracts, net investment income earned during the time that premiums are invested prior to paying
claims and expenses supports the profitability of these products.

The significant increase in net investment income and interest credited in the Retail Products
Group segment and Other and, to a lesser extent Individual Life segment was largely the result of
the adoption of SOP 03-1. The adoption of SOP 03-1 resulted in certain changes in presentation in
the Company’s financial statements, including reporting of the spreads on the Company’s MVA fixed
annuities and variable annuity products offered in Japan on a gross basis in net investment income
and interest credited. The increase in net investment income for the Group Benefits segment was
primarily due to the acquisition of the group benefits business of CNA at December 31, 2003.

Premiums

As discussed above, traditional insurance type products collect premiums from policyholders in
exchange for financial protection of the policy holder from a specified insurable loss, such as
death or disability. These premiums together with net investment income earned from the overall
investment strategy are used to pay the contractual obligations under these insurance contracts.
Two major factors, new sales and persistency, impact premium growth. Sales can increase or
decrease in a given year based on a number of factors, including but not limited to, customer
demand for the Company’s product offerings, pricing competition, distribution channels and the
Company’s reputation and ratings. A majority of sales correspond with the open enrollment periods
of employers’ benefits, typically January 1 or July 1. Persistency is a measure of business
retention during a renewal period.

The persistency rate represents the employer group life and disability business, which
accounts for 65-70% of inforce premiums, excluding the CNA acquisition. For comparability
purposes, the 2004 persistency rate excludes the CNA acquisition.

The significant increase in premiums for the Group Benefits segment in 2004 compared to 2003
is the result of the earned premium growth as the result of the CNA acquisition as well as in the
pre-acquisition Group Benefits business. The increase in earned premiums of the pre-acquisition
Group Benefits business was driven by sales and favorable persistency.

Expenses

There are three major categories for expenses. The first major category of expenses is benefits
and claims. These include the costs of mortality and morbidity, particularly in the group
benefits, and mortality in the individual life businesses, as well as other contractholder benefits
to policyholders. In addition, traditional insurance type products generally use a loss ratio
which is expressed as the amount of benefits incurred during a particular period divided by total
premiums and other considerations, as a key indicator of underwriting performance. Since the Group
Benefits segment occasionally buys a block of claims for a stated premium amount, the Company
excludes this buyout from the loss ratio used for evaluating the underwriting results of the
business as buyouts may distort the loss ratio.

The second major category is insurance operating costs and expenses, which is commonly expressed in
a ratio of a revenue measure depending on the type of business. The third category is the
amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs and the present value of future profits, which is
typically expressed as a percentage of pre-tax income before the cost of this amortization. The
individual annuity business within the Retail Products Group segment accounts for the majority of
the amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs and present value of future profits for the
Company.

The increase in the expense ratio for the Group Benefits segment in 2004 compared to 2003 is the

is now included in the Group Benefits segment and this business typically has lower expected loss
ratios and higher expected commission ratios than other products within the business.

Profitability

Management evaluates the rates of return various businesses can provide as a way of determining
where additional capital is invested to increase net income and shareholder returns. Specifically,
because of the importance of its individual annuity products, the Company uses the return on assets
for the individual annuity business for evaluating profitability. In Group Benefits, after tax
margin is a key indicator of overall profitability.

With the adoption of SOP 03-1, certain annuity and individual life products were required to
be accounted for in the general account. This change in accounting resulted in an increase of
$1,637 in net investment income, an increase of $1,387 in benefits, claims and claim
adjustment expenses and a decrease of $131 in other revenues for the year ended December 31,
2004, respectively.

For the years ended December 31, 2004, represents the cumulative impact of the Company’s
adoption of SOP 03-1.

Life changed its reportable operating segments in 2004 from Investment Products, Individual
Life, Group Benefits and Corporate Owned Life Insurance (“COLI”) to Retail Products Group
(“Retail”), Institutional Solutions Group (“Institutional”), Individual Life and Group Benefits.
Retail offers individual variable and fixed annuities, mutual funds, retirement plan products and
services to corporations under Section 401(k) plans and other investment products. Institutional
primarily offers retirement plan products and services to municipalities under Section 457 plans,
other institutional investment products, structured settlements, and private placement life
insurance. Individual Life sells a variety of life insurance products, including variable
universal life, universal life, interest sensitive whole life and term life insurance. Group
Benefits sells group insurance products, including group life and group disability insurance as
well as other products, including medical stop loss and supplementary medical coverages to
employers and employer sponsored plans, accidental death and dismemberment, travel accident and
other special risk coverages to employers and associations. Life also includes, in an Other
category, its international operations, which are primarily located in Japan and Brazil; net
realized capital gains and losses other than periodic net coupon settlements on non-qualifying
derivatives and net realized capital gains and losses related to guaranteed minimum withdrawal
benefits; corporate items not directly allocated to any of its reportable operating segments; and
intersegment eliminations. Periodic net coupon settlements on non-qualifying derivatives and net
realized capital gains



and losses related to guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefits are reflected
in each applicable segment in net realized capital gains and losses.

2004 Compared to 2003 —

Life’s net income increased due primarily to business growth in virtually
all lines of business as discussed below, a lower effective income tax rate, and higher net
realized capital gains. (See the Investments section for further discussion of investment results
and related realized capital gains.) During the third quarter of 2004, the Internal Revenue
Service completed its examination of the 1998-2001 tax years. (For further discussion see Note 12
of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Tax Matters). Life recorded in the third
quarter of 2004 a tax benefit of $190, consisting primarily of a change in estimate of the
dividends-received deduction (“DRD”) tax benefit reported during 2003 and prior years and interest,
and changed the estimate of the after-tax benefit for the DRD benefit related to the 2004 tax year.

Net income in the Retail segment increased, principally driven by growth in the variable annuity
and mutual fund businesses as a result of increasing assets under management. Partially offsetting
the increase in the Retail segment was lower spread income on market value adjusted (“MVA”) fixed
annuities due to the adoption of SOP 03-1. Net income in the Group Benefits segment increased due
primarily to increased earned premiums and net investment income growth, primarily resulting from
the Company’s acquisition of the group life and accident, and short-term and long-term disability
businesses of CNA Financial Corporation (“CNA Acquisition”). In addition, the Group Benefits
segment was impacted by favorable persistency in most businesses and lower benefit costs in the
group life line. Net income in the Institutional segment was higher as a result of a decrease in
other expenses related to private placement life insurance business compared to the respective
prior year period. The decrease in other expenses for the current year is attributed to a $40
after-tax charge, recorded in the third quarter ended September 30, 2003, associated with the
settlement of the Bancorp Services, LLC (“Bancorp”) litigation. Additionally, net income was
higher for Individual Life and the international operations. The increase in Individual Life
earnings was primarily driven by improved net investment spread income including the effects of
prepayments and growth in account values and life insurance in force. Net income for the
international operations, which is included in the other category, increased over the prior year
primarily driven by the increase in assets under management of the Japan annuity business. Japan’s
assets under management have grown to $14.7 billion at December 31, 2004 from $6.2 billion at
December 31, 2003. During 2004, the Company introduced market value adjusted fixed annuity
products to provide a diversified product portfolio to customers in Japan.

The effective tax rate was 13% for Life operations for the current year as compared to an effective
tax rate of 21% for Life operations for the respective prior year period. The lower effective tax
rate was attributed to tax related items, as discussed above, of $190 and a 2004 tax year DRD
benefit of $132, as compared to tax related items of $30 and a 2003 tax year DRD benefit of $87
reported for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Slightly offsetting the
positive earnings drivers for the year ended December 31, 2004 was the cumulative effect of
accounting change from the Company’s adoption of SOP 03-1. The adoption of SOP 03-1 also resulted
in certain changes in presentation in the Company’s financial statements, including reporting of
the spreads on the Company’s MVA fixed annuities and variable annuity products offered in Japan on
a gross basis in net investment income and benefits expense. Exclusive of the cumulative effect,
overall application of SOP 03-1 resulted in an immaterial reduction in net income. (For further
discussion of the impact of the Company’s adoption of SOP 03-1, see Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements).

2003 Compared to 2002

—

Net income increased for the year ended December 31, 2003 due primarily to
the growth in the Retail segment and a decrease in net realized capital losses compared to 2002.
The earnings growth in the Retail segment is due to an increase in fee income and net investment
income. Fee income in the Retail segment was higher in 2003 compared to 2002, as a result of
higher average account values, specifically in individual annuities and mutual fund businesses, due
primarily to stronger variable annuity sales as well as market appreciation. Net investment income
in Retail increased due to higher general account assets in the individual annuity business. Also
contributing to the net income growth was higher earnings in Group Benefits, primarily due to
increases in earned premiums and favorable claims. Additionally, Individual Life experienced
earnings growth due to increases in fees and cost of insurance as life insurance in-force grew and
aged, and variable universal life account values increased 30% due primarily to the growth in the
equity markets and favorable mortality. Partially offsetting these increases was a decrease in
Institutional net income for the year ended December 31, 2003, as compared to the prior year
period. This decrease is attributed to a $40 after-tax charge, recorded in the third quarter of
2003 associated with the settlement of the Bancorp litigation. In addition, there was an $8
after-tax benefit recorded in the first quarter of 2002 related to favorable development on the
Company’s estimated September 11 exposure.

The effective tax rate increased in 2003 when compared with 2002 as a result of higher earnings and
lower DRD related tax items. The tax provision recorded during 2003 reflects a benefit of $30,
consisting primarily of a change in estimate of the DRD tax benefit reported during 2002. The
change in estimate was the result of actual 2002 investment performance on the related separate
accounts being unexpectedly out of pattern with past performance, which had been the basis for the
estimate. This compares with a tax benefit of $76 recorded in 2002. The total DRD benefit related
to the 2003 tax year for the year ended December 31, 2003 was $87 as compared to $63 for the year
ended December 31, 2002.

Outlook

In 2004, the Company experienced record earnings driven by strong growth in assets under
management, favorable premium growth and loss ratios in Group Benefits, strong expense management,
and a DRD tax benefit related to prior years of $190. Due to gains in the equity markets and
positive net flows, assets under management grew 18%, resulting in increased fee income earned on
those assets. The growth and profitability of the Company in the future is dependent to a large
degree on the performance of the equity



markets as well as each segment’s ability to attract new
customers and attract and retain assets under management. Please refer to each segment’s results
for outlooks on specific segments and products. Also contributing to the Company’s performance in
2004 was increased earnings in the Other category, which was primarily the result of the growth in
assets under management in the
international operations. This growth was driven by record sales of $7.8 billion and positive net
flows in Japan, which combined with gains in the equity market increased assets under management
to $14.7 billion at December 31, 2004 from $6.2 billion at December 31, 2003. Although the
Company’s international operations experienced significant growth during 2004, Japanese
regulations combined with competition could adversely affect the Company’s ability to exceed or
sustain the level of new sales and net flows attained in 2004.

The Retail Products Group segment focuses on the savings and retirement needs of the growing
number of individuals who are preparing for retirement, or have already retired, through the sale
of individual variable and fixed annuities, mutual funds, retirement plan services and other
investment products. The Company is both a leading writer of individual variable annuities and a
top seller of individual variable annuities through banks in the United States.

2004 Compared to 2003 —

Net income increased for the year ended December 31, 2004, principally
driven by higher fee income from double digit growth in the assets under management in virtually
all businesses of the segment and strong expense management. Fee income generated by the variable
annuity operation increased, as average account values were higher in the current year compared to
the respective prior year periods. The increase in average account values can be attributed to
market appreciation of $7.6 billion and net flows of $5.5 billion during 2004. Another
contributing factor to the increase in fee income was the increase in assets under management in
the mutual fund and 401(k) businesses. Retail mutual fund assets under management increased 24%
principally due to net sales and market appreciation of $2.5 billion each during 2004. In
addition, 401(k) assets under management grew 40% to $7.3 billion as a result of favorable net
flows and market conditions.

Partially offsetting the positive earnings drivers discussed above were higher DAC amortization
costs, lower income from the fixed annuity business and the cumulative effect of accounting change
from the Company’s adoption of SOP 03-1. DAC amortization was higher in the current year as
compared to the prior year due to higher subsequent deposit activity, primarily in individual
annuity. The decrease in net income in the fixed annuity business in 2004 compared to 2003 was
principally due to lower investment spread from the market value adjusted (“MVA”) product. With
the adoption of SOP 03-1, the Company includes the investment return from the fixed annuity product
in net investment income and includes interest credited to contract holders in the benefits, claims
and expenses line on the income statement rather than reporting the net spread in fee income and
other. Additionally, income tax expense was higher for the current year due primarily to higher
income earned by the segment. This increase was largely offset by a higher DRD



tax benefit of $115
related to the 2004 tax year reported for the year ended December 31, 2004, as discussed above, as
compared to the DRD tax benefit of $79 related to the 2003 tax year reported in the comparable
prior year period.

2003 Compared to 2002

—

Net income was higher driven by an increase in revenues in the individual
annuity and other retail product operations as a result of the strong net flows and growth in the
equity markets during 2003 and strong expense management. Net
income increased due to an increase in fee income in Retail. Fee income in Retail was higher in
2003 compared to 2002, as a result of higher average account values, specifically in individual
annuities and mutual fund businesses, due primarily to stronger variable annuity sales and the
higher equity market values compared to the prior year. Net investment income increased due to
higher general account assets. General account assets for the individual annuity business were
$9.4 billion as of December 31, 2003, an increase of approximately $800 or 9% from 2002, due
primarily to an increase in individual annuity sales, with the majority of those new sales electing
to use the dollar cost averaging (“DCA”) feature. The DCA feature allows policyholders to earn a
credited interest rate in the general account for a defined period of time as their invested assets
are systematically invested into the separate account funds. Additionally, there was increased
interest credited in the individual annuity operation as a result of higher general account asset
levels and an increase in amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs related to the
individual annuity business due to higher gross profits.

In addition, net income increased in 2003 compared to 2002 due to the favorable impact of $19,
resulting from the Company’s previously discussed change in estimate of the DRD tax benefit
reported during 2002. The change in estimate was the result of 2002 actual investment performance
on the related separate accounts being unexpectedly out of pattern with past performance, which had
been the basis for the estimate. The total DRD benefit related to the 2003 tax year for the year
ended December 31, 2003 was $79 as compared to $59 for the year ended December 31, 2002.

Outlook

Management believes the market for retirement products continues to expand as individuals
increasingly save and plan for retirement. Demographic trends suggest that as the “baby boom”
generation matures, a significant portion of the United States population will allocate a greater
percentage of their disposable incomes to saving for their retirement years due to uncertainty
surrounding the Social Security system and increases in average life expectancy. Individual
annuity sales in 2004 were $15.7 billion (a 5% decrease) compared to $16.5 billion in 2003, and
401(k) products experienced an increase of 37% in sales in 2004 compared to 2003.

Significantly contributing to the Company’s variable annuity sales during 2004 and 2003 was
Principal First, a guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefit (“GMWB”) rider, which was developed in
response to our customers’ needs. However, competition has increased substantially in this market
with most major variable annuity writers now offering GMWB riders and as a result, the Company may
not be able to sustain the level of sales attained in 2004. In an effort to meet diverse customer
needs, in the fourth quarter of 2004 the Company introduced Principal First Preferred, a lower cost
GMWB alternative to Principal First. The success of this new product will ultimately be based on
customer acceptance. According to VARDS, the Company had 11.87% market share as of December 31,
2004 as compared to 12.6% at December 31, 2003. With the increased competition in the variable
annuity market causing lower sales levels from the record level in 2003, combined with an aging
block of business, net flows may decline from levels experienced in 2004. This will be largely
dependent on the Company’s ability to retain contractholder’s account values as they reach the end
of the surrender charge period of their contract. In addition, net flows in the Company’s fixed
annuity block may be impacted by approximately $2 billion of contracts reaching renewal dates in
2005 at crediting rates significantly above those offered currently.

The growth and profitability of the individual annuity and mutual fund businesses is dependent to
a large degree on the performance of the equity markets. In periods of favorable equity market
performance, the Company may experience stronger sales and higher net flows, which will increase
assets under management and thus increase fee income earned on those assets. In addition, higher
equity market levels will generally reduce certain costs to the Company of individual annuities,
such as guaranteed minimum death benefits (“GMDB”) and GMWB benefits. Conversely, weak equity
markets may dampen sales activity and increase surrender activity causing declines in assets under
management and lower fee income. Such declines in the equity markets will also increase the cost
to the Company of GMDB and GMWB benefits associated with individual annuities. The Company
attempts to mitigate some of the volatility associated with the GMDB and GMWB benefits using
reinsurance or other risk management strategies, such as hedging. Future net income for the
Company will be affected by the effectiveness of the risk management strategies the Company has
implemented to mitigate the net income volatility associated with the GMDB and GMWB benefits of
variable annuity contracts. For spread based products sold in the Retail segment, the future
growth will depend on the ability to earn targeted returns on new business given competition,
retention of account values in the fixed annuity business where the contract holder’s rate
guarantee expires in the upcoming year, and the future interest rate environment.

The Institutional Solutions Group primarily offers customized wealth creation and financial
protection for institutions, corporate and government employers and high net worth individuals
through its three business units: Government, Institutional Investment Products (“IIP”) and private
placement life insurance (“PPLI”) (formerly Corporate Owned Life Insurance or “COLI”).

2004 Compared to 2003

—

Net income for the year ended December 31, 2004 increased primarily due to
decreases in other expenses related to PPLI business compared to the prior year. The decrease in
other expenses was primarily attributed to a $40 after-tax charge, recorded in the third quarter
ended September 30, 2003, associated with the settlement of the Bancorp litigation. In addition,
the governmental business contributed higher income for the current year. This increase was
primarily attributable to higher revenues earned from the growth in the average account values as a
result of positive net flows and market appreciation since the prior year coupled with improved
spreads and expense management.

Partially offsetting increases in segment net income for the current year was lower income from the
IIP and PPLI businesses, excluding the settlement of the Bancorp litigation. For a discussion of
the Bancorp litigation, see Note 12 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The decrease in
net income in the IIP was due primarily to lower spread income and slightly higher insurance
operating costs for the year ended December 31, 2004 as compared to 2003. In addition, the IIP
reported lower earnings for the current year compared to the prior year due to favorable mortality
experience in 2003. PPLI also experienced lower earnings for the year ended December 31, 2004 as
compared to 2003 due to lower average leveraged COLI account values.

Additionally, income tax expense was higher for the current year due primarily to decreases in
other expenses related to the PPLI business, as discussed above. This increase in income tax
expense was partially offset by a higher DRD tax benefit of $11 related to the 2004 tax year, as
compared to the DRD tax benefit of $4 related to the 2003 tax year reported in the prior year
period.

2003 Compared to 2002

—

Net income decreased in 2003 compared to 2002 principally as a result of
lower income from the PPLI business due to an increase in other expenses. Other expenses increased
due primarily to a $40 after-tax expense, related to the Bancorp litigation expense recorded in
2003 compared with the $11 after-tax expense recorded in 2002.

Excluding the expenses associated with the Bancorp litigation, net income increased $4 or 9%,
primarily due to higher income in the institutional investment products business as a result of
favorable mortality experience and growth in average assets over the last twelve months. General
account assets under management related to the IIP increased 32% since December 31, 2002, to $9.9
billion as of December 31, 2003. The increase in general account assets was primarily due to
higher net flows and market appreciation related to institutional annuities and structured
settlement products. Partially offsetting the increase in earnings in the IIP was lower PPLI
income due to the decline in leveraged COLI account values as a result of surrender activity and
lower sales volume of PPLI products in 2003 as compared to the prior year. In addition,
amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs increased as a result of higher sales in the
institutional investment products business.



Outlook

The future net income of this segment will depend on the Company’s ability to increase assets under
management and maintain its investment spread earnings on the majority of the products sold in
largely the IIP and Government businesses. These markets are highly competitive from a pricing
perspective, and a small number of cases often account for a significant portion of sales,
therefore the Company may not be able to sustain the level of assets under management growth
attained in 2004. In 2004, IIP introduced the Hartford Income Notes, a new funding agreement
backed product that provides the Company with opportunity for future growth. This product provides
access to both a multi-billion-dollar retail market, and a nearly trillion dollar institutional
market. These markets are very competitive and the Company’s success depends in part on the level
of credited interest rates and the Company’s credit rating. The focus of the PPLI business is
variable PPLI products to fund non-qualified benefits or other post employment benefit liabilities.
The leveraged COLI business, while in run-off, has been an important contributor to PPLI’s
profitability in recent years and will continue to contribute to the profitability of the Company
albeit at lower levels. The market served by PPLI is subject to extensive legal and regulatory
review that could have an adverse effect on its business.

and business insurance clients.

2004 Compared to 2003

—

Net income in the Individual Life segment increased for the year ended
December 31, 2004 as compared to the prior year, primarily driven by business growth and improved
investment spreads. Account values and inforce grew 9% and 7% from 2003 to 2004. Net investment
income increased for the current year as compared to the prior year primarily due to the adoption
of SOP 03-1, growth in general account values and prepayments on bonds. The adoption of SOP 03-1
also resulted in increases in benefits, claims and claim adjustment expenses and a decrease to fee
income and other for the year ended December 31, 2004 as compared to the prior year period for the
segment’s Modified Guarantee Life Insurance product, which was formerly classified as a separate
account product. Fee income increased primarily due to increased cost of insurance charges as life
insurance inforce grew and aged and variable universal life account values increased driven by
favorable equity markets and new sales. The increase in benefits, claims and claim adjustment
expenses was primarily due to the absence in 2004 of the unusually favorable mortality experienced
in 2003, along with continued growth and aging of the inforce. Business growth resulted in
increased insurance operating costs and expenses for the year compared to prior year.
Additionally, income tax expense was higher for the year ended December 31, 2004 due primarily to
earnings growth, as discussed above. Income tax expense includes a DRD tax benefit of $5 related
to the 2004 tax year, whereas, income tax expense for 2003 includes a total DRD tax benefit of
$6.

2003 Compared to 2002

—

Net income increased due to increases in fee income. Fees increased
primarily due to increased cost of insurance charges as life insurance inforce grew and aged, and
variable universal life account values increased 30%, driven by the growth in the equity markets in
2003. Also contributing to the increase in net income was a decrease in benefit costs in 2003 as



compared to 2002 due to favorable mortality rates compared to the prior year. Additionally, net
income for the year ended December 31, 2003 includes the favorable impact of $2 DRD benefit
resulting from the Company’s previously discussed change in estimate of the DRD tax benefit
reported during 2002. The total DRD benefit related to the 2003 tax year for the year ended
December 31, 2003 was $4 as compared to $3 for the year ended December 31, 2002.

Earned premiums, which include premiums for ceded reinsurance, decreased primarily due to increased
use of reinsurance. The decrease in net investment income was due primarily to lower investment
yields.

Outlook

Individual Life sales grew to $233 in 2004 from $196 in 2003 with renewed customer interest in
variable universal life products and the successful introduction of new universal life and variable
universal life products. Variable universal life sales and account values remain sensitive to
equity market levels and returns. The Company also continues to introduce new and enhanced
products, which are expected to increase new sales. The Company continues to pursue broader and
deeper distribution opportunities to increase sales. However, the Company continues to face
uncertainty surrounding estate tax legislation, aggressive competition from life insurance
providers, reduced availability and higher price of reinsurance, and the current regulatory
environment regarding reserving practices for universal life products with no-lapse guarantees.

The Group Benefits segment provides employers, associations, affinity groups and financial
institutions with group life, accident and disability coverage, along with other products and
services, including voluntary benefits, employee assistance programs, travel assistance, group
retiree health, and medical stop loss. The Company also offers disability underwriting,
administration, claims processing services and reinsurance to other insurers and self-funded
employer plans.

2004 Compared to 2003

—

Net income increased for the year ended December 31, 2004 as compared to
the prior year due to earned premium growth and net investment income growth as the result of the
CNA Acquisition. The increase in earned premiums was driven by sales (excluding buyouts) of $632
for the current year, representing an increase of 25% over sales reported in the prior year, and
favorable persistency. Although benefits, claims and claim adjustment expenses increased, the
segment’s loss ratio was 74% for the current year as compared to 79% for the prior year, which
contributed favorably to net income. The loss ratio for the year was the result of improved
mortality and morbidity experience as well as a change in mix of business (discussed below) that
results in a lower loss ratio and higher expense ratio. Partially offsetting these favorable items
for current year as compared to the prior year were higher commissions due to higher sales and
premiums previously discussed. Additionally, operating costs increased due to the growth in the
segment and the CNA Acquisition. Consistent with the increase in operating costs, the segment’s
ratio of insurance operating costs and other expenses to premiums and other considerations
(excluding buyouts) increased to 28% for the year ended December 31, 2004, respectively, from 25%
for prior year. As part of the CNA Acquisition, a larger block of affinity business is now
included in the Group Benefits segment. This business typically has lower expected loss ratios and
higher expected commission ratios than other products within the business.

2003 Compared to 2002

—

Net income increased primarily due to increases in earned premiums and
favorable claims experience. Premium growth was not as high as anticipated however due to lower
sales to new customers in 2003 and lower persistency on renewals reflecting a competitive
marketplace. However, the segment reported an increase in total buyout premiums. Buyouts involve
the acquisition of claim liabilities from another carrier for a purchase price calculated to cover
the run off of those liabilities plus administration expenses and profit. Due to the nature of the
buyout marketplace, the predictability of buyout premiums is uncertain. Although, total benefits,
claims and expenses increased for the year ended December 31, 2003, total benefits, claims and
expenses excluding buyouts decreased $43, or 2%, over the same period. The segment’s loss ratio
was 79%, down from 81% in 2002. Partially offsetting these factors that contributed to the
increased net income was an increase in insurance operating costs and other



expenses due to the
premium growth previously described and continued investments in technology, service and
distribution. The segment’s ratio of insurance operating costs and other expenses to premiums and
other considerations (excluding buyouts) was 25%, increasing slightly from 23% in 2002.

Outlook

Following the majority of the integration effort of the acquired group life and accident, and
short-term and long-term disability businesses of CNA Financial Corporation, the Company
anticipates the increased scale of the group life and disability operations and the expanded
distribution network for its products and services will generate low double digit sales growth in
2005. Sales, however, may be negatively affected by the competitive pricing environment in the
marketplace. Management is committed to selling competitively priced products that meet the
Company’s internal rate of return guidelines. The two significant factors in evaluating this
business are the loss ratio and the expense ratio. Based on historical experience trends and
variability in the Group Benefits business, management expects the loss ratio in future periods to
be in the range of 73% to 76% and the expense ratio to be in the range of 27% to 29%.

Despite the current market conditions, including low interest rates, rising medical costs, the
changing regulatory environment and cost containment pressure on employers, the Group Benefits
segment continues to leverage off of its strength in claim practices risk management, service and
distribution, enabling the Company to capitalize on market opportunities. Additionally, employees
continue to look to the workplace for a broader and ever expanding array of insurance products. As
employers design benefit strategies to attract and retain employees, while attempting to control
their benefit costs, management believes that the need for the Group Benefits segment’s products
will continue to expand. This, combined with the significant number of employees who currently do
not have coverage or adequate levels of coverage, creates unique opportunities for our products and
services.

PROPERTY & CASUALTY

Executive Overview

Property & Casualty is organized into four reportable operating segments: the underwriting
segments of Business Insurance, Personal Lines and Specialty Commercial (collectively “Ongoing
Operations”); and the Other Operations segment. Prior to the first quarter of 2004, Property &
Casualty had also included the domestic assumed reinsurance business of HartRe. With the
discontinuance of writing new assumed domestic reinsurance, HartRe assumed reinsurance is now
fully included in the Other Operations segment for all periods presented.

Property & Casualty provides a number of coverages, as well as insurance related services, to
businesses throughout the United States, including workers’ compensation, property, automobile,
liability, umbrella, specialty casualty, marine, agriculture, bond, professional liability and
directors and officers’ liability coverages. Property & Casualty also provides automobile,
homeowners and home-based business coverage to individuals throughout the United States as well as
insurance-related services to businesses.

Property & Casualty derives its revenues principally from premiums earned for insurance coverages
provided to insureds, investment income, and, to a lesser extent, from fees earned for services
provided to third parties and net realized capital gains and losses. Premiums charged for
insurance coverages are earned principally on a pro rata basis over the terms of the related
policies in force.

Service fees principally include revenues from third party claims administration services provided
by Specialty Risk Services and revenues from member contact center services provided through AARP’s
Health Care Options program.

Property & Casualty underwriting segments are evaluated by The Hartford’s management primarily
based upon underwriting results. Underwriting results represent earned premiums less incurred
claims, claim adjustment expenses and underwriting expenses. Underwriting results are influenced
significantly by premium growth and the adequacy of the Company’s pricing. Property & Casualty
seeks to price its insurance policies such that insurance premiums and future net investment income
earned on premiums received will cover underwriting expenses and the ultimate cost of paying claims
reported on the policies and provide for a profit margin. For many of its insurance products,
Property & Casualty is required to obtain approval for its premium rates from state insurance
departments.

Pricing adequacy depends on a number of factors, including the ability to obtain regulatory
approval for rate changes, proper evaluation of underwriting risks, the ability to project future
loss cost frequency and severity based on historical loss experience adjusted for known trends, the
Company’s response to rate actions taken by competitors, and expectations about regulatory and
legal developments and expense levels.

Underwriting profitability over time is also greatly influenced by the Company’s underwriting
discipline which seeks to manage exposure to loss through favorable risk selection and
diversification and by its ability to manage its expense ratio which it accomplishes through
economies of scale and its management of acquisition costs and other underwriting expenses.

In setting its pricing, Property & Casualty assumes an expected level of losses from natural or
man-made catastrophes that will cover the Company’s exposure to catastrophes over the long-term.
In most years, however, Property & Casualty’s actual losses from catastrophes will be significantly
more or less than that assumed in its pricing due to the significant volatility of catastrophe
losses.



ISO defines a catastrophe loss as an event that causes $25 or more in industry insured
property losses and affects a significant number of property and casualty policyholders and
insurers.

Given the lag in the period from when claims are incurred to when they are reported and paid, final
claim settlements may vary from current estimates of incurred losses and loss expenses,
particularly when those payments may not occur until well into the future. Reserves for lines of
business with a longer lag (or “tail”) in reporting are more difficult to estimate. Reserve
estimates for longer tail lines are initially set based on loss and loss expense ratio assumptions
estimated when the business was priced and are adjusted as the paid and reported claims develop,
indicating that the ultimate loss and loss expense ratio will differ from the initial assumptions.
Adjustments to previously established loss and loss expense reserves, if any, are reflected in
underwriting results in the period in which the adjustment is determined to be necessary.

Through its Other Operations segment, Property & Casualty is responsible for managing operations of
The Hartford that have discontinued writing new or renewal business as well as managing the claims
related to asbestos and environmental exposures. As such, the underwriting loss in Other
Operations is principally related to claim and claim adjustment expense development.

The Company considers several measures and ratios to be the key performance indicators for the
property and casualty underwriting businesses. The following tables and the segment discussions
for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002 include various premium measures and
underwriting ratios. Management believes that these measures and ratios are useful in
understanding the underlying trends in The Hartford’s property and casualty insurance underwriting
business. However, these key performance indicators should only be used in conjunction with, and
not in lieu of, underwriting income for the individual Property & Casualty segments and net income
for the Property & Casualty business as a whole and may not be comparable to other performance
measures used by the Company’s competitors.

The Company aims to achieve both growth and profitability in the Business Insurance and Personal
Lines businesses and, therefore, key performance indicators for these two segments include both
growth and profitability measures. Specialty Commercial, however, is comprised of transactional
businesses where premium writings may fluctuate based on perceived market opportunity. As such,
the key performance indicators do not include a growth objective for Specialty Commercial. The
number of policies in force is a growth measure used for Personal Lines only.

Policies in force as of year end:

Policies in force represent the number of policies with coverage in effect as of the end
of the period. In both automobile and homeowners, the policy in force count in 2004 has
increased as a result of the new Dimensions class plan rolled out in the latter part of
2003 and through the remainder of 2004. The increase is also attributable to continued
growth in AARP business, reflecting growth in the size of the AARP target market and
direct marketing programs to increase premium writings. The policy in force count is a
reflection of both the increase in new business and strong policy renewal retention of
prior year business. The Company expects the number of policies in force to continue to
increase for both automobile and homeowners in 2005.

Written pricing increase (decrease):

Written pricing increase (decrease) over the comparable period of the prior year includes
the impact of rate filings, the impact of changes in the value of the rating bases and
individual risk pricing decisions. A number of factors impact written pricing increases
(decreases) including expected loss costs as projected by the Company’s pricing
actuaries, rate filings approved by state regulators, risk selection decisions made by
the Company’s underwriters and marketplace

The investment return, or yield, on Property & Casualty’s invested assets is an important
element of the Company’s earnings since insurance products are priced with the assumption that
premiums received can be invested for a period of time before loss and loss adjustment expenses are
paid. For longer tail lines, such as workers’ compensation and general liability, claims are paid
over several years and, therefore, the premiums received for these lines of business can generate
significant investment income.

HIM determines the appropriate allocation of investments by asset class and measures the investment
yield performance for each asset class against market indices or other benchmarks. Due to the
emphasis on preservation of capital and the need to maintain sufficient liquidity to satisfy claim
obligations, the vast majority of Property and Casualty’s invested assets have been held in fixed
maturities, including, among other asset classes, corporate bonds, municipal bonds, government
debt, short-term debt, mortgage-



backed securities and asset-backed securities. As of both December
31, 2004 and 2003, approximately 96% of Property & Casualty’s invested assets were held in fixed
maturities.

The Company’s actual investment yields are influenced primarily by, among other factors, changes in
market interest rates, prepayments on mortgage-backed securities and the credit-worthiness of
individual issuers. During 2005, management expects after-tax investment yields to decrease
slightly as the before-tax rate on newly invested funds is expected to be 4.8% to 5.0% in 2005,
compared to a before-tax investment yield of 5.4% in 2004.

When fixed maturity or equity investments are sold, net realized capital gains (losses) are
realized. Individual securities may be sold for a variety of reasons, including a decision to
change the Company’s asset allocation in response to market conditions and the need to liquidate
funds to meet large claim settlements Accordingly, net realized capital gains (losses) for any
particular period are not predictable and can vary significantly. Refer to the Investment section
for further discussion of net investment income and net realized capital gains (losses).

Risk Management Strategy

The Hartford’s property and casualty operations have well-developed processes to manage
catastrophic risk exposures to natural catastrophes, such as hurricanes and earthquakes, and other
perils, such as terrorism. These processes involve establishing underwriting guidelines for both
individual risks and in aggregate including individual policy limits and aggregate exposure limits
by geographic zone and peril. The Company establishes exposure limits and actively monitors the
risk exposures as a percent of Property and Casualty surplus. Generally the Company limits its
exposure to natural catastrophes from a single 250-year event to less than 30% of property and
casualty statutory surplus for losses prior to reinsurance and to less than 15% of property and
casualty statutory surplus for losses net of reinsurance. In specifically identified locations,
the Company manages aggregate terrorism exposures including exposures resulting from the Company’s
Group Life operations. The aggregate terrorism exposure in these locations, as measured by
specific loss scenarios, is generally limited to an amount equivalent to approximately 7% of the
combined statutory surplus of the life and property and casualty operations. The Company monitors
exposures monthly and employs both internally developed and externally purchased loss modeling
tools.

The Hartford utilizes reinsurance to manage risk and transfer exposures to well-established and
financially secure reinsurers. Reinsurance is used to manage aggregate exposures as well as
specific risks based on accumulated property and casualty liabilities in certain geographic zones.
All treaty purchases related to the Company’s property and casualty operations are administered by
a centralized function to support a consistent strategy and ensure that the reinsurance activities
are fully integrated into the organization’s risk management processes.

To minimize the potential credit risk resulting from the use of reinsurance, a centralized group
evaluates the credit standing of potential reinsurers and establishes the Company’s schedule of
approved reinsurers. The assessment process reviews reinsurers against a set of financial and
management criteria and distinguishes between long-tail casualty and short-tail property business.
A committee meets regularly to review activity with each reinsurer and affirm the schedule of
approved reinsurers.

A variety of traditional reinsurance products are used in the development and execution of the risk
management strategy. The risk transfer products used include excess of loss occurrence-based
products that protect aggregate property and workers compensation exposures, and individual risk or
quota share products, that protect specific classes or lines of business. There are currently no
significant finite risk contracts in place and the current statutory surplus benefit from all such
prior year contracts is immaterial. Facultative reinsurance is also used to manage policy-specific
risk exposures based on established underwriting guidelines. The Hartford also participates in
governmentally administered reinsurance facilities such as the Florida Hurricane Catastrophe Fund
(“FHCF”), the facility provided by The Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of 2002 and other reinsurance
programs relating to particular risks or specific lines of business.

The Hartford’s principal catastrophe reinsurance program provides coverage, on average, for 88% of
the $695 of catastrophic property losses incurred from a single event in excess of a $125
retention. The exact amount and percentage of coverage varies by layer. In addition to the
reinsurance protection provided by The Hartford’s principal catastrophe reinsurance program, in
November 2004, the Company purchased two fully collateralized, four-year reinsurance coverages for
losses sustained from qualifying hurricane and earthquake loss events. The Company purchased this
reinsurance from Foundation Re, a Cayman Islands reinsurance company, which financed the provision
of reinsurance through the issuance of $248 in catastrophe bonds to investors under two separate
bond tranches. The first coverage provides reinsurance protection above the Company’s principal
reinsurance program and covers losses arising from large hurricane loss events affecting the Gulf
and Eastern Coast of the United States. The coverage reinsures 45% of $400 in losses in excess of
an index loss trigger of $1.3 billion. The index trigger has an estimated probability of attachment
of approximately 1-in-100 years. The second coverage purchased by the Company reinsures 90% of $75
in losses in excess of $125 in losses arising from qualifying hurricane and earthquake events.
Qualifying hurricane and earthquake events are those which occur in the year following a large
hurricane or earthquake event that has an estimated occurrence probability of 1-in-100 years.

The Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of 2002 established a program that will run through 2005 that
provides a backstop for insurance-related losses resulting from any “act of terrorism” certified by
the Secretary of the Treasury, in concurrence with the Secretary of State and Attorney General.
Under the program, the federal government would pay 90% of covered losses after an insurer’s losses
exceed 15% of the Company’s direct commercial earned premiums in 2004, up to a combined annual
aggregate limit for the federal



government and all insurers of $100 billion. If an act of
terrorism or acts of terrorism result in covered losses exceeding the $100 billion annual limit,
insurers with losses exceeding their deductibles will not be responsible for additional losses.

Presently, no material catastrophe reinsurance capacity exists for certified acts of terrorism,
including those related to nuclear, biological, chemical or radiological attack. The Company
actively manages its exposures to the peril of terrorism and has reduced exposures in specific
locations through underwriting actions. The Company has worked with various industry groups to
develop policy exclusions related to the peril of terrorism, including those associated with
nuclear, biological, chemical and radiological attacks. The Company may include such exclusions in
policies in the future in those jurisdictions and classes of business where such exclusions are
permitted, and take additional underwriting actions as deemed appropriate.

2004 Compared to 2003 —

Total revenues for Property & Casualty increased $653 for the year
ended December 31, 2004. The increase was due primarily to earned premium growth of $689 and an
increase in investment income of $76, partially offset by a decrease in realized capital gains of
$120. The increase in earned premiums in the Business Insurance, Personal Lines and Specialty
Commercial segments was due to earned pricing increases and growth in new business premiums
outpacing non-renewals for Personal Lines and Business Insurance. Additionally, earned premium
growth was partially offset by a $90 decrease reflecting a reduction in estimated earned premium
under retrospectively-rated policies. The increase in investment income of $76 is primarily driven
by an increase in underwriting cash flow, partially offset by a decrease in the after-tax
investment yield.

Net income for the year ended December 31, 2004 increased $1.7 billion, primarily due to the net
asbestos reserve strengthening of $1.7 billion, after-tax, in the first quarter of 2003, a decrease
in after-tax catastrophe losses related to September 11 of $257 and an improved combined ratio
before catastrophes and prior accident year development in Business Insurance, Personal Lines and
Specialty Commercial. The increase in net income is partially offset by an increase in after-tax
catastrophe losses of $159 before considering the September 11 reserve release, a decrease in
after-tax realized capital gains of $78, and an increase in after-tax prior



accident year
development of $383 before considering both the September 11 reserve release and the 2003 net
asbestos reserve strengthening. Before the September 11 reserve release, after-tax catastrophe
losses in 2004 of $330 includes after-tax losses of $76 from Hurricane Charley, $69 from Hurricane
Frances, $54 from Hurricane Ivan and $60 from Hurricane Jeanne. Before the September 11 reserve
release, 2004 prior accident year development of $526, after-tax, includes, among other movements,
a $124
after-tax reserve strengthening for construction defect claims, a $118 after-tax provision related
to a reduction in the reinsurance recoverable asset on older, long-term casualty liabilities, a
$111 after-tax increased in assumed casualty reinsurance reserves, and a $49 after-tax increase in
environmental reserves. The combined ratio before catastrophes and prior accident year development
for Ongoing Operations improved by 3.1 points, from 92.8 in 2003 to 89.7 in 2004. Strong earned
pricing and favorable claim frequency contributed to the improvement across Business Insurance,
Personal Lines and Specialty Commercial.

2003 Compared to 2002 —

Revenues for Property & Casualty increased $1.2 billion for the year
ended December 31, 2003. The improvement was due primarily to earned premium growth in the
Business Insurance, Specialty Commercial and Personal Lines segments, primarily as a result of
earned pricing increases, as well as an increase in net realized capital gains of $321, and an
increase in net investment income of $112. Partially offsetting the increase was a $412 earned
premium decline in the Other Operations segment primarily as a result of the Company’s decision to
withdraw from the assumed reinsurance business as discussed more fully below.

On May 16, 2003, as part of the Company’s decision to withdraw from the assumed reinsurance
business, the Company entered into a quota share and purchase agreement with Endurance Reinsurance
Corporation of America (“Endurance”) whereby HartRe assumed reinsurance retroceded the majority of
its domestic inforce book of business as of April 1, 2003 and sold renewal rights to Endurance.
Under the quota share agreement, Endurance reinsured most of the segment’s assumed reinsurance
contracts that were written on or after January 1, 2002 and that had unearned premium as of April
1, 2003. In consideration for Endurance reinsuring the unearned premium as of April 1, 2003, the
Company paid Endurance an amount equal to unearned premiums less the related unamortized
commissions/deferred acquisition costs. Under the quota share agreement, Endurance pays an
override commission based on a percentage of all ceded premium and a profit sharing commission
based on the performance of property treaty, property catastrophe and aviation pool unearned
premium. Both the override commission and the profit sharing commission are recognized as income
over the period the ceded contracts are in force. Under the purchase agreement, Endurance will pay
a renewal rights fee, subject to a guaranteed minimum of $15, based on the level of renewal premium
on the reinsured contracts over the two year period following the agreement. Given that the
Company did not have a continuing obligation with respect to the renewal rights, the guaranteed
minimum was recorded in income during the second quarter of 2003, when the purchase agreement was
entered. During the first quarter of 2004, the Company fully transferred HartRe assumed
reinsurance to its Other Operations segment, where it remains subject to ongoing reserve
development relating to all retained business.

Net income decreased $1.3 billion for the year ended December 31, 2003 primarily due to the net
asbestos reserve strengthening of $1.7 billion, after-tax, in the first quarter of 2003. Results
for the year were favorably impacted by an increase in net realized capital gains (losses) and
improved underwriting results in the Personal Lines and Business Insurance segments. Strong earned
pricing and favorable claim frequency resulted in an increase in underwriting results in both the
Personal Lines and Business Insurance segments. In addition, net investment income, after-tax,
rose $69 for the year ended December 31, 2003 due to higher invested assets, primarily from strong
cash flows and additional capital raised during the second quarter of 2003.

On September 1, 2003, the Company sold a wholly owned subsidiary, Trumbull Associates, LLC, for
$33, resulting in a gain of $15, after-tax. The gain is included in net realized capital gains.
The revenues and net income of Trumbull Associates, LLC were not material to the Company or the
Property & Casualty operation.

Reserves

Reserving for property and casualty losses is an estimation process. As additional experience and
other relevant claim data become available, reserve levels are adjusted accordingly. Such
adjustments of reserves related to claims incurred in prior years are a natural occurrence in the
loss reserving process and are referred to as “reserve development”. Reserve development that
increases previous estimates of ultimate loss cost is called “reserve strengthening”. Reserve
development that decreases previous estimates of ultimate loss cost is called “reserve releases”.
Reserve development can influence the comparability of year over year underwriting results and is
set forth in the paragraphs and tables that follow. The “prior accident year development” in the
following table represents the ratio of reserve development to earned premiums. For a detailed
discussion of the Company’s reserve policies, see Notes 1, 11 and 12 of Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements and the discussion in Critical Accounting Estimates.

Ongoing Operations

At the end of 2003, several areas of reserve exposure were being closely monitored. Consistent
with the Company’s practices to regularly review its reserves, the Company continued to monitor
these reserve exposures and completed several reserve studies, including studies related to
September 11 reserves and construction defects claims. As a result of these monitoring activities
and studies, during the first quarter of 2004, the Company made reserve adjustments with regard to
certain of those reserve exposures, most notably related to September 11 and construction defects.
During 2004, the Company made other reserve adjustments based on regular reserve evaluations
performed each quarter. These reserve adjustments, and the effects on the Company’s segments, are
more fully discussed in the paragraphs that follow.

With respect to September 11 claim reserves, the Company observed favorable developments, including
the closure of all but 44 primary insurance property cases, a high participation rate within the
Victim’s Compensation Fund and the expiration of the deadline for filing a liability claim in March
2004. Based on these favorable events, the Company determined that it was appropriate to reduce
both the gross and net estimate of loss from September 11. The Company’s (Ongoing Operations and
Other Operations) gross estimate of loss of $1.1 billion was
reduced to $845. The corresponding
reduction in net reserves for September 11 related to Ongoing Operations was $175 in Business
Insurance, $116 in Specialty Commercial and $7 in Personal Lines. As of December 31, 2004, loss
and loss expense reserves remaining related to September 11, both gross and net of reinsurance, are
as follows:

Substantially all of the net reserve balance is incurred but not reported (“IBNR”) and the majority
of the balance is related to workers’ compensation exposures.

The Company has exposure to losses from construction defects, particularly from contractors in
California. The Company’s exposure to losses from construction defects relates primarily to years
prior to 2000. The Company has been evaluating and closely monitoring these reserves. Based on
the Company’s 2004 reserve study that used various predictive models and reflected the increasing
severity of construction defect claims, the Company concluded an increase in reserves of $190 was
required. This increase consisted of $23 for Business Insurance and $167 for Specialty Commercial
and is included in the general liability line of business. As of December 31, 2004, reserves for
Specialty Commercial general liability, net of reinsurance, were $1,125. The $167 strengthening
related to Specialty Commercial represents 15% of the net reserves.



In addition to the release in September 11 reserves and strengthening for construction defect
claims, Business Insurance reserves were strengthened by $85 during 2004. Most of this reserve
strengthening relates to auto liability ($25) and package business ($38),
reflecting an increase in the actuarial estimates of ultimate incurred losses for these lines,
attributable to accident years 1998-2002. As of December 31, 2004, Business Insurance reserves for
auto liability, net of reinsurance, were $549. The $25 of strengthening represents 5% of the net
reserves. Package business reserves, net of reinsurance, for Business Insurance as of December 31,
2004 were $1,499, so the $38 of strengthening represents 3% of the net reserves. During normal
quarterly reserve reviews, the Company’s actuaries noted that, for both auto liability and package
business, actual reported losses were above previous expectations. In particular, the analysis
indicated that there was a higher frequency of large claims (generally those greater than $100,000)
than had been anticipated in prior estimates. The Company increased its estimate of ultimate
incurred losses to recognize this.

In addition to the foregoing reserve adjustments, within the Specialty Commercial segment there
were other offsetting positive and negative adjustments. The principal offsetting adjustments
related to a strengthening in specialty large deductible workers’ compensation reserves and a
release in other liability reserves, each approximately $150.

Other Operations

Reserves and reserve activity in the Other Operations segment are categorized and reported as
asbestos, environmental or “all other” activity. Total net reserve strengthening for Other
Operations was $409 in 2004, including $262 of strengthening for asbestos and environmental
reserves. The asbestos and environmental strengthening primarily includes a $75 increase in
environmental reserves and a $181 reduction in the reinsurance recoverable asset associated with
older, long-term casualty liabilities, including asbestos liabilities. These actions are further
discussed in the Other Operations segment MD&A discussion.

The largest component of the remaining $147 of net “all other” strengthening for Other Operations
was related to assumed casualty reinsurance. The “all other” category of reserves covers a wide
range of insurance and assumed reinsurance coverages, including, but not limited to, potential
liability for breast implants, construction defects, lead paint, molestation, silica,
pharmaceutical products and other long-tail liabilities. As of December 31, 2004, total reserves
for HartRe assumed reinsurance and “all other” liabilities within Other Operations, net of ceded
reinsurance, were $2.5 billion, so the $147 strengthening represents a 6% of these reserves.

The Company has been evaluating and closely monitoring assumed reinsurance reserves in Other
Operations. During 2003 and 2002, the Company booked unfavorable reserve development of $129 and
$77, respectively. Unfavorable trends continued during 2004 and, as a result, the Company
increased reserves by $170. The majority of the $170 increase was for assumed casualty treaty
reinsurance for the years 1997 through 2001. Assumed reinsurance exposures are inherently less
predictable than direct insurance exposures because the Company may not receive notice of a
reinsurance claim until the underlying direct insurance claim is mature. This causes a delay in
the receipt of information from the ceding companies. In recent years, the Company has seen an
increase in reported claims above previous expectations and this increase in reported claims
contributed to the reserve re-estimates.

As noted in the Ongoing Operations discussion, the Company continued to observe favorable
developments with respect to reserves related to September 11. Particularly for Other Operations,
these favorable trends included a lack of significant additional loss notices on assumed
reinsurance property treaties. The reduction in net reserves for September 11 for Other Operations
was $97. As of December 31, 2004, gross reserves and net reserves remaining in Other Operations
related to September 11 were $171 and $68, respectively. All September 11 reserves within Other
Operations relate to HartRe assumed reinsurance exposures, both property and casualty.

Ongoing Operations

There was no significant reserve strengthening or release in the Business Insurance and Personal
Lines segments for the year ended December 31, 2003. Specialty Commercial strengthened prior
accident year reserves by $52 for the year ended December 31, 2003 primarily as a result of losses
in the bond and professional liability lines of business. The bond reserve strengthening was
isolated to a few severe contract surety claims related to accident year 2002. The professional
liability reserve strengthening involved a provision for anticipated settlements of reinsurance
obligations for contracts outstanding at the time of the original acquisition of Reliance Group
Holdings’ auto residual value portfolio in the third quarter of 2000.

Other Operations

As further discussed in the segment section, the Company recorded net asbestos reserve
strengthening of $2.6 billion during the first quarter of 2003. In addition, strengthening of
assumed reinsurance reserves of $129 in 2003 occurred across multiple accident years, primarily
1997 through 2000, and principally in the casualty line of HartRe assumed reinsurance.

Ongoing Operations

Reserve strengthening in the Business Insurance segment for the year ended December 31, 2002 was
not significant. In Personal Lines, prior accident year loss and loss adjustment expenses for
non-standard auto were strengthened due to heavier than expected frequency, severity and litigation
rates on prior accident years. In addition, the prior accident year provision was increased
modestly for mold losses. Virtually all of the strengthening in Specialty Commercial is due to
deductible workers’ compensation losses on a few large accounts.

Other Operations

Reserve strengthening of $77 in HartRe assumed reinsurance reserves occurred across multiple
accident years, primarily 1997 through 2000, and across several lines of business. High reported
losses from ceding companies persisted throughout 2002 and loss ratios were revised upward.
Virtually all of the remaining reserve strengthening in the Other Operations segment related to
asbestos.

Impact of Re-estimates

As explained in connection with the Company’s discussion of Critical Accounting Estimates, the
establishment of Property and Casualty reserves is an estimation process, using a variety of
methods, assumptions and data elements. Ultimate losses may vary significantly from the current
estimates. Many factors can contribute to these variations and the need to change the previous
estimate of required reserve levels. Subsequent changes can generally be thought of as being the
result of the emergence of additional facts that were not known or anticipated at the time of the
prior reserve estimate and/or changes in interpretations of information and trends.

The table below shows the range of annual reserve re-estimates experienced by The Hartford over the
past four years. The amount of prior accident year development (as shown in the reserve
rollforward) for a given calendar year is expressed as a percent of the beginning calendar year
reserves, net of reinsurance. The percentage relationships presented are significantly influenced
by the facts and circumstances of each particular year and by the fact that only the last four
years are included in the range. Accordingly, these percentages are not intended to be a
prediction of the range of possible future variability. See “Impact of key assumptions on reserve
volatility” within Critical Accounting Estimates for further discussion of the potential for
variability in recorded loss reserves.

Before the $2.6 billion of reserve strengthening for asbestos during 2003 and the $785 of
reserve strengthening for asbestos and environmental during 1996, over the past ten years,
reserve re-estimates for total Property and Casualty ranged from (1.3%) to 3.0% .



The potential variability of the Company’s Property and Casualty reserves would normally be
expected to vary by segment and the types of loss exposures insured by those segments.
Illustrative factors influencing the potential reserve variability for each of the segments are
discussed under Critical Accounting Estimates. In general, the Company would expect the
variability of its Personal Lines reserve estimates to be relatively less than the variability of
the reserve estimates for its other property and casualty segments. The Company would expect the
degree of variability of the remaining segments’ reserve estimates, from lower variability to
higher variability, to be generally Business Insurance, Specialty Commercial, and Other Operations.
The actual relative variability could prove to be different than anticipated.

Reinsurance Recoverables

The Company’s net reinsurance recoverables from various property and casualty reinsurance
arrangements amounted to $5.2 billion and $5.4 billion as of December 31, 2004 and December 31,
2003, respectively. Of the total net reinsurance recoverables as of December 31, 2004, 8.4%
relates to the Company’s mandatory participation in various involuntary assigned risk pools, which
are backed by the financial strength of the property and casualty insurance industry. Of the
remainder, $3.4 billion, or 70.9%, were rated by A.M. Best. Of the total rated by A.M. Best, 93%
were rated A- (excellent) or better. The remaining $1.4 billion, or 29.1%, of net recoverables
from reinsurers were comprised of the following: 4.8% related to voluntary pools, 3.2% related to
captive insurance companies, and 21.1% related to companies not rated by A.M. Best.

Where its contracts permit, the Company secures future claim obligations with various forms of
collateral including irrevocable letters of credit, secured trusts, funds held accounts and group
wide offsets. The allowance for uncollectible reinsurance was $374 and $381 as of December 31,
2004 and December 31, 2003, respectively. The allowance for uncollectible reinsurance is based on
an assessment of the credit quality of the Company’s reinsurers as well as an estimate of the cost
of resolution of reinsurer disputes.

The Company completed an evaluation of the reinsurance recoverable asset associated with older,
long-term casualty liabilities, including asbestos liabilities, reported in the Other Operations
segment. As a result of this evaluation, the Company reduced its net reinsurance recoverable by
$181. The after-tax income effect of this action was $118. The $181 primarily related to a
reduction of the amount of liabilities, principally asbestos, that the Company expects to cede to
reinsurers and, to a lesser extent, an increase in the allowance for uncollectible reinsurance
recoverables.

Premium Measures

Written premium is a Statutory accounting financial measure which represents the amount of premiums
charged for policies issued, net of reinsurance, during a fiscal period. Earned premium is a GAAP
and Statutory measure. Premiums are considered earned and are included in the financial results on
a pro rata basis over the policy period. The following segment discussions for the years ended
December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively, include the presentation of written premiums in
addition to earned premiums. Management believes that this performance measure is useful to
investors as it reflects current trends in the Company’s sale of property and casualty insurance
products, as compared to earned premium. Reinstatement premium represents additional ceded premium
paid for the reinstatement of the amount of reinsurance coverage that was reduced as a result of a
reinsurance loss payment.

The difference between written premiums and earned premiums is attributable to the change
in unearned premium reserve.

Business Insurance provides standard commercial insurance coverage to small and middle market
commercial businesses, primarily throughout the United States. This segment offers workers’
compensation, property, automobile, liability, umbrella and marine coverages. The Business
Insurance segment also provides commercial risk management products and services.

2004 Compared to 2003 —

Earned premiums for the segment increased $603 for the year ended December
31, 2004, primarily due to earned pricing increases and new business premium outpacing
non-renewals. For the year ended December 31, 2004, earned pricing increases of 7% for small
commercial and 3% for middle market contributed to the earned premium growth of $295 in small
commercial and $308 in middle market. The increase in earned premiums is partially due to an
increase in Select Xpand product sales for small commercial and growth in workers’ compensation
premium for middle market. As substantially all premiums in the segment are earned over a 12 month
policy period, earned pricing increases in 2004 were primarily driven by written pricing increases
of 9% in the last six months of 2003 and 2% during 2004.

New business written premium for the year ended December 31, 2004 of $1,148 was up from $1,038 for
the year ended December 31, 2003, due to an increase in new business written premium for small
commercial of $172, partially offset by a decrease in new business written premium for middle
market of $61. The new business premium growth in Small Commercial was due primarily to growth from
the Select Xpand product and growth from an increase in the number of agents, partially offset by
the moderation in written pricing increases.

Premium renewal retention remained strong, decreasing slightly from 87% for the year ended December
31, 2003 to 85% for the year ended December 31, 2004. The moderation in written pricing increases
for middle market from 2003 to 2004 contributed to the decrease in premium renewal retention.

Underwriting results for the year ended December 31, 2004 improved $202, with a corresponding 4.1
point decrease in the combined ratio. The improvement in the combined ratio is mainly due to a
decrease in the loss and loss adjustment expense ratio of 2.1 points and a decrease in the expense
ratio of 1.7 points. The improvement in the loss and loss adjustment expense ratio of 2.1 points
was due to a $175 reduction in reserves for September 11 and the impact of earning pricing
increases in excess of loss cost increases, partially offset by $108 of strengthening of prior
accident year reserves, excluding September 11, and an increase in catastrophe losses,



excluding
September 11, of 0.5 points. The 2004 prior accident year reserve strengthening excluding
September 11 of $108, or 2.5 points, includes an increase in reserves of $38 for small commercial
package business, $25 for auto liability claims and $23 for
construction defect claims. Catastrophe losses, excluding the reduction in September 11
reserves, were $136 in 2004 and included losses from hurricanes Charley, Frances, Ivan and Jeanne
in the third quarter of 2004.

Before catastrophes and all prior accident year development, underwriting results for the year
ended December 31, 2004 improved $181, with a corresponding 3.3 point decrease in the combined
ratio, due to a lower loss and loss adjustment expense ratio and a lower expense ratio. The
decrease in the loss and loss adjustment expense ratio was primarily due to earned pricing
increases and to improved claim frequency, partially offset by increased claim severity. The
expense ratio improved 1.7 points, primarily due to earned premium growth coupled with a decrease
in commissions as a percentage of earned premium. Commissions are a lower percentage of earned
premium on workers’ compensation policies and workers compensation premiums were a higher
percentage of earned premium in 2004 than in 2003.

2003 Compared to 2002 —

Earned premiums for the segment increased by $570 for the year ended
December 31, 2003, primarily due to earned pricing increases of 12% and new business growth
outpacing non-renewals. As substantially all premiums in the segment are earned over a 12 month
policy period, earned pricing increases in 2003 were primarily driven by written pricing increases
of 14% in the last six months of 2002 and 9% during 2003. New business growth of 17% in 2003 was
primarily driven by growth in middle market business. Premium renewal retention for the year ended
December 31, 2003 remained strong at 87% compared to 89% in 2002.

Underwriting results improved $64, with a corresponding 1.3 point decrease in the combined ratio,
for the year ended December 31, 2003, despite a significant increase in catastrophe losses due
largely to Hurricane Isabel and severe tornadoes in the Midwest. Before catastrophes,
underwriting results improved $140, or 119%, with a corresponding 3.2 point decrease in the
combined ratio. The improvement was driven by a decrease in the loss and loss expense ratio
before catastrophes for both small commercial and middle market, primarily due to improved claim
frequency and double-digit earned pricing increases. In addition, double-digit earned pricing
increases and prudent expense management favorably impacted the expense ratio for the year ended
December 31, 2003.

Outlook

Management expects the Business Insurance segment to continue to deliver strong results in 2005.
Although some price decreases within many markets of the commercial industry are expected, the
Company expects to achieve mid- to high-single-digit written premium growth due, in part, to
implementing continued strategic actions. These actions include working with distribution channels
to expand market share in targeted states, improving pricing opportunities through better
segmentation of the market, offering flexible products that allow agents to tailor offerings to
each customer, maintaining disciplined renewal underwriting and enhancing agency technology,
including e-submission capability. Loss costs are expected to increase due to less favorable
trends in claim frequency and continuing trends of increasing claim severity. As a result of the
anticipated slight decrease in written pricing and increase in loss costs, management expects the
loss and loss expense ratio to increase moderately in 2005. Competition in middle market is
challenging, but largely rational, with some classes of business experiencing more aggressive price
competition. Written pricing in the small commercial market will also continue to be impacted by
increasing competition as more national carriers enter the market. Nonetheless, we anticipate
continued new business growth in the small commercial segment through execution of strategic
initiatives and the continued growth of our Select Xpand product sales.

[1] The difference between written premiums and earned premiums is attributable to the change
in unearned premium reserve.

Personal Lines provides automobile, homeowners’ and home-based business coverages to the
members of AARP through a direct marketing operation; to individuals who prefer local agent
involvement through a network of independent agents in the standard personal lines market
(“Standard”) and in the non-standard automobile market through the Company’s Omni Insurance Group,
Inc. (“Omni”) subsidiary. Personal Lines also operates a member contact center for health
insurance products offered through AARP’s Health Care Options. The Hartford’s exclusive licensing
arrangement with AARP continues through January 1, 2010 for automobile, homeowners and home-based
business. The Health Care Options agreement continues through 2007.

2004 Compared to 2003 —

Earned premiums increased $264 for the year ended December 31, 2004 due to
growth in both AARP and Agency, partially offset by a reduction in Other Affinity earned premium.
Earned premiums for Omni were flat from 2003 to



2004. AARP and Agency earned premium increased
$190 and $100, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2004, primarily because new business
growth over the prior 6 to 12 months has exceeded non-renewals. Both AARP and Agency have
experienced increased
earned premiums in both automobile and homeowners business. The growth in Agency earned premium is
due, in part, to the new Dimensions automobile and homeowners class plans, which allows the Company
to write a broader class of risks. The growth in AARP reflects growth in the size of the AARP
target market and direct marketing programs to increase premium writings.

The new Dimensions auto class plan has been rolled out to an additional six states in 2004,
bringing the total number of states to 37

.

The new Dimensions homeowners’ class plan was
introduced in the first quarter of 2004 and has been rolled out to 28 states through December 31,
2004. As a result of the new Dimensions class plan initiative and other actions taken to increase
growth, the number of policies in force at year end increased in auto and homeowners from 2,058,825
and 1,319,629, respectively, as of December 31, 2003, to 2,166,922 and 1,348,573, respectively, as
of December 31, 2004. The growth in policies in force does not correspond directly with the growth
in earned premium due to the impact of earned pricing increases and because policy in force counts
are as of a point in time rather than over a period of time. Most of the growth in homeowners
policies in force was generated by Agency while for auto policies in force, growth in both AARP and
Agency is partially offset by a decline in Omni. For the year ended December 31, 2004, new
business premiums for both automobile and homeowners in AARP and Agency were $311 and $167,
respectively, which was up from $226 and $105, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2003.

Earned pricing increases have declined from 2003 to 2004. Earned pricing increases in automobile
of 5% in the year ended December 31, 2004, primarily reflects written pricing increases of 8% in
the last 6 months of 2003 and 3% in 2004. Earned pricing increases in homeowners of 11% in the
year ended December 31, 2004, primarily reflects written pricing increases of 13% in the last 6
months of 2003 and 9% in 2004. In addition to earned pricing increases, homeowners earned
premiums included the effect of automatic increases in the amount of insurance coverage to adjust
for construction cost inflation.

Premium renewal retention for automobile decreased from 91% for the year ended December 31, 2003 to
89% for the year ended December 31, 2004. The decrease in premium renewal retention for automobile
is driven largely by the impact of declining written pricing increases. Premium renewal retention
for homeowners decreased from 101% for the year ended December 31, 2003 to 100% for the year ended
December 31, 2004, also due to declining written pricing increases.

Underwriting results increased $8 for the year ended December 31, 2004 and the combined ratio
remained relatively flat at 96.0. The loss and loss adjustment expense ratio remained flat at
72.9, due to the impact of earned pricing increases in excess of loss cost increases, offset by an
increase in pre-tax catastrophe losses of $122, or 3.3 points. Pre-tax catastrophes, including
losses from Hurricane Charley, Hurricane Frances, Hurricane Ivan and Hurricane Jeanne, were $253,
or 7.4 points, for the year ended December 31, 2004, compared to $131, or 4.1 points, for the year
ended December 31, 2003. Net prior accident year development was not significant in either 2004 or
2003. Before catastrophes and prior accident year development, underwriting results for the year
ended December 31, 2004 increased $142, with a corresponding 3.5 point decrease in the combined
ratio, due to earned pricing increases and favorable claim frequency, offset by increased claim
severity. Automobile and homeowners results, before catastrophes, improved 2.3 and 4.7 combined
ratio points, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2004 as earned pricing increases
outpaced loss costs in both lines of business. The expense ratio remained relatively flat at
23.1%, despite earned premium growth, because of higher commissions as a result of increased Agency
business and increased other underwriting expenses.

2003 Compared to 2002 —

Earned premiums increased $197 in 2003 due to growth in both the
automobile and homeowners lines, primarily in AARP business, which grew by $209, or 12%. The
increase in automobile earned premium of $132 was primarily due to new business growth in AARP and
earned pricing increases of 9% in 2003 up from 6% in 2002. Homeowners earned premium growth of
$65 for the year ended December 31, 2003, was largely driven by new business growth in AARP and
earned pricing increases of 14% in 2003, up from 7% in 2002. The increase in earned premiums for
AARP and Agency is partially offset by the decrease in earned premiums for other affinity business
of $29 due to a planned reduction in policy counts as a result of the Company’s strategic decision
to de-emphasize other affinity business.

Earned pricing increases in automobile of 9% in the year ended December 31, 2003 primarily
reflects written pricing increases of 10% in the last 6 months of 2002 and for all of 2003.
Earned pricing increases in homeowners of 14% in the year ended December 31, 2003 primarily
reflects written pricing increases of 14% in the last 6 months of 2002 and for all of 2003.
Automobile premium renewal retention increased from 88% for the year ended December 31 2002 to 91%
for the year ended December 31, 2003. Premium renewal retention for homeowners was 101% for the
year ended December 31, 2003, which was relatively consistent with the prior year.

Underwriting results increased $161, with a corresponding 5.1 point decrease in the combined
ratio. The improvement was primarily due to the successful execution of the segment’s
state-specific strategies to manage pricing and loss costs. Automobile results improved 5.1
combined ratio points and homeowners results improved 5.0 combined ratio points, both due
primarily to earned pricing increases and favorable claim frequency. Personal Lines financial
performance was negatively affected by an increase in pre-tax catastrophe losses over the prior
year of $58, or 1.6 points, due largely to Hurricane Isabel, California wildfires and severe
tornadoes in the Midwest. Double-digit earned pricing increases and prudent expense management
resulted in a 0.3 point decrease in the expense ratio.



Outlook

While the personal lines industry operating fundamentals are expected to be strong in 2005, the
market will continue to face significant challenges. Price increases in automobile and homeowners
are expected to be in the low single digits. Regulatory requirements applying to premium rates
vary from state to state, and, in most states, rates are subject to prior regulatory approval.
State regulatory constraints may prevent companies from obtaining the necessary rates to achieve an
underwriting profit. Industry rates may remain inadequate in certain states in 2005. New business
competition is still rational, but with lower rate increases, consumer shopping has slowed and
fewer customers are switching carriers. Loss cost inflation is expected to rise in 2005, and it is
uncertain whether favorable claim frequency trends can continue. Automobile repair and medical
cost inflation are expected to continue to outpace general inflation trends.

In 2005, the Personal Lines segment is expected to deliver written premium growth in the high
single digits by expanding the number of agents offering our Dimensions products and increasing our
direct marketing to the AARP membership base. Our new product and technology investments are
expected to continue to deliver a competitive value proposition to independent agents. Continued
strong financial results in 2005 for the Personal Lines segment are also expected as a result of
continued state-driven pricing, product and underwriting actions.

Specialty Commercial offers a variety of customized insurance products and risk management
services. The segment provides standard commercial insurance products including workers’
compensation, automobile and liability coverages to large-sized companies. Specialty Commercial
also provides bond, professional liability, specialty casualty and agricultural coverages, as well
as core property and excess and surplus lines coverages not normally written by standard lines
insurers. Alternative markets, within Specialty Commercial, provides insurance products and
services primarily to captive insurance companies, pools and self-insurance



groups. In addition,
Specialty Commercial provides third-party administrator services for claims administration,
integrated benefits, loss control and performance measurement through Specialty Risk Services.

2004 Compared to 2003

— Earned premiums for the Specialty Commercial segment grew $168 due
primarily to earned pricing increases in casualty, bond and professional liability, partially
offset by earned pricing decreases in property, a decline in new business growth in all lines
except bond and a decrease in renewal retention in all lines. The increase in earned premium for
the year ended December 31, 2004 is also offset by a $90 reduction in premiums receivable under
retrospectively-rated policies, reflecting a decrease in estimated earned premium under the terms
of these policies. As substantially all premiums in the segment are earned over a 12 month policy
period, the earned pricing increases in 2004 resulted primarily from written pricing increases over
the last 6 months of 2003 and the year ended December 31, 2004.

Despite written pricing decreases in 2004, property written premium is relatively flat for the year
ended December 31, 2004, primarily due to an increase of $43 in the portion of property business
derived from multi-peril crop insurance premiums. On September 30, 2004, the Company agreed to
transfer its entire book of multi-peril crop insurance (MPCI) to Rural Community Insurance Company
(RCIC), a subsidiary of Wells Fargo & Company. The agreement transfers in bulk all 2005 crop year
policies to RCIC in exchange for an initial payment and renewal fees based upon retention of the
transferred business over a three year period. The Company will retain responsibility for the MPCI
business written for the 2004 and prior crop years. Earned premium for MPCI for the year ended
December 31, 2004 was $127. Before considering the increase in MPCI premiums, earned premiums for
property declined by 12%, reflecting a business decision to write less new business and renew less
premium as a result of the decline in written pricing.

Casualty written premiums were up $73 for the year ended December 31, 2004, primarily because of
written premium growth in alternative markets business and high single-digit written pricing
increases, partially offset by a decrease in premium renewal retention. Of the total growth in
written premium for the year ended December 31, 2004, $75 was attributable to a single alternative
markets insured program. This program was non-renewed effective December 1, 2004, although it will
continue to earn premium into 2005. The non-renewal is not expected to have a significant impact
on Specialty Commercial’s underwriting results.

Bond written premium grew $35 for the year ended December 31, 2004, primarily as a result of an
increase in contract surety business and a decrease in ceded premiums of $11 as well as written
pricing increases, partially offset by a slight decrease in premium renewal retention.

In professional liability, written premium is up $18 for the year ended December 31, 2004 due to a
decrease in the portion of risks ceded to outside reinsurers and earned pricing increases,
partially offset by a decrease in renewal retention and new business growth. Earned pricing
increases in professional liability were due entirely to written pricing increases in 2003 as
prices have declined in 2004.

Within the “other” category, written and earned premiums increased $31 and $41, respectively, for
the year ended December 31, 2004 due to increased premiums on internal reinsurance arrangements.

Underwriting results decreased $63 for the year ended December 31, 2004, primarily due to prior
accident year loss development and catastrophe losses incurred from the hurricanes in the third
quarter of 2004 and the decrease in earned premiums under retrospectively-rated policies, partially
offset by a $116 release of September 11 reserves and a decrease in the expense ratio. Before the
release of the September 11 reserves, prior accident year loss development was $185, or 10.7
points, in 2004, up from $52, or 3.3 points, in 2003. Prior accident year loss development for the
year ended December 31, 2004 included $167 of reserve strengthening for construction defect claims
as well as strengthening in large deductible workers’ compensation reserves and a release in other
liability reserves, each approximately $150. Before the release of the September 11 reserves,
catastrophe losses were $110, or 6.3 points, in 2004, up from $26, or 1.7 points, in 2003,
principally due to losses incurred for hurricanes Charley, Frances, Ivan and Jeanne in the third
quarter of 2004.

Before catastrophes, all prior accident year development, and the earned premium adjustment on
retrospectively-rated policies, underwriting results improved $126 with a corresponding 6.1 point
decrease in the combined ratio for the year ended December 31, 2004, primarily due to underwriting
improvement in all lines of business. The improvement in casualty, bond and professional liability
was due to earned pricing increases exceeding loss costs. The improvement in property was due to
low non-catastrophe property losses, despite the decline in earned pricing. The expense ratio for
the year ended December 31, 2004 decreased over the prior year expense ratio due primarily to
earned premium growth.

2003 Compared to 2002 —

Earned premiums increased $336, or 27%, for the year ended December 31,
2003, primarily due to earned premium growth in the property, casualty and professional liability
lines of business as a result of strong earned pricing increases. Written premiums increased
$250, or 18%, in 2003, primarily due to double-digit growth in casualty and professional liability.
Casualty and professional liability written premiums grew $114, or 21%, and $85, or 36%,
respectively, due to strong written pricing increases. Bond growth for the year was negatively
impacted by ceded reinstatement premium. While property pricing began to turn negative in the
latter half of 2003, written premiums in property increased $35 for the year ended December 31,
2003. Premium renewal retention for casualty, professional liability and bond was flat to slightly
higher from year to year, except for a decrease in renewal retention in property due to the decline
in pricing.

Underwriting results improved $4 for the year ended December 31, 2003, despite higher
catastrophe losses compared to unusually low catastrophe losses in the prior period and an increase
in loss reserve development that was driven by prior accident year loss reserve strengthening of
$20 in the bond and $25 in the professional liability lines of business. The bond reserve
strengthening is



isolated to a few severe contract surety claims related to accident year 2002.
The professional liability reserve strengthening involved a provision for anticipated settlements
of reinsurance obligations for contracts outstanding at the time of the original acquisition of
Reliance Group Holdings’ auto residual value portfolio in the third quarter of 2000. Excluding
catastrophes, property underwriting results continued to be favorable due to earned pricing
increases. Casualty continued to show underwriting improvement over the prior year due to a lower
loss ratio. The Specialty Commercial combined ratio improved 0.1 points for the year ended
December 31, 2003 as a result of strong earned pricing, higher ceding commissions in the
professional liability line of business and prudent expense management, partially offset by the
prior accident year reserve strengthening and increased catastrophe losses.

Outlook

Specialty Commercial is made up of a diverse group of businesses, each of which operates
independently with its own set of business objectives and focuses on the operational dynamics of
its specific industry. These businesses, while somewhat interrelated, each have a unique business
model and operating cycle. Given pricing declines in some markets, we anticipate negative written
premium growth for 2005. Although written price decreases for property and professional liability
are expected to continue in 2005, management expects written pricing increases in both casualty and
bond. We will continue to write and renew business where pricing and terms and conditions are
reasonable. Management will continue to take actions to maintain profitability, including
exercising underwriting discipline, maximizing growth in the segment’s most profitable lines,
providing innovative new products and expanding non-traditional distribution alternatives. In
2005, both the loss and loss adjustment expense ratio and the expense ratio will be impacted from
exiting the MPCI crop insurance business. The MPCI business made up
27.5% of the earned premium in
property for 2004 and had a higher loss ratio than the balance of the property business. The MPCI
business also had one of the lowest expense ratios in Specialty Commercial because of the
reimbursement of expenses from the Federal government under the MPCI program. As a result of
exiting the business, there will likely be an unfavorable impact to earned premium growth and the
expense ratio, offset by a favorable impact on the loss and loss adjustment expense ratio. In
addition, the non-renewal of an alternative markets insured program, representing $225 of earned
premium in 2004, will negatively impact casualty earned premium in 2005, but is not expected to
have a significant impact on underwriting results.

The Other Operations segment includes operations that are under a single management structure,
Heritage Holdings, which is responsible for two related activities. The first activity is the
management of certain subsidiaries and operations of The Hartford that have discontinued writing
new business. The second is the management of claims (and the associated reserves) related to
asbestos and environmental exposures. Effective January 1, 2004, the financial results of
HartRe assumed reinsurance are fully reported in Other Operations, and 2003 and 2002 financial
results have been restated to include HartRe assumed reinsurance.

2004 Compared to 2003 —

Earned premiums continue to decline as a result of the Company’s decision
to exit from the HartRe assumed domestic reinsurance business in the second quarter of 2003.
Underwriting losses decreased $2.4 billion for the year ended December 31, 2004, primarily due to
the impact of $2.6 billion of asbestos reserve strengthening in the first quarter 2003, and a
reduction in September 11 reserves of $97 in the first quarter of 2004. These favorable variances
were partially offset by the $170 strengthening of assumed reinsurance reserves, the $75
strengthening of environmental reserves in the third quarter of 2004, and the $181 provision
associated with the evaluation of the reinsurance recoverable asset in the second quarter of 2004.

2003 Compared to 2002 —

The decline in earned premiums was primarily due to the Company’s decision
to exit the HartRe assumed domestic reinsurance business. The underwriting loss was driven by the
first quarter net asbestos reserve strengthening of $2.6 billion as discussed in the section that
follows.

The paragraphs that follow are background information and a discussion of asbestos and
environmental claims, the deteriorating trends with respect to asbestos, and a summary of the
Company’s detailed study of asbestos reserves.

Asbestos and Environmental Claims

The Hartford continues to receive claims that assert damages from asbestos-related and
environmental-related exposures. Asbestos claims relate primarily to bodily injuries asserted by
those who came in contact with asbestos or products containing asbestos. Environmental claims
relate primarily to pollution and related clean-up costs.



The Hartford wrote several different categories of insurance coverage to which asbestos and
environmental claims may apply. First, The Hartford wrote primary policies providing the first
layer of coverage in an insured’s liability program. Second, The Hartford wrote excess policies
providing higher layers of coverage for losses that exhaust the limits of underlying coverage.
Third, The
Hartford acted as a reinsurer assuming a portion of risks previously assumed by other insurers
writing primary, excess and reinsurance coverages. Fourth, The Hartford participated in the London
Market, writing both direct insurance and assumed reinsurance business.

With regard to both environmental and particularly asbestos claims, significant uncertainty limits
the ability of insurers and reinsurers to estimate the ultimate reserves necessary for unpaid
losses and related expenses. Traditional actuarial reserving techniques cannot reasonably estimate
the ultimate cost of these claims, particularly during periods where theories of law are in flux.
The degree of variability of reserve estimates for these exposures is significantly greater than
for other more traditional exposures. In particular, The Hartford believes there is a high degree
of uncertainty inherent in the estimation of asbestos loss reserves.

In the case of the reserves for asbestos exposures, factors contributing to the high degree of
uncertainty include inadequate loss development patterns, plaintiffs’ expanding theories of
liability, the risks inherent in major litigation, and inconsistent emerging legal doctrines.
Furthermore, over time, insurers, including The Hartford, have experienced significant changes in
the rate at which asbestos claims are brought, the claims experience of particular insureds, and
the value of claims, making predictions of future exposure from past experience uncertain. For
example, in the past few years, insurers in general, including The Hartford, have experienced an
increase in the number of asbestos-related claims due to, among other things, plaintiffs’ increased
focus on new and previously peripheral defendants, and an increase in the number of insureds
seeking bankruptcy protection as a result of asbestos-related liabilities. Plaintiffs and insureds
have sought to use bankruptcy proceedings, including “pre-packaged” bankruptcies, to accelerate and
increase loss payments by insurers. In addition, some policyholders have asserted new classes of
claims for so-called “non-products” coverages to which an aggregate limit of liability may not
apply. Further uncertainties include insolvencies of other carriers and unanticipated
developments pertaining to The Hartford’s ability to recover reinsurance for asbestos and
environmental claims. Management believes these issues are not likely to be resolved in the near
future.

In the case of the reserves for environmental exposures, factors contributing to the high degree of
uncertainty include expanding theories of liabilities and damages; the risks inherent in major
litigation; inconsistent decisions concerning the existence and scope of coverage for environmental
claims; and uncertainty as to the monetary amount being sought by the claimant from the insured.

It is also not possible to predict changes in the legal and legislative environment and their
impact on the future development of asbestos and environmental claims. It is unknown whether
potential Federal asbestos-related legislation will be enacted, and if so, what its effect will be
on The Hartford’s aggregate asbestos liabilities.

The reporting pattern for assumed reinsurance claims is much longer than for direct claims. In many
instances, it takes months or years to determine that the policyholder’s own obligations have been
met and how the reinsurance in question may apply to such claims. The delay in reporting
reinsurance claims and exposures adds to the uncertainty of estimating the related reserves.

Given the factors and emerging trends described above, The Hartford believes the actuarial tools
and other techniques it employs to estimate the ultimate cost of claims for more traditional kinds
of insurance exposure are less precise in estimating reserves for its asbestos and environmental
exposures. For this reason, The Hartford relies on exposure-based analysis to estimate the
ultimate costs of these claims and regularly evaluates new information in assessing its potential
asbestos and environmental exposures.

The process of estimating asbestos and environmental reserves remains subject to a wide variety of
uncertainties, which are detailed in Note 12 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The
Company believes that its current asbestos and environmental reserves are reasonable and
appropriate. However, analyses of future developments could cause The Hartford to change its
estimates and ranges of its asbestos and environmental reserves, and the effect of these changes could be
material to the Company’s consolidated operating results, financial condition and liquidity.

Reserve Activity

Reserves and reserve activity in the Other Operations segment are categorized and reported as
asbestos, environmental or “all other” activity. The following discussion relates to reserves and
reserve activity, net of applicable reinsurance.

There are a wide variety of claims that drive the reserves within each category of Other
Operations. Asbestos claims relate primarily to bodily injury claims asserted by those who came in
contact with asbestos or products containing asbestos. Environmental claims relate primarily to
pollution and related clean-up costs. The “all other” category of reserves covers a wide range of
insurance and assumed reinsurance coverages, including, but not limited to, potential liability for
breast implants, construction defects, lead paint, silica, pharmaceutical products, molestation and
other long-tail or late emerging liabilities.

The Other Operations book of business contains policies written from 1940s to 2003. With the
transfer of HartRe assumed reinsurance into Other Operations in both 2002 and 2004, Other
Operations has exposure related to more recent assumed casualty reinsurance reserves, particularly
for the underwriting years 1997 through 2001. The Hartford’s experience has been that
this book of runoff business has over time produced significantly higher claims and losses than
were contemplated at inception. The areas of active claim activity have also shifted based on
changes in plaintiff focus and the overall litigation environment. A significant portion of the
claim reserves of the Other Operations segment relates to exposure to the insurance businesses of
other insurers or reinsurers (“whole account” exposure). Many of these whole account exposures
arise from reinsurance agreements previously written by The



Hartford. The Hartford’s net exposure
in these arrangements has increased for a variety of reasons, including The Hartford’s commutation
of previous retrocessions of such business. Due to the reporting practices of cedants to their
reinsurers, determination of
the nature of the individual risks involved in these whole account exposures (such as asbestos,
environmental, or other exposures) requires various assumptions and estimates, which are subject to
uncertainty, as previously discussed.

During 2002, as part of the Company’s ongoing monitoring of reserves, the Company reclassified $600
of reserves from the all other reserve category, of which $540 was reclassified to asbestos and $60
was reclassified to environmental claim reserves. The increase in reserves categorized as
environmental of $60 occurred because the reviews, in each of the two categories of claims,
employed actuarial techniques to analyze distinct and non-overlapping blocks of reserves and
associated exposures. Facts and circumstances associated with each block determined the resulting
changes in category. A portion of the 2002 reclassification relates to re-estimates of the
appropriate allocation among the asbestos, environmental and all other categories of the aggregate
reserves (net of reinsurance) carried for certain assumed reinsurance, commuted cessions and
commuted retrocessions of whole account business. As part of the 2002 reclassification, The
Hartford also revised formulas that it will use to allocate (among the asbestos, environmental and
all other categories) future claim payments for which reinsurance arrangements were commuted and to
allocate claim payments made to effect commutations. As a result of these revisions, payments
categorized as asbestos and environmental exposures will be higher in future periods than in prior
periods.

In December 2002, Halliburton announced its intention to file a pre-packaged bankruptcy plan
through one or more subsidiaries and in January 2003, Honeywell announced that it had reached an
agreement with the plaintiffs’ bar that would enable it to file a pre-negotiated plan through its
former NARCO subsidiary, then already in bankruptcy. In January 2003, Congoleum, a floor tile
manufacturer, which previously had defended claims successfully in the tort system, announced its
intention to file a pre-packaged plan of reorganization to be funded almost entirely with insurance
proceeds. Moreover, prominent members of the plaintiffs’ and policyholders’ bars announced
publicly their intention to file many more such plans. These events represented a worsening of
conditions the Company observed in 2002.

In the first quarter of 2003, several events occurred that in the Company’s view confirmed the
existence of a substantial long-term deterioration in the asbestos litigation environment. For
example, in February 2003, Combustion Engineering, long a major asbestos defendant, filed a
pre-packaged bankruptcy plan under which it proposed to emerge from bankruptcy within five weeks,
before opponents of the plan could have a meaningful opportunity to object, and included many novel
features in its plan that its insurers found objectionable.

As a result of these worsening conditions, the Company conducted a comprehensive, ground-up study
of its asbestos exposures in the first quarter of 2003 in an effort to project, beginning at the
individual account level, the effect of these trends on the Company’s estimated total exposure to
asbestos liability. Based on the Company’s evaluation of the deteriorating conditions described
above, the Company strengthened its gross and net asbestos reserves by $3.9 billion and $2.6
billion, respectively. The reserve strengthening related primarily to policies effective in 1985 or
prior years. The Company had incorporated an absolute asbestos exclusion in most of its general
liability policies written after 1985.

During the first quarter of 2004, the Company completed an updated gross asbestos reserve
evaluation. As part of this evaluation, the Company reviewed all of its open direct domestic
insurance accounts exposed to asbestos liability as well as assumed reinsurance accounts and
certain closed accounts. The Company also examined its London Market exposures for both direct
insurance and assumed reinsurance. The evaluation indicated no change in the overall required
gross asbestos reserves. During the second quarter of 2004, the Company completed an evaluation of
the reinsurance recoverables associated with older, long-term casualty liabilities reported in the
Other Operations segment, including asbestos liabilities. In conducting its Other Operations
reinsurance recoverable review, the Company used its most recent detailed studies of gross
asbestos, environmental and all other liabilities reported in the segment, including its estimate
of the type and potential timing of future claims, and analyzed the legal entities through which
each exposed coverage was written, the reinsurance arrangements in place at each of these legal
entities and the years of potential reinsurance available. As part of its Other Operations
reinsurance recoverable review, the Company also analyzed recent developments in commutation
activity between reinsurers and cedants, recent trends in arbitration and litigation outcomes in
disputes between cedants and reinsurers and the overall credit quality of the Company’s
reinsurers. As a result of this evaluation, the Company reduced its estimated net reinsurance
recoverable by $181, which was comprised of a $126 reduction of ceded amounts and a $55 increase
in the allowance for uncollectible reinsurance. The after-tax effect of this action was $118.
The Company also consolidated within the “all other” category its allowance for insolvencies and
disputes that might affect reinsurance coverage associated with Other Operations into a single
allowance. As of December 31, 2004, the allowance for uncollectible reinsurance totals $314.

In the third quarter of 2004, The Hartford completed an account-by-account review of its
environmental exposures. During the course of this review, the Company found estimates for
individual cases changed based upon the particular circumstances of each account, although the
review found no apparent overarching cause or change in the claim environment. The net effect of
these changes resulted in a $75 before tax increase in gross and net environmental liabilities.

In the fourth quarter of 2004, the Company completed a review of its non-asbestos and environmental
exposures in Other Operations. As a result of this review, the Company increased its assumed
casualty reinsurance reserves by $40. For the year ended December 31, 2004, assumed casualty
reinsurance reserves were strengthened by a total of $170, including $130 of strengthening in the
first quarter and $40 in the fourth quarter.



Consistent with the Company’s long-standing reserving practices, The Hartford will continue to
review and monitor these reserves regularly and, where future developments indicate, make
appropriate adjustments to the reserves. The loss reserving assumptions, drawn from both industry
data and the Company’s experience, have been applied over time to all of this business and have
resulted in
reserve strengthening or reserve releases at various times over the past decade. The Company
believes that its current asbestos and environmental reserves are reasonable and appropriate.
However, analyses of future developments could cause The Hartford to
change its estimates and ranges of its
asbestos and environmental reserves, and the effect of these changes could be material to the
Company’s consolidated operating results, financial condition and liquidity. Currently, the
Company expects to perform an asbestos study in the second quarter of 2005 and an environmental
study in the third quarter of 2005. In addition, the Company currently expects to perform a
comprehensive review of Other Operations reinsurance recoverables at least annually. At any time
there are significant developments that affect particular exposures, reinsurance arrangements or
the financial condition of particular reinsurers, the Company will respond by making adjustments
in the portion of liabilities it expects to cede or in its allowance for uncollectible
reinsurance.

The following table presents reserve activity, inclusive of estimates for both reported and
incurred but not reported claims, net of reinsurance, for Other Operations, categorized by
asbestos, environmental and all other claims, for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002.
Also included are the remaining asbestos and environmental exposures of Ongoing Operations.

At December 31, 2004, asbestos reserves were $2.5 billion, a decrease of $1.3 billion compared
to $3.8 billion as of December 31, 2003. The decrease in asbestos reserves was due primarily to the
MacArthur settlement payment made in the first quarter of 2004. At December 31, 2003, asbestos
reserves were $3.8 billion, an increase of $2.7 billion compared to $1.1 billion as of December 31,
2002. Net incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses were $2.6 billion for the year ended
December 31, 2003. The increase in reserves for 2003 as well as the increase in paid losses
reflect asbestos claim and litigation trends.

The Company classifies its asbestos and environmental reserves into three categories: direct
insurance; assumed reinsurance and London Market. Direct insurance includes primary and excess
coverage. Assumed reinsurance includes both “treaty” reinsurance (covering broad categories of
claims or blocks of business) and “facultative” reinsurance (covering specific risks or individual
policies of primary or excess insurance companies). London Market business includes the business
written by one or more of The Hartford’s subsidiaries in the United Kingdom, which are no longer
active in the insurance or reinsurance business. Such business includes both direct insurance and
assumed reinsurance.



Of these three categories, direct policies tend to have the greatest factual developments from
which to estimate the Company’s exposures. Over the last three years, including the current
reporting period, the Company experienced a reduction in newly reported environmental claims on
direct business, and actual claim payments have been made at levels within the Company’s previously
established provisions for loss. However, with respect to asbestos claims, the Company experienced
a variety of negative trends,
including increasing numbers of policyholders making claims, an apparent increase in the number of
claimants under such policies, and an accelerated rate of policyholder bankruptcies.

Assumed reinsurance exposures are inherently less predictable than direct insurance exposures
because the Company may not receive notice of a reinsurance claim until the underlying direct
insurance claim is mature. This causes a delay in the receipt of information at the reinsurer
level reflecting changes in the asbestos tort litigation and direct insurance coverage
environments.

Estimating liabilities for London Market business is the most uncertain of the three categories of
claims (direct, assumed reinsurance and London Market). As a participant in the London Market
(comprised of both Lloyd’s of London and London Company Markets), the Company wrote business on a
subscription basis, with the Company’s involvement being limited to a relatively small percentage
of a total contract placement. Claims are reported, via a broker, to the “lead” underwriter and,
once agreed to, are presented to the following markets for concurrence. This reporting and claim
agreement process makes estimating liabilities for this business the most uncertain of the three
categories of claims.

On December 19, 2003, Hartford Accident and Indemnity Co. (“Hartford A&I”) entered into a
settlement agreement with MacArthur Co. and its subsidiary, Western MacArthur Co. Under the
settlement agreement, during the first quarter of 2004, Hartford A&I paid $1.15 billion into an
escrow account owned by Hartford A&I. The funds were held in the escrow account until conditions
precedent to the settlement occurred in April. On April 22, 2004, the funds were disbursed from
the escrow account into a trust established for the benefit of present and future asbestos
claimants pursuant to the bankruptcy plan. The settlement payments were accounted for as a
reduction in unpaid claim and claim adjustment expenses during the first quarter of 2004.

For the past three years, direct paid loss and expense for environmental claims have declined. The
vast majority of these payments have been made under settlement agreements that fully resolve The
Hartford’s exposure to these insureds for environmental liabilities.

The following table sets forth, for the three years ended December 31, 2004, paid and incurred loss
activity by the three categories of claims for asbestos and environmental.

Outlook

The Other Operations segment will continue to manage the discontinued operations of The Hartford as
well as claims (and associated reserves) related to asbestos and environmental exposure. The
Hartford will continue to review various components of all of its reserves on a regular basis.



INVESTMENTS

General

The Hartford’s investment portfolios are primarily divided between Life and Property & Casualty.
The investment portfolios of Life and Property & Casualty are managed by Hartford Investment
Management Company (“HIM”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of The Hartford. HIM manages the portfolios
to maximize economic value, while attempting to generate the income necessary to support the
Company’s various product obligations, within internally established objectives, guidelines and
risk tolerances. The portfolio objectives and guidelines are developed based upon the
asset/liability profile, including duration, convexity and other characteristics within specified
risk tolerances. The risk tolerances considered include, for example, asset and credit issuer
allocation limits, maximum portfolio below investment grade (“BIG”) holdings and foreign currency
exposure. The Company attempts to minimize adverse impacts to the portfolio and the results of
operations due to changes in economic conditions through asset allocation limits, asset/liability
duration matching and through the use of derivatives. (For a further discussion of how the
investment portfolio’s credit and market risks are assessed and managed, see the Investment Credit
Risk and Capital Markets Risk Management sections of the MD&A.)

HIM’s security selection process is a multi-dimensional approach that combines independent internal
credit research along with a macro economic outlook of technical trends (e.g. interest rates, slope
of the yield curve and credit spreads) and market pricing to identify valuation inefficiencies and
relative value buying and selling opportunities. Security selection and monitoring is performed by
asset class specialists working within dedicated portfolio management teams.

HIM portfolio managers may sell securities, except those securities in an unrealized loss position
for which the Company has indicated its intent and ability to hold until the price recovers, due to
portfolio guidelines or market technicals or trends. For example, the Company may sell securities
to capture market valuation inefficiencies or relative value opportunities through security or
sector rotation, to remain compliant with internal asset/liability duration matching guidelines
often times a result of changes in interest rates, or to modify a portfolio’s duration to
capitalize on interest rate levels or yield curve slope.

HIM believes that advantageously buying and selling securities within a structured purchasing,
monitoring and selling framework, provides the greatest economic value for the Company over the
long-term.

Pursuant to the adoption of SOP 03-1, as discussed in Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements, on January 1, 2004, the Company reclassified $18.1 billion of separate account assets
to the general account. Of this amount, $11.7 billion was associated with guaranteed separate
accounts and was primarily comprised of fixed maturities. These assets are classified as
available-for-sale securities with changes in fair value reported in other comprehensive income.
In addition, $6.2 billion is primarily comprised of equity securities related to variable annuity
products offered in Japan. These assets are classified as trading securities with changes in fair
value reported in net investment income. The remaining amount of $200 related to policy loans on
private placement life insurance products.

Return on general account invested assets is an important element of The Hartford’s financial
results. Significant fluctuations in the fixed income or equity markets could weaken the Company’s
financial condition or its results of operations. Additionally, changes in market interest rates
may impact the period of time over which certain investments, such as mortgage-backed securities,
are repaid and whether certain investments are called by the issuers. Such changes may, in turn,
impact the yield on these investments and also may result in reinvestment of funds received from
calls and prepayments at rates below the average portfolio yield. Net investment income and net
realized capital gains and losses accounted for approximately 24%, 19% and 16% of the Company’s
consolidated revenues for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The
increase in the percentage of consolidated revenues for 2004, as compared to the prior years, is
primarily due to income earned on separate account assets reclassified to the general account as a
result of the adoption of SOP 03-1.

Fluctuations in interest rates affect the Company’s return on, and the fair value of, general
account fixed maturity investments, which comprised approximately 80% and 93% of the fair value of
its invested assets as of December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Other events beyond the
Company’s control could also adversely impact the fair value of these investments. Specifically, a
downgrade of an issuer’s credit rating or default of payment by an issuer could reduce the
Company’s investment return.

The Company invests in private placement securities, mortgage loans and limited partnership
arrangements in order to further diversify its investment portfolio. These investment types
comprised approximately 16% and 17% of the fair value of its invested assets as of December 31,
2004 and 2003, respectively. These security types are typically less liquid than direct
investments in publicly traded fixed income or equity investments. However, generally these
securities have higher yields to compensate for the liquidity risk.

A decrease in the fair value of any investment that is deemed other-than-temporary would result in
the Company’s recognition of a net realized capital loss in its financial results prior to the
actual sale of the investment. (For a further discussion of the evaluation of other-than-temporary
impairments, see the Critical Accounting Estimates section of the MD&A under “Valuation of
Investments and Derivative Instruments and Evaluation of Other-Than-Temporary Impairments”.)



Life

The primary investment objective of Life’s general account is to maximize after-tax returns
consistent with acceptable risk parameters, including the management of the interest rate
sensitivity of invested assets and the generation of sufficient liquidity relative to that of
policyholder and corporate obligations, as discussed in the Capital Markets Risk Management section
of the MD&A under “Market Risk — Life”.

The following table identifies the invested assets by type held in the general account as of
December 31, 2004 and 2003.

adoption of SOP 03-1 coupled with positive operating cash flow.

Mortgage loans increased $457, or 98%, since December 31, 2003, as a result of a decision to
increase Life’s investment in this asset class primarily due to its attractive yields and
diversification opportunities.

[1] Represents the change in value of securities classified as trading.

[2] Represents annualized net investment income (excluding the change in fair value of trading securities) divided by the
monthly weighted average invested assets at cost or amortized cost, as applicable, excluding trading securities and the
collateral received associated with the securities lending program. Also, for 2003, the fixed maturities associated
with the acquisition of CNA’s group life and accident, long-term and short-term disability and certain specialty
businesses are excluded from the weighted average invested assets.

[3] Primarily consists of changes in fair value on non-qualifying derivatives and hedge ineffectiveness on qualifying
derivative instruments, as well as, the amortization of deferred acquisition costs.

2004 Compared to 2003 —

Net investment income, excluding income on policy loans and trading
securities, increased $859, or 47%, compared to the prior year. The increase in net investment
income was primarily due to income earned on a higher average invested assets base, as compared to
the prior year, and an increase in income from prepayment penalties primarily associated with
commercial mortgage-backed securities (“CMBS”) and yield adjustments related to changes in
prepayment speeds associated with mortgage-backed securities (“MBS”) held at a premium or discount.
These increases were partially offset by a decrease in the average new invested asset yield and
the repositioning of the portfolio into higher quality assets as described below.

The increase in the average invested assets base, as compared to the prior year, was primarily the
result of separate account assets reclassified to the general account pursuant to the adoption of
SOP 03-1 and, to a lesser extent, assets acquired in the CNA acquisition and operating cash flows.
Income earned on separate account assets reclassified to the general account, excluding trading
securities, was $619 for 2004. Income earned on assets acquired in the CNA transaction was $116
for 2004.



During 2004, the yield on average invested assets decreased from the prior year as a result of new
investment purchases at rates below the average portfolio yield due to the continued low interest
rate environment and decreased policy loan income. Since the Company invests primarily in
long-term fixed rate debt securities, current period changes in long-term interest rates impact the
yield on new asset purchases and, therefore, have a gradual impact on the overall portfolio yield.
The weighted average yield on new invested asset purchases in 2004 of approximately 4.9%,
before-tax, continues to be below the average portfolio yield. Life expects the average before-tax
new investment yields in 2005 to range from 4.8% to 5.0%. If future interest rates differ from the
forward rates as of December 31, 2004, the actual average new investment yields may be
significantly different than yields currently expected.

Net realized capital gains during 2004 increased by $109 compared to the prior year, primarily the
result of lower other-than-temporary impairments. (For further discussion of other-than-temporary
impairments, see the Other-Than-Temporary Impairments commentary in this section of the MD&A.)

In 2004, gross gains were realized as fixed maturity credit spreads tightened and portions of the
Life portfolios were repositioned into higher quality assets where HIM believed greater relative
value existed. Credit spreads tightened primarily due to improved credit quality, market liquidity
and demand for higher yielding assets, as well as the relatively low interest rate environment. It
is expected that the higher quality assets will provide greater liquidity if the credit environment
and issuer default rates return to historical norms. In addition, foreign government securities
were sold, primarily in the first and fourth quarters of 2004, to reduce the portfolios’ exposure
to foreign holdings and realize gains associated with the decline in value of the U.S. dollar
against foreign currencies.

In 2004, securities sold at a loss were predominantly corporate securities, U.S. government
securities, certain asset-backed securities (“ABS”) and CMBS with no single security sold at a loss
in excess of $5 and an average loss as a percentage of the fixed maturity’s amortized cost of less
than 5%, which under the Company’s current impairment policy, were deemed to be depressed only to a
minor extent. In 2003, no single security was sold at a loss in excess of $8.

2003 Compared to 2002

— Net investment income, excluding policy loan income, increased $236, or
15%, compared to the prior year. The increase was primarily due to income earned on a higher
invested asset base partially offset by lower investment yields. Policy loan income decreased
primarily due to the decline in leveraged COLI policies, as a result of surrender activity and
lower sales. Yield on average invested assets decreased as a result of lower rates on new
investment purchases and decreased policy loan income.

Net realized capital gains (losses) for 2003 increased by $348 compared to the prior year,
primarily as a result of net gains on sales of fixed maturities and a decrease in
other-than-temporary impairments on fixed maturities. Sales were the result of normal trading
activity and were primarily attributable to the improvement in the corporate credit environment,
general economic conditions and operating fundamentals, the decrease in interest rates and improved
pricing levels for ABS. (For a further discussion of other-than-temporary impairments, see the
Other-Than-Temporary Impairments commentary in this section of the MD&A.)

Separate Account Products

Separate account products are those for which a separate investment and liability account is
maintained on behalf of the policyholder. Prior to January 1, 2004, the Company’s separate accounts
reflected two categories of risk assumption: non-guaranteed separate accounts wherein the
policyholder assumes substantially all the risk and reward; and guaranteed separate accounts
wherein the Company contractually guarantees either a minimum return or the account value to the
policyholder. Effective January 1, 2004, the guaranteed separate accounts are included with
general account assets pursuant to SOP 03-1. As of December 31, 2004, the Company’s separate
accounts totaled $140.0 billion. As of December 31, 2003, the Company’s total separate accounts
totaled $136.6 billion, of which $12.1 billion was guaranteed separate accounts.

Investment objectives for non-guaranteed separate accounts, which consist of the participants’
account balances, vary by fund account type, as outlined in the applicable fund prospectus or
separate account plan of operations. Separate account products include variable annuities,
variable universal life insurance contracts and variable COLI. The assets and liabilities
associated with variable annuity products sold in Japan do not meet the criteria to be recognized
as a separate account because the assets are not legally insulated from the Company. Therefore,
these assets are also included with general account assets effective January 1, 2004.

Products, previously recorded as guaranteed separate accounts but now recorded in the general
account upon adoption of SOP 03-1, primarily consist of modified guaranteed individual annuities
and modified guaranteed life insurance and generally include market value adjustment features and
surrender charges to mitigate the risk of disintermediation. The primary investment objective of
these assets is to maximize after-tax returns consistent with acceptable risk parameters, including
the management of the interest rate sensitivity of invested assets relative to that of policyholder
obligations, as discussed in the Capital Markets Risk Management section of the MD&A under “Market
Risk — Life”.



Property & Casualty

The investment objective for Property & Casualty’s ongoing operations is to maximize economic value
while generating after-tax income and sufficient liquidity to meet policyholder and corporate
obligations. For Property & Casualty’s Other Operations segment, the investment objective is to
ensure the full and timely payment of all liabilities. Property & Casualty’s investment strategies
are developed based on a variety of factors including business needs, regulatory requirements and
tax considerations.

2004 Compared to 2003

— Before-tax net investment income increased $76, or 6%, and after-tax
net investment income increased $43, or 5%, compared to the prior year. The increases in net
investment income were primarily due to income earned on a higher average invested assets base in
2004, as compared to prior year, partially offset by a decrease in the average new invested asset
yield and the repositioning of the portfolio into higher quality assets as described below.

In 2004, the yield on average invested assets decreased slightly from prior year as a result of new
investment purchases at rates below the average portfolio yield due to the continued low interest
rate environment. Since the Company invests primarily in long-term fixed rate debt securities,
current period changes in long-term interest rates impact the yield on new asset purchases and,
therefore, have a gradual impact on the overall portfolio yield. The weighted average yield on new
asset purchases in 2004 of approximately 4.9%, before-tax, continues to be below the average
portfolio yield. Property & Casualty expects the average before-tax new investment yields in 2005
to range from 4.8% to 5.0%. If future interest rates differ from the forward rates as of December
31, 2004, the actual average new investment yields may be significantly different from the yields
currently expected.

Net realized capital gains for 2004 decreased $120 as compared to the prior year as a result of
lower net realized gains on sales of fixed maturity securities, partially offset by lower
other-than-temporary impairments. (For further discussion of other-than-temporary impairments, see
the Other-Than-Temporary Impairments commentary in this section of the MD&A.)

In 2004, gross gains were realized as fixed maturity credit spreads tightened and portions of the
Property & Casualty portfolios were repositioned into higher quality assets where HIM believed
greater relative value existed. Credit spreads tightened primarily due to improved credit quality,
market liquidity and demand for higher yielding assets, as well as the relatively low interest rate
environment. It is expected that the higher quality assets will provide greater liquidity if the
credit environment and issuer default rates return to historical norms. In addition, foreign
government securities were sold, primarily in the first and fourth quarters of 2004, to reduce the



portfolios’ exposure to foreign holdings and realize gains associated with the decline in value of
the U.S. dollar against foreign currencies.

In 2004, securities sold at a loss were predominantly corporate securities, U.S. government
securities, certain ABS and CMBS with no single security sold at a loss in excess of $5 and an
average loss as a percentage of the fixed maturity’s amortized cost of less than 5%, which under
the Company’s current impairment policy were deemed to be depressed only to a minor extent. In
2003, no Property & Casualty security was sold at a loss in excess of $10.

2003 Compared to 2002

— Before-tax net investment income increased $112, or 11%, and after-tax net
investment income increased $69, or 8%, compared to the prior year. The increases in net
investment income were primarily due to income earned on a higher invested asset base partially
offset by lower investment yields. Yields on average invested assets decreased from the prior year
as a result of lower rates on new investment purchases.

Net realized capital gains (losses) for 2003 improved by $321 compared to the prior year. The
improvement was primarily the result of net gains on sales of fixed maturity investments, Trumbull
Associates, LLC and a decrease in other-than-temporary impairments. In the first half of 2003,
interest rates fell to historical lows, the yield curve steepened and credit spreads rallied
significantly. The portfolio was repositioned to realize the available gains, modestly move out
the yield curve and improve statutory surplus. This strategy resulted in approximately $175 of
before-tax gains but adversely impacted Property & Casualty’s before-tax net investment income in
2004 by approximately 8 basis points. (For a further discussion of other-than-temporary
impairments, see the Other-Than-Temporary Impairments commentary in this section of the MD&A.)

Corporate

The investment objective of Corporate is to raise capital through financing activities to support
the Life and Property & Casualty operations of the Company and to maintain sufficient funds to
support the cost of those financing activities including the payment of interest for Hartford
Financial Services Group, Inc. (“HFSG”) issued debt and dividends to shareholders of The Hartford
common stock. As of December 31, 2004 and 2003, Corporate held $159 and $86, respectively, of
short-term fixed maturity investments. In addition, Corporate held $7 and $2, respectively, of
other investments as of December 31, 2004 and 2003.

Investment Management Activities

During 2004, HIM issued one and began serving as the collateral asset manager for two additional
synthetic collateralized loan obligations (“CLOs”), which invest in senior secured bank loans
through total return swaps (“referenced bank loan portfolios”). The notional value of the
referenced bank loan portfolios from the three synthetic CLOs as of December 31, 2004 was $1.1
billion. The synthetic CLOs issued approximately $185 of notes and preferred shares (“CLO
issuances”), approximately $170 of which was to third party investors. The proceeds from the CLO
issuances were invested in collateral accounts consisting of high credit quality securities that
were pledged to the referenced bank loan portfolios’ swap counterparties. Investors in the CLO
issuances receive the net proceeds from the referenced bank loan portfolios. Any principal losses
incurred by the swap counterparties associated with the referenced bank loan portfolios are borne
by the CLO issuances investors through the total return swaps.

Pursuant to the requirements of FIN 46R, the Company has concluded that the three synthetic CLOs
are variable interest entities (“VIEs”) and for the CLO issued in 2004, the Company is the primary
beneficiary and must consolidate this CLO. Accordingly, the Company has recorded in the
consolidated balance sheets $65 of cash and invested assets, total return swaps with a fair value
of $3 in other assets, which reference a bank loan portfolio with a maximum notional of $400, and
$52 in other liabilities related to the CLO issuances. The total return from the referenced bank
loan portfolio of $3 was received via the total return swap and recorded in realized capital gains
and losses. Income from the fixed maturity collateral account and CLO issuance investor payments
were recorded in net investment income in the consolidated statements of operations. The Company’s
investment in the consolidated synthetic CLO issuance is $14, which is its maximum exposure to
loss. Of the two non-consolidated synthetic CLOs, the Company has a $2 preferred share investment
in one of the CLO issuances, which is its maximum exposure to loss. The investors in the three
synthetic CLO issuances have recourse only to the VIE assets and not to the general credit of the
Company. The collateral management fees earned by HIM for the two non-consolidated synthetic CLOs
totaled $3 for the year ended December 31, 2004 and are reported in other income in the
consolidated statements of operations.

Other-Than-Temporary Impairments

The Company has a security monitoring process overseen by a committee of investment and accounting
professionals that, on a quarterly basis, identifies securities that could potentially be
other-than-temporarily impaired. When a security is deemed to be other-than-temporarily impaired
its carrying amount is written-down to current market value and a realized loss is recorded in the
Company’s consolidated statements of operations. (For further discussion regarding the Company’s
other-than-temporary impairment policy, see “Valuation of Investments and Derivative Instruments
and Evaluation of Other-Than-Temporary Impairments” included in the Critical Accounting Estimates
section of the MD&A and Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.)

The decrease in other-than-temporary impairments during 2003 and 2004 in comparison to 2002 levels
is due to an improvement in the corporate credit environment, general economic conditions and
operating fundamentals, and improved pricing levels for ABS. In general, security issuers’
operating fundamentals have improved due to reduced company leverage, improved liquidity and the
successful implementation of various cost cutting measures. Improvement in pricing levels for ABS
has been driven by a general stabilization in the performance of the underlying collateral and an
increase in demand for these asset types due to improved economic and operating fundamentals of the
underlying security issuers, better market liquidity and attractive yields. The following
discussion provides an analysis of significant other-than-temporary impairments recognized during
2004, 2003 and 2002, the related circumstances giving rise to the other-than-temporary impairments
and the potential impact such circumstances may have on other material investments held.


During 2004 there were no significant other-than-temporary impairments (e.g. $15 or greater)
recorded on any single security or issuer. In aggregate, other-than-temporary impairments recorded
on ABS primarily relate to the decline in market values of certain previously impaired securities.
Other-than-temporary impairments recorded on equity securities primarily related to variable rate
perpetual preferred securities issued by two highly rated financial services companies. These
securities are variable rate securities with unique structural interest rate reset characteristics
that have sustained a decline in market value for an extended period of time primarily as a result
of the increase in short-term interest rates after the security’s interest rate reset period. As
of December 31, 2004, the Company did not hold other perpetual preferred securities in an
unrealized loss position with similar interest rate reset characteristics.


During 2003, other-than-temporary impairments were primarily recorded on ABS, corporate fixed
maturities and equity securities. The ABS other-than-temporary impairments were primarily due to
the continued deterioration of the underlying collateral supporting the various transactions. A
significant portion of corporate fixed maturity other-than-temporary impairments during 2003
resulted from various issuers who experienced fraud or accounting irregularities. In addition,
during the first half of the year, corporate debt issuers in the transportation sector,
specifically issuers in the airline sector, deteriorated as a result of the continued decline in
airline travel. During 2003, there was one security for which a significant (e.g. $15 or greater)
other-than-temporary impairment was recorded, the circumstances of which are discussed in more
detail below.



•

The $25 of impairments on corporate fixed maturities within the food and beverage sector
related to securities issued by the Italian dairy concern, Parmalat SpA. Parmalat filed for
bankruptcy in December 2003 due to liquidity problems when it was discovered that 4 billion
euros of liquid investments previously reported on its balance sheet were non-existent.

The following list identifies ABS and equity impairment losses recognized in 2003 that by issuer
did not exceed $15 but did when combined with securities supported with similar collateral or
equity security types. The circumstances giving rise to those losses are as follows:

•

The $31 of CDO other-than-temporary impairments consisted of
approximately ten securities, the majority of which were interests
in the lower tranches of securities backed by high yield corporate
debt. These impairments were primarily the result of continued
high default rates in 2003 and lower recovery rates on the CDO’s
underlying collateral.

•

The $29 of other-than-temporary impairments recognized on ABS
supported by aircraft lease receivables primarily consisted of
investments in lower tranches of five transactions. These
securities are supported by aircraft leases and enhanced equipment
trust certificates (together, “aircraft lease receivables”) issued
by multiple airlines that had sustained a steep decline in market
value and adverse change in expected cash flows due to continued
lower aircraft lease rates, airline bankruptcies and the prolonged
decline in airline travel.

•

The $30 of the other-than-temporary impairments recorded on equity
securities primarily related to various diversified mutual funds.
The market values of these funds had fallen since the date of
purchase due to declines in primarily the equity markets and were
not expected to recover within a reasonable period of time. Due
to the severity of the price depression and length of time the
holdings were in an unrealized loss position, these securities
were deemed to be other-than-temporarily impaired.

In addition to the impairments described above, fixed maturity and equity securities were sold at
losses during 2003, with no single security sold at a loss in excess of $10.


During 2002, other-than-temporary impairments on ABS were primarily driven by collateral
deterioration associated with securities backed by aircraft lease receivables and high yield debt.
Impairments recognized on corporate fixed maturities were concentrated in the technology and
communications sector and were primarily driven by weakening economic conditions and operating
fundamentals in the sector. Other-than-temporary impairments were also recorded on equity
securities, the majority of which related to various diversified mutual funds. The market values
of these funds had fallen since the date of purchase due to declines in the bond and equity markets
and were not expected to recover within a reasonable period of time. Due to severity of the price
depression and length of time the holdings were in an unrealized loss position, these securities
were deemed to be other-than-temporarily impaired. During 2002, there were 8 securities for which
a significant (e.g. $15 or greater) other-than-temporary impairment was recorded which are
discussed in more detail below.

•

Of the technology and communications sector impairments, $110
related to securities issued by WorldCom and its subsidiary MCI,
which filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in July 2002 as a
result of liquidity problems driven by economic and operating
weakness in this sector, and specific issues related to accounting
fraud.

•

Of the $84 of impairments relating to ABS backed by aircraft lease
receivables, $41 related to investments in the lower tranches of
one transaction that experienced a steep decline in fair value as
a result of a significant decrease in aircraft lease payments and
lower appraised values on the underlying collateral. This
transaction was primarily supported by lower quality aircraft and
was significantly impacted by the decline in airline travel and
numerous airline bankruptcies resulting from the catastrophic
events of September 11, 2001. The remaining $43 of impairments on
aircraft lease receivables were primarily related to two other
transactions that were also adversely impacted by similar
circumstances surrounding the airline industry in 2002.

•

In the technology and telecommunications sector, $32 of
impairments were recognized on fixed maturity securities issued by
a major U.S. telecom equipment manufacturer. This issuer had
amassed high levels of debt to acquire assets and subsequently
experienced liquidity difficulties due to the downturn in demand
and economic conditions within the technology and
telecommunications sector. As a result, this issuer initiated a
debt restructuring in 2002.

•

Of the impairments recognized on ABS securities backed by MH
receivables, $21 related to three securities issued by the same
transaction. These securities were backed by the transaction
sponsor who ultimately filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection
as a result of numerous defaults on the underlying loans. The
manufactured housing sector experienced above average default
rates in 2002 primarily due to weak underwriting practices and
loan originators extending credit to sub-prime borrowers.

•

Another $15 of impairments in the technology and communications
sector related to a Canada based local and long-distance
communications carrier. As a result of excess capacity and margin
erosion within the long-distance sector, this issuer began to
experience liquidity problems and eventually filed for bankruptcy
in 2002.

•

Also within the technology and communications sector, $15 of the
impairments recognized related to a major U.S. local and
long-distance service provider. This issuer had amassed high
levels of debt to increase capacity and was significantly impacted
by reduced demand and margin erosion, particularly within the
long-distance sector. As a result, this issuer initiated a debt
restructuring in 2002.

The following identifies ABS impairment losses recognized in 2002 that by issuer did not exceed $15
but did when combined with securities supported with similar collateral. The circumstances giving
rise to those losses are as follows:



•

The $47 of CDO impairments consisted of approximately ten securities, the majority of which
were interests in the lower tranches of transactions backed by high yield corporate debt.
These impairments were primarily driven by deterioration in the underlying collateral
resulting from corporate bankruptcies and above average defaults on high yield bonds.

In addition to the impairments described above, fixed maturity and equity securities were sold at
losses during 2002, with no single security sold at a loss in excess of $13.

The favorable other-than-temporary impairments trend will depend on continued strong economic
fundamentals, political stability and collateral performance. In addition, as discussed in Note 1
of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, the future adoption of EITF Issue No. 03-1 could
result in the recognition of additional other-than-temporary impairments. While the ultimate
impact of the adoption of this standard is still unknown, depending on the nature of the ultimate
guidance, adoption of this standard could potentially result in the recognition of unrealized
losses, including those declines in value that are attributable to interest rate movements, as
other-than-temporary impairments, except those deemed to be minor in nature. As of December 31,
2004, the Company had $265 of total gross unrealized losses. The amount of impairments to be
recognized, if any, will depend on the final standard, market conditions and management’s intent
and ability to hold securities with unrealized losses at the time of the impairment evaluation.
(For further discussion of risk factors associated with sectors with significant unrealized loss
positions, see the sector risk factor commentary under the Consolidated Total Available-for-Sale
Securities with Unrealized Loss Greater than Six Months by Type schedule in the Investment Credit
Risk section of the MD&A.)

INVESTMENT CREDIT RISK

The Company has established investment credit policies that focus on the credit quality of obligors
and counterparties, limit credit concentrations, encourage diversification and require frequent
creditworthiness reviews. Investment activity, including setting of policy and defining acceptable
risk levels, is subject to regular review and approval by senior management and by the Finance
Committee of the Company’s Board of Directors.

The Company invests primarily in securities which are rated investment grade and has established
exposure limits, diversification standards and review procedures for all credit risks including
borrower, issuer and counterparty. Creditworthiness of specific obligors is determined by an
internal credit evaluation supplemented by consideration of external determinants of
creditworthiness, typically ratings assigned by nationally recognized ratings agencies. Obligor,
asset sector and industry concentrations are subject to established Company limits and monitored on
a regular basis.

The Company is not exposed to any credit concentration risk of a single issuer greater than 10% of
the Company’s stockholders’ equity other than certain U.S. government and government agencies.

Derivative Instruments

The Company’s derivative counterparty exposure policy establishes market-based credit limits,
favors long-term financial stability and creditworthiness and typically requires credit
enhancement/credit risk reducing agreements. Credit risk is measured as the amount owed to the
Company based on current market conditions and potential payment obligations between the Company
and its counterparties. Credit exposures are generally quantified daily, netted by counterparty
for each legal entity of the Company, and collateral is pledged to and held by, or on behalf of,
the Company to the extent the current value of derivatives exceeds the exposure policy thresholds
which do not exceed $10. The Company also minimizes the credit risk in derivative instruments by
entering into transactions with high quality counterparties rated Aa/A or better, which are
monitored by the Company’s internal compliance unit and reviewed frequently by senior management.
In addition, the compliance unit monitors counterparty credit exposure on a monthly basis to ensure
compliance with Company policies and statutory limitations. The Company also maintains a policy of
requiring that all derivative contracts be governed by an International Swaps and Dealers
Association Master Agreement which is structured by legal entity and by counterparty and permits
right of offset. To date, the Company has not incurred any losses on derivative instruments due to
counterparty nonperformance.

In addition to counterparty credit risk, the Company periodically enters into swap agreements in
which the Company assumes credit exposure from a single entity, referenced index or asset pool.
Total return swaps involve the periodic exchange of payments with other parties, at specified
intervals, calculated using the agreed upon index and notional principal amounts. Generally, no
cash or principal payments are exchanged at the inception of the contract. Typically, at the time
a swap is entered into, the cash flow streams exchanged by the counterparties are equal in value.

Credit default swaps involve a transfer of credit risk from one party to another in exchange for
periodic payments. One party to the contract will make a payment based on an agreed upon rate and
a notional amount. The second party, who assumes credit exposure will only make a payment when
there is a credit event, and such payment will be equal to the notional value of the swap contract
less the value of the referenced security issuer debt obligation. A credit event is generally
defined as default on contractually obligated interest or principal payments or bankruptcy. The
average S&P rating for these referenced security issuer debt obligations is A.

The Company also uses credit defaults swaps to reduce its credit exposure by entering into
agreements in which the Company pays a derivative counterparty a periodic fee in exchange for
compensation from the counterparty should a credit event occur on the part of the referenced
security issuer. The Company entered into these agreements as an efficient means to reduce credit
exposure to the specified issuers. The average S&P rating for all of these referenced securities
issuers is A-.



As of December 31, 2004 and 2003, the notional value of total return and credit default swaps
totaled $2.2 billion and $1.0 billion, respectively, and the swap fair value totaled $8 and $(33),
respectively.

Effective January 1, 2004, guaranteed separate account assets were included with general
account assets as a result of adopting SOP 03-1.

The Company’s fixed maturity portfolio gross unrealized gains and losses as of December 31,
2004 in comparison to December 31, 2003 were primarily impacted by changes in interest rates,
foreign currency exchange rates, credit spreads and security sales. The Company’s fixed maturity
gross unrealized gains decreased $107 from December 31, 2003 to December 31, 2004 primarily due to
sales of securities in a gain position and the increase in interest rates (e.g. short-term through
five-year rates) offset by credit spread tightening and changes in foreign currency exchange rates.
The gross unrealized loss amount decreased by $97 from December 31, 2003 to December 31, 2004
primarily due to credit spread tightening, improved pricing levels for certain CDOs and ABS,
security sales and, to a lesser extent, other-than-temporary impairments, offset by interest rate
increases.

(For further discussion of risk factors associated with sectors with significant unrealized loss
positions, see the sector risk factor commentary under the Consolidated Total Available-for-Sale
Securities with Unrealized Loss Greater than Six Months by Type schedule in this section of the
MD&A.)

Investment sector allocations as a percentage of total fixed maturities have remained materially
consistent since December 31, 2003, except for ABS and CMBS. In 2004, HIM continued to overweight,
in comparison to the Lehman Aggregate Index, ABS supported by diversified pools of consumer loans
(e.g. home equity and auto loans and credit card receivables) and CMBS due to the securities
attractive spread levels and underlying asset diversification and quality. In general, CMBS
securities have lower prepayment risk than MBS due to contractual penalties.

As of December 31, 2004 and 2003, 18% of the fixed maturities were invested in private placement
securities, including 11% of Rule 144A offerings to qualified institutional buyers. Private
placement securities are generally less liquid than public securities. Most of the private
placement securities are rated by nationally recognized rating agencies.



At the December 14th, 2004 Federal Open Market Committee policy meeting, the overnight funds rate
was raised a quarter-point for the fifth time in 2004 to 2.25%. The Fed members indicated that the
economy is growing at a moderate pace and the job market continues to show gradual improvement
despite higher energy and commodity prices. The Company continues to expect the Fed to raise
short-term interest rates at a measured pace for the foreseeable future unless inflationary
pressures accelerate. The risk of inflation could increase if energy and commodity prices continue
to rise, productivity growth slows or the U.S. dollar continues to devalue in comparison to foreign
currencies. Increases in future interest rates may result in lower fixed maturity valuations.

The following table identifies fixed maturities by credit quality on a consolidated basis as of
December 31, 2004 and 2003. The ratings referenced below are based on the ratings of a nationally
recognized rating organization or, if not rated, assigned based on the Company’s internal analysis
of such securities.

As of December 31, 2004 and 2003, the Company held no issuer of a BIG security with a fair
value in excess of 4% and 3%, respectively, of the total fair value for BIG securities. Total BIG
securities decreased since December 31, 2003 as a result of decisions to reduce exposure to lower
credit quality assets resulting from the securities’ significant credit spread tightening and
re-invest in higher quality securities.

Effective January 1, 2004, guaranteed separate account assets were included with general
account assets as a result of adopting SOP 03-1.

The decrease in the unrealized loss amount since December 31, 2003 is primarily the result of
credit spread tightening, improved pricing levels for certain CDOs and ABS, asset sales, and, to a
lesser extent, other-than-temporary impairments, offset in part by an increase in the short-term
through five-year interest rates. (For further discussion, see the economic commentary under the
Consolidated Fixed Maturities by Type table in this section of the MD&A.)

As a percentage of amortized cost, the average security or fixed maturity unrealized loss at
December 31, 2004 and 2003 was less than 2% and 4%, respectively. As of December 31, 2004 and
2003, fixed maturities represented $252, or 95%, and $349, or 96%, respectively, of the Company’s
total unrealized loss associated with securities classified as available-for-sale. There were no
fixed maturities as of December 31, 2004 and 2003 with a fair value less than 80% of the security’s
amortized cost basis for six continuous months other than certain ABS and CMBS subject to EITF
Issue No. 99-20. Other-than-temporary impairments for certain ABS and CMBS are recognized if the
fair value of the security, as determined by external pricing sources, is less than its carrying
amount and there has been a decrease in the present value of the expected cash flows since the last
reporting period. There were no ABS or CMBS included in the table above, as of December 31, 2004
and 2003, for which management’s best estimate of future cash flows adversely changed during the
reporting period. (For further discussion of the other-than-temporary impairments criteria, see
“Valuation of Investments and Derivative Instruments and Evaluation of Other-Than-Temporary
Impairments” included in the Critical Accounting Estimates section of the MD&A and Note 1 of Notes
to Consolidated Financial Statements.)

The Company held no securities of a single issuer that were at an unrealized loss position in
excess of 5% of the total unrealized loss amount as of December 31, 2004 and 2003.

The total securities classified as available-for-sale in an unrealized loss position for longer

The increase in 2004 consolidated available-for-sale securities with an unrealized loss
greater than six months amounts was primarily driven by the aging of securities depressed due to
interest rate changes from the date of purchase. This increase was partially offset by improved
pricing levels for certain CDOs and ABS, credit spread tightening, security sales and
other-than-temporary impairments.

With the exception of ABS security types, the majority of the securities in an unrealized loss
position for six months or more as of December 31, 2004 were depressed primarily due to interest
rate changes from the date of purchase. The sectors with the most significant concentration of
unrealized losses were ABS supported by aircraft lease receivables and corporate fixed maturities
primarily within the financial services sector. The Company’s current view of risk factors
relative to these fixed maturity types is as follows:

Aircraft lease receivables

— The decrease in the unrealized loss position during 2004 was primarily
the result of improving pricing levels for certain issuers in this sector, as well as by
other-than-temporary impairments taken during the year. In prior years, these securities had
suffered a decrease in value as a result of a prolonged decline in airline travel, the uncertainty
of a potential industry recovery and lack of market liquidity in this sector. Although uncertainty
surrounding the stability of domestic airlines continues to weigh heavily on this sector, worldwide
travel and aircraft demand appears to be improving. While the Company has seen modest price
increases and greater liquidity in this sector during 2004, any additional price recovery will
depend on continued improvement in economic fundamentals, political stability and airline operating
performance.

Financial services

— As of December 31, 2004, the Company held approximately 110 different
securities in the financial services sector that had been in an unrealized loss position for
greater than six months. Substantially all of these securities are investment grade securities
priced at or greater than 90% of amortized cost as of December 31, 2004. These positions are a
mixture of fixed and variable rate securities with extended maturity dates, which have been
adversely impacted by changes in interest rates after the purchase date. Additional changes in
fair value of these securities are primarily dependent on future changes in interest rates.

As part of the Company’s ongoing security monitoring process by a committee of investment and
accounting professionals, the Company has reviewed its investment portfolio and concluded that
there were no additional other-than-temporary impairments as of December 31, 2004 and 2003. Due to
the issuers’ continued satisfaction of the securities’ obligations in accordance with their
contractual terms and the expectation that they will continue to do so, management’s intent and
ability to hold these securities, as well as the evaluation of the fundamentals of the issuers’
financial condition and other objective evidence, the Company believes that the prices of the
securities in the sectors identified above were temporarily depressed.

The evaluation for other-than-temporary impairments is a quantitative and qualitative process,
which is subject to risks and uncertainties in the determination of whether declines in the fair
value of investments are other-than-temporary. The risks and uncertainties include changes in
general economic conditions, the issuer’s financial condition or near term recovery prospects and
the effects of changes in interest rates. In addition, for securitized financial assets with
contractual cash flows (e.g. ABS and CMBS), projections of expected future cash flows may change
based upon new information regarding the performance of the underlying collateral. As of December
31, 2004 and 2003, management’s expectation of the discounted future cash flows on these securities
was in excess of the associated securities’ amortized cost. (For a further discussion, see
“Valuation of Investments and Derivative Instruments and Evaluation of Other-Than-Temporary
Impairments” included in the Critical Accounting Estimates section of the MD&A and Note 1 of Notes
to Consolidated Financial Statements.)

The decrease in the BIG and equity security unrealized loss amount for securities classified
as available-for-sale during 2004 was primarily the result of credit spread tightening, improved
pricing levels for certain CDOs and ABS and other-than-temporary impairments, partially offset by
rating agency downgrades for certain issuers in the aircraft lease receivables sector. (For a
further discussion, see the economic commentary under the Consolidated Fixed Maturities by Type

Effective January 1, 2004, guaranteed separate account assets were included with general
account assets as a result of adopting SOP 03-1.

The decrease in the consolidated available-for-sale BIG and equity securities greater than six
months unrealized loss amount since December 31, 2003 was primarily the result of credit spread
tightening, improved pricing levels for certain CDOs and ABS, other-than-temporary impairments
taken during the year and, to a lesser extent, asset sales. This decrease was partially offset by
rating agency downgrades for certain issuers in the aircraft lease receivables sector. (For a
further discussion of the Company’s current view of risk factors relative to certain security types
listed above, see the Consolidated Total Available-for-Sale Securities with Unrealized Loss Greater
Than Six Months by Type table in this section of the MD&A.)

CAPITAL MARKETS RISK MANAGEMENT

The Hartford has a disciplined approach to managing risks associated with its capital markets and
asset/liability management activities. Investment portfolio management is organized to focus
investment management expertise on the specific classes of investments, while asset/liability
management is the responsibility of a dedicated risk management unit supporting Life and Property &
Casualty operations. Derivative instruments are utilized in compliance with established Company
policy and regulatory requirements and are monitored internally and reviewed by senior management.

Market Risk

The Hartford is exposed to market risk, primarily relating to the market price and/or cash flow
variability associated with changes in interest rates, market indices or foreign currency exchange
rates. The Company analyzes interest rate risk using various models including parametric models
that forecast cash flows of the liabilities and the supporting investments, including derivative
instruments under various market scenarios.

Interest Rate Risk

The Company’s exposure to interest rate risk relates to the market price and/or cash flow
variability associated with the changes in market interest rates. The Company manages its exposure
to interest rate risk through asset allocation limits, asset/liability duration matching and
through the use of derivatives. The Company analyzes interest rate risk using various models
including parametric models that forecast cash flows of the liabilities and the supporting
investments, including derivative instruments under various market scenarios. Measures the Company
uses to quantify its exposure to interest rate risk inherent in its invested assets and interest
rate sensitive liabilities are duration and key rate duration. Duration is the weighted average
term-to-maturity of a security’s cash flows, and is used to approximate the percentage change in
the price of a security for a 100-basis-point change in market interest rates. For example, a
duration of 5 means the price of the security will change by approximately 5% for a 1% change in
interest rates. The key rate duration analysis considers the expected future cash flows of assets
and liabilities assuming non-parallel interest rate movements.

To calculate duration, projections of asset and liability cash flows are discounted to a present
value using interest rate assumptions. These cash flows are then revalued at alternative interest
rate levels to determine the percentage change in fair value due to an incremental change in rates.
Cash flows from corporate obligations are assumed to be consistent with the contractual payment
streams on a yield to worst basis. The primary assumptions used in calculating cash flow
projections include expected asset payment streams taking into account prepayment speeds, issuer
call options and contract holder behavior. Asset-backed securities, collateralized mortgage obligations and mortgage-backed securities are modeled based on estimates of the rate of
future prepayments of principal over the remaining life of the securities. These estimates are
developed using prepayment speeds provided in broker consensus data.



Such estimates are derived
from prepayment speeds previously experienced at the interest rate levels projected for the
underlying collateral. Actual prepayment experience may vary from these estimates.

The Company is also exposed to interest rate risk based upon the discount rate assumption
associated with the Company’s pension and other postretirement benefit obligation. The discount
rate assumption is based upon an interest rate yield curve comprised of AAA/AA bonds with
maturities between zero and thirty years. Declines in long-term interest rates have had a negative
impact on the funded status of the plans. (For a further discussion of interest rate risk
associated with the plans, see the Capital Resource and Liquidity section of the MD&A under
“Pension Plans and Other Postretirement Benefits” and Note 17 of Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements.)

The Company believes that an increase in interest rates from the current levels is generally a
favorable development for the Company. Rate increases are expected to provide additional net
investment income, increase sales of fixed rate Life investment products, reduce the cost of the
GMWB hedging program, limit the potential risk of margin erosion due to minimum guaranteed
crediting rates in certain Life products and, if sustained, could reduce the Company’s prospective
pension expense. Conversely, a rise in interest rates will reduce the net unrealized gain position
of the investment portfolio, increase interest expense on the Company’s variable rate debt
obligations and, if long-term interest rates rise dramatically within a six to twelve month time
period, certain Life businesses may be exposed to disintermediation risk. Disintermediation risk
refers to the risk that policyholders will surrender their contracts in a rising interest rate
environment requiring the Company to liquidate assets in an unrealized loss position. In
conjunction with the interest rate risk measurement and management techniques, significant portions
of Life’s fixed income product offerings have market value adjustment provisions at contract
surrender.

Equity Risk

The Company’s primary exposure to equity risk relates to the potential for lower earnings
associated with certain of the Life’s businesses such as variable annuities where fee income is
earned based upon the fair value of the assets under management. In addition, Life offers certain
guaranteed benefits, primarily associated with variable annuity products, which increases the
Company’s potential benefit exposure as the equity markets decline. (For a further discussion, see
Life “Equity Risk” in this section of the MD&A.)

The Company does not have significant equity risk exposure from invested assets. In March 2003,
the Company decided to liquidate certain equity securities and reinvest the proceeds into fixed
maturity investments, thereby reducing its exposure to equity price risk. The Company has not
materially changed other aspects of its overall asset allocation position or market risk since
December 31, 2003.

The Company is also subject to equity risk based upon the expected long-term rate of return
assumption associated with the Company’s pension and other postretirement benefit obligation. The
Company determines the long-term rate of return assumption for the plans’ portfolio based upon an
analysis of historical returns. Declines in equity returns have had a negative impact on the
funded status of the plans. (For a further discussion of equity risk associated with the plans,
see the Capital Resource and Liquidity section of the MD&A under “Pension Plans and Other
Postretirement Benefits” and Note 17 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.)

Foreign Currency Exchange Risk

The Company’s currency exchange risk is related to non-U.S. dollar denominated investments, which
primarily consist of fixed maturity investments, the investment in the Japanese Life operation and
a yen denominated individual fixed annuity product, and to a lesser
extent, its GMDB and GMIB benefit associated with its Japanese variable
annuities. A significant portion of the Company’s foreign
currency exposure is mitigated through the use of derivatives.

Derivative Instruments

The Hartford utilizes a variety of derivative instruments, including swaps, caps, floors, forwards,
futures and options, in compliance with Company policy and regulatory requirements to mitigate
interest rate, equity market or currency exchange rate risk or volatility.

Interest rate swaps involve the periodic exchange of payments with other parties, at specified
intervals, calculated using the agreed upon rates and notional principal amounts. Generally, no
cash or principal payments are exchanged at the inception of the contract. Typically, at the time
a swap is entered into, the cash flow streams exchanged by the counterparties are equal in value.

Interest rate cap and floor contracts entitle the purchaser to receive from the issuer at specified
dates, the amount, if any, by which a specified market rate exceeds the cap strike rate or falls
below the floor strike rate, applied to a notional principal amount. A premium payment is made by
the purchaser of the contract at its inception and no principal payments are exchanged.

Forward contracts are customized commitments to either purchase or sell designated financial
instruments, at a future date, for a specified price and may be settled in cash or through delivery
of the underlying instrument.

Financial futures are standardized commitments to either purchase or sell designated financial
instruments, at a future date, for a specified price and may be settled in cash or through delivery
of the underlying instrument. Futures contracts trade on organized exchanges. Margin requirements
for futures are met by pledging securities, and changes in the futures’ contract values are settled
daily in cash.



Option contracts grant the purchaser, for a premium payment, the right to either purchase from or
sell to the issuer a financial instrument at a specified price, within a specified period or on a
stated date.

Foreign currency swaps exchange an initial principal amount in two currencies, agreeing to
re-exchange the currencies at a future date, at an agreed upon exchange rate. There may also be a
periodic exchange of payments at specified intervals calculated using the agreed upon rates and
exchanged principal amounts.

Derivative activities are monitored by an internal compliance unit and reviewed frequently by
senior management. The notional amounts of derivative contracts represent the basis upon which pay
or receive amounts are calculated and are not reflective of credit risk. Notional amounts
pertaining to derivative instruments used in the management of market risk for both the general and
guaranteed separate accounts at December 31, 2004 and 2003 were $54.1 billion and $37.3 billion,
respectively. The increase in the derivative notional amount during 2004 was primarily due to the
embedded derivatives associated with the GMWB product feature.

The following discussions focus on the key market risk exposures within Life and Property &
Casualty portfolios.

Life

Life is responsible for maximizing after-tax returns within acceptable risk parameters, including
the management of the interest rate sensitivity of invested assets and the generation of sufficient
liquidity to support policyholder and corporate obligations. Life’s fixed maturity portfolios and
certain investment contract and insurance product liabilities have material market exposure to
interest rate risk. In addition, Life’s operations are significantly influenced by changes in the
equity markets. Life’s profitability depends largely on the amount of assets under management,
which is primarily driven by the level of sales, equity market appreciation and depreciation and
the persistency of the in-force block of business. Life’s foreign currency exposure is primarily
related to non-U.S. dollar denominated fixed income securities, the investment in the Japanese Life
operation and certain foreign currency based individual fixed annuity contracts, and to a lesser
extent, its GMDB and GMIB benefits associated with its Japanese variable annuities.

Interest Rate Risk

Life’s exposure to interest rate risk relates to the market price and/or cash flow variability
associated with changes in market interest rates. Changes in interest rates can potentially impact
Life’s profitability. In certain scenarios where interest rates are volatile, Life could be
exposed to disintermediation risk and a reduction in net interest rate spread or profit margins.
The investments and liabilities primarily associated with interest rate risk are included in the
following discussion. Certain product liabilities, including those containing guaranteed minimum
withdrawal or death benefits, expose the Company to interest rate risk but also have significant
equity risk. These liabilities are discussed as part of the Equity Risk section below.

Fixed Maturity Investments

Life’s general account investment portfolios, including guaranteed separate accounts as of December
31, 2003, primarily consist of investment grade fixed maturity securities, including corporate
bonds, asset-backed securities, commercial mortgage-backed securities, tax-exempt municipal
securities and collateralized mortgage obligations. The fair value of these investments was $50.5
billion and $49.2 billion at December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The fair value of these
investments and Life’s other invested assets fluctuates depending on the interest rate environment
and other general economic conditions. During periods of declining interest rates, paydowns on
mortgage-backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations increase as the underlying
mortgages are prepaid. During such periods, the Company generally will not be able to reinvest the
proceeds of any such prepayments at comparable yields. Conversely, during periods of rising
interest rates, the rate of prepayments generally declines, exposing the Company to the possibility
of asset/liability cash flow and yield mismatch. The weighted average duration of the fixed
maturity portfolio was approximately 5.0 and 4.8 as of December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively.
In 2004, the duration of certain Life portfolios were modestly lengthened, which generated
additional interest income.

Liabilities

Life’s investment contracts and certain insurance product liabilities, other than non-guaranteed
separate accounts, include asset accumulation vehicles such as fixed annuities, guaranteed
investment contracts, other investment and universal life-type contracts and other insurance
products such as long-term disability.

Asset accumulation vehicles primarily require a fixed rate payment, often for a specified period of
time. Product examples include fixed rate annuities with a market value adjustment feature and
fixed rate guaranteed investment contracts. The duration of these contracts generally range from
less than one year to ten years. In addition, certain products such as universal life contracts
and the general account portion of Life’s variable annuity products, credit interest to
policyholders subject to market conditions and minimum interest rate guarantees. The duration of
these products is short-to-intermediate term.

While interest rate risk associated with many of these products has been reduced through the use of
market value adjustment features and surrender charges, the primary risk associated with these
products is that the spread between investment return and credited rate may not be sufficient to
earn targeted returns.

The Company also manages the risk of other insurance liabilities similarly to investment type
products due to the relative predictability of the aggregate cash flow payment streams. Products
in this category may contain significant actuarial (including



mortality and morbidity) pricing and
cash flow risks. Product examples include structured settlement contracts, on-benefit annuities
(i.e., the annuitant is currently receiving benefits thereon) and short and long-term disability
contracts. The cash out flows associated with these policy liabilities are not interest rate
sensitive but do vary based on the timing and amount of benefit payments. The primary risks
associated with these products are that the benefits will exceed expected actuarial pricing and/or
that the actual timing of the cash flows will differ from those anticipated, resulting in an
investment return lower than that assumed in pricing. Contract duration can range from less than
one year to typically up to ten years.

Derivatives

Life utilizes a variety of derivative instruments to mitigate interest rate risk. Interest rate
swaps are primarily used to convert interest receipts to a fixed or variable rate. In addition,
interest rate swaps are used to convert the contract rate on certain liability products offered by
the Company into a rate that trades in a more liquid and efficient market. The use of such swaps
enables the Company to customize contract terms and conditions to customer objectives and satisfies
the operation’s asset/liability duration matching policy. Occasionally, swaps are also used to
hedge the variability in the cash flow of a forecasted purchase or sale due to changes in interest
rates.

Interest rate caps and floors, swaptions and option contracts are primarily used to hedge against
the risk of liability contract holder disintermediation in a rising interest rate environment, and
to offset the changes in fair value of corresponding derivatives embedded in certain of the
Company’s fixed maturity investments.

At December 31, 2004 and 2003, notional amounts pertaining to derivatives utilized to manage
interest rate risk totaled $9.9 billion and $9.5 billion, respectively ($7.7 billion and $7.8
billion, respectively related to insurance investments and $2.2 billion and $1.7 billion,
respectively related to life insurance liabilities). The fair value of these derivatives as
reflected on the consolidated balance sheets was $41 and $142 as of December 31, 2004 and 2003,
respectively.

Calculated Interest Rate Sensitivity

The after-tax change in the net economic value of investment contracts (e.g. guaranteed investment
contracts) and certain other insurance product liabilities (e.g. short and long-term disability
contracts), for which the payment rates are fixed at contract issuance and the investment
experience is substantially absorbed by Life, are included in the following table along with the
corresponding general and guaranteed separate account assets. Also included in this analysis are
the interest rate sensitive derivatives used by Life to hedge its exposure to interest rate risk.
Certain financial instruments, such as limited partnerships, have been omitted from the analysis
because the investments lack sensitivity to interest rate changes. Non-guaranteed separate account
assets and liabilities and equity securities held for trading and the corresponding liabilities
associated with the variable annuity products sold in Japan are excluded from the analysis because
gains and losses in separate accounts accrue to policyholders. The estimated change in net
economic value below assumes a 100 basis point upward and downward parallel shift in the yield
curve.

The fixed liabilities included above represented approximately 50% and 60% of Life’s general
account liabilities as of December 31, 2004 and Life’s general and guaranteed separate account
liabilities as of December 31, 2003. The assets supporting the fixed liabilities are monitored and
managed within rigorous duration guidelines using scenario simulation techniques, and are evaluated
on an annual basis, in compliance with regulatory requirements.

The after-tax change in fair value of the general account invested asset portfolios that support
certain universal life-type contracts and other insurance contracts that possess significant
mortality risk are shown in the following table. The cash flows associated with these liabilities
are less predictable than fixed liabilities. The Company identifies the most appropriate
investment strategy based upon the expected policyholder behavior and liability crediting needs.
The hypothetical calculation of the estimated change in fair value below assumes a 100 basis point
upward and downward parallel shift in the yield curve.

The selection of the 100 basis point parallel shift in the yield curve was made only as a
hypothetical illustration of the potential impact of such an event and should not be construed as a
prediction of future market events. Actual results could differ materially from those illustrated
above due to the nature of the estimates and assumptions used in the above analysis. The Company’s
sensitivity analysis calculation assumes that the composition of invested assets and liabilities
remain materially consistent throughout the year and that the current relationship between
short-term and long-term interest rates will remain constant over time. As a result, these
calculations may not fully capture the impact of portfolio re-allocations, significant product
sales or non-parallel changes in interest rates.



Equity Risk

The Company’s operations are significantly influenced by changes in the equity markets. The
Company’s profitability depends largely on the amount of assets under management, which is
primarily driven by the level of sales, equity market appreciation and depreciation and the
persistency of the in-force block of business. Prolonged and precipitous declines in the equity
markets can have a significant impact on the Company’s operations, as sales of variable products
may decline and surrender activity may increase, as customer sentiment towards the equity market
turns negative. Lower assets under management will have a negative impact on the Company’s
financial results, primarily due to lower fee income related to the Retail Products Group and
Institutional Solutions Group and, to a lesser extent, the Individual Life segments, where a heavy
concentration of equity linked products are administered and sold. Furthermore, the Company may
experience a reduction in profit margins if a significant portion of the assets held in the
variable annuity separate accounts move to the general account and the Company is unable to earn an
acceptable investment spread, particularly in light of the low interest rate environment and the
presence of contractually guaranteed minimum interest credited rates, which for the most part are
at a 3% rate.

In addition, prolonged declines in the equity market may also decrease the Company’s expectations
of future gross profits, which are utilized to determine the amount of DAC to be amortized in a
given financial statement period. A significant decrease in the Company’s estimated gross profits
would require the Company to accelerate the amount of DAC amortization in a given period,
potentially causing a material adverse deviation in that period’s net income. Although an
acceleration of DAC amortization would have a negative impact on the Company’s earnings, it would
not affect the Company’s cash flow or liquidity position.

The Company sells variable annuity contracts that offer one or more benefit guarantees that
generally increase with declines in equity markets. As is described in more detail below, the
Company manages the equity market risks embedded in these guarantees through reinsurance, product
design and hedging programs. The Company believes its ability to manage these equity market risks
by these means gives it a competitive advantage; and, in particular, its ability to create
innovative product designs that allow the Company to meet identified customer needs while
generating manageable amounts of equity market risk. The Company’s relative sales and variable
annuity market share have generally increased during periods when it has recently introduced new
products to the market. In contrast, the Company’s relative sales and market share have generally
decreased when competitors introduce products that cause an issuer to assume larger amounts of
equity and other market risk than the Company is confident it can prudently manage. The Company
believes its long-term success in the variable annuity market will continue to be aided by
successful innovation in both product design and in equity market risk management and that, in the
absence of this innovation, its market share could decline.

The Company sells variable annuity contracts that offer various guaranteed death and income
benefits. The Company maintains a liability for the death and income benefit costs, net of

reinsurance, of $138, as of December 31, 2004. Declines in the equity market may increase the
Company’s net exposure to death benefits under these contracts. The majority of the contracts with
the guaranteed death benefit feature are sold by the Retail Products Group segment. For certain
guaranteed death benefits, The Hartford pays the greater of (1) the account value at death; (2) the
sum of all premium payments less prior withdrawals; or (3) the maximum anniversary value of the
contract, plus any premium payments since the contract anniversary, minus any withdrawals following
the contract anniversary. For certain guaranteed death benefits sold with variable annuity
contracts beginning in June 2003, the Retail Products Group segment pays the greater of (1) the
account value at death; or (2) the maximum anniversary value; not to exceed the account value plus
the greater of (a) 25% of premium payments, or (b) 25% of the maximum anniversary value of the
contract. The Company currently reinsures a significant portion of these death benefit guarantees
associated with its in-force block of business.

The Company’s total gross exposure (i.e. before reinsurance) to these guaranteed death benefits as
of December 31, 2004 is $8.3 billion. Due to the fact that 80% of this amount is reinsured, the
Company’s net exposure is $1.6 billion. This amount is often referred to as the retained net
amount at risk. However, the Company will incur these guaranteed death benefit payments in the
future only if the policyholder has an in-the-money guaranteed death benefit at their time of
death.

In addition, the Company offers certain variable annuity products with a GMWB rider. Declines in
the equity market may increase the Company’s exposure to benefits under the GMWB contracts. For
all contracts in effect through July 6, 2003, the Company entered into a reinsurance arrangement to
offset its exposure to the GMWB for the remaining lives of those contracts. As of July 6, 2003,
the Company exhausted all but a small portion of the reinsurance capacity for new business under
the current arrangement and will be ceding only a very small number of new contracts subsequent to
July 6, 2003. Substantially all new contracts with the GMWB are not covered by reinsurance. These
unreinsured contracts are expected to generate volatility in net income as the underlying embedded
derivative liabilities are recorded at fair value each reporting period, resulting in the
recognition of net realized capital gains or losses in response to changes in certain critical
factors including capital market conditions and policyholder behavior. In order to minimize the
volatility associated with the unreinsured GMWB liabilities, the Company established an alternative
risk management strategy. During the third quarter of 2003, the Company began hedging its
unreinsured GMWB exposure using interest rate futures, Standard and Poor’s (“S&P”) 500 and NASDAQ
index put options and futures contracts. During the first quarter of 2004, the Company entered
into Europe, Australasia and Far East (“EAFE”) Index swaps to hedge GMWB exposure to international
equity markets. The hedging program involves a detailed monitoring of policyholder behavior and
capital markets conditions on a daily basis and rebalancing of the hedge position as needed. While
the Company actively manages this hedge position, hedge ineffectiveness may result due to factors
including, but not limited to, policyholder behavior, capital markets dislocation or discontinuity
and divergence between the performance of the underlying funds and the hedging indices.



The net impact of the change in value of the embedded derivative net of the results of the hedging
program was an $8 gain before deferred policy acquisition costs and tax effects for the year ended
December 31, 2004. As of December 31, 2004, the notional and fair value related to the embedded
derivatives, the hedging strategy, and reinsurance was $37.7 billion and $170, respectively.

In December 2004, the Company purchased one and two year S&P 500 put option contracts to
economically hedge certain liabilities that could increase if the equity markets decline. As of
December 31, 2004, the notional and market value related to this strategy was $1.9 billion and $32,
respectively. Because this strategy is intended to partially hedge certain equity-market sensitive
liabilities calculated under statutory accounting (see Capital Resources and Liquidity), changes in
the value of the put options may not be closely aligned to changes in liabilities determined in
accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“GAAP”), causing volatility in GAAP net
income. The Company anticipates employing similar strategies in the future, which could further
increase volatility in GAAP net income.

Currency Exchange Risk

Currency exchange risk exists with respect to investments in non-U.S. dollar denominated fixed
maturities, primarily denominated in Euro, Sterling, Yen and Canadian dollars, as well as Life’s
investment in foreign operations, primarily Japan, and the yen based individual fixed annuity
product and, to a lesser extent, its GMDB and GMIB benefits associated with its Japanese variable
annuities.

The risk associated with the non-U.S. dollar denominated fixed maturities relates to potential
decreases in value and income resulting from unfavorable changes in foreign exchange rates. The
fair value of the non-U.S. dollar denominated fixed maturities at December 31, 2004 and 2003, were
approximately $2.5 billion and $2.0 billion, respectively. In order to manage its currency
exposures, Life enters into foreign currency swaps and forwards to hedge the variability in cash
flow associated with certain foreign denominated fixed maturities. These foreign currency swap
agreements are structured to match the foreign currency cash flows of the hedged foreign
denominated securities. At December 31, 2004 and 2003, the derivatives used to hedge currency
exchange risk related to non-U.S. dollar denominated fixed maturities had a total notional value of
$1.7 billion and $1.4 billion, respectively, and total fair value of $(503) and $(299),
respectively.

The functional currency of the Japanese operation is the Japanese yen. Accordingly, the premiums,
claims, commissions and investment income are paid or received in yen. In addition, most of the
Japanese operation’s investments are yen denominated.

The net investment in the Japanese operation was approximately $673 and $250, as of December 31,
2004 and 2003, respectively. Life has entered into the yen denominated forwards to hedge a
substantial portion of the net investment in the Japanese operation. At December 31, 2004 and
2003, the derivatives used to hedge the net investment in the Japanese operation had a total
notional value of $401 and $200, respectively, and total fair value of $(23) and $(4),
respectively.

The yen based fixed annuity product is written by Hartford Life Insurance KK, a wholly-owned
Japanese subsidiary of HLA, and subsequently reinsured to Hartford Life Insurance Company, a U.S.
dollar based wholly-owned subsidiary of Hartford Life, Inc. The yen denominated fixed annuity
product is recorded in the consolidated balance sheets in other policyholder funds and benefits
payable in U.S. dollars based upon the December 31, 2004 yen to dollar spot rate. To mitigate the
yen exposure associated with the product, during the fourth quarter of 2004, the Company entered
into pay fixed U.S. dollar receive fixed yen, zero coupon currency swaps and forwards (dollar to
yen derivatives). As of December 31, 2004 the dollar to yen derivatives had a notional and fair
value of $611 and $10, respectively.

Based on the fair values of Life’s non-U.S. dollar denominated investments and derivative
instruments (including its yen based individual fixed annuity product) as of December 31, 2004 and
2003, management estimates that a 10% unfavorable change in exchange rates would decrease the fair
values by an after-tax total of $9 and $20, respectively. The estimated impact was based upon a
10% change in December 31 spot rates. The selection of the 10% unfavorable change was made only
for hypothetical illustration of the potential impact of such an event and should not be construed
as a prediction of future market events. Actual results could differ materially from those
illustrated above due to the nature of the estimates and assumptions used in the above analysis.

Property & Casualty

Property & Casualty attempts to maximize economic value while generating appropriate after-tax
income and sufficient liquidity to meet policyholder and corporate obligations. Property &
Casualty’s investment portfolio has material exposure to interest rates. The Company continually
monitors these exposures and makes portfolio adjustments to manage these risks within established
limits.

Interest Rate Risk

The primary exposure to interest rate risk in Property & Casualty relates to its fixed maturity
investments, including corporate bonds, asset-backed securities, municipal bonds, commercial
mortgage-backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations. The fair value of these
investments was $24.4 billion and $23.7 billion at December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The
fair value of these and Property & Casualty’s other invested assets fluctuates depending on the
interest rate environment and other general economic conditions. During periods of declining
interest rates, embedded call features within securities are exercised with greater frequency and
paydowns on mortgage-backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations increase as the
underlying mortgages are prepaid. During such periods, the Company generally will not be able to
reinvest the proceeds of any such prepayments at comparable yields. Conversely during periods of
rising interest rates, the rate of prepayments generally decline. Derivative instruments such as



swaps, caps and options are used to manage interest rate risk and had a total notional amount as of
December 31, 2004 and 2003 of $1.5 billion and $1.4 billion, respectively, and fair value of $7 and
$19, respectively.

One of the measures Property & Casualty uses to quantify its exposure to interest rate risk
inherent in its invested assets is duration. The weighted average duration of the fixed maturity
portfolio was 4.6 and 4.7 as of December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. In 2004, the duration of
the Property & Casualty portfolios were modestly shortened in anticipation of higher future
interest rates.

Calculated Interest Rate Sensitivity

The following table provides an analysis showing the estimated after-tax change in the fair value
of Property & Casualty’s fixed income investments and related derivatives, assuming 100 basis point
upward and downward parallel shifts in the yield curve as of December 31, 2004 and 2003. Certain
financial instruments, such as limited partnerships, have been omitted from the analysis due to the
fact the investments are accounted for under the equity method and lack sensitivity to interest
rate changes.

The selection of the 100 basis point parallel shift in the yield curve was made only for
hypothetical illustration of the potential impact of such an event and should not be construed as a
prediction of future market events. Actual results could differ materially from those illustrated
above due to the nature of the estimates and assumptions used in the above analysis. The Company’s
sensitivity analysis calculation assumes that the composition of invested assets remains materially
consistent throughout the year and that the current relationship between short-term and long-term
interest rates will remain constant over time. As a result, these calculations may not fully
capture the impact of portfolio re-allocations or non-parallel changes in interest rates.

Currency Exchange Risk

Currency exchange risk exists with respect to investments in non-U.S. dollar denominated fixed
maturities, primarily Euro, Sterling and Canadian dollar denominated securities. The risk
associated with these securities relates to potential decreases in value resulting from unfavorable
changes in foreign exchange rates. The fair value of these fixed maturity securities at December
31, 2004 and 2003 was $1.4 billion and $1.2 billion, respectively.

In order to manage its currency exposures, Property & Casualty enters into foreign currency swaps
and forward contracts to hedge the variability in cash flow associated with certain foreign
denominated securities. These foreign currency swap agreements are structured to match the foreign
currency cash flows of the hedged foreign denominated securities. At December 31, 2004 and 2003,
the derivatives used to hedge currency exchange risk had a total notional value of $370 and $325,
respectively, and total fair value of $(70) and $(26), respectively.

Based on the fair values of Property & Casualty’s non-U.S. dollar denominated securities and
derivative instruments as of December 31, 2004 and 2003, management estimates that a 10%
unfavorable change in exchange rates would decrease the fair values by an after-tax total of
approximately $63 and $49, respectively. The estimated impact was based upon a 10% change in
December 31 spot rates. The selection of the 10% unfavorable change was made only for hypothetical
illustration of the potential impact of such an event and should not be construed as a prediction
of future market events. Actual results could differ materially from those illustrated above due
to the nature of the estimates and assumptions used in the above analysis.

Corporate

Interest Rate Risk

The primary exposure to interest rate risk in Corporate relates to the Company’s debt. The table
below provides information as of December 31, 2004 on Corporate’s debt obligations and reflects
principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by maturity year. Comparative
totals are included as of December 31, 2003.

CAPITAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY

Capital resources and liquidity represent the overall financial strength of The Hartford and
its ability to generate strong cash flows from each of the business segments, borrow funds at
competitive rates and raise new capital to meet operating and growth needs.

Liquidity Requirements

The liquidity requirements of The Hartford have been and will continue to be met by funds from
operations as well as the issuance of commercial paper, common stock, debt securities and
borrowings from its credit facilities. Current and expected patterns of claim frequency and
severity may change from period to period but continue to be within historical norms and,
therefore, the Company’s current liquidity position is considered to be sufficient to meet
anticipated demands. However, if an unanticipated demand was placed on the Company it is likely
that the Company would either sell certain of its investments to fund claims which could result in
larger than usual realized capital gains and losses or the Company would enter the capital markets
to raise further funds to provide the requisite liquidity. For a discussion and tabular
presentation of the Company’s current contractual obligations by period including those related to
its Life and Property & Casualty insurance refer to the Off-Balance Sheet and Aggregate
Contractual Obligations section below.

The principal sources of operating funds are premiums and investment income, while investing cash
flows originate from maturities and sales of invested assets.

The Hartford endeavors to maintain a capital structure that provides financial and operational
flexibility to its insurance subsidiaries, ratings that support its competitive position in the
financial services marketplace (see the Ratings section below for further discussion), and strong
shareholder returns. As a result, the Company may from time to time raise capital from the
issuance of stock, debt or other capital securities. The issuance of common stock, debt or other
capital securities could result in the dilution of shareholder interests or reduced net income due
to additional interest expense.

The Company’s Japanese life insurance operations are conducted through Hartford Life Insurance K.K.
a wholly owned subsidiary of Hartford Life and Accident (“HLA”), one of the Company’s principal
statutorily regulated operating subsidiaries. To date, the Company has funded the capital needs of
its Japanese operations through investments in the common stock of Hartford Life Insurance K.K. by
HLA, an investment that stood at $673 at the end of 2004. This arrangement has generally allowed
some portion of the Company’s investment in its Japanese operations to be included as part of the
aggregate statutory capital (for the purposes of regulatory and rating agency capital adequacy
measures) of HLA.

The Company is currently in the process of evaluating capital structures that it believes in the
long-term could result in improved financial flexibility. Certain of these structures would no
longer allow a portion of the capital invested in our Japanese operations to be included in the
aggregate capital of HLA. This could potentially reduce certain of the capital adequacy measures
employed by regulators and rating agencies to assess the capital strength of The Hartford’s
domestic life insurance companies. At the current time, the Company believes it has sufficient
financial resources to maintain capital adequacy levels consistent with all of its rating
objectives.

The Company may also repurchase outstanding shares of its common stock and equity units from time
to time, in an aggregate amount not to exceed $1 billion. For additional information regarding the
Company’s authorization to repurchase its securities, please see the “Stockholders’ Equity” section
below.

HFSG and HLI are holding companies which rely upon operating cash flow in the form of dividends
from their subsidiaries, which enable them to service debt, pay dividends, and pay certain
business expenses.

Dividends to HFSG from its subsidiaries are restricted. The payment of dividends by
Connecticut-domiciled insurers is limited under the insurance holding company laws of Connecticut.
Under these laws, the insurance subsidiaries may only make their dividend payments out of
unassigned surplus. These laws require notice to and approval by the state insurance commissioner
for the declaration or payment of any dividend, which, together with other dividends or
distributions made within the preceding twelve months, exceeds the greater of (i) 10% of the
insurer’s policyholder surplus as of December 31 of the preceding year or (ii) net income (or net
gain from operations, if such company is a life insurance company) for the twelve-month period
ending on the thirty-first day of December last preceding, in each case determined under statutory
insurance accounting policies. In addition, if any dividend of a Connecticut-domiciled insurer
exceeds the insurer’s earned surplus, it requires the prior approval of the Connecticut Insurance
Commissioner. The insurance holding company laws of the other jurisdictions in which The
Hartford’s insurance subsidiaries are incorporated (or deemed commercially domiciled) generally
contain similar (although in certain instances somewhat more restrictive) limitations on the
payment of dividends. For the year ended December 31, 2004, the Company’s insurance subsidiaries
paid $861 to HFSG and HLI and are permitted to pay up to a maximum of approximately $1.9 billion in
dividends to HFSG and HLI in 2005 without prior approval from the applicable insurance
commissioner.

The primary uses of funds are to pay claims, policy benefits, operating expenses and commissions
and to purchase new investments. In addition, The Hartford has a policy of carrying a significant
short-term investment position and accordingly does not anticipate selling intermediate- and
long-term fixed maturity investments to meet any liquidity needs. (For a discussion of the
Company’s investment objectives and strategies, see the Investments and Capital Markets Risk
Management sections.)



Sources of Liquidity

Shelf Registrations

On December 3, 2003, The Hartford’s shelf registration statement (Registration No. 333-108067)
for the potential offering and sale of debt and equity securities in an aggregate amount of up to
$3.0 billion was declared effective by the Securities and Exchange Commission. The Registration
Statement allows for the following types of securities to be offered: (i) debt securities,
preferred stock, common stock, depositary shares, warrants, stock purchase contracts, stock
purchase units and junior subordinated deferrable interest debentures of the Company, and (ii)
preferred securities of any of one or more capital trusts organized by The Hartford (“The Hartford
Trusts”). The Company may enter into guarantees with respect to the preferred securities of any
of The Hartford Trusts. In January 2004, the Company issued approximately 6.7 million shares of
common stock pursuant to an underwritten offering at a price to the public of $63.25 per share and
received net proceeds of $411. On March 9, 2004, the Company issued $200 of 4.75% senior notes
due March 1, 2014. As of December 31, 2004, the Company had $2.4 billion remaining on its shelf.

On May 15, 2001, HLI filed with the SEC a shelf registration statement (Registration No.
333-60944) for the potential offering and sale of up to $1.0 billion in debt and preferred
securities. The registration statement was declared effective on May 29, 2001. As of December
31, 2004, HLI had $1.0 billion remaining on its shelf.

Under the two revolving credit agreements, the Company must maintain a minimum level of
consolidated statutory surplus and risk based capital ratios. In addition, the Company must
not exceed a maximum ratio of debt to capitalization. Quarterly, the Company certifies
compliance with each financial covenant for its banks. At December 31, 2004 and 2003, the
Company was in compliance with all such covenants.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Aggregate Contractual Obligations

The Company does not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that are reasonably likely to have a
material effect on the financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, or capital resources
of the Company, except for unfunded commitments to purchase investments in limited partnerships and
mortgage loans totaling $629 and a guarantee of the residual value of leased furniture and fixtures
for $20, both as disclosed in Note 12 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

The following points are significant to understanding the cash flows estimated for
obligations under property and casualty contracts:

•

Reserves for Property & Casualty unpaid claim and claim adjustment expenses include case
reserves for reported claims and reserves for claims incurred but not reported (IBNR).
While payments due on claim reserves are considered contractual obligations because they
relate to insurance policies issued by the Company, the ultimate amount to be paid to
settle both case reserves and IBNR is an estimate, subject to significant uncertainty. The
actual amount to be paid is not determined until the Company reaches a settlement with the
claimant. Final claim settlements may vary significantly from the present estimates,
particularly since many claims will not be settled until well into the future.

•

In estimating the timing of future payments by year, the Company has assumed that its
historical payment patterns will continue. However, the actual timing of future payments
will likely vary materially from these estimates due to, among other things, changes in
claim reporting and payment patterns and large unanticipated settlements. In particular,
there is significant uncertainty over the claim payment patterns of asbestos and
environmental claims. Also, estimated payments in 2005 do not include payments that will
be made on claims incurred in 2005 on policies that were in force as of December 31, 2004.
In addition, the table does not include future cash flows related to the receipt of
premiums that will be used, in part, to fund loss payments.

•

Under generally accepted accounting principles, the Company is only permitted to
discount reserves for claim and claim adjustment expenses in cases where the payment
pattern and ultimate loss costs are fixed and reliably determinable on an individual claim
basis. For the Company, these include claim settlements with permanently disabled claimants
and certain structured settlement contracts that fund loss runoffs for unrelated parties.
As of December 31, 2004, the total property and casualty reserves in the above table of
$21,885 are gross of the reserve discount of $556.

[2]

Estimated life, annuity and disability obligations include death and disability claims,
policy surrenders, policyholder dividends and trail commissions offset by expected future
deposits and premiums on in-force contracts. Estimated contractual policyholder obligations
are based on mortality, morbidity and lapse assumptions comparable with Life’s historical
experience, modified for recent observed trends. Life has also assumed market growth and
interest crediting consistent with assumptions used in amortizing deferred acquisition costs.
In contrast to this table, the majority of Life’s obligations are recorded on the balance
sheet at the current account value, as described in Critical Accounting Estimates, and do not
incorporate an expectation of future market growth, interest crediting, or future deposits.
Therefore, the estimated contractual policyholder obligations presented in this table
significantly exceed the liabilities recorded in reserve for future policy benefits and unpaid
claims and claim adjustment expenses, other policyholder funds and benefits payable and
separate account liabilities. Due to the significance of the assumptions used, the amounts
presented could materially differ from actual results. As separate account obligations are
legally insulated from general account obligations, the separate account obligations will be
fully funded by cash flows from separate account assets. Life expects to fully fund the
general account obligations from cash flows from general account investments and future
deposits and premiums.

[3]

Includes contractual principal and interest payments. Payments exclude amounts associated
with fair-value hedges of certain of the Company’s long-term debt. All long-term debt
obligations have fixed rates of interest. Long-term debt obligations also includes principal
and interest payments of $700 and $2.4 billion, respectively, related to junior subordinated
debentures which are callable beginning in 2006. See Note 14 of Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements for additional discussion of long-term debt obligations.

[4]

Includes $1.4 billion in commitments to purchase investments including $330 of limited
partnerships and $299 of mortgage loans. Outstanding commitments under these limited
partnerships and mortgage loans are included in payments due in less than 1 year since the
timing of funding these commitments cannot be estimated. The remaining $759 relates to
payables for securities purchased which are reflected on the Company’s consolidated balance
sheet.

[5]

Includes estimated contribution of $200 to the Company’s pension plan in 2005.

[6]

As of December 31, 2004, the Company has accepted cash collateral of $1.6 billion in
connection with the Company’s securities lending program and derivative instruments. Since
the timing of the return of the collateral is uncertain, the return of the collateral has been
included in the payments due in less than 1 year.

[7]

Includes $52 in collateralized loan obligations (“CLOs”) issued to third-party investors by a
consolidated investment management entity sponsored by the Company in connection with
synthetic CLO transactions. The CLO investors have no recourse to the Company’s assets other
than the dedicated assets collateralizing the CLOs. Refer to Note 4 of Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements for additional discussion of CLOs.



Pension Plans and Other Postretirement Benefits

The Company maintains a U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plan (the “Plan”) that covers
substantially all employees, as well as unfunded excess plans to provide benefits in excess of
amounts permitted to be paid to participants of the Plan under the provisions of the Internal
Revenue Code. Additionally, the Company has entered into individual retirement agreements with
certain current and retired directors providing for unfunded supplemental pension benefits. The
Company maintains international plans which represent an immaterial percentage of total pension
assets, liabilities and expense and, for reporting purposes, are combined with domestic plans.

In September 2003, the Company announced its approval to amend the Plan to implement, effective
January 1, 2009, the cash balance formula for purposes of calculating future pension benefits for
services rendered on or after January 1, 2009 for employees hired before January 1, 2001. These
amounts are in addition to amounts earned through December 31, 2008 under the traditional final
average pay formula. Employees hired on or after January 1, 2001 are currently covered under the
same cash balance formula.

The Company made voluntary contributions of $317, $306 and $0 in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively,
to its defined benefit pension plans. Pension expense reflected in the Company’s net income was
$104, $120 and $67 in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The Company estimates its 2005 pension
expense will be approximately $133, based on current assumptions provided below. The assumptions
that primarily impact the amount of the Company’s pension obligations and periodic pension expense
are the weighted-average discount rate and the Plan asset portfolio’s expected long-term rate of
return.

In determining the discount rate assumption, the Company utilizes current market information
provided by its plan actuaries, including a discounted cash flow analysis of the Company’s pension
obligation and general movements in the current market environment. In particular, the Company
uses an interest rate yield curve developed by its plan actuaries to make judgments pursuant to
EITF Topic No. D-36, “Selection of Discount Rates Used for Measuring Defined Benefit Pension
Obligations and Obligations of Postretirement Benefit Plans Other Than Pensions”. The yield curve
is comprised of bonds rated AA or higher with maturities primarily between zero and thirty years.
Based upon all available information, it was determined that 5.75% was the appropriate discount
rate as of December 31, 2004 to calculate the Company’s accrued benefit liability. Accordingly, as
prescribed by SFAS No. 87, “Employers’ Accounting for Pensions”, the 5.75% discount rate will also
be used to determine the Company’s 2005 pension expense. At December 31, 2003, the discount rate
was 6.25%.

The Company determines the long-term rate of return assumption for the Plan’s asset portfolio based
on analysis of the portfolio’s historical compound rates of return since 1979 (the earliest date
for which comparable portfolio data is available) and over rolling 5 year, 10 year and 20 year
periods, balanced along with future long-term return expectations. The Company selected these
periods, as well as shorter durations, to assess the portfolio’s volatility, duration and total
returns as they relate to pension obligation characteristics, which are influenced by the Company’s
workforce demographics. While the historical return of the Plan’s portfolio has been 11.16% since
1979, management maintained its long-term rate of return assumption at 8.50% as of December 31,
2004 based on its long-term outlook with respect to the markets.

The Plan’s asset portfolio is generally structured over time to include approximately 60% equity
securities (substantially securities issued by United States-based companies) and 40% fixed income
securities (substantially investment grade and above). At December 31, 2004, the portfolio
composition varied slightly from the targeted mix and was approximately 67% equity securities and
33% fixed income securities due in part to a rebound in the equity markets and declining interest
rates.

As provided for under SFAS No. 87, the Company uses a five-year averaging method to determine the
market-related value of Plan assets, which is used to determine the expected return component of
pension expense. Under this methodology, asset gains/losses that result from returns that differ
from the Company’s long-term rate of return assumption are recognized in the market-related value
of assets on a level basis over a five year period. The actual asset returns for the Plan of $289
and $334 for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively, reflect improved equity
market performance, as compared to expected returns of $201 and $184 for the years ended December
31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. These differentials will be fully reflected in the market-related
value of Plan assets over the next five years using the methodology described above. Despite the
favorable 2004 actual asset return, the level of unrecognized net losses continues to exceed the
allowable amortization corridor as defined under SFAS No. 87. Based on the selected 2005 discount
rate of 5.75% and taking into account estimated future minimum funding, the differential between
actual and expected performance in 2004 will decrease annual pension expense in future years by
approximately $4 in 2005 and by approximately $22 in 2009.

At December 31, 2004, the change in the discount rate from 6.25% (as of December 31, 2003) to 5.75%
(as of December 31, 2004) increased the projected benefit obligation (“PBO”) by $219. The effect
of this increase in PBO will serve to increase annual pension expense by approximately $16,
assuming no future changes in discount rates going forward. In addition, the decrease in discount
rate will also increase the service cost component of pension expense by approximately $9.

Changes in the economic assumptions used to determine pension expense will impact the Company’s
pension expense. As mentioned earlier, the two economic assumptions that have the most impact on
pension expense are the discount rate and the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. To
illustrate the impact of these assumptions on annual pension expense for 2005 and going forward, a
25 basis point change in the discount rate will increase/decrease pension expense by approximately
$13, and a 25 basis point change in the long-term asset return assumption will increase/decrease
pension expense by approximately $6.



The Company presently anticipates contributing approximately $200 to its pension plans in 2005,
based upon certain economic and business assumptions. These assumptions include, but are not
limited to, equity market performance, changes in interest rates and the Company’s other capital
requirements. The Company’s 2005 required minimum funding contributions are estimated to be
approximately $1.

Capitalization

The capital structure of The Hartford as of December 31, 2004 and 2003 consisted of debt and

Includes junior subordinated debentures $704 and $952 and debt associated with equity
units of $1,020 and $1,020 as of December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively.

The Hartford’s total capitalization increased $1.9 billion as of December 31, 2004 as compared
with December 31, 2003. This increase was due to a $2.6 billion increase in equity partially offset
by a $731 decrease in debt. The increase in total stockholders’ equity is primarily due to net
income of $2.1 billion, the issuance of common stock of $411 and a $179 increase in AOCI. The
increase in AOCI is primarily the result of Life’s adoption of SOP 03-1, which resulted in a $292
cumulative effect for unrealized gains on securities in the first quarter of 2004 related to the
reclassification of investments from separate account assets to general account assets, partially
offset by net unrealized losses on cash-flow hedging instruments. The decrease in total debt
reflects repayments of commercial paper of $477 and senior notes of $200 and the redemption of $250
of junior subordinated debentures, offset by the issuance of $200 in 4.75% senior notes.

Debt

The following discussion describes the Company’s debt financing activities for 2004.

For the year ended December 31, 2004, the Company repaid $477 of commercial paper utilizing the
proceeds from the equity offering and internal sources.

On June 15, 2004, HLI repaid $200 of 6.9% senior notes at maturity.

On March 15, 2004, HLI redeemed its 7.2% junior subordinated debentures underlying the trust
preferred securities issued by Hartford Life Capital I.

On March 9, 2004, the Company issued 4.75% senior notes due March 1, 2014 and received net proceeds
of $197. Interest on the notes is payable semi-annually on March 1 and September 1.

For additional information regarding debt, see Note 14 of Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements.

Stockholders’ Equity

Issuance of Common Stock —

On January 22, 2004, The Hartford issued approximately 6.3 million
shares of common stock pursuant to an underwritten offering at a price to the public of $63.25 per
share and received net proceeds of $388. Subsequently, on January 30, 2004, The Hartford issued
approximately 377 thousand shares of common stock pursuant to an underwritten offering at a price
to the public of $63.25 per share and received net proceeds of $23. The Company used the proceeds
from these issuances to repay $411 of commercial paper issued in connection with the CNA
Acquisition.

In September 2004, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized the Company to repurchase up to $1
billion of its securities. The Company’s repurchase authorization permits purchases of common
stock and equity units, which may be in the open market or through privately negotiated
transactions. The Company also may enter into derivative transactions to facilitate future
repurchases of common stock and equity units. The timing of repurchases will be dependent upon
several factors, including the market price of the Company’s securities, the Company’s capital
position, consideration of the effect of any repurchases on the Company’s financial strength or
credit ratings, and other corporate considerations. The repurchase program may be modified,
extended or terminated by the Board of Directors at any time. The Company has made no repurchases
under this program.

Dividends

— On February 17, 2005, The Hartford’s Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend
of $0.29 per share payable on April 1, 2005 to shareholders of record as of March 1, 2005.



On October 21, 2004, The Hartford declared a dividend on its common stock of $0.29 per share
payable on January 3, 2005 to shareholders of record as of December 1, 2004.

The Hartford declared $331 and paid $325 in dividends to shareholders in 2004, declared $300 and
paid $291 in dividends to shareholders in 2003, declared $262 and paid $257 in 2002.

AOCI

- AOCI increased by $179 as of December 31, 2004 compared with December 31, 2003. The
increase in AOCI is primarily the result of Life’s adoption of SOP 03-1, which resulted in a $292
cumulative effect for unrealized gains on securities in the first quarter of 2004 related to the
reclassification of investments from separate account assets to general account assets, partially
offset by net unrealized losses on cash-flow hedging instruments.

The funded status of the Company’s pension and postretirement plans is dependent upon many
factors, including returns on invested assets and the level of market interest rates. Declines in
the value of securities traded in equity markets coupled with declines in long-term interest rates
have had a negative impact on the funded status of the plans. As a result, the Company recorded a
minimum pension liability as of December 31, 2004, and 2003, which resulted in an after-tax
reduction of stockholders’ equity of $480 and $375 respectively. This minimum pension liability
did not affect the Company’s results of operations.

For additional information on stockholders’ equity and AOCI see Notes 15 and 16, respectively, of
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

2004 Compared to 2003 —

Cash from operating activities primarily reflects premium cash flows
in excess of claim payments. The decrease in cash provided by operating activities was due
primarily to the $1.15 billion settlement of the MacArthur litigation in 2004. Cash provided by
financing activities decreased primarily due to lower proceeds from investment and universal
life-type contracts as a result of the adoption of SOP 03-1, decreased capital raising activities,
repayment of commercial paper and early retirement of junior subordinated debentures in 2004. The
decrease in cash from financing activities and operating cash flows invested long-term accounted
for the majority of the change in cash used for investing activities.

2003 Compared to 2002—

The increase in cash provided by operating activities was primarily the
result of strong premium cash flows. Financing activities increased primarily due to capital
raising activities related to the 2003 asbestos reserve addition and decreased due to repayments on
long-term debt and lower proceeds from investment and universal life-type contracts. The increase
in cash from financing activities accounted for the majority of the change in cash used for
investing activities.

Operating cash flows in each of the last three years have been adequate to meet liquidity
requirements.

Equity Markets

Capital Markets Risk Management section under “Market Risk”.

Ratings

Ratings are an important factor in establishing the competitive position in the insurance and
financial services marketplace. There can be no assurance that the Company’s ratings will continue
for any given period of time or that they will not be changed. In the event the Company’s ratings
are downgraded, the level of revenues or the persistency of the Company’s business may be adversely
impacted.

On August 4, 2004, Moody’s affirmed the Company’s and Hartford Life, Inc.’s A3 senior debt ratings
as well as the Aa3 insurance financial strength ratings of both its property-casualty and life
insurance operating subsidiaries. In addition, Moody’s changed the outlook for all of these
ratings from negative to stable.

Since the announcement of the suit filed by the New York Attorney General’s Office against Marsh &
McLennan Companies, Inc., and Marsh, Inc. on October 14, 2004, the major independent ratings
agencies have indicated that they continue to monitor developments relating to the suit. On
October 22, 2004, Standard & Poor’s revised its outlook on the U.S. property/casualty commercial
lines sector to negative from stable. On November 23, 2004, Standard & Poor’s revised its outlook
on the financial strength and credit ratings of the property-casualty insurance subsidiaries to
negative from stable. The outlook on the life insurance subsidiaries and corporate debt was
unaffected.

These ratings are not a recommendation to buy or hold any of The Hartford’s securities and
they may be revised or revoked at any time at the sole discretion of the rating organization.

The agencies consider many factors in determining the final rating of an insurance company. One
consideration is the relative level of statutory surplus necessary to support the business written.
Statutory surplus represents the capital of the insurance company reported in accordance with
accounting practices prescribed by the applicable state insurance department.

The table below sets forth statutory surplus for the Company’s insurance companies.

Risk-based Capital

The National Association of Insurance Commissioners (“NAIC”) has regulations establishing minimum
capitalization requirements based on risk-based capital (“RBC”) formulas for both life and
property and casualty companies. The requirements consist of formulas, which identify companies
that are undercapitalized and require specific regulatory actions. The RBC formula for life
companies establishes capital requirements relating to insurance, business, asset and interest
rate risks. RBC is calculated for property and casualty companies after adjusting capital for
certain underwriting, asset, credit and off-balance sheet risks. As of December 31, 2004, each of
The Hartford’s insurance subsidiaries within Life and Ongoing Property & Casualty had more than
sufficient capital to meet the NAIC’s minimum RBC requirements.

Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of 2002

The Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of 2002 established a program that will run through 2005 that
provides a backstop for insurance-related losses resulting from any “act of terrorism” certified by
the Secretary of the Treasury, in concurrence with the Secretary of State and Attorney General.
Under the program, the federal government would pay 90% of covered losses after an insurer’s losses
exceed 15% of the Company’s direct commercial earned premiums in 2004, up to a combined annual
aggregate limit for the federal government and all insurers of $100 billion. If an act of
terrorism or acts of terrorism result in covered losses exceeding the $100 billion annual limit,
insurers with losses exceeding their deductibles will not be responsible for additional losses.
The statutory formula for determining a company’s deductible for each year is based on the
company’s direct commercial earned premiums for the prior calendar year multiplied by a specified
percentage. The specified percentage is 15% for 2005.

The Act requires all property and casualty insurers, including The Hartford, to make terrorism
insurance available in all of their covered commercial property and casualty insurance policies (as
defined in the Act). The Act applies to a significant portion of The Hartford’s commercial
property and casualty contracts, but it specifically excludes some of The Hartford’s other
insurance business, including crop or livestock insurance, reinsurance and personal lines business.
The Act does not apply to group life insurance contracts.

The Act is scheduled to expire on December 31, 2005. If the Act is not extended or renewed, the
Company is exposed to terrorism losses in 2006 that would otherwise have been covered by the Act,
including terrorism losses arising on policies written in 2005 that expire after December 31, 2005.
The Department of Treasury is required to provide Congress its findings and recommendations
related to the Act by June 30, 2005. In the event the Act is not renewed, or is renewed in a
materially different form, the Company



may attempt to obtain appropriate reinsurance for the related terrorism risk, limit certain of its
writings, or pursue a solution encompassing aspects of one or all of the foregoing (see Property &
Casualty of MD&A).

Contingencies

Legal Proceedings

- For a discussion regarding contingencies related to The Hartford’s legal
proceedings, please see Item 3, “Legal Proceedings”.

Dependence on Certain Third Party Relationships

-

The Company distributes its annuity, life and
certain property and casualty insurance products through a variety of distribution channels,
including broker-dealers, banks, wholesalers, its own internal sales force and other third party
organizations. The Company periodically negotiates provisions and renewals of these relationships
and there can be no assurance that such terms will remain acceptable to the Company or such third
parties. An interruption in the Company’s continuing relationship with certain of these third
parties could materially affect the Company’s ability to market its products.

For a discussion regarding contingencies related to the manner in which The Hartford compensates
brokers and other producers, please see “Overview—Broker Compensation” above.

Regulatory Developments

- For a discussion regarding contingencies related to regulatory
developments that affect The Hartford, please see “Overview—Regulatory Developments” above.

On October 21, 2004, the Financial Services Agency (“FSA”), the Company’s primary regulator in
Japan, issued regulations concerning new reserving methodologies and Solvency Margin Ratio (“SMR”)
standards for variable annuity contracts. The regulations allow a “Standard” methodology and an
“Alternative” methodology to determine required reserve levels and SMR standards. On December 27,
2004, the FSA also issued administrative guidelines that describe the detailed requirements under
the two methodologies. The regulations are scheduled to become effective on April 1, 2005.

The new reserve methodologies and SMR standards would only apply to capital requirements for
Japanese regulatory purposes, and are not directly related to results under accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States. At this time, the Company has decided to adopt the
Standard methodology. While management is still evaluating the impact of the regulations on the
Company’s Japanese operations, at this time, based on the Company’s assessment, the Standard
methodology would require $400 — $650 of additional capital during 2005. This estimate assumes that
the Company will successfully employ various capital management strategies within its discretion
and control, which may include, but are not limited to, product re-filing. The Company also is
currently evaluating certain reinsurance strategies which have the potential to reduce the
additional capital required to $100. These reinsurance strategies would be subject to regulatory
approval, which may not be granted.

For further information on other contingencies, see Note 12 of Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements.

Legislative Initiatives

On July 10, 2003, the Senate Judiciary Committee approved legislation that would have provided for
the creation of a Federal asbestos trust fund in place of the current tort system for determining
asbestos liabilities. The 108

th

Congress concluded without further action on the
proposal. Although Judiciary Committee chair Arlen Specter may likely pursue reform legislation in
the current Congress, the prospects for enactment and the ultimate details of any legislation
creating a Federal asbestos trust fund are uncertain. Therefore, any potential effect on the
Company’s financial condition or results of operations cannot be reasonably estimated at this time.

On November 18, 2004, the House Financial Services Committee approved legislation which would have
extended the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act (TRIA) beyond its December 31, 2005, termination.
Efforts will continue in 2005 to extend TRIA and to enact permanent legislation. The prospects for
enactment of a simple extension or more permanent legislation are uncertain. Therefore, any
potential effect on the Company’s financial condition or results of operations cannot be reasonably
estimated at this time.

President Bush has proposed new investment vehicles with larger annual contribution limits for
individuals and permanent income tax rate reductions and changes to the estate tax. These changes
could have a material effect on sales of the Company’s life insurance and investment products.
Prospects for enactment of this legislation in 2005 are uncertain. Therefore, any potential effect
on the Company’s financial condition or results of operations from such potential legislative
changes cannot be reasonably estimated at this time. The American Jobs Creation Act of 2004
imposes new restrictions on non-qualified deferred compensation plans. The Company does not
believe these changes will have a material effect on the sale of its products.

In addition, other tax proposals and regulatory initiatives which have been or are being considered
by Congress could have a material effect on the insurance business. These proposals and
initiatives include changes pertaining to the tax treatment of insurance companies and life
insurance products and annuities, and reductions in benefits currently received by the Company
stemming from the dividends received deduction. The President has also established an advisory
panel to study reform of the Internal Revenue Code. The panel is scheduled to report its findings
and make recommendations to the Secretary of the Treasury by the end of July, 2005. Legislation to
restructure the Social Security system and expand private pension plans incentives also may be
considered. Prospects for enactment and the ultimate effect of these proposals are uncertain.

Congress is expected to consider provisions regarding age discrimination in defined benefit plans,
transition relief for older and longer service workers affected by changes to traditional defined
benefit pension plans and the replacement of the interest rate used to determine pension plan
funding requirements. These changes could affect the Company’s pension plan.



The President has signed into law the Class Action Fairness Act of 2005. The Act will reduce the
number and type of national class actions certified by state judges by updating the federal rules
on diversity jurisdiction. Any potential effect on the Company cannot be reasonably estimated at
this time.

Congress may consider a number of other legal reform proposals this year. Prospects for enactment
of these proposals in 2005 are uncertain.

Guaranty Fund and Other Insurance-related Assessments

In all states, insurers licensed to transact certain classes of insurance are required to become
members of a guaranty fund. In most states, in the event of the insolvency of an insurer writing
any such class of insurance in the state, members of the fund are assessed to pay certain claims of
the insolvent insurer. A particular state’s fund assesses its members based on their respective
written premiums in the state for the classes of insurance in which the insolvent insurer is
engaged. Assessments are generally limited for any year to one or two percent of premiums written
per year depending on the state. Such assessments paid by The Hartford approximated $23 in 2004,
$26 in 2003 and $26 in 2002.

The Hartford accounts for guaranty fund and other insurance assessments in accordance with
Statement of Position No. 97-3, “Accounting by Insurance and Other Enterprises for
Insurance-Related Assessments”. Liabilities for guaranty fund and other insurance-related
assessments are accrued when an assessment is probable, when it can be reasonably estimated, and
when the event obligating the entity to pay an imposed or probable assessment has occurred.
Liabilities for guaranty funds and other insurance-related assessments are not discounted and are
included as part of other liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of December 31, 2004
and 2003, the liability balance was $215 and $181, respectively. As of December 31, 2004 and 2003,
included in other assets was $14 of related assets for premium tax offsets.

Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures

The Company’s principal executive officer and its principal financial officer, based on their
evaluation of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rule
13a-15(e)), have concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures are effective for
the purposes set forth in the definition thereof in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(e) as of December 31,
2004.

Management’s annual report on internal control over financial reporting

The management of The Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc. and its subsidiaries (“The Hartford”)
is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting
for The Hartford as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable
assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial
statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes policies and
procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and
fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide
reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, and
that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations
of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding
prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the company’s
assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or
detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are
subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that
the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.



The Hartford’s management assessed its internal controls over financial reporting as of December
31, 2004 in relation to criteria for effective internal control over financial reporting described
in “Internal Control — Integrated Framework” issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of
the Treadway Commission. Based on this assessment under those criteria, The Hartford’s management
concluded that its internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2004.

The Hartford’s independent registered public accounting firm, Deloitte & Touche LLP, has issued
their attestation report on management’s assessment of internal control over financial reporting
which is set forth below.

Attestation report of the Company’s registered public accounting firm

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of

The Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc.

Hartford, Connecticut

We have audited management’s assessment, included in the accompanying Management’s Annual Report on
Internal Control Over Financial Reporting, that The Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc. and its
subsidiaries (collectively, the “Company”) maintained effective internal control over financial
reporting as of December 31, 2004, based on the criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated
Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. The
Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial
reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting.
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on management’s assessment and an opinion on the
effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was
maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal
control over financial reporting, evaluating management’s assessment, testing and evaluating the
design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing such other procedures as we
considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis
for our opinions.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the
supervision of, the company’s principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons
performing similar functions, and effected by the company’s board of directors, management, and
other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting
and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes
those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable
detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit
preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles,
and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with
authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance
regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the
possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to
error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Also, projections of any
evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods
are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions,
or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, management’s assessment that the Company maintained effective internal control over
financial reporting as of December 31, 2004, is fairly stated, in all material respects, based on
the criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained,
in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31,
2004, based on the criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States), the consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedules as
of and for the year ended December 31, 2004 of the Company and our report dated February 24, 2005
expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements and financial statement schedules
and included an explanatory paragraph regarding the Company’s change in its method of accounting
and reporting for certain nontraditional long-duration contracts and for separate accounts in 2004.

Changes in internal control over financial reporting

There was no change in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during
the Company’s fourth fiscal quarter of 2004 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely
to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.

Summary Description of the 2000 PLANCO Non-Employee Option Plan

The Company’s Board of Directors adopted the PLANCO Plan on July 20, 2000, and amended it on
February 20, 2003 to increase the number of shares of the Company’s common stock subject to the
plan to 450,000 shares. The stockholders of the Company have not approved the PLANCO Plan.

Eligibility

- Any non-employee independent contractor serving on the wholesale sales force as an
insurance agent who is an exclusive agent of the Company or who derives more than 50% of his or her
annual income from the Company is eligible.

Terms of options

- Nonqualified stock options (“NQSOs”) to purchase shares of common stock are
available for grant under the PLANCO Plan. The administrator of the PLANCO Plan, the Compensation
and Personnel Committee, (i) determines the recipients of options under the PLANCO Plan, (ii)
determines the number of shares of common stock covered by such options, (iii) determines the dates
and the manner in which options become exercisable (which is typically in three equal annual
installments beginning on the first anniversary of the date of grant), (iv) sets the exercise price
of options (which may be less than, equal to or greater than the fair market value of common stock
on the date of grant) and (v) determines the other terms and conditions of each option. Payment of
the exercise price may be made in cash, other shares of the Company’s common stock or through a
same day sale program. The term of an NQSO may not exceed ten years and two days from the date of
grant.

If an optionee’s required relationship with the Company terminates for any reason, other than for
cause, any exercisable options remain exercisable for a fixed period of four months, not to exceed
the remainder of the option’s term. Any options that are not exercisable at the time of such
termination are cancelled on the date of such termination. If the optionee’s required relationship
is terminated for cause, the options are canceled immediately.

Acceleration in Connection with a Change in Control

- Upon the occurrence of a change in control,
each option outstanding on the date of such change in control, and which is not then fully vested
and exercisable, shall immediately vest and become exercisable. In general, a “Change in Control”
will be deemed to have occurred upon the acquisition of 20% or more of the outstanding voting stock
of the Company, a tender or exchange offer to acquire 15% or more of the outstanding voting stock
of the Company, certain mergers or corporate transactions resulting in the shareholders of the
Company before the transactions owning less than 55% of the entity surviving the transactions,
certain transactions involving a transfer of substantially all of the Company’s assets or a change
in greater than 50% of the Board members over a two year period. See Note 18 of Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of The Hartford Incentive Stock Plan and the
ESPP.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of

The Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc.

Hartford, Connecticut

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of The Hartford Financial Services
Group, Inc

.

and its subsidiaries (collectively, the “Company”) as of December 31, 2004 and 2003,
and the related consolidated statements of operations, changes in stockholders’ equity,
comprehensive income, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31,
2004. Our audits also included the financial statement schedules listed in the Index at Item 15.
These financial statements and financial statement schedules are the responsibility of the
Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements
and financial statement schedules based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An
audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the
financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects,
the financial position of The Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc

.

and its subsidiaries as of
December 31, 2004 and 2003, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of
the three years in the period ended December 31, 2004, in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America. Also, in our opinion, such financial statement
schedules, when considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as a
whole, present fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein.

As discussed in Note 1 of the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed its method of
accounting and reporting for certain nontraditional long-duration contracts and for separate
accounts in 2004.

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States), the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting
as of December 31, 2004, based on the criteria established in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated
February 24, 2005 expressed an unqualified opinion on management’s assessment of the effectiveness
of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting and an unqualified opinion on the
effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.

THE HARTFORD FINANCIAL SERVICES GROUP, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(Dollar amounts in millions, except for per share data, unless otherwise stated)

1. Basis of Presentation and Accounting Policies

Basis of Presentation

The Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc. is a financial holding company for a group of
subsidiaries that provide investment products and life and property and casualty insurance to both
individual and business customers in the United States and internationally (collectively, “The
Hartford” or the “Company”).

The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the basis of accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America, which differ materially from the accounting
practices prescribed by various insurance regulatory authorities.

Consolidation

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of The Hartford Financial Services
Group, Inc., companies in which the Company directly or indirectly has a controlling financial
interest and those variable interest entities in which the Company is the primary beneficiary.
Entities in which The Hartford has significant influence over the operating and financing decisions
are reported using the equity method. All material intercompany transactions and balances between
The Hartford and its subsidiaries and affiliates have been eliminated.

In 2004, the Company sponsored and purchased an investment interest in a synthetic collateralized
loan obligation transaction, a variable interest entity (“VIE”) for which the Company determined
itself to be the primary beneficiary. Accordingly, the assets, liabilities and results of
operations of the entity are included in the Company’s consolidated financial statements. For
further discussion of the synthetic collateralized loan transaction see Note 4.

On December 31, 2003, the Company acquired the group life and accident, and short-term and
long-term disability business of CNA Financial Corporation. Revenues and expenses of this acquired
business are included in the Company’s results of operations subsequent to December 31, 2003. For
further discussion of the CNA Financial Corporation acquisition, see Note 20.

Use of Estimates

The preparation of financial statements, in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America, requires management to make estimates and assumptions
that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and
liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and
expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

The most significant estimates include those used in determining insurance reserves; Life
operations deferred policy acquisition costs and present value of future profits; the valuation of
investments and derivative instruments and the evaluation of other-than-temporary impairments;
pension and other postretirement benefits; and contingencies.

Reclassifications

Certain reclassifications have been made to prior year financial information to conform to the
current year presentation.

Adoption of New Accounting Standards

In July 2003, the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (“AICPA”) issued Statement of
Position (“SOP”) 03-1, “Accounting and Reporting by Insurance Enterprises for Certain
Nontraditional Long-Duration Contracts and for Separate Accounts” (“SOP 03-1”). SOP 03-1 addresses
a wide variety of topics, some of which have a significant impact on the Company. The major
provisions of SOP 03-1 require:

•

Recognizing expenses for a variety of contracts and
contract features, including guaranteed minimum death
benefits (“GMDB”), certain death benefits on universal-life
type contracts and annuitization options, on an accrual basis
versus the previous method of recognition upon payment;

•

Reporting and measuring assets and liabilities of
certain separate account products as general account assets
and liabilities when specified criteria are not met;

•

Reporting and measuring the Company’s interest in its
separate accounts as general account assets based on the
insurer’s proportionate beneficial interest in the separate
account’s underlying assets; and

•

Capitalizing sales inducements that meet specified
criteria and amortizing such amounts over the life of the
contracts using the same methodology as used for amortizing
deferred acquisition costs (“DAC”).

F-7


NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)

1. Basis of Presentation and Accounting Policies (continued)

SOP 03-1 was effective for financial statements for fiscal years beginning after December 15,
2003. At the date of initial application, January 1, 2004, the cumulative effect of the adoption
of SOP 03-1 on net income and other comprehensive income was comprised of the following individual
impacts shown net of income tax benefit of $12:

Characteristics of both Liabilities and Equity”. SFAS No. 150 establishes standards for
classifying and measuring as liabilities certain financial instruments that embody obligations of
the issuer and have characteristics of both liabilities and equity. Generally, SFAS No. 150
requires liability classification for two broad classes of financial instruments: (a) instruments
that represent, or are indexed to, an obligation to buy back the issuer’s shares regardless of
whether the instrument is settled on a net-cash or gross-physical basis and (b) obligations that
(i) can be settled in shares but derive their value predominately from another underlying
instrument or index (e.g. security prices, interest rates, and currency rates), (ii) have a fixed
value, or (iii) have a value inversely related to the issuer’s shares. Mandatorily redeemable
equity and written options requiring the issuer to buyback shares are examples of financial
instruments that should be reported as liabilities under this new guidance. SFAS No. 150 specifies
accounting only for certain freestanding financial instruments and does not affect whether an
embedded derivative must be bifurcated and accounted for separately. SFAS No. 150 was effective
for instruments entered into or modified after May 31, 2003 and for all other instruments beginning
with the first interim reporting period beginning after June 15, 2003. Adoption of this statement
did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial condition or results of
operations.

In January 2003, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 46, “Consolidation of Variable Interest
Entities, an interpretation of ARB No. 51” (“FIN 46”), which required an enterprise to assess
whether consolidation of an entity is appropriate based upon its interests in a variable interest
entity. A VIE is an entity in which the equity investors do not have the characteristics of a
controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance
its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties. The initial
determination of whether an entity is a VIE shall be made on the date at which an enterprise
becomes involved with the entity. An enterprise shall consolidate a VIE if it has a variable
interest that will absorb a majority of the VIEs expected losses if they occur, receive a majority
of the entity’s expected residual returns if they occur or both. FIN 46 was effective immediately
for new VIEs established or purchased subsequent to January 31, 2003. For VIEs established or
purchased subsequent to January 31, 2003, the adoption of FIN 46 did not have a material impact on
the Company’s consolidated financial condition or results of operations as there were no material
VIEs which required consolidation.

In December 2003, the FASB issued a revised version of FIN 46 (“FIN 46R”), which incorporated a
number of modifications and changes made to the original version. FIN 46R replaced the previously
issued FIN 46 and, subject to certain special provisions, was effective no later than the end of
the first reporting period that ends after December 15, 2003 for entities considered to be
special-purpose entities and no later than the end of the first reporting period that ends after
March 15, 2004 for all other VIEs. Early adoption was permitted. The Company adopted FIN 46R in
the fourth quarter of 2003. The adoption of FIN 46R did not result in the consolidation of any
material VIEs but resulted in the deconsolidation of VIEs that issued Mandatorily Redeemable
Preferred Securities of Subsidiary Trusts (“trust preferred securities”). The Company is not the
primary beneficiary of the VIEs, which issued the trust preferred securities. The Company does not
own any of the trust preferred securities which were issued to unrelated third parties. These
trust preferred securities are considered the principal variable interests issued by the VIEs. As
a result, the VIEs, which the Company previously consolidated, are no longer consolidated. The
sole assets of the VIEs are junior subordinated debentures issued by the Company with payment terms
identical to the trust preferred securities. Previously, the trust preferred securities were
reported as a separate liability on the Company’s consolidated balance sheets as “company obligated
mandatorily redeemable preferred securities of subsidiary trusts holding solely junior subordinated
debentures”. At December 31, 2003 and 2002, the impact of deconsolidation was to increase
long-term debt and decrease the trust preferred securities by $952 and $1.5 billion, respectively.
(For further discussion, see Note 14 for disclosure of information related to these VIEs as
required under FIN 46R.)

Future Adoption of New Accounting Standards

In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004), “Share-Based Payment” (“SFAS No.
123R”), which replaces SFAS No. 123, “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation” (“SFAS No. 123”) and
supercedes APB Opinion No. 25, “Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees”. SFAS No. 123R requires
all companies to recognize compensation costs for share-based payments to employees based on the
grant-date fair value of the award for financial statements for reporting periods beginning after
June 15, 2005. The pro forma disclosures previously permitted under SFAS No. 123 will no longer be
an alternative to financial statement recognition. The transition methods include prospective and
retrospective adoption options. The prospective method requires that

F-8


NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)

compensation expense be recorded for all unvested stock-based awards including those granted
prior to adoption of the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123, at the beginning of the
first quarter of adoption of SFAS No.123R, while the retrospective methods would record
compensation expense for all unvested stock-based awards beginning with the first period restated.
The Company will adopt SFAS No. 123R in the third quarter of fiscal 2005 using the prospective
method. In January 2003, the Company began expensing all stock-based compensation awards granted
or modified after January 1, 2003 under the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123 and
therefore, the adoption is not expected to have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated
financial condition or results of operations.

In March 2004, the Emerging Issues Task Force (“EITF”) reached a final consensus on EITF Issue No.
03-1, “The Meaning of Other-Than-Temporary Impairment and Its Application to Certain Investments”
(“EITF Issue No. 03-1”). EITF Issue No. 03-1 was effective for periods beginning after June 15,
2004 and adopts a three-step impairment model for securities within its scope. The three-step
model must be applied on a security-by-security basis as follows:

Step 1:

Determine whether an investment is impaired. An investment is
impaired if the fair value of the investment is less than its cost
basis.

Step 2:

Evaluate whether an impairment is other-than-temporary. For debt
securities that cannot be contractually prepaid or otherwise
settled in such a way that the investor would not recover
substantially all of its cost, an impairment is deemed
other-than-temporary if the investor does not have the ability and
intent to hold the investment until a forecasted market price
recovery or it is probable that the investor will be unable to
collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the
debt security.

Step 3:

If the impairment is other-than-temporary, recognize an impairment
loss equal to the difference between the investment’s cost basis
and its fair value.

Subsequent to an other-than-temporary impairment loss, a debt security should be accounted for in
accordance with SOP 03-3, “Accounting for Certain Loans and Debt Securities Acquired in a Transfer”
(“SOP 03-3”). SOP 03-3 requires that the amount of a security’s expected cash flows in excess of
the investor’s initial cost or amortized cost investment be recognized as interest income on a
level-yield basis over the life of the security. EITF Issue No. 03-1 does not replace the
impairment guidance for investments accounted for under EITF Issue No. 99-20, “Recognition of
Interest Income and Impairments on Purchased and Retained Beneficial Interests in Securitized
Financial Assets” (“EITF Issue No. 99-20”), however, it requires investors to determine if a
security is other-than-temporarily impaired under EITF Issue No. 03-1 if the security is determined
not to be other-than-temporarily impaired under EITF Issue No. 99-20.

In September 2004, the FASB staff issued clarifying guidance for comment in FASB Staff Position
(“FSP”) EITF Issue No. 03-1-a, “Implementation Guidance for the Application of Paragraph 16 of EITF
Issue No. 03-1” (“FSP Issue No. 03-1-a”) and subsequently voted to delay the implementation of the
impairment measurement and recognition guidance contained in paragraphs 10–20 of EITF Issue No.
03-1 in order to redeliberate certain aspects of the consensus as well as the implementation
guidance included in FSP Issue No. 03-1-a. The disclosure requirements including quantitative and
qualitative information regarding investments in an unrealized loss position remain effective and
are included in Note 4.

The ultimate impact the adoption of EITF Issue No. 03-1 will have on the Company’s consolidated
financial condition and results of operations is still unknown. Depending on the nature of the
ultimate guidance, adoption of the standard could potentially result in the recognition of
unrealized losses, including those declines in value that are attributable to interest rate
movements, as other-than-temporary impairments, except those deemed to be minor in nature. As of
December 31, 2004, the Company had $265 of total gross unrealized losses. The amount of
impairments to be recognized, if any, will depend on the final standard, market conditions and
management’s intent and ability to hold securities with unrealized losses at the time of the
impairment evaluation.

Stock-Based Compensation

In January 2003, the Company began expensing all stock-based compensation awards granted or
modified after January 1, 2003 under the fair value recognition provisions of Statement of
Financial Accounting Standard (“SFAS”) No. 123 “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation”. The fair
value of stock-based awards granted during the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003 were $43 and
$42, respectively, after-tax. The fair value of these awards will be recognized as expense over
the awards’ vesting periods, generally three years.

Prior to January 1, 2004, the Company used the Black-Scholes model to determine the fair value of
the Company’s stock-based compensation. For all awards granted or modified on or after January 1,
2004, the Company uses a binomial option-pricing model that incorporates the possibility of early
exercise of options into the valuation. The binomial model also incorporates the Company’s
historical forfeiture and exercise experience to determine the option value. For these reasons,
the Company believes the binomial model provides a fair value that is more representative of actual
experience than the value calculated under the Black-Scholes model.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)

1. Basis of Presentation and Accounting Policies (continued)

All stock-based awards granted or modified prior to January 1, 2003 continue to be valued
using the intrinsic value-based provisions set forth in Accounting Principles Board (“APB”) Opinion
No. 25, “Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees”. Under the intrinsic value method, compensation
expense is determined on the measurement date, which is the first date on which both the number of
shares the employee is entitled to receive and the exercise price are known. Compensation expense,
if any, is measured based on the award’s intrinsic value, which is the excess of the market price
of the stock over the exercise price on the measurement date, and is recognized over the award’s
vesting period. The expense, including non-option plans, related to stock-based employee
compensation included in the determination of net income for the years ended December 31, 2004,
2003 and 2002 is less than that which would have been recognized if the fair value method had been
applied to all awards since the effective date of SFAS No. 123. For further discussion of the
Company’s stock-based compensation plans, see Note 18.

The following table illustrates the effect on net income (loss) and earnings (loss) per share
(basic and diluted) as if the fair value method had been applied to all outstanding and unvested
awards in each period. The pro-forma fair values disclosed below related to awards granted prior
to 2004 were calculated using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model and were not recalculated
using the binomial model. The change in valuation methodology would have an immaterial impact on
the pro-forma net income amounts disclosed.

[3]

As a result of the net loss for the year ended December 31, 2003, SFAS No. 128, “Earnings Per Share”, requires the Company to use
basic weighted average common shares outstanding in the calculation of the year ended December 31, 2003 diluted earnings (loss)
per share, since the inclusion of options of 1.8 would have been antidilutive to the earnings per share calculation. In the
absence of the net loss, weighted average common shares outstanding and dilutive potential common shares would have totaled 274.2.

The fair value of each option grant is estimated on the date of the grant using the following
weighted average or range assumptions for grants in 2004, 2003 and 2002:

The expected life of options granted in 2004 is an output derived from the binomial

The use of the fair value recognition method results in compensation expense being recognized in
the financial statements at different amounts and in different periods than the related income tax
deduction. Generally, the compensation expense recognized under SFAS No. 123 will result in a
deferred tax asset since the stock compensation expense is not deductible for tax until the option
is exercised. Deferred tax assets arising under SFAS No. 123 are evaluated as to future
realizability to determine whether a valuation allowance is necessary. (For further discussion, see
Note 13.)

Investments

The Hartford’s investments in fixed maturities, which include bonds, redeemable preferred stock and
commercial paper; and certain equity securities, which include common and non-redeemable preferred
stocks, are classified as “available-for-sale” as defined in SFAS No. 115, “Accounting for Certain
Investments in Debt and Equity Securities” (“SFAS No. 115”). Accordingly, these securities are
carried at fair value with the after-tax difference from amortized cost, as adjusted for the effect
of deducting the life and pension policyholders’ share of the immediate participation guaranteed
contracts and certain life and annuity deferred policy acquisition costs, reflected in
stockholders’ equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (“AOCI”). The equity
investments associated with the variable annuity products offered in Japan are recorded at fair
value and are classified as “trading” as defined in

SFAS No. 115, with changes in fair value recorded in net investment income. Policy loans are
carried at outstanding balance, which approximates fair value. Other investments primarily consist
of limited partnership interests, derivatives and mortgage loans. Limited partnerships are
accounted for under the equity method and accordingly the Company’s share of partnership earnings
are included in net investment income. Derivatives are carried at fair value and mortgage loans on
real estate are recorded at the outstanding principal balance adjusted for amortization of premiums
or discounts and net of valuation allowances, if any.

Valuation of Fixed Maturities

The fair value for fixed maturity securities is largely determined by one of three primary pricing
methods: independent third party pricing service market quotations, independent broker quotations
or pricing matrices, which use data provided by external sources. With the exception of short-term
securities for which amortized cost is predominantly used to approximate fair value, security
pricing is applied using a hierarchy or “waterfall” approach whereby prices are first sought from
independent pricing services with the remaining unpriced securities submitted to brokers for prices
or lastly priced via a pricing matrix.

Prices from independent pricing services are often unavailable for securities that are rarely
traded or are traded only in privately negotiated transactions. As a result, certain of the
Company’s asset-backed and commercial mortgage-backed securities are priced via broker quotations.
A pricing matrix is used to price securities for which the Company is unable to obtain either a
price from an independent third party service or an independent broker quotation. The pricing
matrix begins with current treasury rates and uses credit spreads and issuer-specific yield
adjustments received from an independent third party source to determine the market price for the
security. The credit spreads incorporate the issuer’s credit rating as assigned by a nationally
recognized rating agency and a risk premium, if warranted, due to the issuer’s industry and the
security’s time to maturity. The issuer-specific yield adjustments, which can be positive or
negative, are updated twice annually, as of June 30 and December 31, by an independent third-party
source and are intended to adjust security prices for issuer-specific factors. The matrix-priced
securities at December 31, 2004 and 2003, primarily consisted of non-144A private placements and
have an average duration of 4.8 and 4.6, respectively.

The following table identifies the fair value of fixed maturity securities by pricing source as of

Effective January 1, 2004, guaranteed separate account assets were included with general account assets as a result of adopting SOP 03-1.

The fair value of a financial instrument is the amount at which the instrument could be
exchanged in a current transaction between knowledgeable, unrelated willing parties. As such, the
estimated fair value of a financial instrument may differ significantly from the amount that could
be realized if the security was sold immediately.

Other-Than-Temporary Impairments

One of the significant estimations inherent in the valuation of investments is the evaluation of
other-than-temporary impairments. The evaluation of impairments is a quantitative and qualitative
process, which is subject to risks and uncertainties and is intended to determine whether declines
in the fair value of investments should be recognized in current period earnings. The risks and
uncertainties include changes in general economic conditions, the issuer’s financial condition or
near term recovery prospects and the effects of changes in interest rates. The Company’s
accounting policy requires that a decline in the value of a security below its amortized cost basis
be assessed to determine if the decline is other-than-temporary. If the security is deemed to be
other-than-temporarily impaired, a charge is recorded in net realized capital losses equal to the
difference between the fair value and amortized cost basis of the security. In addition, for
securities expected to be sold, an other-than-temporary impairment charge is recognized if the
Company does not expect the fair value of a security to recover to amortized cost prior to the
expected date of sale. The fair value of the other-than-temporarily impaired investment becomes
its new cost basis. The Company has a security monitoring process overseen by a committee of
investment and accounting professionals (“the committee”) that identifies securities that, due to
certain characteristics, as described below, are subjected to an enhanced analysis on a quarterly
basis.

Securities not subject to EITF Issue No. 99-20 (“non-EITF Issue No. 99-20 securities”) that are in
an unrealized loss position, are reviewed at least quarterly to determine if an
other-than-temporary impairment is present based on certain quantitative and qualitative factors.
The primary factors considered in evaluating whether a decline in value for non-EITF Issue No.
99-20 securities is other-

F-11


NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)

1. Basis of Presentation and Accounting Policies (continued)

than-temporary include: (a) the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been
less than cost, (b) the financial condition, credit rating and near-term prospects of the issuer,
(c) whether the debtor is current on contractually obligated interest and principal payments and
(d) the intent and ability of the Company to retain the investment for a period of time sufficient
to allow for recovery. Non-EITF Issue No. 99-20 securities depressed by twenty percent or more for
six months are presumed to be other-than-temporarily impaired unless significant objective
verifiable evidence supports that the security price is temporarily depressed and is expected to
recover within a reasonable period of time. The evaluation of non-EITF Issue No. 99-20 securities
depressed more than ten percent is documented and discussed quarterly by the committee.

For certain securitized financial assets with contractual cash flows (including asset-backed
securities), EITF Issue No. 99-20 requires the Company to periodically update its best estimate of
cash flows over the life of the security. If the fair value of a securitized financial asset is
less than its carrying amount and there has been a decrease in the present value of the estimated
cash flows since the last revised estimate, considering both timing and amount, then an
other-than-temporary impairment charge is recognized. Estimating future cash flows is a
quantitative and qualitative process that incorporates information received from third party
sources along with certain internal assumptions and judgments regarding the future performance of
the underlying collateral. As a result, actual results may differ from current estimates. In
addition, projections of expected future cash flows may change based upon new information regarding
the performance of the underlying collateral.

Once an impairment charge has been recorded, the Company then continues to review the
other-than-temporarily impaired securities for additional other-than-temporary impairments. The
ultimate completion of EITF Issue No. 03-1 may impact the Company’s current other-than-temporary
impairment evaluation process. (For further discussion of EITF Issue No. 03-1, see the Future
Adoption of New Accounting Standards section of Note 1.)

Net Realized Capital Gains and Losses

Net realized capital gains and losses, after deducting the life and pension policyholders’ share
and related amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs for certain Life products, are
reported as a component of revenues and are determined on a specific identification basis. Net
realized capital gains and losses on security transactions associated with the Company’s immediate
participation guaranteed contracts are recorded and offset by amounts owed to policyholders and
were less than $1 for the year ended December 31, 2004 and were $1 for the years ended December 31,
2003 and 2002. Under the terms of the contracts, the net realized capital gains and losses will be
credited to policyholders in future years as they are entitled to receive them.

Net Investment Income

Interest income from fixed maturities is recognized when earned on a constant effective yield basis
based on estimated principal repayments, if applicable. Prepayment fees are recorded in net
investment income when earned. The Company stops recognizing interest income when it does not
expect to receive amounts in accordance with the contractual terms of the security. Interest
income on these investments is recognized only when interest payments are received.

Derivative Instruments

Overview

The Company utilizes a variety of derivative instruments, including swaps, caps, floors, forwards,
futures and options through one of four Company-approved objectives: to hedge risk arising from
interest rate, price or currency exchange rate volatility; to manage liquidity; to control
transaction costs; or to enter into replication transactions. (For a further discussion of
derivative instruments, see the Derivative Instruments section of Note 4.)

The Company’s derivative transactions are permitted uses of derivatives under the derivatives use
plan filed and/or approved, as applicable, by the State of Connecticut, the State of Illinois and
the State of New York insurance departments. The Company does not make a market or trade in these
instruments for the express purpose of earning short-term trading profits.

Accounting and Financial Statement Presentation of Derivative Instruments and Hedging
Activities

Derivatives are recognized on the balance sheet at fair value. Fair value is based upon either
independent market quotations or pricing valuation models which utilize independent third party
data as inputs. The derivative contracts are reported as assets or liabilities in other
investments and other liabilities, respectively, in the consolidated balance sheets, excluding
embedded derivatives and guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefits (“GMWB”) reinsurance contracts.
Embedded derivatives are recorded in the consolidated balance sheets with the associated host
instrument. GMWB reinsurance contract amounts are recorded in reinsurance recoverables in the
consolidated balance sheets.

On the date the derivative contract is entered into, the Company designates the derivative as (1) a
hedge of the fair value of a recognized asset or liability (“fair value” hedge), (2) a hedge of a
forecasted transaction or of the variability of cash flows to be received or paid related to a
recognized asset or liability (“cash-flow” hedge), (3) a foreign-currency, fair value or cash-flow
hedge

F-12


NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)

1. Basis of Presentation and Accounting Policies (continued)

(“foreign-currency” hedge), (4) a hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation or (5) held
for other investment and risk management activities, which primarily involve managing asset or
liability related risks which do not qualify for hedge accounting.

Fair-Value Hedges

Changes in the fair value of a derivative that is designated and qualifies as a fair-value hedge,
along with the changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability that is attributable to
the hedged risk, are recorded in current period earnings with any differences between the net
change in fair value of the derivative and the hedged item representing the hedge ineffectiveness.
Periodic derivative net coupon settlements are recorded in net investment income with the exception
of hedges of Company issued debt which are recorded in interest expense.

Cash-Flow Hedges

Changes in the fair value of a derivative that is designated and qualifies as a cash-flow hedge are
recorded in AOCI and are reclassified into earnings when the variability of the cash flow of the
hedged item impacts earnings. Gains and losses on derivative contracts that are reclassified from
AOCI to current period earnings are included in the line item in the consolidated statements of
operations in which the hedged item is recorded. Any hedge ineffectiveness is recorded immediately
in current period earnings as net realized capital gains and losses. Periodic derivative net
coupon settlements are recorded in net investment income.

Foreign-Currency Hedges

Changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as foreign-currency hedges
are recorded in either current period earnings or AOCI, depending on whether the hedged transaction
is a fair-value hedge or a cash-flow hedge, respectively. Any hedge ineffectiveness is recorded
immediately in current period earnings as net realized capital gains and losses. Periodic
derivative net coupon settlements are recorded in net investment income.

Net Investment in a Foreign Operation Hedges

Changes in fair-value of a derivative used as a hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation,
to the extent effective as a hedge, are recorded in the foreign currency translation adjustments
account within AOCI. Cumulative changes in fair value recorded in AOCI are reclassified into
earnings upon the sale or complete or substantially complete liquidation of the foreign entity.
Any hedge ineffectiveness is recorded immediately in current period earnings as net realized
capital gains and losses. Periodic derivative net coupon settlements are recorded in net
investment income.

Other Investment and Risk Management Activities

The Company’s other investment and risk management activities primarily relate to strategies used
to reduce economic risk or enhance income, and do not receive hedge accounting treatment. Changes
in the fair value, including periodic net coupon settlements, of derivative instruments held for
other investment and risk management purposes are reported in current period earnings as net
realized capital gains and losses.

Hedge Documentation and Effectiveness Testing

To qualify for hedge accounting treatment, a derivative must be highly effective in mitigating the
designated change in value of the hedged item. At hedge inception, the Company formally documents
all relationships between hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as its risk-management
objective and strategy for undertaking each hedge transaction. The documentation process includes
linking all derivatives that are designated as fair-value, cash-flow, foreign-currency or
net-investment hedges to specific assets or liabilities on the balance sheet or to specific
forecasted transactions. The Company also formally assesses, both at the hedge’s inception and on
an ongoing basis, whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly
effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of hedged items. Hedge effectiveness
is assessed using qualitative and quantitative methods. Qualitative methods may include comparison
of critical terms of the derivative to the hedged item. Depending on the hedging strategy,
quantitative methods may include the “Change in Variable Cash Flows Method,” the “Change in Fair
Value Method” and the “Hypothetical Derivative Method”. In addition, certain hedging relationships
are considered highly effective if the changes in the fair value or discounted cash flows of the
hedging instrument are within a ratio of 80-125% of the inverse changes in the fair value or
discounted cash flows of the hedged item. If it is determined that a derivative is no longer
highly effective as a hedge, the Company prospectively discontinues hedge accounting in the period
in which the derivative became ineffective.

Discontinuance of Hedge Accounting

The Company discontinues hedge accounting prospectively when (1) it is determined that the
derivative is no longer highly effective in offsetting changes in the fair value or cash flows of a
hedged item; (2) the derivative is dedesignated as a hedging instrument, because it is unlikely
that a forecasted transaction will occur; or (3) the derivative expires or is sold, terminated, or
exercised.

F-13


NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)

1. Basis of Presentation and Accounting Policies (continued)

When hedge accounting is discontinued because it is determined that the derivative no longer
qualifies as an effective fair-value hedge, the derivative continues to be carried at fair value on
the balance sheet with changes in its fair value recognized in current period earnings.

When hedge accounting is discontinued because the Company becomes aware that it is not probable
that the forecasted transaction will occur, the derivative continues to be carried on the balance
sheet at its fair value, and gains and losses that were accumulated in AOCI are recognized
immediately in earnings.

In other situations in which hedge accounting is discontinued on a cash-flow hedge, including those
where the derivative is sold, terminated or exercised, amounts previously deferred in AOCI are
amortized into earnings when earnings are impacted by the variability of the cash flow of the
hedged item.

Embedded Derivatives

The Company purchases and issues financial instruments and products that contain a derivative
instrument that is embedded in the financial instruments or products. When it is determined that
(1) the embedded derivative possesses economic characteristics that are not clearly and closely
related to the economic characteristics of the host contract, and (2) a separate instrument with
the same terms would qualify as a derivative instrument, the embedded derivative is bifurcated from
the host for measurement purposes. The embedded derivative, which is reported with the host
instrument in the consolidated balance sheets, is carried at fair value with changes in fair value
reported in net realized capital gains and losses.

Credit Risk

The Company’s derivatives counterparty exposure policy establishes market-based credit limits,
favors long-term financial stability and creditworthiness, and typically requires credit
enhancement/credit risk reducing agreements. By using derivative instruments, the Company is
exposed to credit risk, which is measured as the amount owed to the Company based on current market
conditions and potential payment obligations between the Company and its counterparties. When the
fair value of a derivative contract is positive, this indicates that the counterparty owes the
Company, and, therefore, exposes the Company to credit risk. Credit exposures are generally
quantified daily, netted by counterparty for each legal entity of the Company, and then collateral
is pledged to and held by, or on behalf of, the Company to the extent the current value of
derivatives exceeds exposure policy thresholds. The Company also minimizes the credit risk in
derivative instruments by entering into transactions with high quality counterparties that are
monitored by the Company’s internal compliance unit and reviewed frequently by senior management.
In addition, the compliance unit monitors counterparty credit exposure on a monthly basis to ensure
compliance with Company policies and statutory limitations. The Company also maintains a policy of
requiring that all derivative contracts be governed by an International Swaps and Dealers
Association Master Agreement which is structured by legal entity and by counterparty and permits
the right of offset. In addition, the Company periodically enters into swap agreements in which
the Company assumes credit exposure from a single entity, referenced index or asset pool.

Product Derivatives and Risk Management

The Company offers certain variable annuity products with a guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefit
(“GMWB”) rider. The GMWB provides the policyholder with a guaranteed remaining balance (“GRB”) if
the account value is reduced to zero through a combination of market declines and withdrawals. The
GRB is generally equal to premiums less withdrawals. However, annual withdrawals that exceed a
specific percentage of the premiums paid may reduce the GRB by an amount greater than the
withdrawals and may also impact the guaranteed annual withdrawal amount that subsequently applies
after the excess annual withdrawals occur. For certain of the withdrawal benefit features, the
policyholder also has the option, after a specified time period, to reset the GRB to the
then-current account value, if greater. The GMWB represents an embedded derivative in the variable
annuity contract that is required to be reported separately from the host variable annuity
contract. It is carried at fair value and reported in other policyholder funds. The fair value of
the GMWB obligations is calculated based on actuarial assumptions related to the projected cash
flows, including benefits and related contract charges, over the lives of the contracts,
incorporating expectations concerning policyholder behavior. Because of the dynamic and complex
nature of these cash flows, stochastic techniques under a variety of market return scenarios and
other best estimate assumptions are used. Estimating these cash flows involves numerous estimates
and subjective judgments including those regarding expected market rates of return, market
volatility, correlations of market returns and discount rates.

In valuing the embedded derivative, the Company attributes to the derivative a portion of the fees
collected from the policyholder equal to the present value of future GMWB claims (the “Attributed
Fees”). All changes in the fair value of the embedded derivative are recorded in net realized
capital gains and losses. The excess of fees collected from the policyholder for the GMWB over the
Attributed Fees are associated with the host variable annuity contract and recorded in fee income.

For contracts issued prior to July 2003, the Company has a reinsurance arrangement in place to
offset its exposure to the GMWB. This arrangement is recognized as a derivative and carried at fair
value in reinsurance recoverables. Changes in the fair value of both the derivative assets and
liabilities related to the reinsured GMWB are recorded in net realized capital gains and losses.
As of July 2003,

F-14


NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)

the Company had substantially exhausted all of its reinsurance capacity, with respect to
contracts issued after July 2003 and began hedging its exposure to the GMWB rider using a
sophisticated program involving interest rate futures, Standard and Poor’s (“S&P”) 500 and NASDAQ
index put options and futures contracts and Europe, Australasia and Far East (“EAFE”) Index swaps
to hedge GMWB exposure to international equity markets. For the years ended December 31, 2004 and
2003, net realized capital gains and losses included the change in market value of the embedded
derivative related to the GMWB liability, the derivative reinsurance arrangement and the related
derivative contracts that were purchased as economic hedges, the net effect of which was a gain of
$8 and $6 before deferred policy acquisition costs and tax effects, respectively.

Separate Accounts

The Company maintains separate account assets and liabilities, which are reported at fair value.
Separate accounts reflect two categories of risk assumption: non-guaranteed separate accounts,
wherein the policyholder assumes the investment risk, and guaranteed separate accounts, wherein the
Company contractually guarantees either a minimum return or account value to the policyholder.
Non-guaranteed separate account assets are segregated from other investments and investment income
and gains and losses accrue directly to the policyholder. Effective January 1, 2004, guaranteed
separate account assets are included with general account assets as a result of adopting SOP 03-1
and fees earned for administrative and contractholder maintenance services performed for these
separate accounts are included in fee income.

Deferred Policy Acquisition Costs and Present Value of Future Profits

Life –

Policy acquisition costs include commissions and certain other expenses that vary with and
are primarily associated with acquiring business. Present value of future profits is an intangible
asset recorded upon applying purchase accounting in an acquisition of a life insurance company.
Deferred policy acquisition costs and the present value of future profits intangible asset are
amortized in the same way. Both are amortized over the estimated life of the contracts acquired,
usually 20 years. Within the following discussion, deferred policy acquisition costs and the
present value of future profits intangible asset will be referred to as “DAC”. At December 31,
2004 and 2003, the carrying value of the Life’s DAC was $7.4 billion and $6.6 billion,
respectively. For statutory accounting purposes, such costs are expensed as incurred.

DAC related to traditional policies are amortized over the premium-paying period in proportion to
the present value of annual expected premium income. DAC related to investment contracts and
universal life-type contracts are deferred and amortized using the retrospective deposit method.
Under the retrospective deposit method, acquisition costs are amortized in proportion to the
present value of estimated gross profits (“EGPs”), arising principally from projected investment,
mortality and expense margins and surrender charges. The attributable portion of the DAC
amortization is allocated to realized gains and losses on investments. The DAC balance is also
adjusted through other comprehensive income by an amount that represents the amortization of
deferred policy acquisition costs that would have been required as a charge or credit to operations
had unrealized gains and losses on investments been realized. Actual gross profits can vary from
management’s estimates, resulting in increases or decreases in the rate of amortization.

The Company regularly evaluates its EGPs to determine if actual experience or other evidence
suggests that earlier estimates should be revised. In the event that the Company were to revise
its EGPs, the cumulative DAC amortization would be adjusted to reflect such revised EGPs in the
period the revision was determined to be necessary. Several assumptions considered to be
significant in the development of EGPs include separate account fund performance, surrender and
lapse rates, estimated interest spread and estimated mortality. The separate account fund
performance assumption is critical to the development of the EGPs related to the Company’s variable
annuity and to a lesser extent, variable universal life insurance businesses. The average annual
long-term rate of assumed separate account fund performance (before mortality and expense charges)
used in estimating gross profits for the variable annuity and variable universal life business was
9% for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003. For other products including fixed annuities
and other universal life-type contracts, the average assumed investment yield ranged from 5.7% to
7.9% for both years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003.

The Company had developed models to evaluate its DAC asset, which allowed it to run a large number
of stochastically determined scenarios of separate account fund performance. These scenarios were
then utilized to calculate a statistically significant range of reasonable estimates of EGPs. This
range was then compared to the present value of EGPs currently utilized in the DAC amortization
model. As of December 31, 2004, the present value of the EGPs utilized in the DAC amortization
model fall within a reasonable range of statistically calculated present value of EGPs. As a
result, the Company does not believe there is sufficient evidence to suggest that a revision to the
EGPs (and therefore, a revision to the DAC) as of December 31, 2004 is necessary; however, if in
the future the EGPs utilized in the DAC amortization model were to exceed the margin of the
reasonable range of statistically calculated EGPs, a revision could be necessary.

Additionally, the Company continues to perform analyses with respect to the potential impact of a
revision to future EGPs. If such a revision to EGPs were deemed necessary, the Company would
adjust, as appropriate, all of its assumptions for products accounted for in accordance with
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No. 97, “Accounting and Reporting by Insurance
Enterprises for Certain Long-Duration Contracts and for Realized Gains and Losses from the Sale of
Investments”, and reproject its future EGPs based on current account values at the end of the
quarter in which a revision is deemed to be necessary.

Aside from absolute levels and timing of market performance assumptions, additional factors
that will influence the determination to adjust assumptions include the degree of volatility in
separate account fund performance and shifts in asset allocation within the separate account made
by policyholders. The overall return generated by the separate account is dependent on several
factors, including the relative mix of the underlying sub-accounts among bond funds and equity
funds as well as equity sector weightings. The Company’s overall separate account fund performance
has been reasonably correlated to the overall performance of the S&P 500 Index (which closed at
1,212 on December 31, 2004), although no assurance can be provided that this correlation will
continue in the future.

The overall recoverability of the DAC asset is dependent on the future profitability of the
business. The Company tests the aggregate recoverability of the DAC asset by comparing the amounts
deferred to the present value of total EGPs. In addition, the Company routinely stress tests its
DAC asset for recoverability against severe declines in its separate account assets, which could
occur if the equity markets experienced another significant sell-off, as the majority of
policyholders’ funds in the separate accounts is invested in the equity market.

Property & Casualty

— The Property & Casualty operations also incur costs including commissions,
premium taxes and certain underwriting and policy issuance costs that vary with and are related
primarily to the acquisition of property and casualty insurance business and are deferred and
amortized ratably over the period the related premiums are earned. Deferred acquisition costs are
reviewed to determine if they are recoverable from future income, and if not, are charged to
expense. Anticipated investment income is considered in the determination of the recoverability of
deferred policy acquisition costs. For the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, no
material amounts of deferred policy acquisition costs were charged to expense based on the
determination of recoverability.

Reserve for Future Policy Benefits and Unpaid Claims and Claim Adjustment Expenses

Life —

Liabilities for the Company’s group life and disability contracts as well its individual
term life insurance policies include amounts for unpaid claims and future policy benefits.
Liabilities for unpaid claims include estimates of amounts to fully settle known reported claims as
well as claims related to insured events that the Company estimates have been incurred but have not
yet been reported. Liabilities for future policy benefits are calculated by the net level premium
method using interest, withdrawal and mortality assumptions appropriate at the time the policies
were issued. The methods used in determining the liability for unpaid claims and future policy
benefits are standard actuarial methods recognized by the American Academy of Actuaries. For the
tabular reserves, discount rates are based on the Company’s earned investment yield and the
morbidity/mortality tables used are standard industry tables modified to reflect the Company’s
actual experience when appropriate. In particular, for the Company’s group disability known claim
reserves, the morbidity table for the early durations of claim is based exclusively on the
Company’s experience, incorporating factors such as sex, elimination period and diagnosis. These
reserves are computed such that they are expected to meet the Company’s future policy obligations.
Future policy benefits are computed at amounts that, with additions from estimated premiums to be
received and with interest on such reserves compounded annually at certain assumed rates, are
expected to be sufficient to meet the Company’s policy obligations at their maturities or in the
event of an insured’s death. Changes in or deviations from the assumptions used for mortality,
morbidity, expected future premiums and interest can significantly affect the Company’s reserve
levels and related future operations and, as such, provisions for adverse deviation are built into
the long-tailed liability assumptions.

Property & Casualty —

The Hartford establishes property and casualty reserves to provide for the
estimated costs of paying claims under insurance policies written by the Company. These reserves
include estimates for both claims that have been reported and those that have been incurred but not
reported, and include estimates of all expenses associated with processing and settling these
claims. Estimating the ultimate cost of future claims and claim adjustment expenses is an uncertain
and complex process. This estimation process is based significantly on the assumption that past
developments are an appropriate predictor of future events, and involves a variety of actuarial
techniques that analyze experience, trends and other relevant factors. The uncertainties involved
with the reserving process have become increasingly difficult due to a number of complex factors
including social and economic trends and changes in the concepts of legal liability and damage
awards. Accordingly, final claim settlements may vary from the present estimates, particularly
when those payments may not occur until well into the future.

The Hartford regularly reviews the adequacy of its estimated claims and claim adjustment expense
reserves by line of business within the various operating segments. Adjustments to previously
established reserves which may be significant, are reflected in the operating results of the period
in which the adjustment is determined to be necessary. Such adjustments could possibly be
significant, reflecting any variety of new and adverse or favorable trends.

Most of the Company’s property and casualty reserves are not discounted. However, certain
liabilities for unpaid claims for permanently disabled claimants have been discounted to present
value using an average interest rate of 4.6% in 2004 and 4.7% in 2003. At December 31, 2004 and
2003, such discounted reserves totaled $707 and $666, respectively (net of discounts of $440 and
$429, respectively). In addition, certain structured settlement contracts that fund loss run-offs
for unrelated parties and have payment patterns that are fixed and determinable, have been
discounted to present value using an average interest rate of 5.5%. At December 31, 2004 and 2003,
such discounted reserves totaled $257 and $245, respectively (net of discounts of $116 and $127,
respectively). Accretion of this discount did not have a material effect on net income during 2004
and 2003.

Other Policyholder Funds and Benefits Payable

The Company has classified its fixed and variable annuities, 401(k), certain governmental
annuities, private placement life insurance (“PPLI”), variable universal life insurance, universal
life insurance and interest sensitive whole life insurance as universal life-type contracts. The
liability for universal life-type contracts is equal to the balance that accrues to the benefit of
the policyholders as of the financial statement date (commonly referred to as the account value),
including credited interest, amounts that have been assessed to compensate the Company for services
to be performed over future periods, and any amounts previously assessed against policyholders that
are refundable on termination of the contract. Certain contracts classified as universal life-type
may also include additional death or other insurance benefit features, such as guaranteed minimum
death or income benefits offered with variable annuity contracts or no lapse guarantees offered
with universal life insurance contracts. An additional liability is established for these benefits
by estimating the expected present value of the benefits in excess of the projected account value
in proportion to the present value of total expected assessments. Excess benefits are accrued as a
liability as actual assessments are recorded. Determination of the expected value of excess
benefits and assessments are based on a range of scenarios and assumptions including those related
to market rates of return and volatility, contract surrender rates and mortality experience.

The Company has classified its institutional and governmental products, without life contingencies,
including funding agreements, certain structured settlements and guaranteed investment contracts,
as investment contracts. The liability for investment contracts is equal to the balance that
accrues to the benefit of the contract holder as of the financial statement date, which includes
the accumulation of deposits plus credited interest, less withdrawals and amounts assessed through
the financial statement date.

Revenue Recognition

Life

— For investment and universal life-type contracts, the amounts collected from policyholders
are considered deposits and are not included in revenue. Fee income for investment and universal
life-type contracts consists of policy charges for policy administration, cost of insurance charges
and surrender charges assessed against policyholders’ account balances and are recognized in the
period in which services are provided. The Company’s traditional life and group disability
products are classified as long duration contracts, and premiums are recognized as revenue when due
from policyholders.

Property & Casualty

— Property and casualty insurance premiums are earned principally on a pro rata
basis over the lives of the policies and include accruals for ultimate premium revenue anticipated
under auditable and retrospectively rated policies. Unearned premiums represent the portion of
premiums written applicable to the unexpired terms of policies in force. Unearned premiums also
include estimated and unbilled premium adjustments related to a small percentage of the Company’s
loss-sensitive workers’ compensation business. An estimated allowance for doubtful accounts is
recorded on the basis of periodic evaluations of balances due from insurers, management’s
experience and current economic conditions. The allowance for doubtful accounts included in
premiums receivable and agents’ balances in the consolidated
balance sheets was $175 and $150 as of
December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Other revenue consists primarily of revenues associated
with the Company’s servicing businesses.

Foreign Currency Translation

Foreign currency translation gains and losses are reflected in stockholder’s equity as a component
of accumulated other comprehensive income. The Company’s foreign subsidiaries’ balance sheet
accounts are translated at the exchange rates in effect at each year end and income statement
accounts are translated at the average rates of exchange prevailing during the year. Gains and
losses on foreign currency transactions are reflected in earnings. The national currencies of the
international operations are their functional currencies.

Dividends to Policyholders

Policyholder dividends are accrued using an estimate of the amount to be paid based on underlying
contractual obligations under policies and applicable state laws.

Life

— Participating life insurance in force accounted for 5%, 6%, and 6% as of December 31, 2004,
2003 and 2002, respectively, of total life insurance in force. Dividends to policyholders were
$29, $63, and $65 for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003
and 2002, respectively. There
were no additional amounts of income allocated to participating policyholders. If limitations
exist on the amount of net income from participating life insurance contracts that may be
distributed to stockholders, the policyholder’s share of net income on those contracts that cannot
be distributed is excluded from stockholders’ equity by a charge to operations and a credit to a
liability.

Property & Casualty

— Net written premiums for participating property and casualty insurance
policies represented 8%, 9% and 9% of total net written premiums for the years ended December 31,
2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Dividends to policyholders were $12, $34 and $57 for the years
ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively.

Mutual Funds

The Company maintains a retail mutual fund operation, whereby the Company, through wholly-owned
subsidiaries, provides investment management and administrative services to The Hartford Mutual
Funds, Inc. and The Hartford Mutual Funds II, Inc. (“The Hartford mutual funds”), families of 40
mutual funds. The Company charges fees to the shareholders of the mutual funds, which are recorded
as revenue by the Company. Investors can purchase “shares” in the mutual funds, all of which are
registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), in accordance with the Investment
Company Act of 1940. The mutual funds are owned by the shareholders of those funds and not by the
Company. As such, the mutual fund assets and liabilities and related investment returns are not
reflected in the Company’s consolidated financial statements since they are not assets, liabilities
and operations of the Company.

Reinsurance

Written premiums, earned premiums and incurred insurance losses and loss adjustment expense all
reflect the net effects of assumed and ceded reinsurance transactions. Assumed reinsurance refers
to our acceptance of certain insurance risks that other insurance companies have underwritten.
Ceded reinsurance means other insurance companies have agreed to share certain risks the Company
has underwritten. Reinsurance accounting is followed for assumed and ceded transactions when the
risk transfer provisions of SFAS No. 113, “Accounting and Reporting for Reinsurance of
Short-Duration and Long-Duration Contracts,” have been met.

Income Taxes

The Company recognizes taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred taxes for the
tax consequences of differences between the financial reporting and tax basis of assets and
liabilities. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to
apply to taxable income in the years the temporary differences are expected to reverse.

Property and Equipment

Property and equipment is carried at cost net of accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is based
on the estimated useful lives of the various classes of property and equipment and is determined
principally on the straight-line method. Accumulated depreciation as of December 31, 2004 and 2003
was $1.1 billion and $958, respectively.

2. Earnings (Loss) per Share

Earnings (loss) per share amounts have been computed in accordance with the provisions of SFAS
No. 128. The following tables present a reconciliation of net income (loss) and shares used in

As a result of the net loss for the year ended December 31, 2003, SFAS No. 128 requires the
Company to use basic weighted average common shares outstanding in the calculation of the year
ended December 31, 2003 diluted earnings (loss) per share, since the inclusion of options of
1.8 would have been antidilutive to the earnings per share calculation. In the absence of the
net loss, weighted average common shares outstanding and dilutive potential common shares
would have totaled 274.2.

F-18


NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)

2. Earnings (Loss) per Share (continued)

Basic earnings (loss) per share are computed based on the weighted average number of shares
outstanding during the year. Diluted earnings (loss) per share include the dilutive effect of
outstanding options and the Company’s equity units, if any, using the treasury stock method, and
also contingently issuable shares. Under the treasury stock method, exercise of options is assumed
with the proceeds used to purchase common stock at the average market price for the period. The
difference between the number of shares assumed issued and number of shares purchased represents
the dilutive shares. Under the treasury stock method for the equity units, the number of shares of
common stock used in calculating diluted earnings per share is increased by the excess, if any, of
the number of shares issuable upon settlement of the purchase contracts, over the number of shares
that could be purchased by The Hartford in the market using the proceeds received upon settlement.
The number of issuable shares is based on the average market price for the last 20 trading days of
the period. The number of shares purchased is based on the average market price during the entire
period. Contingently issuable shares are included upon satisfaction of certain conditions related
to the contingency.

Upon exercise of outstanding options, the additional shares issued and outstanding are included in
the calculation of the Company’s weighted average shares from the date of exercise. Similarly,
upon settlement of the purchase contracts associated with the Company’s equity units, the
associated common shares are added to the Company’s issued and outstanding shares. Accordingly,
assuming The Hartford’s common stock price exceeds $56.875 per share and assuming operation of the
equity unit purchase contracts in the ordinary course, on August 16, 2006, 12.1 million common
shares will be added to the Company’s issued and outstanding shares and will be included in the
calculation of the Company’s weighted average shares for the period the shares are outstanding.
Additionally, assuming The Hartford’s common stock price exceeds $57.645 per share and assuming
operation of the equity unit purchase contracts in the ordinary course, on November 16, 2006, 5.7
million common shares will be added to the Company’s issued and outstanding shares and will be
included in the calculation of the Company’s weighted average shares for the period the shares are
outstanding. For further discussion of the Company’s equity units offerings, see Note 14.

3. Segment Information

The Hartford is organized into two major operations: Life and Property & Casualty, each
containing reporting segments. In the quarter ended March 31, 2004, and as more fully described
below, the Company changed its reporting segments to reflect the current manner by which its chief
operating decision maker views and manages the business. All segment data for prior reporting
periods have been adjusted to reflect the current segment reporting. Within the Life and Property
& Casualty operations, The Hartford conducts business principally in eight operating segments.
Additionally, Corporate includes all of the Company’s debt financing and related interest expense,
as well as certain capital raising activities and purchase accounting adjustments.

Life

Life’s business is conducted by Hartford Life, Inc. (“Hartford Life” or “Life”), an indirect
subsidiary of The Hartford, headquartered in Simsbury, Connecticut, and is a leading financial
services and insurance organization. Life has changed its reportable operating segments in 2004
from Investment Products, Individual Life, Group Benefits and Corporate Owned Life Insurance
(“COLI”) to Retail Products Group (“Retail”), Institutional Solutions Group (“Institutional”),
Individual Life and Group Benefits.

Retail offers individual variable and fixed annuities, mutual funds, retirement plan products and
services to corporations under Section 401(k) plans and other investment products.

Institutional primarily offers retirement plan products and services to municipalities under
Section 457 plans, other institutional investment products, structured settlements, and private
placement life insurance (formerly COLI).

Individual Life sells a variety of life insurance products, including variable universal life,
universal life, interest sensitive whole life and term life insurance.

Group Benefits sells group insurance products, including group life and group disability insurance
as well as other products, including medical stop loss and supplementary medical coverages to
employers and employer sponsored plans, accidental death and dismemberment, travel accident and
other special risk coverages to employers and associations.

Life includes in an Other category its international operations, which are primarily located in
Japan and Brazil; as well as Life Corporate, which includes net realized capital gains and losses
other than periodic net coupon settlements on non-qualifying derivatives, net realized capital
gains and losses related to guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefits; corporate items not directly
allocated to any of its reportable operating segments; and intersegment eliminations. Periodic net
coupon settlements on non-qualifying derivatives and net realized capital gains and losses related
to guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefits are reflected in each applicable segment in net realized
capital gains and losses.

The accounting policies of the reportable operating segments are the same as those described in the
summary of significant accounting policies in Note 1. Life evaluates performance of its segments
based on revenues, net income and the segment’s return on allocated capital. The Company charges
direct operating expenses to the appropriate segment and allocates the majority of indirect
expenses to the segments based on an intercompany expense arrangement. Intersegment revenues
primarily occur between Life’s Other category

F-19


NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)

3. Segment Information (continued)

and the operating segments. These amounts primarily include interest income on allocated
surplus, interest charges on excess separate account surplus, the allocation of net realized
capital gains and losses and the allocation of credit risk charges. Each operating segment is
allocated corporate surplus as needed to support its business. Portfolio management is a corporate
function and net realized capital gains and losses on invested assets are recognized in Life’s
Other category. Those net realized capital gains and losses that are interest rate related are
subsequently allocated back to the operating segments in future periods, with interest, over the
average estimated duration of the operating segment’s investment portfolios, through an adjustment
to each respective operating segment’s net investment income, with an offsetting adjustment in
Life’s Other category. Credit related net capital losses are retained by Life Corporate. However,
in exchange for retaining credit related losses, Life’s Other category charges each operating
segment a “credit-risk” fee through net investment income. The “credit-risk” fee covers fixed
income assets included in each operating segment’s general account and guaranteed separate
accounts. The “credit-risk” fee is based upon historical default rates in the corporate bond
market, the Company’s actual default experience and estimates of future losses. The Company’s
revenues are primarily derived from customers within the United States. The Company’s long-lived
assets primarily consist of deferred policy acquisition costs and deferred tax assets from within
the United States.

Property & Casualty

Property & Casualty is now organized into four reportable operating segments: the underwriting
segments of Business Insurance, Personal Lines, and Specialty Commercial (collectively “Ongoing
Operations”); and the Other Operations segment. Prior to the first quarter of 2004, Property &
Casualty had also included a Reinsurance segment. With the discontinuance of writing new assumed
reinsurance business, the assumed reinsurance business is included in the Other Operations segment
for all periods presented.

Business Insurance provides standard commercial insurance coverage to small commercial and middle
market commercial businesses primarily throughout the United States. This segment offers workers’
compensation, property, automobile, liability, umbrella and marine coverages. Commercial risk
management products and services are also provided.

Personal Lines provides automobile, homeowners’ and home-based business coverages to the members of
AARP through a direct marketing operation; to individuals who prefer local agent involvement
through a network of independent agents in the standard personal lines market; and through the Omni
Insurance Group in the non-standard automobile market. Personal Lines also operates a member
contact center for health insurance products offered through AARP’s Health Care Options. AARP
accounts for earned premiums of $2.1 billion, $2.0 billion and $1.7 billion in 2004, 2003 and 2002,
respectively.

The Specialty Commercial segment offers a variety of customized insurance products and risk
management services. Specialty Commercial provides standard commercial insurance products
including workers’ compensation, automobile and liability coverages to large-sized companies.
Specialty Commercial also provides bond, professional liability, specialty casualty and
agricultural coverages, as well as core property and excess and surplus lines coverages not
normally written by standard lines insurers. Alternative markets within Specialty Commercial,
provides insurance products and services primarily to captive insurance companies, pools and
self-insurance groups. In addition, Specialty Commercial provides third party administrator
services for claims administration, integrated benefits, loss control and performance measurement
through Specialty Risk Services, a subsidiary of the Company.

The Other Operations segment consists of certain property and casualty insurance operations of The
Hartford which have discontinued writing new business and includes substantially all of the
Company’s asbestos and environmental exposures.

The measure of profit or loss used by The Hartford’s management in evaluating the performance of
its Life segments is net income. The Property & Casualty segments are evaluated by The Hartford’s
management primarily based upon underwriting results. Underwriting results represent premiums
earned less incurred claims, claim adjustment expenses and underwriting expenses. The sum of
underwriting results, net investment income, net realized capital gains and losses, other expenses,
and related income taxes is net income (loss).

Certain transactions between segments occur during the year that primarily relate to tax
settlements, insurance coverage, expense reimbursements, services provided, security transfers and
capital contributions. In addition, certain reinsurance stop loss arrangements exist between the
segments which specify that one segment will reimburse another for losses incurred in excess of a
predetermined limit. Also, one segment may purchase group annuity contracts from another to fund
pension costs and annuities to settle casualty claims. In addition, certain intersegment
transactions occur in Life. These transactions include interest income on allocated surplus and
the allocation of certain net realized capital gains and losses through net investment income
utilizing the duration of the segment’s investment portfolios. Consolidated Life net investment
income and net realized capital gains and losses are unaffected by such transactions. During the
year ended December 31, 2003, $1.8 billion of securities were sold by the Property & Casualty
operation to the Life operation. For segment reporting, the net gain on this sale was deferred and
will be reported by the Property & Casualty operation as realized when the underlying securities
are sold by the Life operation. On December 1, 2002, the Property & Casualty segments entered into
a contract with a subsidiary, whereby reinsurance will be provided to the Property & Casualty
operation. This reinsurance program enables Property & Casualty to purchase reinsurance at the
overall Property & Casualty operation level rather than by the individual segment. The financial
results of this reinsurance program, net of retrocessions to unrelated reinsurers, are included in
the Specialty Commercial segment.

discussion, see the Adoption of New Accounting Standards section of Note 1.)

The amortized cost and estimated fair value of fixed maturity investments at December 31, 2004 by
contractual maturity year are shown below. Estimated maturities may differ from contractual
maturities due to call or prepayment provisions. Asset-backed securities, including MBS and CMOs,
are distributed to maturity year based on the Company’s estimates of the rate of future prepayments
of principal over the remaining lives of the securities. These estimates are developed using
prepayment speeds provided in broker consensus data. Such estimates are derived from prepayment
speeds experienced at the interest rate levels projected for the applicable underlying collateral.
Actual prepayment experience may vary from these estimates.

Concentration of Credit Risk

The Company is not exposed to any credit concentration risk of a single issuer greater than 10% of
the Company’s stockholders’ equity other than certain U.S. government and government agencies.

Security Unrealized Loss Aging

The Company has a security monitoring process overseen by a committee of investment and accounting
professionals that, on a quarterly basis, identifies securities in an unrealized loss position that
could potentially be other-than-temporarily impaired. (For further discussion regarding the
Company’s other-than-temporary impairment policy, see the Investments section of Note 1.) Due to
the issuers’ continued satisfaction of the securities’ obligations in accordance with their
contractual terms and the expectation that they will continue to do so, management’s intent and
ability to hold these securities for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated
recovery in market value, as well as the evaluation of the fundamentals of the issuers’ financial
condition and other objective evidence, the Company believes that the prices of the securities in
the sectors identified in the tables below were temporarily depressed as of December 31, 2004 and
2003.

The following table presents amortized cost, fair value and unrealized losses for the Company’s
fixed maturity and available-for-sale equity securities, aggregated by investment category and
length of time that individual securities have been in a continuous unrealized loss position as of
December 31, 2004.

As of December 31, 2004, fixed maturities represented approximately 95% of the Company’s total
unrealized loss amount, which was comprised of approximately 1,800 different securities. The
Company held no securities as of December 31, 2004 that were in an unrealized loss position in
excess of $11. There were no fixed maturities or equity securities as of December 31, 2004, with a
fair value less than 80% of the security’s amortized cost for six continuous months other than
certain ABS and CMBS. Other-than-temporary impairments for certain ABS and CMBS are recognized if
the fair value of the security, as determined by external pricing

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)

sources, is less than its carrying amount and there has been a decrease in the present value
of the expected cash flows since the last reporting period. Based on management’s best estimate of
future cash flows, there were no such ABS and CMBS in an unrealized loss position as of December
31, 2004 that were deemed to be other-than-temporarily impaired.

Securities in an unrealized loss position for less than twelve months were comprised of over 1,500
securities of which 92%, or $123, were comprised of securities with fair value to amortized cost
ratios at or greater than 90%. The majority of these securities are investment grade fixed
maturities depressed due to changes in interest rates from the date of purchase.

The securities depressed for twelve months or more as of December 31, 2004 were comprised of
approximately 300 securities, with the majority of the unrealized loss amount relating to ABS and
corporate fixed maturities within the financial services sector. A description of these events
contributing to the security types’ unrealized loss position and the factors considered in
determining that recording an other-than-temporary impairment was not warranted are outlined below.

ABS

— ABS represents $56 of the securities in an unrealized loss position for twelve months or
more. These securities were primarily supported by aircraft lease receivables that had suffered a
decrease in value in recent years as a result of a prolonged decline in airline travel, the
uncertainty of a potential industry recovery and lack of market liquidity in this sector. Although
uncertainty surrounding the stability of domestic airlines continues to weigh heavily on this
sector, worldwide travel and aircraft demand appears to be improving, resulting in a modest
increase in market prices and greater liquidity in this sector during 2004. As of December 31,
2004, the estimated future cash flows for these securities indicated full recovery and as a result,
based on management’s intent and ability to hold these securities, the prices of these securities
were deemed to be temporarily depressed.

Financial services

— Financial services represents approximately $18 of the securities in an
unrealized loss position for twelve months or more. These securities are investment grade
securities priced at or greater than 90% of amortized cost. As of December 31, 2004, the financial
services twelve months or more unrealized loss amount primarily related to variable rate securities
with extended maturity dates, which have been adversely impacted by the reduction in forward
interest rates after the purchase date, resulting in lower expected cash flows. Unrealized losses
for these securities have declined during the year as interest rates have risen. Additional
changes in fair value of these securities are primarily dependent on future changes in forward
interest rates. The majority of these variable rate securities are currently hedged with interest
rate swaps, which convert the variable rate earned on the securities to a fixed amount. The swaps
generally receive cash flow hedge accounting treatment and are currently in an unrealized gain
position.

The remaining balance of $58 in the twelve months or more unrealized loss category is comprised of
approximately 170 securities, substantially all of which were depressed only a minor extent with
fair value to amortized cost ratios at or greater than 90% as of December 31, 2004. The decline in
market value for these securities is primarily attributable to changes in interest rates.

The following table presents amortized cost, fair value and unrealized losses for the Company’s
fixed maturity and equity securities, aggregated
by investment category and length of time that individual securities have been in a continuous
unrealized loss position as of December 31, 2003.

4. Investments and Derivative Instruments (continued)

There were no fixed maturities or equity securities as of December 31, 2003, with a fair value
less than 80% of the security’s amortized cost for six continuous months. As of December 31, 2003,
fixed maturities represented approximately 92% of the Company’s unrealized loss amount, which was
comprised of approximately 800 different securities. As of December 31, 2003, the Company held no
securities presented in the table above that were at an unrealized loss position in excess of $5.

The majority of the securities in an unrealized loss position for less than twelve months were
depressed due to the rise in long-term interest rates. This group of securities was comprised of
over 700 securities. Of the less than twelve months total unrealized loss amount $148, or 91%, was
comprised of securities with fair value to amortized cost ratios as of December 31, 2003 at or
greater than 90%. As of December 31, 2003, $144 of the less than twelve months total unrealized
loss amount was comprised of securities in an unrealized loss position for less than six continuous
months.

The securities depressed for twelve months or more were comprised of less than 100 securities. Of
the twelve months or more unrealized loss amount $24, or 67%, was comprised of securities with fair
value to amortized cost ratios as of December 31, 2003 at or greater than 90%.

As of December 31, 2003, the securities in an unrealized loss position for twelve months or more
were primarily interest rate related. The sector in the greatest gross unrealized loss position in
the table above was financial services, which is included within the corporate category above. A
description of the events contributing to the security type’s unrealized loss position and the
factors considered in determining that recording an other-than-temporary impairment was not
warranted are outlined below.

Financial services

— Financial services represents approximately $23 of the securities in an
unrealized loss position for twelve months or more. All of these positions were priced at or
greater than 80% of amortized cost as of December 31, 2003. The financial services securities in
an unrealized loss position are primarily investment grade variable rate securities with extended
maturity dates, which have been adversely impacted by the reduction in forward interest rates after
the purchase date, resulting in lower expected cash flows. Unrealized loss amounts for these
securities declined during 2003 as interest rates increased. Additional changes in fair value of
these securities are primarily dependent on future changes in forward interest rates. A
substantial percentage of these securities are currently hedged with interest rate swaps, which
convert the variable rate earned on the securities to a fixed amount. The swaps generally receive
cash flow hedge accounting treatment and are currently in an unrealized gain position.

The remaining balance of $13 in the twelve months or more unrealized loss category is comprised of
approximately 60 securities with fair value to amortized cost ratios at or greater than 80%.

Investment Management Activities

In addition to managing the general account assets of the Company, Hartford Investment Management
Company (“HIM”) is also an investment advisor for third party institutional clients, a sub-advisor
for certain fixed income mutual funds offered by Hartford Life and serves as the sponsor and
collateral manager for synthetic collateralized loan obligations (“CLOs”). During 2004, HIM issued
one and began serving as the collateral asset manager for two additional synthetic CLOs, which
invest in senior secured bank loans through total return swaps (“referenced bank loan portfolios”).
The notional value of the referenced bank loan portfolios from the three synthetic CLOs as of
December 31, 2004 was $1.1 billion. The synthetic CLOs issued approximately $185 of notes and
preferred shares (“CLO issuances”), approximately $170 of which was to third party investors. The
proceeds from the CLO issuances were invested in collateral accounts consisting of high credit
quality securities that were pledged to the referenced bank loan portfolios’ swap counterparties.
Investors in the CLO issuances receive the net proceeds from the referenced bank loan portfolios.
Any principal losses incurred by the swap counterparties associated with the referenced bank loan
portfolios are borne by the CLO issuances investors through the total return swaps.

Pursuant to the requirements of FIN 46R, the Company has concluded that the three synthetic CLOs
are VIEs and for the CLO issued in 2004, the Company is the primary beneficiary and must
consolidate this CLO. Accordingly, the Company has recorded in the consolidated balance sheets $65
of cash and invested assets, total return swaps with a fair value of $3 in other assets, which
reference a bank loan portfolio with a maximum notional of $400, and $52 in other liabilities
related to the CLO issuances. The total return from the referenced bank loan portfolio of $3 was
received via the total return swap and recorded in realized capital gains and losses. Income from
the fixed maturity collateral account and CLO issuance investor payments were recorded in net
investment income in the consolidated statements of operations. The Company’s investment in the
consolidated synthetic CLO issuance is $14, which is its maximum exposure to loss. Of the two
non-consolidated synthetic CLOs, the Company has a $2 preferred share investment in one of the CLO
issuances, which is its maximum exposure to loss. The investors in the three synthetic CLO
issuances have recourse only to the VIE assets and not to the general credit of the Company. The
collateral management fees earned by HIM for the two non-consolidated synthetic CLOs totaled $3 for
the year ended December 31, 2004 and are reported in other income in the consolidated statements of
operations.

Cash-Flow Hedges

Interest rate swaps

Interest rate swaps are
primarily used to
convert interest
receipts on
floating-rate fixed
maturity investments to
fixed rates. These
derivatives are
predominantly used to
better match cash
receipts from assets
with cash disbursements
required to fund
liabilities. The
Company also enters into
forward starting swap
agreements to hedge the
interest rate exposure
on anticipated
fixed-rate asset
purchases due to changes
in the benchmark
interest rate
London-Interbank Offered
Rate (“LIBOR”). These
derivatives were
structured to hedge
interest rate exposure
inherent in the
assumptions used to
price primarily certain
long-term disability
products.

Interest rate swaps are
also used to hedge a
portion of the Company’s
floating rate guaranteed
investment contracts.
These derivatives
convert the floating
rate guaranteed
investment contract
payments to a fixed rate
to better match the cash
receipts earned from the
supporting investment
portfolio.

Foreign currency swaps

Foreign currency swaps
are used to convert
foreign denominated cash
flows associated with
certain foreign
denominated fixed
maturity investments to
U.S. dollars. The
foreign fixed maturities
are primarily denominated
in euros and are swapped
to minimize cash flow
fluctuations due to
changes in currency
rates.

Fair-Value Hedges

Interest rate swaps

A portion of the
Company’s fixed debt is
hedged against increases
in LIBOR, the designated
benchmark interest rate.
In addition, interest
rate swaps are used to
hedge the changes in fair
value of certain fixed
rate liabilities due to
changes in LIBOR.

Interest rate caps and floors

Interest rate caps and
floors are used to offset
the changes in fair value
related to corresponding
interest rate caps and
floors that exist in
certain of the Company’s
variable-rate fixed
maturity investments.

Swaptions

Swaption arrangements are
utilized to offset the
change in the fair value
of call options embedded
in certain municipal
fixed maturity
securities. The
swaptions give the
Company the option to
enter into a “received
fixed” swap. The purpose
of the swaptions is to
mitigate reinvestment
risk arising from the
call option embedded in
the municipal security,
providing for a fixed
return over the original
term to maturity.

Other Investment and Risk Management Activities

Interest rate caps and swaption contracts

The Company is exposed to policyholder surrenders
during a rising interest rate environment. Interest
rate cap and swaption contracts are used to mitigate
the Company’s loss in a rising interest rate
environment. The increase in yield from the cap and
swaption contract in a rising interest rate
environment may be used to raise credited rates,
thereby increasing the Company’s competitiveness and
reducing the policyholder’s incentive to surrender.
These derivatives are also used to reduce the
duration risk in certain investment portfolios.
These derivative instruments are structured to hedge
the durations of fixed maturity investments to match
certain life products in accordance with the
Company’s asset and liability management policy.

The Company also uses an interest rate cap as an
economic hedge of the interest rate risk related to
fixed rate debt. In a rising interest rate
environment, the cap will limit the net interest
expense on the hedged fixed rate debt.

Foreign currency swaps, forwards and put and call options

The Company enters into foreign currency swaps and
forwards and purchases foreign put options and writes
foreign call options to hedge the foreign currency
exposures in certain of its foreign fixed maturity
investments. Currency options were closed in January
2003 for a loss of $3, after-tax.

The Company also enters into pay fixed U.S. dollar
receive fixed yen zero coupon swaps and forwards to
mitigate the foreign currency exposure associated
with the yen denominated individual fixed annuity
product. In addition, forward
settling fixed maturity investments are traded to
manage duration and foreign currency risk associated
with this product.

Credit default and total return swaps

The Company enters into swap agreements in which the
Company assumes credit exposure from an individual
entity, referenced index or asset pool. The Company
assumes credit exposure to individual entities
through credit default swaps. These contracts
entitle the company to receive a periodic fee in
exchange for an obligation to compensate the
derivative counterparty should a credit event occur
on the part of the referenced security issuer.
Credit events typically include failure on the part
of the referenced security issuer to make a fixed
dollar amount of contractual interest or principal
payments or bankruptcy. The maximum potential future
exposure to the Company is the notional value of the
swap contracts, $291 and $137, after-tax, as of
December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively.

The Company also assumes exposure to the change in
value of indices or asset pools through total return
swaps. As of December 31, 2004 and 2003, the maximum
potential future exposure to the Company from such
contracts is $809 and $425, after-tax, respectively.

The Company enters into credit default swap
agreements, in which the Company pays a derivative
counterparty a periodic fee in exchange for
compensation from the counterparty should a credit
event occur on the part of the referenced security
issuer. The Company entered into these agreements as
an efficient means to reduce credit exposure to
specified issuers.

Options

The Company writes option

certain of its fixed maturity
investments. The written option
grants the holder the ability to
call the bond at a predetermined

potential future economic
exposure is represented by the
then fair value of the bond in
excess of the strike value, which
is expected to be entirely offset
by the appreciation in the value
of the embedded long option.

Product derivatives

The Company offers certain
variable annuity products with a
GMWB rider. The GMWB is an
embedded derivative that provides
the policyholder with a
guaranteed remaining balance
(“GRB”) if the account value is
reduced to zero through a
combination of market declines
and withdrawals. The GRB is
generally equal to premiums less
withdrawals. The policyholder
also has the option, after a
specified time period, to reset
the GRB to the then-current
account value, if greater. (For
a further discussion, see the
Derivative Instruments section of
Note 1.) The notional value of
the embedded derivative is the

The increase in notional amount since December 31, 2003 is primarily due to an increase in
embedded derivatives associated with GMWB product sales, and, to a lesser extent, derivatives
transferred to the general account as a result of the adoption of SOP 03-1 and new hedging
strategies. The decrease in the net fair value of derivative instruments since December 31, 2003
was primarily due to the changes in foreign currency exchange rates, the rise in short-term
interest rates during 2004 and derivatives transferred to the general account pursuant to the
adoption of SOP 03-1, partially offset by the increase in derivatives associated with GMWB.

Due to the adoption of SOP 03-1, derivatives previously included in separate accounts were
reclassified into various other balance sheet classifications. On January 1, 2004, the notional
amount and net fair value of derivative instruments reclassified totaled $2.9 billion and $(71),
respectively.

For the year ended December 31, 2004, gross gains and losses representing the total ineffectiveness
of all fair-value and net investment hedges were immaterial. For the year ended December 31, 2004,
the Company’s net gain and loss representing hedge ineffectiveness on cash flow hedges was $(11),
after-tax. For the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002, the Company’s gross gains and losses
representing the total ineffectiveness of all cash-flow, fair-value and net investment hedges were
immaterial.

The total change in value for other derivative-based strategies which do not qualify for hedge
accounting treatment, including periodic net coupon settlements, are reported as net realized
capital gains and losses in the consolidated statements of operations. For the years ended
December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, the Company recognized an after-tax net gain of $6, $11 and $22,
respectively, for derivative-based strategies, which do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment.
The net, after-tax, GMWB activity (including the embedded derivative liability, reinsurance
contracts and futures, swaps and option contracts) is included in this amount and totaled $5, $4
and $0 for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively.

As of December 31, 2004 and 2003, the after-tax deferred net gains on derivative instruments
accumulated in AOCI that are expected to be reclassified to earnings during the next twelve months
are $7. This expectation is based on the anticipated interest payments on hedged investments in
fixed maturity securities that will occur over the next twelve months, at which time the Company
will recognize the deferred net gains (losses) as an adjustment to interest income over the term of
the investment cash flows. The maximum term over which the Company is hedging its exposure to the
variability of future cash flows (for all forecasted transactions,

excluding interest payments on variable-rate debt) is twenty-four months. For the years ended
December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, the net reclassifications from AOCI to earnings resulting from
the discontinuance of cash-flow hedges were immaterial.

The net investment hedge of the Japanese Life operation was established in the fourth quarter of
2003. The after-tax amount of gain (loss) included in the foreign currency translation adjustment
associated with the net investment hedge was $(14) as of December 31, 2004. The net amount of
gains (losses) recorded in the foreign currency translation adjustments account pertaining to the
net investment hedge for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003 was $(14) and $(3),
respectively.

The Company began issuing a yen denominated individual fixed annuity product in the fourth quarter
of 2004. The yen denominated fixed annuity product is recorded in the consolidated balance sheets
in other policyholder funds and benefits payable in U.S. dollars based upon the December 31, 2004
yen to dollar spot rate. To mitigate the yen exposure associated
with the product, during the fourth quarter of 2004, the Company entered into pay fixed U.S. dollar
receive fixed yen, zero coupon currency swaps (dollar to yen derivatives). As of December 31, 2004
the dollar to yen derivatives had a notional and fair value of $408 and $9, respectively. Changes
in fair value of the dollar to yen derivatives totaled $9 for the year ended December 31, 2004. Although economically an effective hedge, a
divergence between the yen denominated fixed annuity product liability and the dollar to yen
derivatives exists primarily due to the difference in the basis of accounting between the liability
and the derivative instruments (i.e. historical cost versus fair value). The yen denominated fixed
annuity product liabilities are recorded on a historical cost basis and are only adjusted for
changes in foreign spot rates and accrued income. The dollar to yen derivatives are recorded at
fair value incorporating changes in value due to changes in forward foreign exchange rates,
interest rates and accrued income.

Securities Lending and Collateral Arrangements

The Company participates in a securities lending program to generate additional income, whereby
certain domestic fixed income securities are loaned for a short period of time from the Company’s
portfolio to qualifying third parties, via a lending agent. Borrowers of these securities provide
collateral of 102% of the market value of the loaned securities. Acceptable collateral may be in
the form of cash or U.S. Government securities. The market value of the loaned securities is
monitored and additional collateral is obtained if the market value of the collateral falls below
100% of the market value of the loaned securities. Under the terms of the securities lending
program, the lending agent indemnifies the Company against borrower defaults. As of December 31,
2004 and 2003, the fair value of the loaned securities was approximately $1.5 billion and $1.1
billion, respectively, and was included in fixed maturities in the consolidated balance sheets.
The Company retains a portion of the income earned from the cash collateral or receives a fee from
the borrower. The Company recorded before-tax income from securities lending transactions, net of
lending fees, of $2 and $1 for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively, which was
included in net investment income.

The Company enters into various collateral arrangements, which require both the pledging and
accepting of collateral in connection with its derivative instruments. As of December 31, 2004 and
2003, collateral pledged of $337 and $275, respectively, was included in fixed maturities in the
consolidated balance sheets.

The classification and carrying amount of the loaned securities associated with the lending program
and the collateral pledged at December 31, 2004 and 2003 were as follows:

At December 31, 2004 and 2003, cash collateral of $1.6 billion and $1.2 billion, respectively, was
invested and recorded in the consolidated balance sheets in fixed maturities with a corresponding
amount recorded in other liabilities. The Company is only permitted by contract to sell or
repledge the noncash collateral in the event of a default by the counterparty and none of the
collateral has been sold or repledged at December 31, 2004 and 2003. As of December 31, 2004 and
2003, all collateral accepted was held in separate custodial accounts.

5. Fair Value of Financial Instruments

SFAS No. 107, “Disclosures about Fair Value of Financial Instruments”, requires disclosure of
fair value information of financial instruments.

For certain financial instruments where quoted market prices are not available, other independent
valuation techniques and assumptions are used. Because considerable judgment is used, these
estimates are not necessarily indicative of amounts that could be realized in a current market
exchange. SFAS No. 107 excludes certain financial instruments from disclosure, including insurance
contracts, other than financial guarantees and investment contracts.

The Hartford uses the following methods and assumptions in estimating the fair value of each class
of financial instrument. Fair value for fixed maturities and marketable equity securities
approximates those quotations published by applicable stock exchanges or received from other
reliable sources.

For policy loans, carrying amounts approximate fair value.

For mortgage loans, fair values were estimated using discounted cash flow calculations based
on current incremental lending rates for similar type loans.

Fair value of limited partnerships and trusts is based on external market valuations from
partnership and trust management.

Derivative instruments are reported at fair value based upon internally established valuations that
are consistent with external valuation models, quotations furnished by dealers in such instrument
or market quotations.

Other policyholder funds and benefits payable fair value information is determined by estimating
future cash flows, discounted at the current market rate. For further discussion of other
policyholder funds and derivatives, see Note 1.

For commercial paper, carrying amounts approximate fair value.

Fair value for long-term debt is based on market quotations from independent third party pricing
services.

and 2003 were as follows:

6. Reinsurance

The Hartford cedes insurance to other insurers in order to limit its maximum losses and to
diversify its exposures. Such transfers do not relieve The Hartford of its primary liability under
policies it wrote and, as such, failure of reinsurers to honor their obligations could result in
losses to The Hartford. The Hartford also assumes reinsurance from other insurers. The Hartford
also is a member of and participates in several reinsurance pools and associations. The
Hartford evaluates the financial condition of its reinsurers and monitors concentrations of credit
risk. Virtually all of The Hartford’s property and casualty reinsurance is placed with reinsurers
that meet strict financial criteria established by a credit committee. As of December 31, 2004 and
2003, The Hartford had no reinsurance-related concentrations of credit risk greater than 10% of the
Company’s stockholders’ equity.

6. Reinsurance (continued)

Life

In accordance with normal industry practice, Life is involved in both the cession and assumption of
insurance with other insurance and reinsurance companies. As of December 31, 2004, the largest
amount of life insurance retained on any one life by any one of the life operations was
approximately $2.9. In addition, the Company reinsures the majority of minimum death benefit
guarantees as well as the guaranteed withdrawal benefits on contracts issued prior to July 2003
offered in connection with its variable annuity contracts.

Life insurance fees, earned premiums and other were comprised of the following:

Life reinsures certain of its risks to other reinsurers under yearly renewable term,
coinsurance, and modified coinsurance arrangements. Yearly renewable term and coinsurance
arrangements result in passing a portion of the risk to the reinsurer. Generally, the reinsurer
receives a proportionate amount of the premiums less an allowance for commissions and expenses and
is liable for a corresponding proportionate amount of all benefit payments. Modified coinsurance
is similar to coinsurance except that the cash and investments that support the liabilities for
contract benefits are not transferred to the assuming company, and settlements are made on a net
basis between the companies.

Life also purchases reinsurance covering the death benefit guarantees on a portion of its variable
annuity business. On March 16, 2003, a final decision and award was issued in the previously
disclosed arbitration between subsidiaries of the Company and one of their primary reinsurers
relating to policies with death benefits written from 1994 to 1999. (For further discussion of
this arbitration, see Note 12.)

The cost of reinsurance related to long-duration contracts is accounted for over the life of the
underlying reinsured policies using assumptions consistent with those used to account for the
underlying policies. Life insurance recoveries on ceded reinsurance contracts, which reduce death
and other benefits, were $478, $541 and $484 for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002,
respectively. Life also assumes reinsurance from other insurers.

liabilities that are reinsured, net of a valuation allowance, if necessary. The amounts
recoverable from reinsurers are estimated based on assumptions that are consistent with those used
in establishing the reserves related to the underlying reinsured contracts. Management believes
the recoverables are appropriately established; however, in the event that future circumstances and
information require The Hartford to change its estimate of needed loss reserves, the amount of
reinsurance recoverables may also require adjustments.

As of December 31, 2004 and 2003, the allowance for uncollectible reinsurance totaled $374 and
$381, respectively.

6. Reinsurance (continued)

Reinsurance Recapture

On June 30, 2003, the Company recaptured a block of business previously reinsured with an
unaffiliated reinsurer. Under this treaty, HLI reinsured a portion of the GMDB feature associated
with certain of its annuity contracts. As consideration for recapturing the business and final
settlement under the treaty, the Company has received assets valued at approximately $32 and one
million warrants exercisable for the unaffiliated company’s stock. This amount represents to the
Company an advance collection of its future recoveries under the reinsurance agreement and will be
recognized as future losses are incurred. Prospectively, as a result of the recapture, HLI will be
responsible for all of the remaining and ongoing risks associated with the GMDB’s related to this
block of business. The recapture increased the net amount at risk retained by the Company, which
is included in the net amount at risk discussed in Note 9. On January 1, 2004, upon adoption of
the SOP, the $32 was included in the Company’s GMDB reserve calculation as part of the net reserve
benefit ratio and as a claim recovery to date.

9. Separate Accounts, Death Benefits and Other Insurance Benefit Features

The Hartford records the variable portion of individual variable annuities, 401(k),
institutional, governmental, private placement life and variable life insurance products within
separate account assets and liabilities, which are reported at fair value. Separate account assets
are segregated from other investments. Investment income and gains and losses from those separate
account assets, which accrue directly to, and whereby investment risk is borne by the policyholder,
are offset by the related liability changes within the same line item in the statement of income.
The fees earned for administrative and contract holder maintenance services performed for these
separate accounts are included in fee income. During 2004, there were no gains or losses on
transfers of assets from the general account to the separate account. The Company had recorded
certain market value adjusted (“MVA”) fixed annuity products and modified guarantee life insurance
(primarily the Company’s Compound Rate Contract (“CRC”) and associated assets) as separate account
assets and liabilities through December 31, 2003. Notwithstanding the market value adjustment
feature in this product, all of the investment performance of the separate account assets is not
being passed to the contract holder. Therefore, it does not meet the conditions for separate
account reporting under SOP 03-1. Separate account assets and liabilities related to CRC of $11.7
billion were reclassified to, and revalued in, the general account upon adoption of SOP 03-1 on
January 1, 2004.

Prior to the adoption of SOP 03-1, the Company had also recorded its variable annuity products
offered in Japan in separate account assets and liabilities through December 31, 2003. These
assets are not legally insulated from general creditors and therefore did not meet the conditions
for separate account reporting under SOP 03-1. On January 1, 2004, separate account assets and
liabilities in Japan of $6.2 billion were reclassified to the general account with no change in
value. The investment assets were recorded at fair value in a trading securities portfolio. As of
December 31, 2004, due to additional sales of Japan variable annuity products and positive
performance of the Japanese equity markets these assets had increased to $14.1 billion.

Many of the variable annuity contracts issued by the Company offer various guaranteed minimum
death, withdrawal and income benefits. Guaranteed minimum death and income benefits are offered in
various forms as described in the footnotes to the table below. The Company currently reinsures a
significant portion of the death benefit guarantees associated with its in-force block of business.
Upon adoption of SOP 03-1, the Company recorded a liability for GMDB and guaranteed minimum income
benefits (“GMIB”) offered only in Japan sold with variable annuity products of $225 and a related
GMDB reinsurance recoverable asset of $108. As of December 31, 2004, the liability from GMDB sold
with annuity products offered in the United States and GMDB/GMIB sold with annuity products offered
in Japan was $174 and $28, respectively. The reinsurance recoverable asset, related to the U.S.
GMDB was $64 as of December 31, 2004. During 2004, the Company incurred guaranteed death benefits
on U.S. products and death and income benefits on Japanese products of $123 and $21, and paid
guaranteed death benefits on U.S. products and death and income benefits on Japanese products of
$166 and $1, respectively. Guaranteed minimum death benefits on U.S. products and death and income
benefits on Japanese products paid during 2003 were $289 and $4, respectively. Guaranteed minimum
death benefits paid during 2002 were $265.

The net GMDB and GMIB liability is established by estimating the expected value of net reinsurance
costs and death and income benefits in excess of the projected account balance. The excess death
and income benefits and net reinsurance costs are recognized ratably over the accumulation period
based on total expected assessments. The GMDB and GMIB liabilities are recorded in Future Policy
Benefits on the Company’s balance sheet. Changes in the GMDB and GMIB liability are recorded in
Benefits, Claims and Claims Adjustment Expenses in the Company’s statement of operations. The
Company regularly evaluates estimates used and adjusts the additional liability balances, with a
related charge or credit to benefit expense, if actual experience or other evidence suggests that
earlier assumptions should be revised.

The determination of the GMDB and GMIB liabilities and related GMDB reinsurance recoverable is
based on models that involve a range of scenarios and assumptions, including those regarding
expected market rates of return and volatility, contract surrender rates and mortality experience.
The following assumptions were used to determine the GMDB and GMIB liabilities as of December 31,
2004:

The Company offers certain variable annuity products with a GMWB rider. The GMWB provides
the policyholder with a guaranteed remaining balance (“GRB”) if the account value is reduced to
zero through a combination of market declines and withdrawals. The GRB is generally equal to
premiums less withdrawals. However, annual withdrawals that exceed a specified percentage of the
premiums paid may reduce the GRB by an amount greater than the withdrawals and may also impact the
guaranteed annual withdrawal amount that subsequently applies after the excess annual withdrawals
occur. In certain contracts, the policyholder also has the option, after a specified time period,
to reset the GRB to the then-current account value, if greater. The GMWB represents an embedded
derivative liability in the variable annuity contract that is required to be reported separately
from the host variable annuity contract. It is carried at fair value and reported in other
policyholder funds. The fair value of the GMWB obligations are calculated based on actuarial
assumptions related to the projected cash flows, including benefits and related contract charges,
over the lives of the contracts, incorporating expectations concerning policyholder behavior.
Because of the dynamic and complex nature of these cash flows, stochastic techniques under a
variety of market return scenarios and other best estimate assumptions are used. Estimating cash
flows involves numerous estimates and subjective judgments including those regarding expected
market rates of return, market volatility, correlations of market returns and discount rates.

As of December 31, 2004 and December 31, 2003, the embedded derivative asset recorded for GMWB,
before reinsurance or hedging, was $129 and $115, respectively. During 2004 and 2003, the change
in value of the GMWB, before reinsurance and

hedging, reported in realized gains was $33 and $165 was incurred, respectively. There were
no payments made for the GMWB during 2004, 2003 or 2002.

As of December 31, 2004 and December 31, 2003, $18.1 billion, or 61%, and $6.2 billion, or 36%,
respectively, of account value representing substantially all of the contracts written after July
2003, with the GMWB feature was unreinsured. In order to minimize the volatility associated with
the unreinsured GMWB liabilities, the Company has established an alternative risk management
strategy. In 2003, the Company began hedging its unreinsured GMWB exposure using interest rate
futures, and Standard and Poor’s (“S&P”) 500 and NASDAQ index options and futures contracts.
During 2004, the Company began using Europe, Australasia and Far East (“EAFE”) Index swaps to
hedge GMWB exposure to international equity markets. The GRB as of December 31, 2004 and 2003
was $32.7 billion and $15.5 billion, respectively.

Account balances of contracts with guarantees were invested in variable separate accounts as
follows:

As

approximately 84% were invested in equity securities.

The Individual Life segment sells universal life-type contracts with and without certain secondary
guarantees, such as a guarantee that the policy will not lapse, even if the account value is
reduced to zero, as long as the policyholder makes scheduled premium payments. The cumulative
effect on net income upon recording additional liabilities for universal life-type contracts and
the related secondary guarantees, in accordance with SOP 03-1, was not material. As of December
31, 2004, the liability for secondary guarantees as well as the amounts incurred and paid during
the year was immaterial.

10. Sales Inducements

The Company currently offers enhanced crediting rates or bonus payments to contract holders on
certain of its individual and group annuity products. Through December 31, 2003, the expense
associated with offering certain of these bonuses was deferred and amortized over the contingent
deferred sales charge period. Others were expensed as incurred. Effective January 1, 2004, upon
the Company’s adoption of SOP 03-1, the expense associated with offering a bonus is deferred and
amortized over the life of the related contract in a pattern consistent with the amortization of
deferred policy acquisition costs. Also, effective January 1, 2004, amortization expense
associated with expenses previously deferred is recorded over the remaining life of the contract
rather than over the contingent deferred sales charge period.

Changes in deferred sales inducement activity were as follows for the year ended December 31, 2004:

11. Reserves for Claims and Claim Adjustment Expenses

As described in Note 1, The Hartford establishes reserves for claims and claim adjustment
expenses on reported and unreported claims. These reserve estimates are based on known facts and
interpretations of circumstances, and consideration of various internal factors including The
Hartford’s experience with similar cases, historical trends involving claim payment patterns, loss
payments, pending levels of unpaid claims, loss control programs and product mix. In addition, the
reserve estimates are influenced by consideration of various external factors including court
decisions, economic conditions and public attitudes. The effects of inflation are implicitly
considered in the reserving process.

The establishment of appropriate reserves, including reserves for catastrophes and asbestos and
environmental claims, is inherently uncertain. The Hartford regularly updates its reserve
estimates as new information becomes available and events unfold that may have an impact on
unsettled claims. Changes in prior year reserve estimates, which may be material, are reflected in
the results of operations in the period such changes are determined to be necessary. For further
discussion of asbestos and environmental claims, see Note 12.

In the opinion of management, based upon the known facts and current law, the reserves
recorded for The Hartford’s property and casualty businesses at December 31, 2004 represent the
Company’s best estimate of its ultimate liability for claims and claim adjustment expenses related
to losses covered by policies written by the Company. However, because of the significant
uncertainties surrounding environmental, and particularly asbestos exposures, it is possible that
management’s estimate of the ultimate liabilities for these claims may change and that the required
adjustment to recorded reserves could exceed the currently recorded reserves by an amount that
could be material to The Hartford’s results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.

Examples of current trends include increases in medical cost inflation rates, changes in internal
claim practices, changes in the legislative and regulatory environment over workers’ compensation
claims, evolving exposures to claims asserted against religious institutions and other
organizations relating to molestation or abuse and other mass torts. In the case of the reserves
for asbestos exposures, factors contributing to the high degree of uncertainty include inadequate
development patterns, plaintiffs’ expanding theories of liability, the risks inherent in major
litigation, and inconsistent emerging legal doctrines. In the case of the reserves for
environmental exposures, factors contributing to the high degree of uncertainty include expanding
theories of liabilities and damages; the risks inherent in major litigation; inconsistent decisions
concerning the existence and scope of coverage for environmental claims; and uncertainty as to the
monetary amount being sought by the claimant from the insured.

The prior year provision of $414 in 2004 is primarily due to a number of net reserve increases to
reflect current trends, partially offset by a reduction in September 11 reserves. The reserve
increases in 2004 include reserve strengthening for construction defect claims, assumed casualty
reinsurance and environmental claims as well as a reduction in the reinsurance recoverable asset on
older, long-term casualty liabilities. The prior year provision in 2003 is primarily due to reserve
strengthening of $2.6 billion based on a ground up study of asbestos reserves. The ground up study
confirmed the Company’s view of the existence of a substantial long-term deterioration in the
asbestos litigation environment. In 2002, the prior year provision of $293 is primarily due to
reserve strengthening of non-standard auto claims and strengthening of workers’ compensation loss
reserves on a few large accounts.

12. Commitments and Contingencies

Litigation

The Hartford is involved in claims litigation arising in the ordinary course of business, both as a
liability insurer defending third-party claims brought against insureds and as an insurer defending
coverage claims brought against it. The Hartford accounts for such activity through the
establishment of unpaid claim and claim adjustment expense reserves. Subject to the uncertainties
discussed below under the caption “Asbestos and Environmental Claims,” management expects that the
ultimate liability, if any, with respect to such ordinary-course claims litigation, after
consideration of provisions made for potential losses and costs of defense, will not be material to
the consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash flows of The Hartford.

F-42


NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)

12. Commitments and Contingencies (continued)

The Hartford is also involved in other kinds of legal actions, some of which assert claims for
substantial amounts. These actions include, among others, putative state and federal class actions
seeking certification of a state or national class. Such putative class actions have alleged, for
example, underpayment of claims or improper underwriting practices in connection with various kinds
of insurance policies, such as personal and commercial automobile, property, and inland marine;
improper sales practices in connection with the sale of life insurance and other investment
products; and improper fee arrangements in connection with mutual funds. The Hartford also
is involved in individual actions in which punitive damages are sought, such as claims alleging bad
faith in the handling of insurance claims. Like many other insurers, The Hartford also has been
joined in actions by asbestos plaintiffs asserting that insurers had a duty to protect the public
from the dangers of asbestos. Management expects that the ultimate liability, if any, with respect
to such lawsuits, after consideration of provisions made for estimated losses, will not be material
to the consolidated financial condition of The Hartford. Nonetheless, given the large or
indeterminate amounts sought in certain of these actions, and the inherent unpredictability of
litigation, it is possible that an adverse outcome in certain matters could, from time to time,
have a material adverse effect on the Company’s consolidated results of operations or cash flows in
particular quarterly or annual periods.

Broker Compensation Litigation

– On October 14, 2004, the New York Attorney General’s Office filed
a civil complaint (the “NYAG Complaint”) against Marsh Inc. and Marsh & McLennan Companies, Inc.
(collectively, “Marsh”) alleging, among other things, that certain insurance companies, including
The Hartford, participated with Marsh in arrangements to submit inflated bids for business
insurance and paid contingent commissions to ensure that Marsh would direct business to them. The
Hartford is not joined as a defendant in the action. Since the filing of the NYAG Complaint,
several private actions have been filed against the Company asserting claims arising from the
allegations of the NYAG Complaint.

Two securities class actions have been filed in the United States District Court for the District
of Connecticut alleging claims against the Company and five of its executive officers under Section
10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act and SEC Rule 10b-5. The complaints allege on behalf of a
putative class of shareholders that the Company and the five named individual defendants, as
control persons of the Company, “disseminated false and misleading financial statements” by
concealing that “the Company was paying illegal and concealed ‘contingent commissions’ pursuant to
illegal ‘contingent commission agreements.’” The class period alleged is November 5, 2003 through
October 13, 2004, the day before the NYAG Complaint was filed. The complaints seek damages and
attorneys’ fees. The Company and the individual defendants dispute the allegations and intend to
defend these actions vigorously.

In addition, three putative class actions have been filed in the same court on behalf of
participants in the Company’s 401(k) plan against The Hartford, Hartford Fire Insurance Company,
the Company’s Pension Fund Trust and Investment Committee, the Company’s Pension Administration
Committee, the Company’s Chief Financial Officer, and John/Jane Does 1-15. The suits assert claims
under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (“ERISA”), alleging that the
Company and the other named defendants breached their fiduciary duties to plan participants by,
among other things, failing to inform them of the risk associated with investment in the Company’s
stock as a result of the activity alleged in the NYAG Complaint. The class period alleged is
November 5, 2003 through the present. The complaints seek restitution of losses to the plan,
declaratory and injunctive relief, and attorneys’ fees. All defendants dispute the allegations and
intend to defend these actions vigorously.

Two corporate derivative actions also have been filed in the same court. The complaints, brought
in each case by a shareholder on behalf of the Company against its directors and an executive
officer, allege that the defendants knew adverse non-public information about the activities
alleged in the NYAG Complaint and concealed and misappropriated that information to make profitable
stock trades, thereby breaching their fiduciary duties, abusing their control, committing
gross mismanagement, wasting corporate assets, and unjustly enriching themselves. The complaints
seek damages, injunctive relief, disgorgement, and attorneys’ fees. All defendants dispute the
allegations and intend to defend these actions vigorously.

Seven putative class actions also have been filed by alleged
policyholders in federal district courts, one in the Southern District of New York, two in
the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, three in the Northern District of Illinois, and one in the Northern
District of California, against several brokers and insurers, including the Company. These actions assert,
on behalf of a class of persons who purchased insurance through the broker defendants, claims under
the Sherman Act and state law, and in some cases the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act
(“RICO”), arising from the conduct alleged in the NYAG Complaint.
The class period alleged is 1994 through the date of class certification, which has not yet
occurred. The complaints seek treble damages, injunctive and
declaratory relief, and attorneys’ fees. Putative class actions also have been
filed in the Circuit Court for Cook County, Illinois, Chancery Division and in the Circuit Court for Seminole
County, Florida, Civil Division, on behalf of a class of all persons who purchased insurance from a class of
defendant insurers. These state court actions assert unjust enrichment claims and violations of state
unfair trade practices acts arising from the conduct alleged in the NYAG Complaint and seek remedies including restitution of premiums,
and, in the Cook County action, imposition of a constructive trust, and declaratory and injunctive relief. The class period alleged
is 1994 through the present. The Company has removed the Cook County action to the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois.
Pursuant to an order of the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation, it is likely that most or all of these actions will be transferred to the United States District
Court for the District of New Jersey. The Company disputes the allegations in all of these actions and intends to defend
the actions vigorously.

Additional complaints may be filed against the Company in various courts alleging claims under
federal or state law arising from the conduct alleged in the NYAG Complaint. The Company’s
ultimate liability, if any, in the pending and possible future suits is highly uncertain and
subject to contingencies that are not yet known, such as how many suits will be filed, in which
courts they will be lodged, what claims they will assert, what the outcome of investigations by the
New York Attorney General’s Office and other regulatory agencies will be, the success of defenses
that the Company may assert, and the amount of recoverable damages if liability is established. In
the opinion of management, it is possible that an adverse outcome in one or more of these suits
could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s consolidated results of operations or cash
flows in particular quarterly or annual periods.

The MacArthur Litigation

– Hartford Accident and Indemnity Company (“Hartford A&I”), a subsidiary
of the Company, issued primary general liability policies to Mac Arthur Company and its subsidiary,
Western MacArthur Company, both former regional distributors of asbestos products (collectively or
individually, “MacArthur”), during the period 1967 to 1976. In 1987, Hartford A&I notified
MacArthur that its available limits for asbestos bodily injury claims under these policies had been
exhausted, and MacArthur ceased submitting claims to Hartford A&I under these policies. Thirteen
years later, MacArthur filed an action against Hartford A&I seeking for the first time additional
coverage for asbestos bodily injury claims under the Hartford A&I primary policies on the theory
that Hartford A&I had not exhausted limits MacArthur alleged to be available for non-products
liability. Following the voluntary dismissal of MacArthur’s original action, the coverage
litigation proceeded in the Superior Court in Alameda County, California. MacArthur sought a
declaration of coverage and damages, alleging that its liability for liquidated but unpaid asbestos
bodily injury claims was $2.5 billion, of which more than $1.8 billion consisted of unpaid
judgments, and that it had substantial additional liability for unliquidated and future claims.

On December 19, 2003, Hartford Accident and Indemnity Co. (“Hartford A&I”) entered into a
settlement agreement with MacArthur Co. and its subsidiary, Western MacArthur Co. Under the
settlement agreement, during the first quarter of 2004, Hartford A&I paid $1.15 billion into an
escrow account owned by Hartford A&I. The funds were held in the escrow account until conditions
precedent to the settlement occurred in April. On April 22, 2004, the funds were disbursed from
the escrow account into a trust established for the benefit of present and future asbestos
claimants pursuant to the bankruptcy plan. The settlement payments were accounted for as a
reduction in unpaid claim and claim adjustment expenses during the first quarter of 2004.

Bancorp Services, LLC

– In the third quarter of 2003, Hartford Life Insurance Company and its
affiliate International Corporate Marketing Group, LLC settled their intellectual property dispute
with Bancorp Services, LLC (“Bancorp”). The dispute concerned, among other things, Bancorp’s
claims for alleged patent infringement, breach of a confidentiality agreement, and misappropriation
of trade secrets related to certain stable value corporate-owned life insurance products. The
settlement provided that The Hartford would pay a minimum of $70 and a maximum of $80, depending on
the outcome of the patent appeal, to resolve all disputes between the parties. The settlement
resulted in the recording of an additional charge of $40, after-tax, in the third quarter of 2003,
reflecting the maximum amount payable under the settlement, and in November of 2003, The Hartford
paid the initial $70 of the settlement. On March 1, 2004, the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals
decided the patent appeal adversely to The Hartford, and on March 22, 2004, The Hartford paid
Bancorp an additional $10 in full and final satisfaction of its obligations under the settlement.
Because the charge taken in the third quarter of 2003 reflected the maximum amount payable under
the settlement, the amount paid in the first quarter of 2004 had no effect on the Company’s results
of operations.

Reinsurance Arbitration

– On March 16, 2003, a final decision and award was issued in the
previously disclosed reinsurance arbitration between subsidiaries of The Hartford and one of their
primary reinsurers relating to policies with guaranteed death benefits written from 1994 to 1999.
The arbitration involved alleged breaches under the reinsurance treaties. Under the terms of the
final decision and award, the reinsurer’s reinsurance obligations to The Hartford’s subsidiaries
were unchanged and not limited or reduced in any manner. The award was confirmed by the Connecticut
Superior Court on May 5, 2003.

Asbestos and Environmental Claims

The Hartford continues to receive claims that assert damages from asbestos-related and
environmental-related exposures. Asbestos claims relate primarily to bodily injuries asserted by
those who came in contact with asbestos or products containing asbestos. Environmental claims
relate primarily to pollution and related clean-up costs.

The Hartford wrote several different categories of insurance coverage to which asbestos and
environmental claims may apply. First, The Hartford wrote primary policies providing the first
layer of coverage in an insured’s liability program. Second, The Hartford wrote excess policies
providing higher layers of coverage for losses that exhaust the limits of underlying coverage.
Third, The Hartford acted as a reinsurer assuming a portion of risks previously assumed by other
insurers writing primary, excess and reinsurance coverages. Fourth, The Hartford participated in
the London Market, writing both direct insurance and assumed reinsurance business.

With regard to both environmental and particularly asbestos claims, significant uncertainty limits
the ability of insurers and reinsurers to estimate the ultimate reserves necessary for unpaid
losses and related expenses. Traditional actuarial reserving techniques cannot reasonably estimate
the ultimate cost of these claims, particularly during periods where theories of law are in flux.
The degree of

F-44


NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)

12. Commitments and Contingencies (continued)

variability of reserve estimates for these exposures is significantly greater than for other
more traditional exposures. In particular, The Hartford believes there is a high degree of
uncertainty inherent in the estimation of asbestos loss reserves.

In the case of the reserves for asbestos exposures, factors contributing to the high degree of
uncertainty include inadequate loss development patterns, plaintiffs’ expanding theories of
liability, the risks inherent in major litigation, and inconsistent emerging legal doctrines.
Furthermore, over time, insurers, including The Hartford, have experienced significant changes in
the rate at which asbestos claims are brought, the claims experience of particular insureds, and
the value of claims, making predictions of future exposure from past experience uncertain. For
example, in the past few years, insurers in general, including The Hartford, have experienced an
increase in the number of asbestos-related claims due to, among other things, plaintiffs’ increased
focus on new and previously peripheral defendants, and an increase in the number of insureds
seeking bankruptcy protection as a result of asbestos-related liabilities. Plaintiffs and insureds
have sought to use bankruptcy proceedings, including “pre-packaged” bankruptcies, to accelerate and
increase loss payments by insurers. In addition, some policyholders have asserted new classes of
claims for so-called “non-products” coverages to which an aggregate limit of liability may not
apply. Further uncertainties include insolvencies of other carriers and unanticipated developments
pertaining to The Hartford’s ability to recover reinsurance for asbestos and environmental claims.
Management believes these issues are not likely to be resolved in the near future.

In the case of the reserves for environmental exposures, factors contributing to the high degree of
uncertainty include expanding theories of liabilities and damages; the risks inherent in major
litigation; inconsistent decisions concerning the existence and scope of coverage for environmental
claims; and uncertainty as to the monetary amount being sought by the claimant from the insured.

It is also not possible to predict changes in the legal and legislative environment and their
impact on the future development of asbestos and environmental claims. It is unknown whether
potential Federal asbestos-related legislation will be enacted, and if so, what its effect will be
on The Hartford’s aggregate asbestos liabilities.

The reporting pattern for assumed reinsurance claims is much longer than for direct claims. In many
instances, it takes months or years to determine that the policyholder’s own obligations have been
met and how the reinsurance in question may apply to such claims. The delay in reporting
reinsurance claims and exposures adds to the uncertainty in estimating the related reserves.

Given the factors and emerging trends described above, The Hartford believes the actuarial tools
and other techniques it employs to estimate the ultimate cost of claims for more traditional kinds
of insurance exposure are less precise in estimating reserves for its asbestos and environmental
exposures. For this reason, The Hartford relies on exposure-based analysis to estimate the ultimate
costs of these claims and regularly evaluates new information in assessing its potential asbestos
and environmental exposures.

As of December 31, 2004 and December 31, 2003, the Company reported $2.5 billion and $3.8 billion
of net asbestos reserves and $394 and $408 of net environmental reserves, respectively. The
Company believes that its current asbestos and environmental reserves are appropriate. However,
analyses of future developments could cause The Hartford to change
its estimates and ranges of its asbestos
and environmental reserves, and the effect of these changes could be material to the Company’s
consolidated operating results, financial condition, and liquidity.

Regulatory Developments

In June 2004, the Company received a subpoena from the New York Attorney General’s Office in
connection with its inquiry into compensation arrangements between brokers and carriers. In
mid-September 2004 and subsequently, the Company has received additional subpoenas from the New
York Attorney General’s Office, which relate more specifically to possible anti-competitive
activity among brokers and insurers. Since the beginning of October
2004, the Company has received
subpoenas or other information requests from Attorneys General and regulatory agencies in more than
a dozen jurisdictions regarding broker compensation and possible anti-competitive activity. The
Company may receive additional subpoenas and other information requests from Attorneys General or
other regulatory agencies regarding similar issues. The Company also has received a subpoena from
the New York Attorney General’s Office requesting information related to the Company’s underwriting
practices with respect to legal professional liability insurance. In addition, the Company has
received a request for information from the New York Attorney General’s Office concerning the
Company’s compensation arrangements in connection with the administration of workers compensation
plans. The Company intends to continue cooperating fully with these investigations, and is
conducting an internal review, with the assistance of outside counsel, regarding the issues under
investigation.

On October 14, 2004, the New York Attorney General’s Office filed a civil complaint against Marsh &
McLennan Companies, Inc., and Marsh, Inc. (collectively, “Marsh”). The complaint alleges, among
other things, that certain insurance companies, including the Company, participated with Marsh in
arrangements to submit inflated bids for business insurance and paid contingent commissions to
ensure that Marsh would direct business to them. The Company is not joined as a defendant in the
action. Although no regulatory action has been initiated against the Company in connection with
the allegations described in the civil complaint, it is possible that the New York Attorney
General’s Office or one or more other regulatory agencies may pursue action against the Company or
one or more of its employees in the future. The potential timing of any such action is difficult
to predict. If such an action is brought, it could have a material adverse effect on the Company.

On October 29, 2004, the New York Attorney General’s Office informed the Company that the
Attorney General is conducting an investigation with respect to the timing of the previously
disclosed sale by Thomas Marra, a director and executive officer of the Company, of 217,074 shares
of the Company’s common stock on September 21, 2004. The sale occurred shortly after the issuance
of two additional subpoenas dated September 17, 2004 by the New York Attorney General’s Office.
The Company has engaged outside counsel to review the circumstances related to the transaction and
is fully cooperating with the New York Attorney General’s Office. On the basis of the review, the
Company has determined that Mr. Marra complied with the Company’s applicable internal trading
procedures and has found no indication that Mr. Marra was aware of the additional subpoenas at the
time of the sale.

There continues to be significant federal and state regulatory activity relating to financial
services companies, particularly mutual funds companies. These regulatory inquiries have focused
on a number of mutual fund issues, including market timing and late trading, revenue sharing and
directed brokerage, fees, transfer agents and other fund service providers, and other mutual-fund
related issues. The Company has received requests for information and subpoenas from the SEC,
subpoenas from the New York Attorney General’s Office, requests for information from the
Connecticut Securities and Investments Division of the Department of Banking, and requests for
information from the New York Department of Insurance, in each case requesting documentation and
other information regarding various mutual fund regulatory issues.

The SEC’s Division of Enforcement and the New York Attorney General’s Office are investigating
aspects of the Company’s variable annuity and mutual fund operations related to market timing. The
Company’s mutual funds are available for purchase by the separate accounts of different variable
universal life insurance policies, variable annuity products, and funding agreements, and they are
offered directly to certain qualified retirement plans. Although existing products contain
transfer restrictions between subaccounts, some products, particularly older variable annuity
products, do not contain restrictions on the frequency of transfers. In addition, as a result of
the settlement of litigation against the Company with respect to certain owners of older variable
annuity products, the Company’s ability to restrict transfers by
these owners is limited. In February 2005, the Company agreed in
principle with the Boards of Directors of the mutual funds to
indemnify the mutual funds for any material harm caused to the funds
from frequent trading by these owners. The specific terms of the
indemnification
have not been determined. The SEC’s Division of Enforcement also is investigating aspects of the Company’s variable annuity and
mutual fund operations related to directed brokerage and revenue sharing. The Company discontinued
the use of directed brokerage in recognition of mutual fund sales in late 2003. The Company also
has received a subpoena from the New York Attorney General’s Office requesting information related
to the Company’s group annuity products. The Company continues to cooperate fully with the SEC,
the New York Attorney General’s Office and other regulatory agencies.

A number of companies have announced settlements of enforcement actions with various regulatory
agencies, primarily the SEC and the New York Attorney General’s Office, which have included a range
of monetary penalties and restitution. While no such action has been initiated against the
Company, the SEC, and the New York Attorney General’s Office are likely to take some action at the
conclusion of the on-going investigations related to market timing and directed brokerage. The
potential timing of any such action is difficult to predict, and the Company’s ultimate liability,
if any, from any such action is not reasonably estimable at this time. If such an action is
brought, it could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s consolidated results of
operations or cash flows in particular quarterly or annual periods.

Lease Commitments

Total rental expense on operating leases was $193 in 2004, $158 in 2003 and $155 in 2002. Future
minimum lease commitments are as follows:

On June 30, 2003, the Company entered into a sale-leaseback of certain furniture and fixtures
with a net book value of $40. The sale-leaseback resulted in a gain of $15, which was deferred and
will be amortized into earnings over the initial lease term of three years. The lease qualifies as
an operating lease for accounting purposes. At the end of the initial lease term, the Company has
the option to purchase the leased assets, renew the lease for two one-year periods or return the
leased assets to the lessor. If the Company elects to return the assets to the lessor at the end
of the initial lease term, the assets will be sold, and the Company has guaranteed a residual value
on the furniture and fixtures of $20. If the fair value of the furniture and fixtures were to
decline below the residual value, the Company would have to make up the difference under the
residual value guarantee. Under the sale-leaseback, the Company must maintain a minimum level of
consolidated statutory surplus and risk based capital ratios. In addition, the Company must not
exceed a maximum ratio of debt to capitalization. As of December 31, 2004, the Company was in
compliance with all such covenants.

As of December 31, 2004 and 2003, no liability was recorded for this guarantee, as the expected
fair value of the furniture and fixtures at the end of the initial lease term was greater than the
residual value guarantee.

Tax Matters

The Company’s federal income tax returns are routinely audited by the Internal Revenue Service
(“IRS). During the third quarter of 2004, the IRS completed its examination of the 1998-2001 tax
years, and the IRS and the Company agreed upon all adjustments. As a result, during the third
quarter of 2004 the Company booked a $216 tax benefit to reflect the impact of the audit settlement
on tax years covered by the examination as well as all other tax years prior to 2004. The benefit
relates primarily to the separate account DRD and interest. During the fourth quarter of 2004, the
IRS issued a Revenue Agent’s Report, reflecting the adjustments computed and agreed upon in the
prior quarter with respect to the Company’s federal taxes for the years under examination. No
additional tax adjustments were recorded, as the results reflected in the Report were included in
the tax benefit recorded in the third quarter. The IRS is expected to begin its audit of the
2002-2004 tax years in 2005. Management believes that adequate provision has been made in the
financial statements for any potential assessments that may result from future tax examinations and
other tax-related matters for all open tax years.

Unfunded Commitments

At December 31, 2004, The Hartford has outstanding commitments totaling $629, of which $330 is
committed to fund limited partnership investments. These capital commitments can be called by the
partnership during the commitment period (on average 2 to 5 years) to fund working capital needs or
purchase new investments. Once the commitment period expires, the Company is under no obligation
to fund the remaining unfunded commitment but may elect to do so. The remaining $299 of
outstanding commitments are primarily related to various funding obligations associated with
investments in mortgage and construction loans. These have a commitment period of one month to 3
years.

Guaranty Fund and Other Insurance-related Assessments

In all states, insurers licensed to transact certain classes of insurance are required to become
members of a guaranty fund. In most states, in the event of the insolvency of an insurer writing
any such class of insurance in the state, members of the fund are assessed to pay certain claims of
the insolvent insurer. A particular state’s fund assesses its members based on their respective
written premiums in the state for the classes of insurance in which the insolvent insurer is
engaged. Assessments are generally limited for any year to one or two percent of premiums written
per year depending on the state. Such assessments paid by The Hartford approximated $23 in 2004,
$26 in 2003 and $26 in 2002.

The Hartford accounts for guaranty fund and other insurance assessments in accordance with
Statement of Position No. 97-3, “Accounting by Insurance and Other Enterprises for
Insurance-Related Assessments”. Liabilities for guaranty fund and other insurance-related
assessments are accrued when an assessment is probable, when it can be reasonably estimated, and
when the event obligating the entity to pay an imposed or probable assessment has occurred.
Liabilities for guaranty funds and other insurance-related assessments are not discounted and are
included as part of other liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of December 31, 2004
and 2003, the liability balance was $215 and $181, respectively. As of December 31, 2004 and 2003,
included in other assets was $14 of related assets for premium tax offsets.

In management’s judgment, the net deferred tax asset will more likely than not be realized as
reductions of future taxes paid. Accordingly, no valuation allowance has been recorded. Included
in the deferred tax asset is the expected tax benefit attributable to net operating losses of $2.3
billion, consisting of U.S. losses of $1.8 billion, which expire in 2023, and foreign losses of
$0.5 billion, which expire from 2006-2012.

Prior to the Tax Reform Act of 1984, the Life Insurance Company Income Tax Act of 1959 permitted
the deferral from taxation of a portion of statutory income under certain circumstances. In these
situations, the deferred income was accumulated in a “Policyholders’ Surplus Account” and would be
taxable only under conditions which management considered to be remote; therefore, no federal
income taxes have been provided on the balance in this account, which for tax return purposes was
$104 as of December 31, 2004. The American Jobs Creation Act of 2004, which was enacted
in October 2004, allows distributions to be made from the Policyholders’ Surplus Account free of
tax in 2005 and 2006. The Company anticipates, based on currently available information, that it
will distribute the entire balance in the account, thereby permanently eliminating the potential
tax of $37.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)

14. Debt (continued)

Each equity unit offered initially consists of a corporate unit with a stated amount of fifty
dollars per unit. Each corporate unit consists of one purchase contract for the sale of a certain
number of shares of the Company’s stock and a 5% ownership interest in one thousand dollars
principal amount of senior notes due August 16, 2008.

The corporate unit may be converted by the holder into a treasury unit consisting of the purchase
contract and a 5% undivided beneficial interest in a zero-coupon U.S. Treasury security with a
principal amount of one thousand dollars that matures on August 15, 2006. The holder of an equity
unit owns the underlying senior notes or treasury securities but has pledged the senior notes or
treasury securities to the Company to secure the holder’s obligations under the purchase contract.

The purchase contract obligates the holder to purchase, and obligates The Hartford to sell, on
August 16, 2006, for fifty dollars, a variable number of newly issued common shares of The
Hartford. The number of The Hartford’s shares to be issued will be determined at the time the
purchase contracts are settled based upon the then current applicable market value of The
Hartford’s common stock. If the applicable market value of The Hartford’s common stock is equal to
or less than $45.50, then the Company will deliver 1.0989 shares to the holder of the equity unit,
or an aggregate of 15.2 million shares. If the applicable market value of The Hartford’s common
stock is greater than $45.50 but less than $56.875, then the Company will deliver the number of
shares equal to fifty dollars divided by the then current applicable market value of The Hartford’s
common stock to the holder. Finally, if the applicable market value of The Hartford’s common stock
is equal to or greater than $56.875, then the Company will deliver 0.8791 shares to the holder, or
an aggregate of 12.1 million shares. Accordingly, upon settlement of the purchase contracts on
August 16, 2006, The Hartford will receive proceeds of approximately $690 and will deliver between
12.1 million and 15.2 million common shares in the aggregate. The proceeds will be credited to
stockholders’ equity and allocated between the common stock and additional paid-in capital
accounts. The Hartford will make quarterly contract adjustment payments to the equity unit holders
at a rate of 4.44% of the stated amount per year until the purchase contract is settled.

Each corporate unit also includes a 5% ownership interest in one thousand dollars principal amount
of senior notes that will mature on August 16, 2008. The aggregate maturity value of the senior
notes is $690. The notes are pledged by the holders to secure their obligations under the purchase
contracts. The Hartford will make quarterly interest payments to the holders of the notes
initially at an annual rate of 2.56%. On May 11, 2006, the notes will be remarketed. At that
time, The Hartford’s remarketing agent will have the ability to reset the interest rate on the
notes in order to generate sufficient remarketing proceeds to satisfy the holder’s obligation under
the purchase contract. If the initial remarketing is unsuccessful, the remarketing agent will
attempt to remarket the notes, as necessary, on June 13, 2006, July 12, 2006 and August 11, 2006.
If all remarketing attempts are unsuccessful, the Company will exercise its rights as a secured
party to obtain and extinguish the notes.

The total distributions payable on the equity units are at an annual rate of 7%, consisting of
interest (2.56%) and contract adjustment payments (4.44%). The corporate units are listed on the
New York Stock Exchange under the symbol “HIG PrD”.

The equity units have been reflected in the diluted earnings per share calculation using the
treasury stock method. Under the treasury stock method, the number of shares of common stock used
in calculating diluted earnings per share is increased by the excess, if any, of the number of
shares issuable upon settlement of the purchase contracts, over the number of shares that could be
purchased by The Hartford in the market using the proceeds received upon settlement. The number of
issuable shares is based on the average marketprice for the last 20 trading days of the
period. The number of shares purchased is based on the average market price during the entire
period. For each of the periods in the year ended December 31, 2004, the equity units had a
dilutive effect on the diluted earnings per share calculation. For the period from the date of
issuance through December 31, 2003, the equity units did not impact the diluted earnings (loss) per
share calculation.

On September 13, 2002, The Hartford issued 6.6 million 6% equity units at a price of fifty dollars
per unit and received net proceeds of $319. Each equity unit offered initially consists of a
corporate unit with a stated amount of fifty dollars per unit. Each corporate unit consists of one
purchase contract for the sale of a certain number of shares of the Company’s stock and fifty
dollars principal amount of senior notes due November 16, 2008.

The corporate unit may be converted by the holder into a treasury unit consisting of the purchase
contract and a 5% undivided beneficial interest in a zero-coupon U.S. Treasury security with a
principal amount of one thousand dollars that matures on November 15, 2006. The holder of an
equity unit owns the underlying senior notes or treasury portfolio but has pledged the senior notes
or treasury portfolio to the Company to secure the holder’s obligations under the purchase
contract.

The purchase contract obligates the holder to purchase, and obligates The Hartford to sell, on
November 16, 2006, for fifty dollars, a variable number of newly issued common shares of The
Hartford. The number of The Hartford’s shares to be issued will be determined at the time the
purchase contracts are settled based upon the then current applicable market value of The
Hartford’s common stock. If the applicable market value of The Hartford’s common stock is equal to
or less than $47.25, then the Company will deliver 1.0582 shares to the holder of the equity unit,
or an aggregate of 7.0 million shares. If the applicable market value of The Hartford’s common
stock is greater than $47.25 but less than $57.645, then the Company will deliver the number of
shares equal to fifty dollars divided by the then current applicable market value of The Hartford’s
common stock to the holder. Finally, if the

F-50


NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)

14. Debt (continued)

applicable market value of The Hartford’s common stock is equal to or greater than $57.645,
then the Company will deliver 0.8674 shares to the holder, or an aggregate of 5.7 million shares.
Accordingly, upon settlement of the purchase contracts on November 16, 2006, The Hartford will
receive proceeds of approximately $330 and will deliver between 5.7 million and 7.0 million common
shares in the aggregate. The proceeds will be credited to stockholders’ equity and allocated
between the common stock and additional paid-in capital accounts. The Hartford will make quarterly
contract adjustment payments to the equity unit holders at a rate of 1.90% of the stated amount per
year until the purchase contract is settled.

Each corporate unit also includes fifty dollars principal amount of senior notes that will mature
on November 16, 2008. The aggregate maturity value of the senior notes is $330. The notes are
pledged by the holders to secure their obligations under the purchase contracts. The Hartford will
make quarterly interest payments to the holders of the notes initially at an annual rate of 4.10%.
On August 11, 2006, the notes will be remarketed. At that time, The Hartford’s remarketing agent
will have the ability to reset the interest rate on the notes in order to generate sufficient
remarketing proceeds to satisfy the holder’s obligation under the purchase contract. In the event
of an unsuccessful remarketing, the Company will exercise its rights as a secured party to obtain
and extinguish the notes.

The total distributions payable on the equity units are at an annual rate of 6.0%, consisting of
interest (4.10%) and contract adjustment payments (1.90%). The corporate units are listed on the
New York Stock Exchange under the symbol “HIG PrA”.

The equity units are reflected in the diluted earnings per share calculation using the treasury
stock method, which would be used for the equity units at any time before the issuance of the
shares of The Hartford’s common stock upon the settlement of the purchase contracts. Under the
treasury stock method, the number of shares of common stock used in calculating diluted earnings
per share is increased by the excess, if any, of the number of shares issuable upon settlement of
the purchase contracts over the number of shares that could be purchased by The Hartford in the
market, at the average market price during the period, using the proceeds received upon settlement.
The Company anticipates that there will be no dilutive effect on its earnings per share related to
the equity units, except during periods when the average market price of a share of the Company’s
common stock is above the threshold appreciation price of $57.645. Because the average market
price of The Hartford’s common stock during the period from the date of issuance through December
31, 2002 and for the year ended December 2003, was below this threshold appreciation price, the
shares issuable under the purchase contract component of the equity units have not been included in
the diluted earnings (loss) per share calculations.

Shelf Registrations

On December 3, 2003, The Hartford’s shelf registration statement (Registration No. 333-108067) for
the potential offering and sale of debt and equity securities in an aggregate amount of up to $3.0
billion was declared effective by the SEC. The Registration Statement allows for the following
types of securities to be offered: (i) debt securities, preferred stock, common stock, depositary
shares, warrants, stock purchase contracts, stock purchase units and junior subordinated deferrable
interest debentures of the Company, and (ii) preferred securities of any of one or more capital
trusts organized by The Hartford (“The Hartford Trusts”). The
Company may enter into guarantees with respect to the preferred securities of any of The Hartford
Trusts. As of December 31, 2004, the Company had $2.4 billion remaining on its shelf.

On May 15, 2001, HLI filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) a shelf registration
statement for the potential offering and sale of up to $1.0 billion in debt and preferred
securities. The registration statement was declared effective on May 29, 2001. As of December 31,
2004, the Company had $1.0 billion remaining on its shelf.

14. Debt (continued)

Under the two revolving credit agreements, the Company must maintain a minimum level of
consolidated statutory surplus and risk based capital ratios. In addition, the Company must
not exceed a maximum ratio of debt to capitalization. Quarterly, the Company certifies
compliance with each financial covenant. At December 31, 2004 and 2003, the Company was in
compliance with all such covenants.

Junior Subordinated Debentures

The Hartford and its subsidiary, HLI, have formed statutory business trusts, which exist for the
exclusive purposes of (i) issuing Trust Securities representing undivided beneficial interests in
the assets of the Trust; (ii) investing the gross proceeds of the Trust Securities in Junior
Subordinated Deferrable Interest Debentures (“Junior Subordinated Debentures”) of The Hartford or
HLI; and (iii) engaging in only those activities necessary or incidental thereto. Prior to the
adoption of FIN 46R, the trust preferred securities were reported as mandatory redeemable preferred
securities of subsidiary trusts. In accordance with the adoption of FIN 46R, the Company has
deconsolidated the trust preferred securities. For further discussion of the adoption of FIN 46R,
see Note 1.

For each of the respective debentures, The Hartford or HLI, has the right at any time, and
from time to time, to defer payments of interest on the Junior Subordinated Debentures for a
period not exceeding 20 consecutive quarters up to the debentures’ maturity date. During any
such period, interest will continue to accrue and The Hartford or HLI may not declare or pay
any cash dividends or distributions on, or purchase, The Hartford’s or HLI’s capital stock nor
make any principal, interest or premium payments on or repurchase any debt securities that
rank equally with or junior to the Junior Subordinated Debentures. The Hartford or HLI will
have the right at any time to dissolve the Trust and cause the Junior Subordinated Debentures
to be distributed to the holders of the Preferred Securities.

[2]

The Hartford Junior Subordinated Debentures are unsecured and rank junior and subordinate in
right of payment to all senior debt of The Hartford and are effectively subordinated to all
existing and future liabilities of its subsidiaries.

[3]

The Hartford has guaranteed, on a subordinated basis, all of the Hartford Capital III
obligations under the Hartford Series C Preferred Securities, including to pay the redemption
price and any accumulated and unpaid distributions to the extent of available funds and upon
dissolution, winding up or liquidation, but only to the extent that Hartford Capital III has
funds to make such payments.

The securities for Hartford Life Capital I were redeemed on March 15, 2004.

15. Stockholders’ Equity

Common Stock

In September 2004, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized the Company to repurchase up to $1
billion of its securities. The Company’s repurchase authorization permits purchases of common
stock and equity units, which may be in the open market or

F-52


NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)

15. Stockholders’ Equity (continued)

through privately negotiated transactions. The Company also may enter into derivative
transactions to facilitate future repurchases of common stock and equity units. As of December 31,
2004, the Company has made no repurchases under this program.

On January 22, 2004, The Hartford issued approximately 6.3 million shares of common stock pursuant
to an underwritten offering at a price to the public of $63.25 per share and received net proceeds
of $388. Subsequently, on January 30, 2004, The Hartford issued approximately 377 thousand shares
of common stock pursuant to an underwritten offering at a price to the public of $63.25 per share
and received net proceeds of $23. The Company used the proceeds from these issuances to repay $411
of commercial paper issued in connection with the acquisition of the group life and accident, and
short-term and long-term disability businesses of CNA Financial Corporation. (For further
discussion of this acquisition, see Note 20.)

On May 23, 2003, The Hartford issued approximately 24.2 million shares of common stock pursuant to
an underwritten offering at a price to the public of $45.50 per share and received net proceeds of
$1.1 billion. Subsequently, on May 30, 2003, The Hartford issued approximately 2.2 million shares
of common stock at a price to the public of $45.50 per share and received net proceeds of $97.

On May 23, 2003 and May 30, 2003, The Hartford issued 12.0 million 7% equity units and 1.8 million
7% equity units, respectively. Each equity unit contains a purchase contract obligating the holder
to purchase and The Hartford to sell, a variable number of newly issued shares of The Hartford’s
common stock. Upon settlement of the purchase contracts on August 16, 2006, The Hartford will
receive proceeds of approximately $690 and will deliver between 12.1 million and 15.2 million
shares in the aggregate. For further discussion of the equity units issuance, see Note 14 above.

Preferred Stock

The Company has 50,000,000 shares of preferred stock authorized, none of which have been
issued. In 1995, the Company approved The Hartford Stockholder Rights Plan, pursuant to which a
nonvoting right attaches to each share of common stock. Upon the occurrence of certain triggering
events, the right will permit each shareholder to purchase a fraction of a share of the Series A
Participating Cumulative Preferred Stock (the “Series A Preferred Stock”) of The Hartford. There
are 300,000 authorized shares of Series A Preferred Stock. No shares were issued or outstanding at
December 31, 2004 or 2003.

Statutory Results

The domestic insurance subsidiaries of HFSG prepare their statutory financial statements in
accordance with accounting practices prescribed or permitted by the applicable state insurance
department which vary with GAAP. Prescribed statutory accounting practices include publications of
the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (“NAIC”), as well as state laws, regulations
and general administrative rules. The differences between statutory financial statements and
financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP vary between domestic and foreign
jurisdictions. The principal differences are that statutory financial statements do not reflect
deferred policy acquisition costs and limit deferred income taxes, and for statutory reporting,
bonds are generally carried at amortized cost and reinsurance assets and liabilities are presented
net of reinsurance. The Company’s use of permitted statutory accounting practices does not have a
significant impact on statutory surplus.

The payment of dividends by Connecticut-domiciled insurers is limited under the insurance
holding company laws of Connecticut. Under these laws, the insurance subsidiaries may only make
their dividend payments out of unassigned surplus. These laws require notice to and approval by
the state insurance commissioner for the declaration or payment of any dividend, which, together
with other dividends or distributions made within the preceding twelve months, exceeds the greater
of (i) 10% of the insurer’s policyholder surplus as of December 31 of the preceding year or (ii)
net income (or net gain from operations, if such company is a life insurance company) for the
twelve-month period ending on the thirty-first day of December last preceding, in each case
determined under statutory insurance accounting policies. In addition, if any dividend of a
Connecticut-domiciled insurer exceeds the insurer’s earned surplus, it requires the prior approval
of the Connecticut Insurance Commissioner. The insurance holding

F-53


NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)

15. Stockholders’ Equity (continued)

company laws of the other jurisdictions in which The Hartford’s insurance subsidiaries are
incorporated (or deemed commercially domiciled) generally contain similar (although in certain
instances somewhat more restrictive) limitations on the payment of dividends. As of December 31,
2004, the maximum amount of statutory dividends which may be paid to HFSG from its insurance
subsidiaries in 2005, without prior approval, is $1.9 billion.

16. Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income, Net of Tax

Comprehensive income is defined as all changes in stockholders’ equity, except those arising
from transactions with stockholders. Comprehensive income includes net income (loss) and other
comprehensive income (loss), which for the Company consists of changes in unrealized appreciation
or depreciation of available-for-sale investments carried at market value, changes in gains or
losses on cash-flow hedging instruments, changes in foreign currency translation gains or losses
and changes in the Company’s minimum pension liability.

17. Pension Plans and Postretirement Health Care and Life Insurance Benefit Plans

The Company maintains a U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plan (“the Plan”) that covers
substantially all employees. U.S. employees of the Company and certain affiliates hired prior to
January 1, 2001 and who have rendered 5 or more years of service are entitled to annual pension
benefits, beginning at normal retirement age (65), equal to 2% of their final average pay per year
multiplied by the number of years of credited service up to a maximum of 60% of the average, less 1
2/3% of primary Social Security per year of credited service, up to a maximum of 50%. Final
average pay represents the average of any of their 60 highest paid calendar months during the last
120 calendar months of credited service preceding termination or retirement.

F-54


NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)

17. Pension Plans and Postretirement Health Care and Life Insurance Benefit Plans (continued)

Effective for all employees who joined the Company on or after January 1, 2001, a new
component or formula was applied under the Plan referred to as the “cash balance formula”. Under
the cash balance formula, a notional account is established for each employee that is credited with
a percentage of the employee’s pay for each pay period, based on the employee’s age and whether or
not the employee’s pay has exceeded the Social Security taxable wage base at the time crediting
occurs. Interest is also credited on employee cash balance accounts. Once they become vested,
employees can elect to receive the value of their plan benefit (the accumulated sum of their annual
plan allocations with interest) in a single cash payment when they leave the Company. In
September 2003, the Company announced its approval to amend the Plan to implement, as of January 1,
2009, the cash balance formula for the purposes of calculating future pension benefits for services
rendered on or after January 1, 2009, for all employees hired before January 1, 2001. These amounts
are in addition to amounts earned through December 31, 2008 under the traditional final average pay
formula. Employees hired on or after January 1, 2001 are currently covered under the same cash
balance formula. Under certain conditions, as described in the Plan document, the Plan permits
early retirement at ages 50-64 with a reduced benefit. Employees may elect to receive their
pension benefits in the form of a life annuity or joint and survivor annuity. Employees covered
under the cash balance formula may elect a lump-sum distribution. If employees terminate before
rendering 5 years of service, they forfeit the right to receive the portion of their accumulated
plan benefits attributable to the Company’s contributions.

The Company also maintains unfunded excess plans to provide benefits in excess of amounts permitted
to be paid to participants of the Plan under the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code.
Additionally, the Company has entered into individual retirement agreements with certain current
and retired directors providing for unfunded supplemental pension benefits.

The Hartford provides certain health care and life insurance benefits for eligible retired
employees. The Hartford’s contribution for health care benefits will depend upon the retiree’s
date of retirement and years of service. In addition, the plan has a defined dollar cap for
certain retirees which limits average Company contributions. The Hartford has prefunded a portion
of the health care obligations through trust funds where such prefunding can be accomplished on a
tax effective basis. Effective January 1, 2002, retiree medical, retiree dental and retiree life
insurance benefits were eliminated for employees with original hire dates with the Company on or
after January 1, 2002.

In May 2004, the FASB issued FSP FAS No. 106-2, “Accounting and Disclosure Requirements Related to
the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003” (“FSP 106-2”), which
provides guidance on accounting for the effects of the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and
Modernization Act of 2003 (“the Act”). The Act introduces (1) a prescription drug benefit under
Medicare and (2) a federal subsidy to sponsors of retiree health care benefit plans that provide a
benefit that is at least “actuarially equivalent” to Medicare Part D. The FASB concluded that the
subsidy should be treated as an actuarial gain pursuant to SFAS No. 106, “Employers’ Accounting for
Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions”. FSP 106-2 is effective for the first interim period
or annual period beginning after June 15, 2004. Since the effects of the Act were not considered
a significant event, the effects of the Act were incorporated in the next measurement of plan
assets and obligations, December 31, 2004. The Company believes that it will be entitled to the
subsidy. Therefore, the Company adopted FSP 106-2 as of December 31, 2004. The adoption of FSP
106-2 did not have a material effect on either the Company’s accumulated postretirement benefit
obligation or its consolidated financial condition or results of operations.

obligation and fair value of plan assets as well as the funded status of The Hartford’s defined
benefit pension and postretirement health care and life insurance benefit plans for the years ended
December 31, 2004 and 2003. International plans represent an immaterial percentage of total
pension assets, liabilities and expense and, for reporting purposes, are combined with domestic
plans. The Company uses a measurement date of December 31 for its pension and other postretirement
benefit plans.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)

17. Pension Plans and Postretirement Health Care and Life Insurance Benefit Plans (continued)

The funded status of the Company’s defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans is
dependent upon many factors, including returns on invested assets and the level of market interest
rates. Declines in long-term interest rates have had a negative impact on the funded status of the
plans. As a result, the Company has recorded a change in minimum pension liability as of December
31, 2004 and 2003 as presented below:

In determining the discount rate assumption, the Company utilizes current market information
provided by its plan actuaries, including a discounted cash flow analysis of the Company’s pension
and other postretirement obligations and general movements in the current market environment. The
Company determines the long-term rate of return assumption for the pension and other postretirement
asset portfolios based on analysis of the portfolios’ historical rates of return balanced with
future long-term return expectations. Based on its long-term outlook with respect to the markets,
the Company maintained its long-term rate of return assumption at 8.50% as of December 31, 2004.

Assumed health care cost trend rates were as follows:

As of December 31,

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)

17. Pension Plans and Postretirement Health Care and Life Insurance Benefit Plans (continued)

Assumed health care cost trends have an effect on the amounts reported for the postretirement
health care and life insurance benefit plan. Increasing/decreasing the health care trend rates by
one percent would have the effect of increasing/decreasing the benefit obligation as of December
31, 2004 by $12 and the annual net periodic expense for the year then ended by $1.

The overall goal of the Plan is to maximize total investment returns to provide sufficient funding
for present and anticipated future benefit obligations within the constraints of a prudent level of
portfolio risk and diversification. Investment decisions are approved by the Company’s Pension
Fund Trust and Investment Committee. The Company believes that the asset allocation decision will
be the single most important factor determining the long-term performance of the Plan.

Divergent market performance among different asset classes may, from time to time, cause the asset
allocation to deviate from the desired asset allocation ranges. The asset allocation mix is
reviewed on a periodic basis. If it is determined that an asset allocation mix rebalancing is
required, future portfolio additions and withdrawals will be used, as necessary, to bring the
allocation within tactical ranges.

In order to minimize risk, the Plan maintains a listing of permissible and prohibited investments.
In addition, the Plan has certain concentration limits and investment quality requirements imposed
on permissible investment options. The Company employs a duration overlay program to
adjust the duration of the fixed income component in the plan assets to better match the duration
of the benefit obligation. The portfolio will invest primarily in U.S. Treasury notes and bond
futures contracts to maintain the duration within +/- 0.75 year of target duration.

18. Stock Compensation Plans

On May 18, 2000, the shareholders of The Hartford approved The Hartford Incentive Stock Plan
(the “2000 Plan”), which replaced The Hartford 1995 Incentive Stock Plan (the “1995 Plan”). The
terms of the 2000 Plan were substantially similar to the terms of the 1995 Plan except that the
1995 Plan had an annual award limit and a higher maximum award limit.

Under the 2000 Plan, awards may be granted in the form of non-qualified or incentive stock options
qualifying under Section 422A of the Internal Revenue Code, performance shares or restricted stock,
or any combination of the foregoing. In addition, stock appreciation rights may be granted in
connection with all or part of any stock options granted under the 2000 Plan. In December 2004,
the 2000 Plan was amended to allow for grants of restricted stock units effective as of January 1,
2005. The aggregate number of shares of stock, which may be awarded, is subject to a maximum limit
of 17,211,837 shares applicable to all awards for the ten-year duration of the 2000 Plan.

All options granted have an exercise price equal to the market price of the Company’s common stock
on the date of grant, and an option’s maximum term is ten years and two days. Certain options
become exercisable over a three year period commencing one year from the date of grant, while
certain other options become exercisable upon the attainment of specified market price appreciation
of the Company’s common shares. For any year, no individual employee may receive an award of
options for more than 1,000,000 shares. As of December 31, 2004, The Hartford had not issued any
incentive stock options under the 2000 Plan.

Performance awards of common stock granted under the 2000 Plan become payable upon the attainment
of specific performance goals achieved over a period of not less than one nor more than five years,
and the restricted stock granted is subject to a restriction period. On a cumulative basis, no
more than 20% of the aggregate number of shares which may be awarded under the 2000 Plan are
available for performance shares and restricted stock awards. Also, the maximum award of
performance shares for any individual employee in any year is 200,000 shares. In 2004, 2003 and
2002, the Company granted shares of common stock of 315,452, 333,712 and 40,852 with weighted
average prices of $64.93, $38.13 and $62.28, respectively, related to performance share and
restricted stock awards.

In 1996, the Company established The Hartford Employee Stock Purchase Plan (“ESPP”). Under this
plan, eligible employees of The Hartford may purchase common stock of the Company at a 15% discount
from the lower of the closing market price at the beginning or end of the quarterly offering
period. The Company may sell up to 5,400,000 shares of stock to eligible employees under the ESPP.
In 2004, 2003 and 2002, 345,262, 443,467 and 408,304 shares were sold, respectively. The per
share weighted average fair value of the discount under the ESPP was $9.31, $11.96, and $11.70 in
2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Additionally, during 1997, The Hartford established employee
stock purchase plans for certain employees of the Company’s international subsidiaries. Under
these plans, participants may purchase common stock of The Hartford at a fixed price at the end of
a three-year period. The activity under these programs is not material.

18. Stock Compensation Plans (continued)

Effective January 1, 2003, the Company adopted the fair value recognition provisions of
accounting for stock-based compensation awards granted or modified after January 1, 2003. All
stock-based awards granted or modified prior to January 1, 2003, continue to be valued using the
intrinsic value-based provisions set forth in APB Opinion No. 25 and related interpretations. (See
Note 1 for discussion of accounting for stock compensation plans.) A summary of the status of
non-qualified options included in the Company’s incentive stock plan as of December 31, 2004, 2003

19. Investment and Savings Plan

Substantially all U.S. employees are eligible to participate in The Hartford’s Investment and
Savings Plan under which designated contributions may be invested in common stock of The Hartford
or certain other investments. These contributions are matched, up to 3% of compensation, by the
Company. In addition, the Company allocates at least 0.5% of base salary to the plan for each
eligible employee. In 2004, the Company allocated 1.5% of base salary to the plan for eligible
employees who received compensation of less than ninety thousand dollars during the prior year.
The cost to The Hartford for this plan was approximately $50, $36 and $34 for 2004, 2003 and 2002,
respectively.

20. Acquisitions

During the second quarter of 2004, the Company finalized its December 31, 2003, acquisition of
CNA Financial Corporation’s group life and accident, and short-term and long-term businesses. The
acquisition was consummated to increase the scale of the Company’s group life and disability
operations and to expand and enhance the distribution and delivery of those products and related
services. The final purchase price was $543. Through the acquisition, assets, comprised primarily
of fixed maturities and short-term investments, increased $2.6 billion and liabilities, comprised
primarily of future policy benefits and unpaid claims and claim adjustments expense increased by
$2.0 billion. The Company did not record any goodwill or other intangibles, including present
value of future profits as a result of the acquisition. As the acquisition was completed on
December 31, 2003, the results of operations of the acquired business are included in the Company’s
statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2004.

addition. Included in the quarter ended June 30, 2003 are
after-tax severance charges in Property & Casualty of $27 and $30
of tax benefits in Life related to the favorable treatment of
certain tax items arising during the 1996-2002 tax years.
Included in the quarter ended September 30, 2003 are after-tax
expenses of $40 related to the settlement of the Bancorp Services,
LLC litigation dispute. Included in the quarter ended September
30, 2004 are tax benefits of $190 in Life and $26 in Property and
Casualty related to tax years prior to 2004.

[2]

As a result of the net loss in the quarter ended March 31, 2003,
SFAS No. 128 requires the Company to use basic weighted average
shares outstanding in the calculation of first quarter 2003
diluted earnings per share, as the inclusion of options of 0.7
would have been antidilutive to the earnings per share
calculation. In the absence of the net loss, weighted average
common shares outstanding and dilutive potential common shares
would have totaled 256.1.
