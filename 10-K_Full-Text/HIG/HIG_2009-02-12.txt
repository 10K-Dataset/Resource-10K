ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K

FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2008




PART I

Item 1. BUSINESS

(Dollar amounts in millions, except for per share data, unless otherwise stated)

General

The Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc. (together with its subsidiaries, “The Hartford” or the
“Company”) is an insurance and financial services company. The Hartford, headquartered in
Connecticut, is among the largest providers of investment products, individual life, group life and
group disability insurance products, and property and casualty insurance products in the United
States. Hartford Fire Insurance Company, founded in 1810, is the oldest of The Hartford’s
subsidiaries. The Hartford writes insurance in the United States and internationally. At December
31, 2008, total assets and total stockholders’ equity of The Hartford were $287.6 billion and $9.3
billion, respectively.

Organization

The Hartford strives to maintain and enhance its position as a market leader within the financial
services industry. The Company sells diverse and innovative products through multiple distribution
channels to consumers and businesses. The Company is continuously seeking to develop and expand
its distribution channels, achieve cost efficiencies through improved technology, and capitalize on its
brand name and The Hartford Stag Logo, one of the most recognized symbols in the financial services
industry.

As a holding company that is separate and distinct from its subsidiaries, The Hartford Financial
Services Group, Inc. has no significant business operations of its own. Therefore, it relies on
the dividends from its insurance companies and other subsidiaries as the principal source of cash
flow to meet its obligations. Additional information regarding the cash flow and liquidity needs
of The Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc. may be found in the Capital Resources and Liquidity
section of Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations (“MD&A”).

The Company maintains a retail mutual fund operation, whereby the Company, through wholly-owned
subsidiaries, provides investment management and administrative services to The Hartford Mutual
Funds, Inc. and The Hartford Mutual Funds II, Inc (“The mutual funds”), families of 62 mutual funds
and 1 closed end fund. The Company charges fees to the shareholders of the mutual funds, which are
recorded as revenue by the Company. Investors can purchase “shares” in the mutual funds, all of
which are registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), in accordance with the
Investment Company Act of 1940.

The mutual funds are owned by the shareholders of those funds and not by the Company. As such, the
mutual fund assets and liabilities and related investment returns are not reflected in the
Company’s consolidated financial statements since they are not assets, liabilities and operations
of the Company.

Reporting Segments

The Hartford is organized into two major operations: Life and Property & Casualty, each containing
reporting segments. Within the Life and Property & Casualty operations, The Hartford conducts
business principally in eleven reporting segments. Corporate primarily includes the Company’s debt
financing and related interest expense, as well as other capital raising activities and purchase
accounting adjustments.

Life is organized into four groups which are comprised of six reporting segments: The Retail
Products Group (“Retail”) and Individual Life segments make up the Individual Markets Group. The
Retirement Plans and Group Benefits segments make up the Employer Markets Group. The International
and Institutional Solutions Group (“Institutional”) segments each make up their own group.

Life includes in an Other category its leveraged private placement life insurance (“PPLI”) product
line of business; corporate items not directly allocated to any of its reportable operating
segments; inter-segment eliminations; and the mark-to-market adjustment for the International
variable annuity account assets that are classified as equity securities held for trading reported
in net investment income and the related change in interest credited reported as a component of
benefits, losses and loss adjustment expenses.

Property & Casualty is organized into five reporting segments: the underwriting segments of
Personal Lines, Small Commercial, Middle Market and Specialty Commercial (collectively “Ongoing
Operations”); and the Other Operations segment.

A measure of profit or loss used by The Hartford’s management in evaluating the performance of its
Life segments is net income (loss). Likewise, within Property & Casualty, net income (loss) is a
measure of profit or loss used in evaluating the performance of Total Property & Casualty, Ongoing
Operations and the Other Operations segment. Within Ongoing Operations, the underwriting segments
of Personal Lines, Small Commercial, Middle Market and Specialty Commercial are evaluated by The
Hartford’s management primarily based upon underwriting results. Underwriting results represent
premiums earned less incurred losses, loss adjustment expenses and underwriting expenses. The sum
of underwriting results, other revenues, net investment income, net realized capital gains and
losses, other expenses, and related income taxes is net income (loss).



Life

Life’s business is conducted by Hartford Life, Inc. (“Hartford Life” or “Life”), an indirect
wholly-owned subsidiary of The Hartford, headquartered in Simsbury,
Connecticut. Life provides (i) retail and institutional investment
products, including variable annuities, fixed market value adjusted (“Fixed MVA”) annuities, mutual
funds, private placement life insurance, which includes life insurance products purchased by a
company on the lives of its employees, and retirement plan services for the savings and retirement
needs of over 7 million customers, (ii) life insurance for wealth protection, accumulation and
transfer needs for approximately 760,000 customers, (iii) group benefits products such as group
life and group disability insurance for the benefit of millions of individuals, and (iv) fixed and
variable annuity products through its international operations for the savings and retirement needs
of approximately 490,000 customers. Life is a large seller of individual variable annuities,
variable universal life insurance and group life and disability insurance in the United States.
Life’s position in each of its core businesses provides an opportunity to sell Life’s products and
services as individuals save and plan for retirement, protect themselves and their families against
the financial uncertainties associated with disability or death and engage in estate planning.

In the past year, primarily as a result of effects of the financial crisis, Life’s total assets
under management declined to $298.0 billion at December 31, 2008 from $371.7 billion and $327.3
billion as of December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively, which include $50.1 billion, $55.5 billion
and $43.7 billion of third party assets invested in Life’s mutual funds and 529 College Savings
Plans for the same respective periods. The effects of the financial crisis, primarily due to
declines in net investment income on equity securities held for trading and investment impairments,
also impacted revenues which were $(1.1) billion in 2008, declining from $13.4 billion and $14.1
billion in 2007 and 2006, respectively, and net income (loss) of $(2.4) billion in 2008, declining
from $1.6 billion and $1.4 billion in 2007 and 2006, respectively.

Customer Service, Technology and Efficiencies

Life currently maintains operating efficiencies due to Life’s attention to expense and claims
management and commitment to customer service and technology. In addition, Life utilizes
technology to enhance communications within Life and throughout its distribution network in order
to improve Life’s efficiency in marketing, selling and servicing its products and, as a result,
provides high-quality customer service. In recognition of excellence in customer service for
individual annuities, Hartford Life was awarded the 2008 Annuity Service Award by DALBAR Inc., a
recognized independent financial services research organization, for the thirteenth consecutive
year. Hartford Life has received this prestigious award in every year of the award’s existence.
Also, in 2008 Life earned its sixth DALBAR Award for Mutual Fund and Retirement Plan Service.
Continuing the trend of service excellence, Life’s Individual Life segment won its eighth
consecutive DALBAR award for service of life insurance customers, where they finished the year
ranked number one and was the only life insurance company to win the service award this year.
Additionally, Life’s Individual Life segment also won its seventh consecutive DALBAR Financial
Intermediary Service Quality Evaluation Award in 2008, where they finished the year ranked number
nine and was the only life insurance company to win the service award this year. In 2008, Life’s
International segment received two 5-Star Financial Adviser Service Awards, voted by independent
financial advisers, for providing service excellence for their United Kingdom operations.

Risk Management

Life’s product designs, prudent underwriting standards and risk management techniques are
intended to mitigate against disintermediation risk, greater than expected mortality and
morbidity experience, foreign currency risk and risks associated with certain product features,
specifically the guaranteed minimum death benefit (“GMDB”), guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefit
(“GMWB”), guaranteed minimum income benefit (“GMIB”) and the guaranteed minimum accumulation
benefit (“GMAB”) offered with variable annuity products.
Life seeks to effectively utilize prudent
underwriting to select and price insurance risks and regularly monitors mortality and morbidity
assumptions to determine if experience remains consistent with these assumptions and to ensure that
its product pricing remains appropriate. Life also employs disciplined claims management to
protect itself against greater than expected morbidity experience. Life uses reinsurance
structures and has modified benefit features to mitigate the mortality exposure associated with
GMDB. Life also uses reinsurance and derivative instruments to attempt to mitigate risks
associated with GMWB, GMIB and GMAB liabilities. In managing the various aspects of these risks,
during the fourth quarter 2008, the Company placed a greater relative emphasis on protection of
statutory surplus, which will likely result in greater U.S. GAAP
earnings volatility. See Item 1A, Risk Factors, for a further discussion on the Company’s risks and
Capital Markets Risk Management for a discussion of Life Equity Risk Management.

Retail

The Retail segment focuses, through the sale of individual variable and fixed annuities, mutual
funds and other investment products to customers principally in the U.S., on the savings and
retirement needs of the growing number of individuals who are preparing for retirement or who have
already retired. This segment’s total assets were $97.2 billion, $136.0 billion and $130.0 billion
at December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively, excluding mutual funds of $32.7 billion, $50.5
billion and $40.0 billion for the same respective periods. Retail generated revenues of $1.6
billion, $3.5 billion and $3.4 billion in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively, of which individual
annuities accounted for $797, $2.7 billion and $2.7 billion for 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively.
Net income (loss) in Retail was $(1.4) billion, $812 and $536 in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively.



Life sells both variable and fixed individual annuity products through a wide distribution network
of national and regional broker-dealer organizations, banks and other financial institutions and
independent financial advisors. Life had annuity deposits of $9.5 billion, $14.3 billion and $13.1
billion in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Life had individual retail variable annuity deposits
in the United States of $7.9 billion, $13.2 billion and $12.1 billion in 2008, 2007 and 2006,
respectively. Annuity deposits declined in 2008 due to equity market volatility and increased
competition.

Life’s total account value related to individual annuity products was $85.9 billion as of December
31, 2008. Of this total account value, $74.6 billion, or 87%, related to individual variable
annuity products and $11.3 billion, or 13%, related primarily to fixed MVA annuity products. As of
December 31, 2007, Life’s total account value related to individual annuity products was $129.3
billion. Of this total account value, $119.1 billion, or 92%, related to individual variable
annuity products and $10.2 billion, or 8%, related primarily to fixed MVA annuity products. As of
December 31, 2006, Life’s total account value related to individual annuity products was $124.3
billion. Of this total account value, $114.4 billion, or 92%, related to individual variable
annuity products and $9.9 billion, or 8%, related primarily to fixed MVA annuity products.
Individual variable annuity account values declined in 2008 due primarily to declining equity
markets.

The mutual fund business continues to be a significant business to the Life Company. Retail mutual
fund assets were $31.0 billion, $48.4 billion and $38.5 billion as of December 31, 2008, 2007 and
2006, respectively. The decline in Retail mutual fund assets during 2008 was primarily related to
declining equity markets. Retail mutual fund deposits were $14.1 billion, $14.4 billion and $11.1
billion in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively.

Principal Products

Individual Variable Annuities

— Life earns fees, based on policyholders’ account values, for
managing variable annuity assets, providing various death and living benefits, and maintaining
policyholder accounts. Life uses specified portions of the periodic deposits paid by a customer to
purchase units in one or more mutual funds as directed by the customer, who then assumes the
investment performance risks and rewards. As a result, variable annuities permit policyholders to
choose aggressive or conservative investment strategies, as they deem appropriate, without
affecting the composition and quality of assets in Life’s general account. These products offer
the policyholder a variety of equity and fixed income options, as well as the ability to earn a
guaranteed rate of interest in the general account of Life. Life offers an enhanced guaranteed
rate of interest for a specified period of time (no longer than twelve months) if the policyholder
elects to dollar-cost average funds from Life’s general account into one or more separate accounts.

The assets underlying Life’s variable annuities are managed both internally and by independent
money managers, while Life provides all policy administration services. Furthermore, each money
manager is compensated on sales of Life’s products and enhances the marketability of Life’s
annuities and the strength of its product offerings.

Policyholders may make deposits of varying amounts at regular or irregular intervals and the value
of these assets fluctuates in accordance with the investment performance of the funds selected by
the policyholder. To encourage persistency, many of Life’s individual variable annuities are
subject to withdrawal restrictions and surrender charges. Surrender charges range up to 8% of the
contract’s deposits less withdrawals, and reduce to zero on a sliding scale, usually within seven
years from the deposit date.

Many of the individual variable annuity contracts issued by Retail also offer a living benefit
(i.e., GMWB) feature. The GMWB provides the policyholder with a guaranteed remaining balance
(“GRB”) if their account value is reduced to zero through a combination of market declines and
withdrawals. The GRB is generally equal to premiums less withdrawals. However, certain withdrawal
provisions and reset features could cause the GRB to fluctuate from year to year. Retail’s total
account value related to individual variable annuity products with GMWB features was $38.1 billion,
$56.4 billion and $48.3 billion at December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The decline in
account value during 2008 was primarily due to declines in equity markets.

All variable annuity contracts are issued with a GMDB feature. GMDB features include (1) the sum of
all premium payments less prior withdrawals; (2) the maximum anniversary value of the contract,
plus any premium payments since the contract anniversary, minus any withdrawals following the
contract anniversary and (3) the maximum anniversary value; not to exceed the account value plus
the greater of (a) 25% of premium payments, or (b) 25% of the maximum anniversary value of the
contract.

Fixed MVA Annuities

— Fixed MVA annuities are fixed rate annuity contracts which guarantee a
specific sum of money to be paid in the future, either as a lump sum or as monthly income. In the
event that a policyholder surrenders a policy prior to the end of the guarantee period, the MVA
feature increases or decreases the cash surrender value of the annuity as a function of decreases
or increases, respectively, in crediting rates for newly issued contracts thereby protecting Life
from losses due to higher interest rates (but, not necessarily widening credit spreads) at the time
of surrender. The amount of the lump sum or monthly income payment will not fluctuate due to
adverse changes in other components of Life’s investment return, mortality experience or expenses.
Retail’s primary fixed MVA annuities have terms varying from one to ten years with an average term
to maturity of approximately four years.

Mutual Funds

— Life offers a family of retail mutual funds for which Life provides investment
management and administrative services. The fund family has grown significantly from 8 funds at
inception to the current offering of 62 mutual funds and 1 closed end fund. Life’s funds are
managed by Wellington Management Company, LLP (“Wellington”) and Hartford Investment Management
Company (“HIMCO”). Life has entered into agreements with over 1,000 financial services firms to
distribute these mutual funds.



Life charges fees to the shareholders of the mutual funds, which are recorded as revenue by Life.
Investors can purchase shares in the mutual funds, all of which are registered with the SEC, in
accordance with the Investment Company Act of 1940. The mutual funds are owned by the shareholders
of those funds and not by Life. Therefore, the mutual fund assets and liabilities, as well as
related investment returns, are not reflected in The Hartford’s consolidated financial statements.

Marketing and Distribution

Life’s distribution network is based on management’s strategy of utilizing multiple and competing
distribution channels to achieve the broadest distribution to reach target customers. The success
of Life’s marketing and distribution system depends on its product offerings, fund performance,
successful utilization of wholesaling organizations, quality of customer service, and relationships
with national and regional broker-dealer firms, banks and other financial institutions, and
independent financial advisors (through which the sale of Life’s retail investment products to
customers is consummated).

Life periodically negotiates provisions and terms of its relationships with unaffiliated parties,
and there can be no assurance that such terms will remain acceptable to Life or such third parties.
Life’s primary wholesaler of its individual annuities is PLANCO Financial Services, LLC and its
affiliate, PLANCO, LLC (collectively “PLANCO”) which are indirect wholly-owned subsidiaries of
Hartford Life. PLANCO is one of the leading wholesalers of individual annuities and has played a
significant role in The Hartford’s growth over the past decade. As a wholesaler, PLANCO
distributes Life’s fixed and variable annuities, mutual funds, 529 plans and offshore products by
providing sales support to registered representatives, financial planners and broker-dealers at
brokerage firms and banks across the United States. Owning PLANCO secures an important
distribution channel for Life and gives Life a wholesale distribution platform which it can expand
in terms of both the number of individuals wholesaling its products and the portfolio of products
which they wholesale.

Competition

Retail competes with numerous other insurance companies as well as certain banks, securities
brokerage firms, independent financial advisors and other financial intermediaries marketing
annuities, mutual funds and other retirement-oriented products. Product sales are affected by
competitive factors such as investment performance ratings, product design, visibility in the
marketplace, financial strength ratings, distribution capabilities, levels of charges and credited
rates, reputation and customer service.

Near-term, the industry and the Company are experiencing lower variable annuity deposits as a
result of recent market turbulence and uncertainty in the U.S. financial system. Current market
pressures are also increasing the expected claim costs, the cost and volatility of hedging
programs, and the level of capital needed to support living and death benefit guarantees. Some
companies have already begun to increase the price of their guaranteed living benefits and change
the level of guarantees offered. The new economic landscape has focused the Company’s attention to
reconsider the structure and scope of the variable annuity product line. In 2009, the Company
intends to increase pricing levels and take certain actions with respect to its variable annuity
product features in an effort to reduce risks and costs associated with variable annuity benefit
features in the current economic environment and explore other risk-limiting techniques such as
increased hedging or other reinsurance structures. Competitor reactions, including the extent of
competitor risk limiting techniques, to these actions by the Company is difficult to predict and
may result in a decline in Retail’s market share.

The retail mutual fund market continues to be highly competitive, with mutual fund companies
looking to differentiate themselves through product solutions, performance, expenses, wholesaling
and service. In this non-proprietary broker sold space, The Hartford and its competitors compete
aggressively for net flows. As this business continues to evolve, success will be driven by
diversifying net sales across the mutual fund platform, delivering superior investment performance
and creating new investment solutions for current and future mutual fund shareholders.

Another source of competition for the Company’s retail mutual funds is products that are seen as
mutual fund alternatives, such as exchange traded funds (“ETFs”). An ETF is a fund that tracks an
index but can be traded like a stock and is available to virtually any investor.

Individual Life

The Individual Life segment provides life insurance strategies to a wide array of business
intermediaries and partners to solve the wealth protection, accumulation and transfer needs of its
affluent, emerging affluent and business life insurance clients. Life insurance in-force was
$195.5 billion, $179.5 billion and $164.2 billion as of December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006,
respectively. Account values were $10.2 billion, $12.3 billion and $11.4 billion as of December
31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Individual Life total assets were $13.8 billion, $15.6
billion and $14.2 billion as of December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Revenues were
$914, $1.1 billion and $1.1 billion in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Net income (loss) in
Individual Life was $(43), $182 and $150 in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively.

Principal Products

Life holds a significant market share in the variable universal life product market and is a
leading seller of variable universal life insurance according to the Tillinghast VALUE Survey as of
September 30, 2008. Sales in the Individual Life segment were $274, $286 and $284 in 2008, 2007 and
2006, respectively.



Variable Universal Life

— Variable universal life provides life insurance with an investment return
linked to underlying investments as policyholders are allowed to invest premium dollars among a
variety of underlying mutual funds. As the return on the investment portfolios increase or
decrease, the surrender value of the variable universal life policy will increase or decrease, and,
under certain policyholder options or market conditions, the death benefit may also increase or
decrease. Life’s second-to-die products are distinguished from other products in that two lives
are insured rather than one, and the policy proceeds are paid upon the deaths of both insureds.
Second-to-die policies are frequently used in estate planning for a married couple as the policy
proceeds are paid out at the time an estate tax liability is incurred. Variable universal life
account values were $4.8 billion, $7.3 billion and $6.6 billion as of December 31, 2008, 2007 and
2006, respectively.

Universal Life and Interest Sensitive Whole Life

— Universal life and interest sensitive whole life
insurance coverages provide life insurance with adjustable rates of return based on current
interest rates and on the returns of the underlying investment portfolios. Universal life provides
policyholders with flexibility in the timing and amount of premium payments and the amount of the
death benefit, provided there are sufficient policy funds to cover all policy charges for the
coming period, unless guaranteed no-lapse coverage is in effect. At December 31, 2008 and 2007,
guaranteed no-lapse universal life represented approximately 9% and 8% of life insurance in-force,
respectively. Life also sells second-to-die universal life insurance policies.

Term Life

— Term life provides basic life insurance coverage at guaranteed level premium payments
for a specific period of time and generally has no cash value. As of December 31, 2008 and 2007,
term life accounted for 32% and 29% of life insurance in-force, respectively.

Marketing and Distribution

Consistent with Life’s strategy to access multiple distribution outlets, the Individual Life
distribution organization has been developed to penetrate multiple retail sales channels. Life
sells both variable and fixed individual life products through a wide distribution network of
national and regional broker-dealer organizations, banks and independent financial advisors. Life
is a market leader in selling individual life insurance through national stockbroker and financial
institutions channels. In addition, Life distributes individual life products through independent
life and property-casualty agents and Woodbury Financial Services, an indirect and wholly-owned
subsidiary retail broker-dealer. To wholesale Life’s products, Life has a group of highly
qualified life insurance professionals with specialized training in sophisticated life insurance
sales. These individuals are generally employees of Life who are managed through a regional sales
office system.

Competition

Individual Life competes with approximately 1,000 life insurance companies in the United States, as
well as other financial intermediaries marketing insurance products

.

Competitive factors related
to this segment are primarily the breadth and quality of life insurance products offered, pricing,
relationships with third-party distributors, effectiveness of wholesaling support, pricing and
availability of reinsurance, and the quality of underwriting and customer service.

The individual life industry continues to see a move in distribution away from the traditional life
insurance sales agents, to the consultative financial advisor as the place people go to buy their
life insurance. In 2008, traditional career agents accounted for approximately thirty percent of
sales, while the independent channels, including brokerage, financial institutions and banks, and
stockbrokers, sold the remainder. Companies who distribute products through financial advisors and
independent agents have increased commissions or offered additional incentives to attract new
business. Competition is most intense among the largest brokerage general agencies. Individual
Life’s regional sales office system is a differentiator in the market and allows it to compete across multiple distribution outlets.

The individual life market has seen a shift in product mix towards universal life products over the
past few years, which now represents 42% of life insurance sales as of September 30, 2008 as
reported through LIMRA. Both consumers and producers have been demanding fixed products and more
guarantees, which can be demonstrated by the shift in the mix of products being sold. Due to this
shifting market demand, enhanced product features are becoming an increasingly important factor in
competition. The Company has updated its universal life product set and sales of universal life
have increased. The Company is ranked number two in total variable universal life sales according
to LIMRA as of September 30, 2008.

As of September 30, 2008 The Hartford is ranked number seven in total premium sales of life
insurance and number fourteen in annualized premium according to LIMRA’s quarterly U.S. Individual
Life Insurance Sales Survey.

Retirement Plans

Life is among the top providers of retirement products and services. Products and services offered
by Retirement Plans include asset management and plan administration sold to municipalities and
not-for-profit organizations pursuant to Section 457 and 403(b) of the Internal Revenue Code of
1986, as amended (referred to as “Section 457” and “403(b)”, respectively). Life also provides
retirement products and services, including asset management and plan administration sold to small
and medium-size corporations pursuant to Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
amended (referred to as “401(k)”).



In the first quarter of 2008, the Company completed three Retirement Plans acquisitions. The
acquisition of part of the defined contribution record keeping business of Princeton Retirement
Group gives Life a foothold in the business of providing recordkeeping services to large financial
firms which offer defined contribution plans to their clients and at acquisition added $2.9 billion
in mutual funds to Retirement Plans assets under management and $5.7 billion of assets under
administration. The acquisition of Sun Life Retirement Services, Inc., at acquisition added $15.8
billion in Retirement Plans assets under management across 6,000 plans and provides new service
locations in Boston, Massachusetts and Phoenix, Arizona. The acquisition of TopNoggin LLC.,
provides web-based technology to address data management, administration and benefit calculations.

same respective periods. Retirement Plans generated revenues of $408, $556 and $522 in 2008, 2007
and 2006, respectively, and net income (loss) of $(157), $61 and $101 in 2008, 2007 and 2006,
respectively.

Principal Products


03(b)

/457

— Life sells retirement plan products and services to municipalities under Section 457
plans and to not-for-profits under Section 403(b) plans. Life offers a number of different
investment products, including group variable annuities and fixed products, to the employees in
Section 457 and 403(b) plans. Generally, with the variable products, Life manages the fixed income
funds and certain other outside money managers act as advisors to the equity funds offered in
Section 457 and 403(b) plans administered by Life. As of December 31, 2008, Life administered over
4,300 plans under Sections 457 and 403(b). Total assets under management were $10.3 billion, $12.4
billion and $11.5 billion as of December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively.


01(k)

— Life sells retirement plan products and services to corporations under 401(k) plans
targeting the small and medium case markets. Life believes these markets are under-penetrated in
comparison to the large case market. The number of 401(k) plans administered as of December 31,
2008 was over 25,400. Total assets under management were $26.7 billion, $16.2 billion and $13.2
billion as of December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively.

Marketing and Distribution

In the Section 457, 403(b) and 401(k) markets, Retirement Plans’ distribution network uses internal
personnel with extensive experience to sell its products and services in the retirement plan and
institutional markets. The success of Life’s marketing and distribution system depends on its
product offerings, fund performance, successful utilization of wholesaling organizations, quality
of customer service, and relationships with national and regional broker-dealer firms, banks and
other financial institutions.

Competition

Retirement Plans competes with numerous other insurance companies as well as certain banks,
securities brokerage firms, independent financial advisors and other financial intermediaries
marketing annuities, mutual funds and other retirement-oriented products. Product sales are
affected by competitive factors such as investment performance ratings, product design, visibility
in the marketplace, financial strength ratings, distribution capabilities, levels of charges and
credited rates, reputation and customer service.

For the Section 457 and 403(b) as well as the 401(k) markets, which offer mutual funds wrapped in a
variable annuity, variable funding agreement, or mutual fund retirement program, the variety of
available funds and their performance is most important to plan sponsors. The competitors tend to
be the major mutual fund companies.

The competitive landscape for providers of group retirement plans has, and will continue to,
intensify. The past few years have seen consolidation among industry providers seeking to increase
scale, improve cost efficiencies, and enter new market segments. The consolidation of providers is
expected to continue as smaller providers exit the market.

In addition, many providers are attempting to expand their market share by extending their target
markets across plan size and tax code segments (401(k), 457, 403(b)), some of which they may not
have previously served. Competition increases as the number of providers selling business in each
segment grows.

The long-awaited, landmark 403(b) regulations, finalized in July 2007, have contributed to the
increased activity in the 403(b) market. The regulations, in general, align an employer’s
responsibilities more closely with those of a 401(k), making 403(b) plans more attractive to
providers who have experience with 401(k) plans. Final Pension Provider Act regulations have also
increased competition over features key to those regulations, such as automatic enrollment
capabilities and differentiation of target date fund offerings, when used as qualified default
investment alternatives.



Group Benefits

The Group Benefits segment provides individual members of employer groups, associations, affinity
groups and financial institutions with group life, accident and disability coverage, along with
other products and services, including voluntary benefits, and group retiree health. Life ranks
number two in fully-insured group disability premium and number three in fully-insured life premium
of U.S. group carriers (according to LIMRA data as of June 30, 2008). The Company also offers
disability underwriting, administration, claims processing services and reinsurance to other
insurers and self-funded employer plans. Generally, policies sold in this segment are term
insurance. This allows the Company to adjust the rates or terms of its policies in order to
minimize the adverse effect of various market trends, including declining interest rates and other
factors. Typically policies are sold with one-, two- or three-year rate guarantees depending upon
the product. In the disability market, the Company focuses on its risk management expertise and on
efficiencies and economies of scale to derive a competitive advantage. Group Benefits generated
fully insured ongoing premiums of $4.4 billion, $4.2 billion and $4.1 billion in 2008, 2007 and
2006, respectively, of which group disability insurance accounted for $2.0 billion, $1.9 billion
and $1.8 billion in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively, and group life insurance accounted for $2.1
billion, $1.9 billion and $1.8 billion for the year ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006,
respectively. The Company held group disability reserves of $4.7 billion, $4.6 billion and $4.5
billion and group life reserves of $1.3 billion, $1.3 billion and $1.3 billion as of December 31,
2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Total assets for Group Benefits were $9.0 billion, $9.3 billion
and $9.0 billion as of December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Total revenues in Group
Benefits were $4.3 billion, $4.7 billion and $4.6 billion, during 2008, 2007 and 2006,
respectively. Net income (loss) in Group Benefits was $(6), $315 and $298 in 2008, 2007 and 2006,
respectively.

Principal Products

Group Disability

— Life is one of the largest carriers in the “large case” market of the group
disability insurance business. Life’s strong market presence in the group disability markets is
the result of its well known brand and reputation, financial strength and stability and Life’s
approach to claims management. Life also offers voluntary, or employee-paid, short-term and
long-term disability group benefits. Life’s efforts in the group disability market focus on early
intervention, return-to-work programs and successful rehabilitation, which offer the support to
help claimants return to an active, productive life after a disability. Life also works with
disability claimants to improve their approval rate for Social Security Assistance (i.e., reducing
payment of benefits by the amount of Social Security payments received).

Life’s short-term disability benefit plans provide a weekly benefit amount (typically 60% to 70% of
the insured’s earned income up to a specified maximum benefit) to insureds when they are unable to
work due to an accident or illness. Long-term disability insurance provides a monthly benefit for
those extended periods of time not covered by a short-term disability benefit plan when insureds
are unable to work due to disability. Insureds may receive total or partial disability benefits.
Most of these policies begin providing benefits following a 90- or 180-day waiting period and
generally continue providing benefits until the insured reaches age 65. Long-term disability
benefits are paid monthly and are limited to a portion, generally 50-70%, of the insured’s earned
income up to a specified maximum benefit.

Group Life and Accident

— Group term life insurance provides term coverage to employees and members
of associations, affinity groups and financial institutions and their dependents for a specified
period and has no accumulation of cash values. Life offers options for its basic group life
insurance coverage, including portability of coverage and a living benefit and critical illness
option, whereby terminally ill policyholders can receive death benefits in advance. Life also
offers voluntary, or employee-paid, life group benefits and accidental death and dismemberment
coverage either packaged with life insurance or on a stand-alone basis.

Other

— Life offers a host of other products and services, such as Family and Medical Leave Act
Administration, group retiree health, and specialized insurance products for physicians. Life also
provides travel accident, hospital indemnity, supplemental health insurance for military personnel
and their families and other coverages to individual members of various associations, affinity
groups, financial institutions and employee groups. Prior to the second quarter of 2007, Life
provided excess of loss medical coverage (known as medical stop loss insurance) to employers who
self-fund their medical plans and pay claims using the services of a third party administrator. In
the second quarter of 2007, Life entered into a renewal rights arrangement on its medical stop loss
coverage business. As a result of this transaction, the existing policies in-force will diminish
as contracts expire.

Marketing and Distribution

Life uses an experienced group of Company employees, managed through a regional sales office
system, to distribute its group insurance products and services through a variety of distribution
outlets, including brokers, consultants, third-party administrators and trade associations.

Competition

The Group Benefits business remains highly competitive. Competitive factors primarily affecting
Group Benefits are the variety and quality of products and services offered, the price quoted for
coverage and services, Life’s relationships with its third-party distributors, and the quality of
customer service. In addition, there has been an increase in the length of rate guarantee periods
being offered in the market and top tier carriers are offering on-line and self service
capabilities to agents and consumers. Group Benefits competes with numerous other insurance
companies and other financial intermediaries marketing insurance products. However, many of these
businesses have relatively high barriers to entry and there have been few new entrants into the
group benefits insurance market over the past few years.



Based on LIMRA market share data for in-force premiums as of June 30, 2008, Group Benefits is the
second largest group disability carrier and the third largest group life insurance carrier. The
relatively large size and underwriting capacity of this business provides opportunities not
available to smaller companies.

International

International, which has operations located in Japan, Brazil, Ireland and the United Kingdom, and
plans to open operations in Germany in 2009, provides investments, retirement savings and other
insurance and savings products to individuals and groups outside the United States and Canada.
International revenues were $617, $847 and $736 in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Net income
(loss) for International was $(325), $223 and $231 in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively.
International’s total assets were $41.5 billion, $41.6 billion and $33.8 billion as of December 31,
2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The Company’s Japan operation, Hartford Life Insurance K.K.
(“HLIKK”), remains the largest distributor of variable annuities in Japan, based on assets under
management. The Company also sells yen and U.S. dollar denominated fixed annuities in Japan. With
assets under management of $34.5 billion, $37.6 billion and $31.3 billion as of December 31, 2008,
2007 and 2006, respectively, the Japan operation is the largest component of International with net
income (loss) of $(263), $253 and $252 in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively.

The Company’s Japan operation sells both variable and fixed individual annuity products through a
wide distribution network of Japan’s broker-dealer organizations, banks and other financial
institutions and independent financial advisors. Individual retail variable annuity deposits in
Japan were $3.0 billion, $6.3 billion and $5.8 billion in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively.
Deposits have declined in 2008 due to increased competition from Japanese domestic firms as well as
equity market volatility.

During the second and third quarters of 2008, the Company launched a new product called “Rising
Income/Care Story,” which is a GMWB variable annuity combined with a nursing care rider, as well as
the new product “Plus 5,” which is a 10-year GMAB variable annuity with a 5% bonus at year 10. The
success of the Company’s product offerings will ultimately be based on customer acceptance in an
increasingly competitive environment.

Due to significant market declines in the fourth quarter of 2008, approximately 97% of the
Company’s in-force 3 Win policies, or $3.1 billion in account value, have triggered the associated
GMIB. 3 Win is a variable annuity product offered in Japan with a
GMIB and GMAB rider. The GMIB trigger occurred as a result of policyholder account values falling below 80% of their
initial deposit. As a result of the GMIB trigger, the majority of the Company’s 3 Win policies
annuitized or surrendered free of charge in the fourth quarter of 2008. This significantly and
negatively impacted fourth quarter net flows and will continue to reduce future profitability.
For further details on the trigger of the GMIB associated with the 3 Win product, see Unlock and
Sensitivity Analysis within Critical Accounting Estimates.

International’s other operations include a 50% owned joint venture in Brazil and startup operations
in Europe. The Brazil joint venture operates under the name Icatu-Hartford and distributes pension,
life insurance and other insurance and savings products through broker-dealer organizations and
various partnerships. The Company’s European operation, Hartford Life Limited, began selling
unit-linked investment bonds and pension products in the United Kingdom in April 2005. Unit-linked
bonds and pension products are similar to variable annuities marketed in the United States and
Japan, and are distributed through independent financial advisors. Hartford Life Limited
established its operations in Dublin, Ireland with a branch office in London to help market and
service its business in the United Kingdom.

Principal Products

Individual Variable Annuities

— The Company earns fees, based on policyholders’ account values, for
managing variable annuity assets and maintaining policyholder accounts. The Company uses specified
portions of the periodic deposits paid by a customer to purchase units in one or more mutual funds
as directed by the customer, as long as asset allocation limits, where applicable, are not
exceeded, who then assumes the investment performance risks and rewards. These products offer the
policyholder a variety of equity and fixed income options. Additionally, International sells
variable annuity contracts that offer various guaranteed minimum death and living benefits.

Policyholders may make deposits of varying amounts at regular or irregular intervals, and the value
of these assets fluctuates in accordance with the investment performance of the funds selected by
the policyholder. To encourage persistency, many of the Company’s individual variable annuities are
subject to withdrawal restrictions and surrender charges. Surrender charges range up to 7% of the
contract’s deposits, less withdrawals, and reduce to zero on a sliding scale, usually within seven
years from the deposit date. In Japan, individual variable annuity account values were $29.7
billion, $35.8 billion and $29.7 billion as of December 31, 2008, 2007, and 2006, respectively.

Fixed MVA Annuities and Other

— Fixed MVA annuities are fixed rate annuity contracts that guarantee
a specific sum of money to be paid in the future, either as a lump sum or as monthly income. In the
event that a policyholder surrenders a policy prior to the end of the guarantee period, the MVA
feature adjusts the contract’s cash surrender value with respect to any changes in Japanese LIBOR,
thereby protecting the Company from losses due to higher interest rates, but not necessarily
widening credit spreads, at the time of surrender. The amount of lump sum or monthly income
payments will not fluctuate due to adverse changes in the Company’s investment return, mortality
experience or expenses. The Company’s primary fixed MVA annuities in Japan are yen and dollar
denominated with terms varying from five to ten years with an average term to maturity of
approximately seven years. In Japan, account values of fixed MVA annuities were $4.8 billion, $1.8
billion and $1.7 billion as of December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The fixed MVA
annuity account value and other as of December 31, 2008 increased by $2.2 billion as a result of 3
Win product customers whose account values triggered the GMIB and who elected the 15 year
annuitization option.



Marketing and Distribution

The International distribution network is based on management’s strategy of developing and
utilizing multiple and competing distribution channels to achieve the broadest distribution to
reach target customers. The success of the Company’s marketing and distribution system depends on
its product offerings, fund performance, successful utilization of wholesaling, quality of customer
service, financial regulations or laws that impact distribution and relationships with securities
firms, banks and other financial institutions, and independent financial advisors (through which
the sale of the Company’s retail investment products to customers is consummated). Specifically,
in 2008, the Company entered into a new relationship with the second largest variable annuity
distributor in Japan for an existing product. As of December 31, 2008, the Japan operation
employed a wholesaling network that supports sales through 50 banks and securities firms.

Competition

The International segment competes with a number of domestic and international insurance companies.
Product sales are affected by competitive factors such as investment performance ratings, product
design, visibility in the marketplace, financial strength ratings, distribution capabilities,
levels of charges and credited rates, reputation, customer service and policyholders’ perception of
the Company and its financial strength. Competition has continued to increase, especially in the
Japanese market as the result of the strengthening of both domestic and foreign competitors. In
addition to seeing new entrants in the Japanese market, our existing competitors are rapidly
introducing new products, some of which include shorter guarantee periods as well as ratcheting
guarantee features and higher equity asset allocation.

The Hartford is the largest variable annuity provider in Japan with 21.6% market share based on
September 30, 2008 assets under management as published in Hoken Mainichi Shimbun newspaper, but
its share of new deposits has been declining. In 2009, the Company intends to review its variable
annuity product features in an effort to reduce risks and costs associated with variable annuity
benefit features in the current economic environment. Competitor reaction, including the extent of
competitor risk limiting strategies, is difficult to predict and may result in a further decline in
market share.

Institutional

Life provides structured settlement contracts, institutional annuities, longevity assurance, income
annuities, institutional mutual funds and stable value investment products. Additionally, Life is
a leader in the variable private placement life insurance (“PPLI”) market, which includes life
insurance policies purchased by a company or a trust on the lives of its employees, with Life or a
trust sponsored by Life named as the beneficiary under the policy.

Institutional’s
total account values were $56.5 billion, $57.9 billion and
$48.3 billion as of
December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Institutional’s total assets were $59.9 billion,
$78.8 billion and $66.2 billion as of December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively, excluding
mutual funds of $2.6 billion, $3.6 billion and $2.6 billion,
respectively. Institutional generated revenues of $1.3 billion,
$2.3 billion and $1.7 billion in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively and net income (loss) of $(502),
$17 and $78 in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively.

Principal Products

PPLI Products

— PPLI products are typically utilized by employers to fund non-qualified benefits or
other post-employment benefit liabilities. Plan sponsors have the opportunity to select from a
range of tax advantaged investment allocations. PPLI has also been widely used in the high net
worth marketplace due to its low costs and range of investment choices.

Structured Settlements

— Structured settlement annuity contracts provide periodic payments to an
injured person or survivor, typically in settlement of a claim under a liability policy in lieu of
a lump sum settlement. Contracts pay either life contingent and/or period certain benefits, at the
discretion of the contract holder.

Institutional Annuities

— Institutional annuities arrangements are group annuity contracts used to
fund pension liabilities that exist when a qualified retirement plan sponsor decides to terminate
some or all of its liabilities under an existing defined benefit pension plan. In addition,
institutional annuities are used when a qualified retirement plan sponsor purchases a group annuity
contract to offer annuitization benefit options to retiring plan participants. Group annuity
contracts are usually very long-term in nature and typically pay monthly benefits to participants
covered under the pension plan which is being terminated.

Longevity assurance

— Longevity assurance is an individual fixed deferred payout annuity that
provides life contingent benefits to individuals with the purpose of providing individuals with
protection from the risk of outliving retirement income.

Income Annuities

— Income annuities are individual contracts that provide a fixed payout.
Contracts pay either life contingent or period certain benefits, at the discretion of the contract
holder.



Institutional Mutual Funds

— Life sells institutional shares of The Hartford Mutual Funds to both
qualified (i.e., section 401(k) and 457 plans) and non-qualified (i.e., endowments and foundations)
institutional investors on an “investment only” basis. The funds are sold individually, with no
recordkeeping services included and not as a part of any bundled retirement program. The
Hartford’s indirect wholly-owned subsidiary, HL Investment Advisors, LLC, serves as the investment
advisor to these funds and contracts with sub-advisors to perform the day-to-day management of the
funds. The two primary sub-advisors to the Hartford HLS Funds are Wellington for most of the
equity funds and HIMCO for the fixed income funds.

Stable Value Products

— Guaranteed investment contracts (“GICs”) are group annuity contracts issued
to sponsors of qualified pension or profit-sharing plans or stable value pooled fund managers.
Under these contracts, the client deposits a lump sum with The Hartford for a specified period of
time for a guaranteed interest rate. At the end of the specified period, the client receives
principal plus interest earned. Funding agreements are investment contracts that provide a
contractually-obligated rate of interest or return. The Company has issued fixed and variable rate
funding agreements to Hartford Life Global Funding trusts, that in turn issue registered notes to
institutional and retail investors. Certain of these contracts allow an investor to accelerate
principal payments after a defined notice period. During 2008, Life ceased issuance of retail and
institutional funding agreement backed notes, largely due to the change in customer preference to
FDIC-insured products. Prospectively, the Company will issue only GICs, and on a limited basis,
funding agreements.

Marketing and Distribution

In the PPLI market, specialized brokers with expertise in the large case market assist in the
placement of many cases. High net worth PPLI is often placed with the assistance of investment
banking and wealth management specialists.

In the institutional annuities market, Life sells its group annuity products to retirement plan
sponsors through three different channels: (1) a small number of specialty brokers; (2) large
benefits consulting firms; and (3) directly, using Hartford employees.

In the structured settlement market, the Institutional segment sells individual fixed immediate
annuity products through a small number of specialty brokerage firms that work closely with The
Hartford’s Property & Casualty operations. Life also works directly with the brokerage firms on
cases that do not involve The Hartford’s Property & Casualty operations. Approximately 85 percent
of annual sales are through claim settlements not associated with The Hartford’s Property &
Casualty operations.

In the longevity assurance and income annuities markets, Life sells its individual fixed payout
annuity contracts through financial advisors that work with individual investors.

In the institutional mutual fund market, the Institutional segment typically sells its products
through investment consulting firms employed by retirement plan sponsors. Institutional’s products
are also sold through 401(k) record keeping firms that offer a “platform” of mutual funds to their
plan sponsor clients. A third sales channel is direct sales to qualified plan sponsors, using
registered representatives employed by Hartford Equity Sales Company, Inc., an indirect
wholly-owned subsidiary.

In the stable value marketplace, the Institutional segment typically sells GICs to retirement plan
sponsors or stable value portfolio managers either through investment management firms or directly,
using Hartford employees.

Competition

Institutional markets are highly competitive from a pricing perspective, and a small number of
cases often account for a significant portion of sales. Institutional competes with other life
insurance companies and asset managers who provide investment and risk management solutions.
Product sales are often affected by competitive factors such as investment performance, company
credit ratings, perceived financial strength, product design, marketplace visibility, distribution
capabilities, fees, credited rates, and customer service. Recent actions by rating agencies may make competition more challenging for Institutional in
several of its businesses.

For PPLI, competition in the large case market comes from other insurance carriers and from
specialized agents with expertise in the benefit funding marketplace. Price is a major
consideration, but there are other factors such as investment offerings and services. For high net
worth programs, the competition is often from investment banking firms allied with other insurance
carriers.

For institutional product lines offering fixed annuity products (e.g., institutional annuities,
income annuities, structured settlements, and stable value products), price, financial strength,
stability and credit ratings are key buying factors. As a result, the competitors in those
marketplaces tend to be large, long-established insurance companies.

For institutional mutual funds, the variety of available funds, fee levels, and fund performance
are most important to plan sponsors and investment consultants. Competitors tend to be the major
mutual fund companies, insurance companies, and asset managers.

Stable value products typically compete on price, financial strength, stability and the Company’s
credit ratings.



Property & Casualty

Property & Casualty provides (1) workers’ compensation, property, automobile, liability, umbrella,
specialty casualty, marine, livestock and fidelity and surety coverages to commercial accounts
primarily throughout the United States; (2) professional liability coverage and directors and
officers liability coverage, as well as excess and surplus lines business not normally written by
standard commercial lines insurers; (3) automobile, homeowners and home-based business coverage to
individuals throughout the United States; and (4) insurance-related services.

The Hartford seeks to distinguish itself in the property and casualty market through its product
depth and innovation, distribution capacity, customer service expertise, and technology for ease of
doing business. The Hartford is the eleventh largest property and casualty insurance operation in
the United States based on direct written premiums for the year ended December 31, 2007, according
to A.M. Best Company, Inc. (“A.M. Best”). Property & Casualty generated revenues of $10.2 billion,
$12.5 billion, and $12.4 billion in 2008, 2007, and 2006, respectively. Revenues include earned
premiums, servicing revenue, net investment income and net realized capital gains and losses.
Earned premiums for 2008, 2007, and 2006 were $10.3 billion, $10.5 billion, and $10.4 billion,
respectively. Additionally, net income was $92, $1.5 billion and $1.5 billion for 2008, 2007 and
2006, respectively. Total assets for Property & Casualty were $36.7 billion, $41.8 billion, and
$41.0 billion as of December 31, 2008, 2007, and 2006, respectively.

Ongoing Operations consists of the underwriting segments of Personal Lines, Small Commercial,
Middle Market and Specialty Commercial. Ongoing Operations earned premiums for 2008, 2007, and
2006 were $10.3 billion, $10.5 billion, and $10.4 billion, respectively. Additionally, Ongoing
Operations net income was $189, $1.5 billion and $1.6 billion for 2008, 2007 and 2006,
respectively. Total assets for Ongoing Operations were $31.5 billion, $35.9 billion, and $34.1
billion as of December 31, 2008, 2007, and 2006, respectively.

Personal Lines

Personal Lines sells automobile, homeowners and home-based business coverages directly to the
consumer and through a network of independent agents. Most of the Company’s personal lines
business sold directly to the consumer is to the members of AARP through a direct marketing
operation. Until the sale of the business on November 30, 2006, the Company also sold non-standard
auto insurance through the Company’s Omni Insurance Group, Inc. (“Omni”) subsidiary. Personal
Lines had earned premiums of $3.9 billion, $3.9 billion, and $3.8 billion in 2008, 2007, and 2006,
respectively. AARP represents a significant portion of the total Personal Lines business and
amounted to earned premiums of $2.8 billion, $2.7 billion, and $2.5 billion in 2008, 2007, and
2006, respectively. The Hartford’s exclusive licensing arrangement with AARP continues until
January 1, 2020 for automobile, homeowners and home-based business. This agreement provides
Personal Lines with an important competitive advantage as management expects favorable “baby boom”
demographics to increase AARP membership during this period. Personal Lines’ underwriting income
for 2008, 2007, and 2006 was $280, $322, and $429, respectively. The Hartford is the twelfth
largest personal lines insurer in the United States based on direct written premiums for the year
ended December 31, 2007 according to A.M. Best. Personal Lines also operates a member contact
center for health insurance products offered through the AARP Health program. The AARP Health
program agreement continues through 2009.

Principal Products

Personal Lines provides standard automobile, homeowners and home-based business coverages to
individuals across the United States, including a special program designed exclusively for members
of AARP. Beginning in 2006, the Company enhanced its new Dimensions automobile and homeowners class
plans for insurance sold through independent agents and brokers. “Dimensions with Packages”,
introduced in 2006, is a suite of products that offers coverages and competitive rates tailored to
a customer’s individual risk. Dimensions uses a large number of interactive rating variables to
determine a rate that most accurately reflects the customer’s individual characteristics. In 2007
and 2008, The Hartford rolled out a new “Next Generation Auto” product to AARP customers. Similar
to The Hartford’s Dimensions with Packages for Agency business, Next Generation Auto offers more
coverage options and provides customized pricing based on the AARP policyholder’s individualized
risk characteristics.

Marketing and Distribution

Personal Lines reaches diverse markets through multiple distribution channels including direct
sales to the consumer, brokers and independent agents. In direct sales to the consumer, the
Company markets its products through a mix of media, including direct marketing, the internet and
advertising in publications. Most of Personal Lines’ direct sales to the consumer are through its
exclusive licensing arrangement with AARP to market automobile, homeowners and home-based business
insurance products to AARP’s nearly 39 million members.

The Personal Lines Agency business provides customized products and services to customers through a
network of independent agents in the standard personal lines market. Independent agents are not
employees of The Hartford. An important strategic objective of the Company is to develop common
products and processes for all of its personal lines business regardless of the distribution
channel.



Competition

The personal lines automobile and homeowners businesses are highly competitive. Personal lines
insurance is written by insurance companies of varying sizes that sell products through various
distribution channels, including independent agents, captive agents and directly to the consumer.
The personal lines market competes on the basis of price, product, service (including claims
handling), stability of the insurer and name recognition. Companies with recognized brands, direct
sales capability and economies of scale will have a competitive advantage. In the past three
years, a number of carriers have increased their advertising in an effort to gain new business and
retain profitable business. This has been particularly true of carriers that sell directly to the
consumer. Sales of personal lines insurance directly to the consumer have been growing faster than
sales through agents, particularly for auto insurance, and now sales of auto insurance direct to
the consumer represent a little more than 20% of total industry auto premium.

Carriers that distribute products mainly through agents have either increased commissions or
offered additional incentives to those agents to attract new business. To distinguish themselves
in the marketplace, top tier carriers are offering on-line and self service capabilities to agents
and consumers. More agents have been using “comparative rater” tools that allow the agent to
compare premium quotes among several insurance companies. The use of comparative rater tools has
further increased price competition.

Carriers with more efficient cost structures will have an advantage in competing for new business
through price. The use of data mining and predictive modeling is used by more and more carriers to
target the most profitable business and carriers have further segmented their pricing plans to
expand market share in what they believe to be the most profitable segments.

Due to the slowdown in the economy and the effect of continued price competition, the total market
premium for personal auto insurance is expected to grow at less than 1% in 2009 affected, in part,
by a decline in new passenger vehicle sales. Total market premium for personal homeowners
insurance is expected to decrease by about 4% in 2009 driven, in part, by an increase in
foreclosures and a decrease in construction of new single-family dwellings. Many insurers have
reduced their writings of new homeowners business in catastrophe-exposed states which has
intensified competition in areas that are not subject to the same level of catastrophes, such as
states in the Midwest.

Small Commercial

Small Commercial provides standard commercial insurance coverage to small commercial businesses
primarily throughout the United States. Small commercial businesses generally represent companies
with up to $5 in annual payroll, $15 in annual revenues or $15 in total property values. Earned
premiums for each of the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007, and 2006 were $2.7 billion. The
segment had underwriting income of $437, $508, and $422 in 2008, 2007, and 2006, respectively.

Principal Products

Small Commercial offers workers’ compensation, property, automobile, liability and umbrella
coverages under several different products. Some of these coverages are sold together as part of a
single multi-peril package policy called Spectrum. The sale of Spectrum business owners’ package
policies and workers’ compensation policies accounts for most of the written premium in the Small
Commercial segment. In the fourth quarter of 2006, The Hartford began to roll out a new “Next
Generation Auto” product to Small Commercial customers. Similar to The Hartford’s Next Generation
Auto product for AARP business, Next Generation Auto for Small Commercial offers more coverage
options and provides customized pricing based on the policyholder’s individualized risk
characteristics.

Marketing and Distribution

Small Commercial provides insurance products and services through its home office located in
Hartford, Connecticut, and multiple domestic regional office locations and insurance centers. The
segment markets its products nationwide utilizing brokers and independent agents. Brokers and
independent agents are not employees of The Hartford. The Company also has relationships with
payroll service providers whereby the Company offers insurance products to customers of the payroll
service providers. Agencies are consolidating such that, in the future, a larger share of premium
volume will likely be concentrated with the larger agents.

Competition

The insurance market for small commercial businesses is competitive with insurers seeking to
differentiate themselves through product, price, service and technology. The Hartford competes
against a number of large, national carriers as well as regional competitors in certain
territories. Competitors include other stock companies, mutual companies and other underwriting
organizations. Companies writing business for small commercial business distribute their products
through agents and other channels.

The market for small commercial business has become more competitive as favorable loss costs in the
past few years have led carriers to expand coverage and reduce pricing. Written premium growth
rates in the small commercial market have slowed and underwriting margins will likely decrease due
to earned pricing decreases and increases in loss cost severity. A number of companies have sought
to grow their business by increasing their underwriting appetite, appointing new agents and
expanding business with existing agents. Carriers serving middle market-sized accounts are more
aggressively competing for small commercial accounts as small commercial business has generally
been less price-sensitive. Competition is expected to continue to increase as the slowing economy
has reduced the number of new business opportunities.



Insurance companies have been improving their pricing sophistication and ease of doing business
with the agent. Carriers are developing more sophisticated pricing and predictive modeling tools
and have invested in technology to speed up the process of evaluating a risk and quoting on new
business. Price competition has increased as companies seek to retain profitable business and
agents are seeking competitive quotes for renewals more frequently, particularly for larger
accounts within small commercial. Carriers also compete on service with agents expecting enhanced
automation and faster turnaround on quotes.

The Hartford is the sixth largest commercial lines insurer in the United States based on direct
written premiums for the year ended December 31, 2007 according to A.M. Best. The relatively large
size and underwriting capacity of The Hartford provide opportunities not available to smaller
insurers.

Middle Market

Middle Market provides standard commercial insurance coverage to middle market commercial
businesses primarily throughout the United States. Middle market businesses generally represent
companies with greater than $5 in annual payroll, $15 in annual revenues or $15 in total property
values. Earned premiums for 2008, 2007, and 2006 were $2.3 billion $2.4 billion, and $2.5 billion,
respectively. The segment had underwriting income of $169, $157, and $214 in 2008, 2007, and 2006,
respectively.

Principal Products

Middle Market offers workers’ compensation, property, automobile, liability, umbrella, marine and
livestock coverages under several different products. Workers’ compensation insurance accounts for
the largest share of the written premium in the Middle Market segment.

Marketing and Distribution

Middle Market provides insurance products and services through its home office located in Hartford,
Connecticut, and multiple domestic regional office locations and insurance centers. The segment
markets its products nationwide utilizing brokers and independent agents. Brokers and independent
agents are not employees of The Hartford. The current pace of consolidation within the independent
agent and broker distribution channel will likely continue such that, in the future, a larger share
of written premium will likely be concentrated with the larger agents and brokers.

Competition

The middle market commercial insurance marketplace is a highly competitive environment regarding
product, price and service. The Hartford competes against a number of large, national carriers as
well as regional insurers in certain territories. Competitors include other stock companies,
mutual companies and alternative risk sharing groups. These competitors sell primarily through
independent agents and brokers across a broad array of product lines, and with a high level of
variation regarding geographic, marketing and customer segmentation.

Middle Market business is characterized as “high touch” with case-by-case underwriting and pricing
decisions. Compared to Small Commercial, the pricing of Middle Market accounts is prone to more
significant variation or cyclicality from year to year. Legislative reforms in a number of states
in recent years have helped to control indemnity costs on workers’ compensation claims, but these
have also led to rate reductions in many states. In addition, companies writing middle market
business have continued to experience a reduction in average premium size due to continued price
competition. The downturn in the economy and rising unemployment will likely cause soft market
conditions to continue into 2009.

Soft market conditions, characterized by highly competitive pricing on new business, have lessened
the number of new business opportunities as carriers look to secure their renewals early. In the
soft market, we are seeing an increase in industry specialization by agents and brokers which has
placed even greater importance on the carrier’s need to demonstrate industry expertise to win new
business. To gain a competitive advantage, carriers are improving automation with the agent or
broker, appointing more agents and enhancing their product offerings. There was some consolidation
of carriers within the industry in 2008 and management expects a modest level of consolidation to
continue in the industry going forward.

The Hartford is the sixth largest commercial lines insurer in the United States based on direct
written premiums for the year ended December 31, 2007 according to A.M. Best. The relatively large
size and underwriting capacity of The Hartford provide opportunities not available to smaller
companies.

Specialty Commercial

Specialty Commercial provides a wide variety of property and casualty insurance products and
services to large commercial clients requiring specialized coverages. Excess and surplus lines
coverages not normally written by standard line insurers are also provided, primarily through
wholesale brokers. Specialty Commercial had earned premiums of $1.4 billion, $1.4 billion, and
$1.5 billion in 2008, 2007, and 2006, respectively. Underwriting income (loss) was $71, $(18), and
$46 in 2008, 2007, and 2006, respectively.



Principal Products

Specialty Commercial offers a variety of customized insurance products and risk management
services. Specialty Commercial provides standard commercial insurance products including workers’
compensation, automobile and liability coverages to large-sized companies. Specialty Commercial
also provides professional liability, fidelity, surety and specialty casualty coverages as well as
property excess and surplus lines coverages not normally written by standard lines insurers. A
significant portion of specialty casualty business, including workers’ compensation business, is
written through large deductible programs where the insured typically provides collateral to
support loss payments made within their deductible. The specialty casualty business also provides
retrospectively-rated programs where the premiums are adjustable based on loss experience. Captive
and Specialty Programs, within Specialty Commercial, provides insurance products and services
primarily to captive insurance companies, pools and self-insurance groups. In addition, Specialty
Commercial provides third-party administrator services for claims administration, integrated
benefits and loss control through Specialty Risk Services, LLC, a subsidiary of the Company.

Marketing and Distribution

Specialty Commercial provides insurance products and services through its home office located in
Hartford, Connecticut and multiple domestic office locations. The segment markets its products
nationwide utilizing a variety of distribution networks including independent retail agents,
brokers and wholesalers. Brokers, independents agents and wholesalers are not employees of The
Hartford.

Competition

Specialty Commercial is comprised of a diverse group of businesses that operate independently
within their specific industries. These businesses, while somewhat interrelated, have different
business models and operating cycles. Specialty Commercial is largely considered a transactional
business and, therefore, competes with other companies for much of its business on an account by
account basis due to the complex nature of each transaction.

For specialty casualty business, written pricing competition continues to be significant,
particularly for the larger individual accounts. Written pricing declines and expanded terms and
conditions have reduced the profitability of this business. Carriers are trying to protect their
in-force casualty business by starting to renew policies well before the policy renewal date.
Employing this early renewal practice often prevents other carriers from quoting on the business,
resulting in fewer new business opportunities within the marketplace. With national account
business, as the market continues to soften, more insureds may opt for guaranteed cost policies in
lieu of loss-sensitive products. The market for loss sensitive casualty business in 2009 will
likely continue to experience price competition and the use of expanded terms and conditions. For
property business, written pricing on catastrophe-exposed business continues to be under pressure
as standard market carriers have increased their risk appetite for this business.

For professional liability business, we expect written pricing to firm for financial services
companies and related classes of business driven by an increase in federal shareholder class action
lawsuits arising from the financial market turmoil. For other classes of business, we expect a
moderate decline in written pricing. Carriers writing professional liability business are
increasingly more focused on profitable private, middle market companies. This trend has continued
as the downturn in the economy has led to a significant drop in the number of initial public
offerings and volatility for all public companies. Losses taken on investment portfolios have
affected the financial strength ratings of some insurers in the marketplace for directors and
officers and errors and omissions insurance and a carrier’s new business opportunities can be
significantly affected by customer perceptions about its financial strength. In February 2009, rating agencies lowered
the insurance financial strength ratings of the Company’s group of principal property and
casualty subsidiaries.

For surety business, favorable underwriting results in recent years has led to more intense
competition for market share. This could lead to written price declines and less favorable terms
and conditions. Driven by the upheaval in the credit markets, new private construction activity has
declined dramatically, resulting in lower demand for contract surety business. For both
professional liability business and fidelity and surety business, the economic downturn and
weakened credit environment may increase loss costs in 2009.

Disciplined underwriting and targeted returns are the objectives of Specialty Commercial since
premium writings may fluctuate based on the segment’s view of perceived market opportunity.
Specialty Commercial competes with other stock companies, mutual companies, alternative risk
sharing groups and other underwriting organizations. The relatively large size and underwriting
capacity of The Hartford provide opportunities not available to smaller companies.

Other Operations

The Other Operations segment operates under a single management structure, Heritage Holdings, which
is responsible for two related activities. The first activity is the management of certain
subsidiaries and operations of The Hartford that have discontinued writing new business. The
second is the management of claims (and the associated reserves) related to asbestos, environmental
and other exposures. Including net realized capital gains (losses) and net investment income,
total revenues for Other Operations were $(4) in 2008, $241 in 2007 and $292 in 2006. Other
Operations had net income (loss) of $(97), $30 and $(35) in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively.
Total assets for Other Operations were $5.2 billion, $5.9 billion, and $6.9 billion as of December
31, 2008, 2007, and 2006, respectively.



Life Reserves

Life insurance subsidiaries of the Company establish and carry as liabilities, predominantly, five
types of reserves: (1) a liability equal to the balance that accrues to the benefit of the
policyholder as of the financial statement date, otherwise known as the account value, (2) a
liability for unpaid losses, including those that have been incurred but not yet reported, (3) a
liability for future policy benefits, representing the present value of future benefits to be paid
to or on behalf of policyholders less the present value of future net premiums; (4) fair value
reserves for living benefits embedded derivative guarantees; and (5) death and living benefit
reserves which are computed based on a percentage of revenues less actual claim costs. The
liabilities for unpaid losses and future policy benefits are calculated based on actuarially
recognized methods using morbidity and mortality tables, which are modified to reflect Life’s
actual experience when appropriate. Liabilities for unpaid losses include estimates of amounts to
fully settle known reported claims as well as claims related to insured events that the Company
estimates have been incurred but have not yet been reported. Future policy benefit reserves are
computed at amounts that, with additions from estimated net premiums to be received and with
interest on such reserves compounded annually at certain assumed rates, are expected to be
sufficient to meet Life’s policy obligations at their maturities or in the event of an insured’s
disability or death. Other insurance liabilities include those for unearned premiums and benefits
in excess of account value. Reserves for assumed reinsurance are computed in a manner that is
comparable to direct insurance reserves. Liabilities for death and living benefit guarantees whose
values are dependant upon the equity markets, have significantly increased in 2008 as equity
markets declined.

Property & Casualty Reserves

The Hartford establishes property and casualty reserves to provide for the estimated costs of
paying claims under insurance policies written by The Hartford. These reserves include estimates
for both claims that have been reported to The Hartford and those that have been incurred but not
reported (“IBNR”) and include estimates of all expenses associated with processing and settling
these claims. This estimation process involves a variety of actuarial techniques and is primarily
based on historical experience and consideration of current trends. Examples of current trends
include increases in medical cost inflation rates, the changing use of medical care procedures, the
introduction of new products such as the Dimensions product in Personal Lines and the Next
Generation auto product in Personal Lines, Small Commercial and Middle Market. Other current
trends include changes in internal claim practices, changes in the legislative and regulatory
environment for workers’ compensation claims and evolving exposures to claims asserted against
religious institutions and other organizations relating to molestation or abuse and other mass
torts.

The Hartford continues to receive claims that assert damages from asbestos-related and
environmental-related exposures. Asbestos claims relate primarily to bodily injuries asserted by
those who came in contact with asbestos or products containing asbestos. Environmental claims
relate primarily to pollution-related clean-up costs. As discussed further in the Critical
Accounting Estimates and Other Operations sections of the MD&A, significant uncertainty limits the
Company’s ability to estimate the ultimate reserves necessary for unpaid losses and related
expenses with regard to environmental and particularly asbestos claims.

Most of the Company’s property and casualty reserves are not discounted. However, the Company has
discounted liabilities funded through structured settlements and has discounted certain reserves
for indemnity payments due to permanently disabled claimants under workers’ compensation policies.
Structured settlements are agreements that provide fixed periodic payments to claimants and include
annuities purchased to fund unpaid losses for permanently disabled claimants and, prior to 2008,
agreements that funded loss run-offs for unrelated parties. Most of the annuities have been
purchased from Life and these structured settlements are recorded at present value as annuity
obligations of Life, either within the reserve for future policy benefits if the annuity benefits
are life-contingent or within other policyholder funds and benefits payable if the annuity benefits
are not life-contingent. If not funded through an annuity, reserves for certain indemnity payments
due to permanently disabled claimants under workers’ compensation policies are recorded as property
and casualty reserves and were discounted to present value at an average interest rate of 5.4% in
2008 and 5.5% in 2007. Reserves for structured settlements that funded loss run-offs for unrelated
parties were discounted at an average interest rate of 5.5% in 2007.

As of December 31, 2008 and 2007, property and casualty reserves were discounted by a total of $488
and $568, respectively. The current accident year benefit from discounting property and casualty
reserves was $38 in 2008, $46 in 2007 and $63 in 2006. Contributing to the decrease in the current
accident year benefit from discounting over the past three years has been a reduction in the
discount rate, reflecting a lower risk-free rate of return over that period. Accretion of
discounts for prior accident years totaled $26 in 2008, $31 in 2007, and $32 in 2006. For
annuities issued by Life to fund certain P&C workers’ compensation indemnity payments where the
claimant has not released the P&C Company of its obligation, Life has recorded annuity obligations
totaling $945 as of December 31, 2008 and $962 as of December 31, 2007.

As of December 31, 2008, net property and casualty reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses
reported under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S.
GAAP”) were approximately equal to net reserves reported on a statutory basis. Under U.S. GAAP,
liabilities for unpaid losses for permanently disabled workers’ compensation claimants are
discounted at rates that are no higher than risk-free interest rates and which generally exceed the
statutory discount rates set by regulators, such that workers’ compensation reserves for statutory
reporting are higher than the reserves for U.S. GAAP reporting. Largely offsetting the effect of
the difference in discounting is that a portion of the U.S. GAAP provision for uncollectible
reinsurance is not recognized under statutory accounting.

Further discussion of The Hartford’s property and casualty reserves, including asbestos and
environmental claims reserves, may be found in the Property and Casualty Reserves, Net of
Reinsurance section of the MD&A– Critical Accounting Estimates.



A reconciliation of liabilities for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses is herein referenced
from Note 11 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. A table depicting the historical

Reserve changes for accident years 1998 & Prior

During the 2007 calendar year, the Company refined its processes for allocating incurred but not
reported (“IBNR”) reserves by accident year, resulting in a reclassification of $347 of IBNR
reserves from the 2003 to 2006 accident years to the 2002 and prior accident years. This
reclassification of reserves by accident year had no effect on total recorded reserves within any
segment or on total recorded reserves for any line of business within a segment.

The largest impacts of net reserve re-estimates are shown in the “1998 & Prior” accident years.
The reserve re-estimates in calendar year 2003 include an increase in reserves of $2.6 billion
related to reserve strengthening based on the Company’s evaluation of its asbestos reserves. The
reserve evaluation that led to the strengthening in calendar year 2003 confirmed the Company’s view
of the existence of a substantial long-term deterioration in the asbestos litigation environment.
The reserve re-estimates in calendar years 2004 and 2006 were largely attributable to reductions in
the reinsurance recoverable asset associated with older, long-term casualty liabilities. Excluding
the impacts of asbestos and environmental strengthening, over the past ten years, reserve
re-estimates for total Property & Casualty ranged from (3.0)% to 1.6% of total net recorded
reserves.

Apart from the effect of reserve reclassifications by accident year during the 2007 calendar year,
the Company strengthened workers’ compensation and general liability reserves in 2007 by $79
related to accident years prior to 1987 and recorded a charge of $99 in 2007 principally as a
result of an adverse arbitration decision involving claims prior to 1993 that were owed to an
insurer of the Company’s former parent.

Reserve changes for accident years 1999 and 2000

Prior to calendar year 2006, there was reserve deterioration, spread over several calendar years,
on accident years 1998-2000 driven, in part, by deterioration of reserves for assumed casualty
reinsurance and workers’ compensation claims. Numerous actuarial assumptions on assumed casualty
reinsurance turned out to be low, including loss cost trends, particularly on excess of loss
business, and the impact of deteriorating terms and conditions. Workers’ compensation reserves
also deteriorated, as medical inflation trends were above initial expectations.

Reserve changes for accident years 2001 and 2002

Accident years 2001 and 2002 are reasonably close to original estimates. However, each year shows
some swings by calendar period, with some favorable development prior to calendar year 2005,
largely offset by unfavorable development in calendar years 2005 through 2008. The release for
accident year 2001 during calendar year 2004 relates primarily to reserves for September 11.
Subsequent adverse developments on accident year 2001 relate to assumed casualty reinsurance and
unexpected development on mature claims in both general liability and workers’ compensation.
Reserve releases for accident year 2002 during calendar years 2003 and 2004 come largely from
short-tail lines of business, where results emerge quickly and actual reported losses are
predictive of ultimate losses. Reserve increases on accident year 2002 during calendar year 2005
were recognized, as unfavorable development on accident years prior to 2002 caused the Company to
increase its estimate of unpaid losses for the 2002 accident year. Net favorable reserve
development in calendar year 2008 related to the 2001 and 2002 accident years was largely due to a
release of workers’ compensation reserves, partially offset by modest strengthening of reserves for
professional liability claims.



Reserve changes for accident years 2003 through 2007

Even after considering the 2007 calendar year reclassification of $347 of IBNR reserves from the
2003 to 2006 accident years to the 2002 and prior accident years, accident years 2003 through 2007
show favorable development in calendar years 2004 through 2008. A portion of the release comes
from short-tail lines of business, where results emerge quickly. During calendar year 2005 and
2006, favorable re-estimates occurred in Personal Lines for both loss and allocated loss adjustment
expenses. In addition, catastrophe reserves related to the 2004 and 2005 hurricanes developed
favorably in 2006. During calendar years 2005 through 2008, the Company recognized favorable
re-estimates of both loss and allocated loss adjustment expenses on workers’ compensation claims
driven, in part, by state legal reforms, including in California and Florida, underwriting actions
and expense reduction initiatives that have had a greater impact in controlling costs than was
originally estimated. In 2007, the Company released reserves for Small Commercial package business
claims as reported losses have emerged favorably to previous expectations. In 2007 and 2008, the
Company released reserves for Middle Market general liability claims due to the favorable emergence
of losses for high hazard and umbrella general liability claims. Reserves for professional
liability claims were released in 2008 related to the 2003 through 2006 accident years due to a
lower estimate of claim severity on both directors’ and officers’ insurance claims and errors and
omissions insurance claims. Reserves of Personal Lines auto liability claims were released in 2008
due largely to an improvement in emerged claim severity for the 2005 to 2007 accident years.

Ceded Reinsurance

The
Hartford cedes some of its insurance risk to reinsurance companies. Reinsurance does not relieve The
Hartford of its primary liability and, therefore, failure of reinsurers to honor their obligations
could result in losses to The Hartford. The Hartford evaluates the risk transfer of its
reinsurance contracts, the financial condition of its reinsurers and monitors concentrations of
credit risk. The Company’s monitoring procedures include careful initial selection of its
reinsurers, structuring agreements to provide collateral funds where possible, and regularly
monitoring the financial condition and ratings of its reinsurers. Reinsurance accounting is
followed for ceded transactions when the risk transfer provisions of Financial Accounting Standards
Board (“FASB”) Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 113, “Accounting and Reporting for
Reinsurance of Short-Duration and Long-Duration Contracts,” (“SFAS 113”) have been met. For
further discussion, see Note 6 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

For Property & Casualty operations, these reinsurance arrangements are intended to provide greater
diversification of business and limit The Hartford’s maximum net loss arising from large risks or
catastrophes. A major portion of The Hartford’s property and casualty reinsurance is effected
under general reinsurance contracts known as treaties, or, in some instances, is negotiated on an
individual risk basis, known as facultative reinsurance. The Hartford also has in-force excess of
loss contracts with reinsurers that protect it against a specified part or all of a layer of losses
over stipulated amounts.

In accordance with normal industry practice, Life is involved in both the cession and assumption of
insurance with other insurance and reinsurance companies. As of December 31, 2008 and 2007, the
Company’s policy for the largest amount of life insurance retained on any one life by any company
comprising the life operations was $10. In addition, Life has reinsured U.S. minimum
death benefit guarantees, Japan’s guaranteed minimum death
benefits, as well as the U.S. guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefits offered in connection with its variable
annuity contracts. Reinsurance of the Company’s GMWB riders meet the definition of a derivative
reported under SFAS 133; the difference in fair value of the reinsurance derivative is reported in
earnings. Life also assumes reinsurance from other insurers. For the years ended December 31,
2008, 2007 and 2006, Life did not make any significant changes in the terms under which reinsurance
is ceded to other insurers. For further discussion on reinsurance, see Reinsurance in the Capital
Markets Risk Management section of the MD&A.

Investment Operations

The Hartford’s investment portfolios are primarily divided between Life and Property & Casualty.
The investment portfolios of Life and Property & Casualty are managed by HIMCO. HIMCO manages the
portfolios to maximize economic value, while attempting to generate the income necessary to support
the Company’s various product obligations, within internally established objectives, guidelines and
risk tolerances. The portfolio objectives and guidelines are developed based upon the
asset/liability profile, including duration, convexity and other characteristics within specified
risk tolerances. The risk tolerances considered include, for example, asset and credit issuer
allocation limits, maximum portfolio below investment grade holdings and foreign currency exposure.
The Company attempts to minimize adverse impacts to the portfolio and the Company’s results of
operations from changes in economic conditions through asset allocation limits, asset/liability
duration matching and through the use of derivatives. During the latter part of 2008, HIMCO
initiated certain activities to reduce overall credit risk exposure in the investment portfolios.
For further discussion of HIMCO’s portfolio management approach, see the Investments — General and
the Investment Credit Risk sections of the MD&A.

In addition to managing the general account assets of the Company, HIMCO is also a Securities and
Exchange Commission (“SEC”) registered investment advisor for third party institutional clients, a
sub-advisor for certain mutual funds and serves as the sponsor and collateral manager for capital
markets transactions. HIMCO specializes in investment management that incorporates proprietary
research and active management within a disciplined risk framework to provide value added returns
versus peers and benchmarks. As of December 31, 2008 and 2007, the fair value of HIMCO’s total
assets under management was approximately $138.8 billion and $148.7 billion, respectively, of which
$9.2 billion and $10.9 billion, respectively, were held in HIMCO managed third party accounts.



Regulation and Premium Rates

Insurance companies are subject to comprehensive and detailed regulation and supervision throughout
the United States. The extent of such regulation varies, but generally has its source in statutes
which delegate regulatory, supervisory and administrative powers to state insurance departments.
Such powers relate to, among other things, the standards of solvency that must be met and
maintained; the licensing of insurers and their agents; the nature of and limitations on
investments; establishing premium rates; claim handling and trade practices; restrictions on the
size of risks which may be insured under a single policy; deposits of securities for the benefit of
policyholders; approval of policy forms; periodic examinations of the affairs of companies; annual
and other reports required to be filed on the financial condition of companies or for other
purposes; fixing maximum interest rates on life insurance policy loans and minimum rates for
accumulation of surrender values; and the adequacy of reserves and other necessary provisions for
unearned premiums, unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses and other liabilities, both reported
and unreported.

Most states have enacted legislation that regulates insurance holding company systems such as The
Hartford. This legislation provides that each insurance company in the system is required to
register with the insurance department of its state of domicile and furnish information concerning
the operations of companies within the holding company system that may materially affect the
operations, management or financial condition of the insurers within the system. All transactions
within a holding company system affecting insurers must be fair and equitable. Notice to the
insurance departments is required prior to the consummation of transactions affecting the ownership
or control of an insurer and of certain material transactions between an insurer and any entity in
its holding company system. In addition, certain of such transactions cannot be consummated
without the applicable insurance department’s prior approval. In the jurisdictions in which the
Company’s insurance company subsidiaries are domiciled, the acquisition of more than 10% of The
Hartford’s outstanding common stock would require the acquiring party to make various regulatory
filings.

The extent of insurance regulation on business outside the United States varies significantly among
the countries in which The Hartford operates. Some countries have minimal regulatory requirements,
while others regulate insurers extensively. Foreign insurers in certain countries are faced with
greater restrictions than domestic competitors domiciled in that particular jurisdiction. The
Hartford’s international operations are comprised of insurers licensed in their respective
countries.

The Company has also submitted an application
to participate in the U.S. Treasury Department’s Capital Purchase Program. If the Company’s application
is approved, and the Company purchases Federal Trust Corporation, it will become a savings and loan holding
company subject to regulation by the Office of Thrift Supervision.

Intellectual Property

We rely on a combination of contractual rights and copyright, trademark, patent and trade secret
laws to establish and protect our intellectual property.

We have a worldwide trademark portfolio that we consider important in the marketing of our products
and services, including, among others, the trademarks of The Hartford name, the Stag Logo and the
combination of these two marks. The duration of trademark registrations varies from country to
country and may be renewed indefinitely subject to country-specific use and registration
requirements. We regard our trademarks as extremely valuable assets in marketing our products and
services and vigorously seek to protect them against infringement.

Employees

The Hartford had approximately 31,000 employees as of December 31, 2008.

Available Information

The Hartford makes available, free of charge, on or through its Internet website
(http://www.thehartford.com) The Hartford’s annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form
10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to
Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act as soon as reasonably practicable after The Hartford
electronically files such material with, or furnishes it to, the SEC.



Item 1A. RISK FACTORS

Investing in The Hartford involves risk. In deciding whether to invest in The Hartford, you should
carefully consider the following risk factors, any of which could have a significant or material
adverse effect on the business, financial condition, operating results or liquidity of The
Hartford. This information should be considered carefully together with the other information
contained in this report and the other reports and materials filed by The Hartford with the
Securities and Exchange Commission.

We have been materially adversely affected by conditions in the global financial markets and
economic conditions generally, and may be materially adversely affected if these conditions persist
or deteriorate further in 2009 or if our planned initiatives are not effective.

Markets in the United States and elsewhere have experienced extreme volatility and disruption for
more than 12 months, due largely to the stresses affecting the global banking system, which
accelerated significantly in the second half of 2008. The United States, Europe and Japan have
entered a severe recession that is likely to persist well into and perhaps through and even beyond
2009, despite past and expected governmental intervention in the world’s major economies. These
circumstances have exerted significant downward pressure on prices of equity securities and
virtually all other asset classes and have resulted in substantially increased market volatility,
severely constrained credit and capital markets, particularly for financial institutions, and an
overall loss of investor confidence. Economic conditions have continued to deteriorate in early
2009.

Like other financial institutions and particularly life insurers, which face significant financial
and capital markets risk in their operations, we have been adversely affected, to a significant
extent, by these conditions. Among other effects, we incurred significant investment losses and
other charges in 2008, notably with respect to deferred acquisition costs and goodwill associated
with our variable annuity and international businesses, which resulted in a net loss for the fourth
quarter and the full year. Our unrealized loss position also increased substantially in 2008. The
unanticipated, severe decline in the equity markets also caused material increases to our
liabilities in connection with certain annuity products, a line of business in which we have
significant concentration. Concerns related to investment losses, liabilities arising from
variable annuity products and capital pressures, which led to severe pressure on our stock price in
2008, are continuing in 2009. As detailed in the following risk factors, we expect to continue to
face significant challenges and uncertainties that could materially adversely affect our results,
financial condition and prospects.

Our capital position declined in
2008 relative to 2007, notwithstanding our capital-raising transaction with Allianz SE in October 2008. We
expect continued pressure on our capital position in 2009. Further significant declines in our capital
position could impair our ability to support the scale of our business as currently constituted and to
absorb continuing operating losses and liabilities under our customer contracts and our overall competitiveness.
We have taken a number of steps to preserve capital and mitigate risk, among them launching a range
of initiatives to reduce risks associated with our various lines of business, applying for federal funds
under the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 (“EESA”) and looking across the
enterprise for additional opportunities to reduce risk. These initiatives include modifying product
features, adjusting our hedging activities and mitigating risks in our investment portfolio, and
could also include discontinuing or restructuring certain business lines. Like other companies,
we are also evaluating our expense base in light of expected contractions in certain of our business
lines and have further reduced our dividend rate. Taken as a whole, these actions may not be effective,
especially if the global economy experiences further shocks. Even if effective, certain measures may
have unintended consequences. For example, rebalancing our hedging program may better protect our statutory
surplus, but may also result in greater U.S. GAAP earnings volatility. These actions may also entail
additional costs or result in further impairment or other charges or adversely affect our ability to
compete successfully in an increasingly difficult consumer market.

On February 6, 2009, Moody’s Investor Services
downgraded our long-term debt rating to “Baa1” and the financial strength ratings of our principal subsidiaries
to “A1”. On February 9, 2009, Fitch Ratings downgraded our long-term debt rating to “BBB” and the financial
strength ratings of our principal subsidiaries to “A” (in the case of our life subsidiaries) and “A+” (in the
case of our property and casualty subsidiaries) and Standard & Poor’s downgraded our counterparty credit rating to “A-”.
If our planned initiatives fail to mitigate the impacts on the Company of the current recession, or if
the current recession is even more severe than expected, we may also experience further downgrades of our financial
strength and credit ratings. See Ratings within Capital Resources and Liquidity of the MD&A. While reductions in
ratings may ease pressure on our capital position, it could also have negative implications for our competitive position.
We may also need to raise additional capital or consider other transactions to manage our capital position and
liquidity or further reduce our exposure to market and financial risks. We may not be able to raise sufficient
capital as and when required if the financial markets remain in turmoil, and any capital we raise may be on
terms that are dilutive to existing shareholders or otherwise unfavorable to us. Any sales of securities or
other assets that we may carry out may be completed on unfavorable terms or cause us to incur charges, and we
would lose the potential for market upside on those assets in a market recovery. If our business continues to
experience significant challenges, we may face other pressures, such as employee retention issues and potential
loss of distributors for our products.

Other developments relating to the current economic environment and financial crisis may also
significantly affect our operations and prospects in ways that we cannot predict. For example,
U.S. and overseas governmental or regulatory authorities, including the Securities and Exchange
Commission (the “SEC”), the Office of Thrift Supervision (“OTS”), the New York Stock Exchange or
the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (“FINRA”), may implement enhanced or new regulatory
requirements intended to prevent future crises or otherwise stabilize the institutions under their
supervision. New regulations will likely affect critical matters, including capital requirements,
and published proposals by insurance regulatory authorities that could reduce the pressure on our
capital position may not be adopted or may be adopted in a form that does not afford as much
capital relief as anticipated. If we fail to manage the impact of these developments effectively,
our prospects, results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.



The markets in the United States and elsewhere have been experiencing extreme and unprecedented
volatility and disruption. We are exposed to significant financial and capital markets risk,
including changes in interest rates, credit spreads, equity prices, and foreign exchange rates
which may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and
liquidity.

The markets in the United States and elsewhere have been experiencing and are expected to continue
to experience extreme and unprecedented volatility and disruption. We are exposed to significant
financial and capital markets risk, including changes in interest rates, credit spreads, equity
prices and foreign currency exchange rates.

One important exposure to equity risk relates to the potential for lower earnings associated with
certain of our Life businesses, such as variable annuities, where fee income is earned based upon
the fair value of the assets under management. During the course of 2008, the significant declines
in equity markets have negatively impacted assets under management. As a result, fee income earned
from those assets has also been negatively impacted. In addition, certain of our Life products
offer guaranteed benefits which increase our potential obligation and statutory capital exposure
should equity markets decline. Due to declines in equity markets during 2008, our liability for
these guaranteed benefits has significantly increased and our statutory capital position has
decreased. Further sustained declines in equity markets during 2009 may result in the need to
devote significant additional capital to support these products. We are also exposed to interest
rate and equity risk based upon the discount rate and expected long-term rate of return assumptions
associated with our pension and other post-retirement benefit obligations. Sustained declines in
long-term interest rates or equity returns are likely to have a negative effect on the funded
status of these plans.

Our exposure to interest rate risk relates primarily to the market price and cash flow variability
associated with changes in interest rates. A rise in interest rates, in the absence of other
countervailing changes, will increase the net unrealized loss position of our investment portfolio
and, if long-term interest rates rise dramatically within a six to twelve month time period,
certain of our Life businesses may be exposed to disintermediation risk. Disintermediation risk
refers to the risk that our policyholders may surrender their contracts in a rising interest rate
environment, requiring us to liquidate assets in an unrealized loss position. Due to the long-term
nature of the liabilities associated with certain of our Life businesses, such as structured
settlements and guaranteed benefits on variable annuities, sustained declines in long term interest
rates may subject us to reinvestment risks and increased hedging costs. In other situations,
declines in interest rates or changes in credit spreads may result in reducing the duration of
certain Life liabilities, creating asset liability duration mismatches and lower spread income.

Our exposure to credit spreads primarily relates to market price and cash flow variability
associated with changes in credit spreads. The recent widening of credit spreads has contributed to
the increase in the net unrealized loss position of our investment portfolio of $12.5 billion in
2008, before DAC effects and tax, and has also contributed to the
increase in other than temporary impairments. If issuer credit spreads
continue to widen significantly over an extended period of time, it would likely exacerbate these
effects, resulting in greater and additional other-than-temporary impairments. Increased losses
have also occurred associated with credit based non-qualifying derivatives where the Company
assumes credit exposure. If credit spreads tighten significantly, it will reduce net investment
income associated with new purchases of fixed maturities. In addition, a reduction in market
liquidity has made it difficult to value certain of our securities as trading has become less
frequent. As such, valuations may include assumptions or estimates that may be more susceptible to
significant period to period changes which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated
results of operations or financial condition.

Our statutory surplus is also impacted by widening credit spreads as a result of the accounting for
the assets and liabilities on our fixed market value adjusted (“MVA”) annuities. Statutory separate
account assets supporting the fixed MVA annuities are recorded at fair value. In determining the
statutory reserve for the fixed MVA annuities we are required to use current crediting rates in the
U.S. and Japanese LIBOR in Japan. In many capital market scenarios, current crediting rates in the
U.S. are highly correlated with market rates implicit in the fair value of statutory separate
account assets. As a result, the change in the statutory reserve from period to period will likely
substantially offset the change in the fair value of the statutory separate account assets.
However, in periods of volatile credit markets, such as we are now experiencing, actual credit
spreads on investment assets may increase sharply for certain sub-sectors of the overall credit
market, resulting in statutory separate account asset market value losses. As actual credit spreads
are not fully reflected in current crediting rates in the U.S. or Japanese LIBOR in Japan, the
calculation of statutory reserves will not substantially offset the change in fair value of the
statutory separate account assets resulting in reductions in statutory surplus. This has resulted
and may continue to result in the need to devote significant additional capital to support the
product.

Our primary foreign currency exchange risks are related to net income from foreign operations,
non–U.S. dollar denominated investments, investments in foreign subsidiaries, our yen-denominated
individual fixed annuity product, and certain guaranteed benefits associated with the Japan and
U.K. variable annuities. These risks relate to potential decreases in value and income resulting
from a strengthening or weakening in foreign exchange rates versus the U.S. dollar. In general, the
weakening of foreign currencies versus the U.S. dollar will unfavorably affect net income from
foreign operations, the value of non-U.S. dollar denominated investments, investments in foreign
subsidiaries and realized gains or losses on the yen denominated individual fixed annuity product.
In comparison, a strengthening of the Japanese yen or British pound in comparison to the U.S.
dollar and other currencies will increase our exposure to the guarantee benefits associated with
the Japan or U.K. variable annuities. Correspondingly, a strengthening of the U.S. dollar
compared to other currencies will increase our exposure to the U.S. variable annuity guarantee benefits
where policyholders have elected to invest in international funds.

If significant, further declines in equity prices, changes in U.S. interest rates, changes in
credit spreads and the strengthening or weakening of foreign currencies against the U.S. dollar,
individually or in combination, could continue to have a material adverse effect on our
consolidated results of operations, financial condition and liquidity both directly and
indirectly by creating competitive and other pressures such as employee retention issues
and the potential loss of distributors for our products.



In addition, in the conduct of our business, there could be scenarios where in order to reduce
risks, fulfill our obligations or to raise incremental liquidity, we would sell assets at a loss
for a variety of reasons including the unrealized loss position in our overall investment portfolio
and the lack of liquidity in the credit markets. These scenarios could include selling assets as
the Company reduces its securities lending program.

Declines in equity markets and changes in interest rates and credit spreads can also negatively
impact the fair values of each of our segments. If a significant decline in the fair value of a
segment occurred and this resulted in an excess of that segment’s book value over fair value, the
goodwill assigned to that segment might be impaired and could cause the Company to record a charge
to impair a part or all of the related goodwill assets, as occurred
in the fourth quarter of 2008 with respect to our Individual Annuity
and International reporting units.
See impairment of goodwill risk factor for further information on this risk.

We may be unable to effectively mitigate the impact of equity market volatility arising from
obligations under annuity product guarantees, which may have a
material adverse effect on our
consolidated results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.

Some of the products offered by our life businesses, especially variable annuities, offer certain
guaranteed benefits which, as a result of any decline in equity markets would not only result in
lower earnings, but may also increase our exposure to liability for benefit claims. During the
course of 2008, as equity markets declined, our liability for guaranteed benefits significantly
increased. We are also subject to equity market volatility related to these benefits, especially
the guaranteed minimum death benefit (“GMDB”), guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefit (“GMWB”),
guaranteed minimum accumulation benefit (“GMAB”) and guaranteed minimum income benefit (“GMIB”)
offered with variable annuity products. As of December 31, 2008, the liability for GMWB and GMAB
was $6.6 billion and $0, respectively. The liability for GMIB and GMDB was a combined $473, net of
reinsurance as of December 31, 2008. We use reinsurance structures and have modified benefit
features to mitigate the exposure associated with GMDB. We also use reinsurance in combination with
a modification of benefit features and derivative instruments to minimize the claim exposure and to
reduce the volatility of net income associated with the GMWB liability. However, due to the severe
economic conditions in the fourth quarter of 2008, we have adjusted our risk management program to
place greater relative emphasis on the protection of statutory surplus. This shift in relative
emphasis will likely result in greater U.S. GAAP earnings volatility. While we believe that these
and other actions we have taken serve to improve the efficiency by which we manage the risks
related to these benefits, we remain liable for the guaranteed benefits in the event that
reinsurers or derivative counterparties are unable or unwilling to pay, and are subject to the risk
that other management procedures prove ineffective or that unanticipated policyholder behavior,
combined with adverse market events, produces economic losses beyond the scope of the risk
management techniques employed, which individually or collectively may have a material adverse
effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial condition
and cash flows.

The amount of statutory capital that we have and the amount of statutory capital that we must hold
to maintain our financial strength and credit ratings and meet other requirements can vary
significantly from time to time and is sensitive to a number of factors outside of our control,
including equity market, credit market, interest rate and foreign
currency conditions, changes in policyholder behavior and changes
in rating agency models.

We conduct the vast majority of our business through licensed insurance company subsidiaries.
Accounting standards and statutory capital and reserve requirements for these entities are
prescribed by the applicable insurance regulators and the National Association of Insurance
Commissioners (“NAIC”). Insurance regulators have established regulations that provide minimum
capitalization requirements based on risk-based capital (“RBC”) formulas for both life and property
and casualty companies. The RBC formula for life companies establishes capital requirements
relating to insurance, business, asset and interest rate risks, including equity, interest rate and
expense recovery risks associated with variable annuities and group annuities that contain death
benefits or certain living benefits. The RBC formula for property and casualty companies adjusts
statutory surplus levels for certain underwriting, asset, credit and off-balance sheet risks.

In any particular year, statutory surplus amounts and RBC ratios may increase or decrease depending
on a variety of factors – the amount of statutory income or losses generated by our insurance
subsidiaries (which itself is sensitive to equity market and credit market conditions), the amount
of additional capital our insurance subsidiaries must hold to support business growth, changes in
equity market levels, the value of certain fixed-income and equity securities in our investment
portfolio, the value of certain derivative instruments, changes in interest rates and foreign
currency exchange rates, as well as changes to the NAIC RBC formulas. Most of these factors are
outside of the Company’s control. The Company’s financial strength and credit ratings are
significantly influenced by the statutory surplus amounts and RBC ratios of our insurance company
subsidiaries. In addition, rating agencies may implement changes to their internal models that have
the effect of increasing or decreasing the amount of statutory capital we must hold in order to
maintain our current ratings. Also, in extreme scenarios of equity market declines, the amount of
additional statutory reserves that we are required to hold for our variable annuity guarantees
increases at a greater than linear rate. This reduces the statutory surplus used in calculating our
RBC ratios. When equity markets increase, surplus levels and RBC ratios will generally increase,
however, as a result of a number of factors and market conditions, including the level of hedging
costs and other risk transfer activities, reserve requirements for death and living benefit
guarantees and RBC requirements could increase resulting in lower RBC ratios. Due to all of these
factors, projecting statutory capital and the related RBC ratios is
complex. During February 2009, our financial strength and credit
ratings have been downgraded by multiple rating agencies. To the extent that
our statutory capital resources are deemed to be insufficient to maintain a particular rating by
one or more rating agencies, we may seek to raise additional capital through public or private
equity or debt financing. Alternatively, if we were not to raise additional capital in such a
scenario, either at our discretion or because we were unable to do so, our financial strength and
credit ratings might be further downgraded by one or more rating agencies.



Our
application to participate in the CPP may not be approved or, if
approved, may subject us to additional restrictions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.

In order to supplement our capital position, we have applied to the U.S. Treasury Department to
receive funds from its Capital Purchase Program (“CPP”). If approved, we estimate that we may be
eligible to receive between $1.1 billion and $3.4 billion in funds. There can be no assurance,
however, that we will be approved to participate in the CPP or, if approved, that we will receive
an amount consistent with our estimates. If other insurance companies are approved to participate
in the CPP but we are not so approved, it could create negative market perceptions of our financial
strength and capital position, reduce our available options to raise capital and otherwise have an
adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.

If we do receive approval to participate in the CPP, receipt of CPP funds will subject us to
additional regulation and restrictions that may have a negative impact on our operations. In order
to be eligible to receive CPP funds, we agreed to acquire (contingent on our approval to
participate in the CPP) the parent company of Federal Trust Bank (“FTB”), a federally chartered,
FDIC-insured thrift. As required by the OTS as a condition to consummating that acquisition, we
have since been approved by the OTS to become a savings and loan holding company. As a result, if
we are approved to participate in the CPP and consummate the acquisition of FTB, we will be subject
to supervision and examination by the OTS. New legislation or regulations may also be adopted that
would impose additional constraints on the operations of recipients of CPP funds. Such restrictions,
combined with OTS oversight, may make it more difficult to recruit and retain key employees and
otherwise restrict our flexibility to respond to changing market conditions. In addition, if we consummate the acquisition of FTB,
we have agreed with OTS to contribute approximately $100 to the capital of FTB and to serve
as a source of strength to FTB, which could require the contribution of additional capital to FTB
in the future. These factors could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations,
financial condition and liquidity.

We have experienced and may experience additional future downgrades in our financial strength or
credit ratings, which may make our products less attractive, increase our cost of capital and
inhibit our ability to refinance our debt, which would have a material adverse effect on our
business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.

Financial strength and credit ratings, including commercial paper ratings, are an important factor
in establishing the competitive position of insurance companies.
During February 2009, our financial strength and credit ratings have
been downgraded by multiple rating agencies. See our ratings in Capital
Resources and Liquidity section of the MD&A. Rating agencies assign ratings based upon several
factors. While most of the factors relate to the rated company, some of the factors relate to the
views of the rating agency, general economic conditions, and circumstances outside the rated
company’s control. In addition, rating agencies may employ different models and formulas to assess
the financial strength of a rated company, and from time to time rating agencies have, in their
discretion, altered these models. Changes to the models, general economic conditions, or
circumstances outside our control could impact a rating agency’s judgment of its rating and the
rating it assigns us. We cannot predict what actions rating agencies may take, or what actions we
may take in response to the actions of rating agencies, which may adversely affect us.

Our financial strength ratings, which are intended to measure our ability to meet policyholder
obligations, are an important factor affecting public confidence in most of our products and, as a
result, our competitiveness. The recent downgrades we have
experienced, a further downgrade, or an announced
potential further downgrade, in the rating of our
financial strength or of one of our principal insurance subsidiaries could affect our competitive
position in the insurance industry and make it more difficult for us to market our products, as
potential customers may select companies with higher financial strength ratings thereby reducing
future sales of our products and lowering future earnings.

The
recent downgrades we have experienced, a further downgrade of our
credit ratings, or an announced potential further downgrade, could affect our ability to
raise additional debt with terms and conditions similar to our current debt, or at all, and
accordingly, would likely increase our cost of capital. The recent
downgrades we have experienced, or a further downgrade of our credit ratings could
also make it more difficult to raise capital to refinance any maturing debt obligations, to support
business growth at our insurance subsidiaries and to maintain or improve the current financial
strength ratings of our principal insurance subsidiaries described
above. After taking into consideration rating agency actions through
February 10, 2009,
a downgrade of three levels below our current insurance financial strength levels could begin to
trigger potentially material collateral calls on certain of our
derivative instruments and could also trigger counterparty rights to
terminate derivative relationships, both of which could limit
our ability to purchase additional derivative instruments. If any of these negative events were to
occur, our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity may be adversely
affected.



Our business, results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected by general
domestic and international economic and business conditions that are less favorable than
anticipated.

Factors such as consumer spending, business investment, government spending, the volatility and
strength of the capital markets, and inflation all affect the business and economic environment
and, ultimately, the amount and profitability of business we conduct. For example, in an economic
downturn such as the current financial crisis characterized by higher unemployment, lower family
income, lower corporate earnings, lower business investment and lower consumer spending, the demand
for financial and insurance products has been adversely affected. Further, given that we offer our
products and services in North America, Japan, Europe and South America, we are exposed to these
risks in multiple geographic locations. Our operations are subject to different local political,
regulatory, business and financial risks and challenges, which may affect the demand for our
products and services, the value of our investment portfolio, the required levels of our capital
and surplus and the credit quality of local counterparties. These risks include, for example,
political, social or economic instability in countries in which we operate, fluctuations in foreign
currency exchange rates, credit risks of our local counterparties, lack of local business
experience in certain markets and, in certain cases, risks associated with potential
incompatibility with partners. We may not succeed in developing and implementing policies and
strategies that are effective in each location where we do business, and we cannot guarantee that
the inability to successfully address the risks related to economic conditions in all of the
geographic locations where we conduct business will not have a material adverse effect on our
business, results of operations and financial condition.

Our valuations of many of our financial instruments include methodologies, estimations and
assumptions that are subject to differing interpretations and could result in changes to investment
valuations that may materially adversely affect our results of
operations and financial condition.

The following financial instruments are carried at fair value in the Company’s consolidated
financial statements: fixed maturities, equity securities, freestanding and embedded derivatives,
and separate account assets. The Company has categorized these securities into a three-level
hierarchy, based on the priority of the inputs to the respective valuation technique. The fair
value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets for identical assets
or liabilities (Level 1) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3). In many
situations, inputs used to measure the fair value of an asset or liability position may fall into
different levels of the fair value hierarchy. In these situations, the Company will determine the
level in which the fair value falls based upon the lowest level input that is significant to the
determination of the fair value.

The determination of fair values are made at a specific point in time, based on available market
information and judgments about financial instruments, including estimates of the timing and
amounts of expected future cash flows and the credit standing of the issuer or counterparty. The
use of different methodologies and assumptions may have a material effect on the estimated fair
value amounts.

During
periods of market disruption such as we are currently experiencing, including periods of
rapidly widening credit spreads or illiquidity, it has been and will likely continue to be
difficult to value certain of our securities, such as Alt-A, subprime mortgage backed and CMBS
securities, if trading becomes less frequent and/or market data becomes less observable. There may
be certain asset classes that were in active markets with significant observable data that become
illiquid due to the current financial environment. In such cases, more securities may fall to
Level 3 and thus require more subjectivity and management judgment. As such, valuations may include
inputs and assumptions that are less observable or require greater estimation thereby resulting in
values which may differ materially from the value at which the investments may be ultimately sold.
Further, rapidly changing and unprecedented credit and equity market conditions could materially
impact the valuation of securities as reported within our consolidated financial statements and the
period-to-period changes in value could vary significantly. Decreases in value could have a
material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. As of December 31,
2008, 14%, 70% and 16% of our available for sale securities were considered to be Level 1, 2 and 3,
respectively.

Evaluation of available-for-sale securities for other than temporary impairment involves subjective
determinations and could materially impact our results of operations.

The evaluation of impairments is a quantitative and qualitative process, which is subject to risks
and uncertainties and is intended to determine whether declines in the fair value of investments
should be recognized in current period earnings. The risks and uncertainties include changes in
general economic conditions, the issuer’s financial condition or future recovery prospects, the
effects of changes in interest rates or credit spreads and the
expected recovery period. For securitized
financial assets with contractual cash flows, the Company currently uses its best estimate of cash
flows over the life of the security under severe recession scenarios. In addition, estimating
future cash flows involves incorporating information received from third party sources and making
internal assumptions and judgments regarding the future performance of the underlying collateral
and assessing the probability that an adverse change in future cash flows has occurred. The
determination of the amount of other than temporary impairments is based upon our quarterly
evaluation and assessment of known and inherent risks associated with the respective asset class.
Such evaluations and assessments are revised as conditions change and new information becomes
available.



Additionally, our management considers a wide range of factors about the security issuer and uses
their best judgment in evaluating the cause of the decline in the estimated fair value of the
security and in assessing the prospects for recovery. Inherent in management’s evaluation of the
security are assumptions and estimates about the operations of the issuer and its future earnings
potential. Considerations in the impairment evaluation process include, but are not limited to: (i)
the length of time and the extent to which the market value has been
less than cost or amortized cost;
(ii) the potential for impairments of securities when the issuer is experiencing significant
financial difficulties; (iii) the potential for impairments in an entire industry sector or
sub-sector; (iv) the potential for impairments in certain economically depressed geographic
locations; (v) the potential for impairments of securities where the issuer, series of issuers or
industry has suffered a catastrophic type of loss or has exhausted natural resources; (vi) our
intent and ability to retain the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for the recovery
of its value; (vii) unfavorable changes in forecasted cash flows on mortgage-backed and
asset-backed securities; and (viii) other subjective factors, including concentrations and
information obtained from regulators and rating agencies. During the year ended December 31, 2008,
the Company concluded that approximately $4.0 billion of unrealized losses were other than
temporarily impaired. Additional impairments may need to be taken in the future, which could have a material adverse
effect on our results of operations and financial condition.

Losses due to nonperformance or defaults by others, including issuers of investment securities
(which include structured securities such as commercial mortgage backed securities and residential
mortgage backed securities or other high yielding bonds) or reinsurance and derivative instrument
counterparties, could have a material adverse effect on the value of our investments, results of
operations, financial condition and cash flows.

Issuers or borrowers whose securities or loans we hold, customers, trading counterparties,
counterparties under swaps and other derivative contracts, reinsurers, clearing agents, exchanges,
clearing houses and other financial intermediaries and guarantors may default on their obligations
to us due to bankruptcy, insolvency, lack of liquidity, adverse economic conditions, operational
failure, fraud government intervention or other reasons. Such defaults could have a material
adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Additionally, the
underlying assets supporting our structured securities may deteriorate causing these securities to
incur losses. For example, during the year ended December 31, 2008, the Company incurred losses of $46 on
derivative instruments due to counterparty default related to the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers
Holding, Inc.

Our investment portfolio includes investment securities in the financial services sector that have
experienced nonperformance or defaults recently. Further nonperformance or defaults could have a
material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial
condition and cash flows. In
addition, the value of our investments in hybrid securities, perpetual preferred securities, or
other equity securities in the financial services sector may be significantly impaired if the
issuers of such securities defer the payment of optional coupons or dividends, are forced to accept
government support or intervention, or grant majority equity stakes to their respective
governments.

The Company is not exposed to any credit concentration risk of a single issuer greater than 10% of
the Company’s stockholders’ equity other than U.S. government and U.S. government agencies backed
by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government and the Japanese government. However, if the
Company’s creditors are acquired, merge or otherwise consolidate with other creditors of the
Company’s, the Company’s credit concentration risk could increase above the 10% threshold, for a
period of time, until the Company is able to sell securities to get back in compliance with the
established investment credit policies.

The availability of the Company’s commercial paper program is dependent upon a variety of factors
including the Company’s ratings and market conditions.

The Company’s maximum borrowings available under its commercial paper program are $2.0 billion.
The Company’s ability to borrow under its commercial paper program is dependent upon market
conditions. On October 7, 2008, The Federal Reserve Board authorized the Commercial Paper Funding
Facility (“CPFF”) to improve liquidity in short-term funding markets by increasing the availability
of term commercial paper funding to issuers and by providing greater assurance to both issuers and
investors that firms will be able to roll over their maturing commercial paper. The Company
registered with the CPFF in order to sell up to a maximum of $375 to the facility, of which it has
issued the full amount as of December 31, 2008. The Company’s commercial paper must be rated
A-1/P-1/F1 by at least two ratings agencies to be eligible for the program. Moody’s, S&P and Fitch
all recently downgraded our commercial paper rating, rendering the Company ineligible to sell
additional commercial paper under the CPFF program going forward. As a result, we will be required
to pay the maturing commercial paper issued under the CPFF program from existing sources of
liquidity. Future deterioration of our capital position at a time when we are unable to access the
commercial paper markets due to prevailing market conditions could have a material adverse effect
on our liquidity.



If assumptions used in estimating future gross profits differ from actual experience, we may be
required to accelerate the amortization of DAC and increase reserves for guaranteed minimum death
benefits, which could have a material adverse effect on our results
of operations and financial
condition.

The Company defers acquisition costs associated with the sales of its universal and variable life
and variable annuity products. These costs are amortized over the expected life of the contracts.
The remaining deferred but not yet amortized cost is referred to as the Deferred Acquisition Cost
(“DAC”) asset. We amortize these costs in proportion to the present value of estimated gross
profits. The Company also establishes reserves for GMDB using components of estimated gross
profits (“EGPs”). The projection of estimated gross profits requires the use of certain assumptions,
principally related to separate account fund returns in excess of amounts credited to
policyholders, surrender and lapse rates, interest margin, mortality, and hedging costs. Of these
factors, we anticipate that changes in investment returns are most likely to impact the rate of
amortization of such costs. However, other factors such as those the Company might employ to
reduce risk, such as the cost of hedging or other risk mitigating techniques could also
significantly reduce estimates of future gross profits. Estimating future gross profits is a
complex process requiring considerable judgment and the forecasting of events well into the future.
If our assumptions regarding policyholder behavior, hedging costs or costs to employ other risk
mitigating techniques prove to be inaccurate or if significant or sustained equity market declines
persist, we could be required to accelerate the amortization of DAC related to variable annuity and
variable universal life contracts, and increase reserves for GMDB which would result in a charge to
net income. Such adjustments could have a material adverse effect on
our results of operations and
financial condition. During the year ended December 31, 2008, the Company recorded a $932,
after-tax, charge related to the unlock. Since September 30, 2008, the date of the last unlock,
the actual return on U.S. variable annuity assets has been 21% below our estimated aggregate
return. The Company estimates the actual return would need to drop by an additional 6% from
December 31, 2008 before EGPs in the Company’s models fall outside of the statistical ranges of
reasonable EGPs. Since September 30, 2008, the date of the last unlock, the actual return on Japan
variable annuity assets has been 15.5% below our estimated aggregate return. The Company estimates
the actual return would need to drop by an additional 7.5% from December 31, 2008 before EGPs in
the Company’s models fall outside of the statistical ranges of reasonable EGPs.

If our businesses do not perform well, we may be required to recognize an impairment of our
goodwill or to establish a valuation allowance against the deferred income tax asset, which could
have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.

Goodwill represents the excess of the amounts we paid to acquire subsidiaries and other businesses
over the fair value of their net assets at the date of acquisition. We test goodwill at least
annually for impairment. Impairment testing is performed based upon estimates of the fair value of
the “reporting unit” to which the goodwill relates. The reporting unit is the operating segment or
a business one level below that operating segment if discrete financial information is prepared and
regularly reviewed by management at that level. The fair value of the reporting unit is impacted by
the performance of the business and could be adversely impacted by any efforts made by the Company
to limit risk. If it is determined that the goodwill has been impaired, the Company must write
down the goodwill by the amount of the impairment, with a corresponding charge to net income. Such
write downs could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial
position. During 2008, the Company took an impairment charge of $745,
pre-tax, with respect to its Individual Annuity and International
reporting units.

If current market conditions persist during 2009, in particular, if the Company’s share price
remains below book value per share, or if the Company’s actions to limit risk associated with its
products or investments causes a significant change in any one reporting unit’s fair value, the
Company may need to reassess goodwill impairment at the end of each quarter as part of an annual or
interim impairment test. Subsequent reviews of goodwill could result in additional impairment of
goodwill during 2009.

Deferred income tax represents the tax effect of the differences between the book and tax basis of
assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets are assessed periodically by management to determine if
they are realizable. Factors in management’s determination include the performance of the business
including the ability to generate capital gains from a variety of sources and tax planning
strategies. If based on available information, it is more likely than not that the deferred income
tax asset will not be realized then a valuation allowance must be established with a corresponding
charge to net income. Our valuation allowance of $75, as of December 31, 2008, based on future
facts and circumstances may not be sufficient. Charges to increase our valuation allowance could
have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position.



It is difficult for us to predict our potential exposure for asbestos and environmental claims, and
our ultimate liability may exceed our currently recorded reserves, which may have a material
adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition and liquidity.

We continue to receive asbestos and environmental claims. Significant uncertainty limits the
ability of insurers and reinsurers to estimate the ultimate reserves necessary for unpaid losses
and related expenses for both environmental and particularly asbestos claims. We believe that the
actuarial tools and other techniques we employ to estimate the ultimate cost of claims for more
traditional kinds of insurance exposure are less precise in estimating reserves for our asbestos
and environmental exposures. Traditional actuarial reserving techniques cannot reasonably estimate
the ultimate cost of these claims, particularly during periods where theories of law are in flux.
Accordingly, the degree of variability of reserve estimates for these exposures is significantly
greater than for other more traditional exposures. It is also not possible to predict changes in
the legal and legislative environment and their effect on the future development of asbestos and
environmental claims. Although potential Federal asbestos-related legislation has been considered
in the Senate, it is uncertain whether such legislation will be reconsidered or enacted in the
future and, if so, what its effect would be on our aggregate asbestos liabilities. Because of the
significant uncertainties that limit the ability of insurers and reinsurers to estimate the
ultimate reserves necessary for unpaid losses and related expenses for both environmental and
particularly asbestos claims, the ultimate liabilities may exceed the currently recorded reserves.
Any such additional liability cannot be reasonably estimated now but could have a material adverse
effect on our consolidated operating results, financial condition and liquidity.

The occurrence of one or more terrorist attacks in the geographic areas we serve or the threat of
terrorism in general may have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated operating
results, financial condition and liquidity.

The occurrence of one or more terrorist attacks in the geographic areas we serve could result in
substantially higher claims under our insurance policies than we have anticipated. Private sector
catastrophe reinsurance is extremely limited and generally unavailable for terrorism losses caused
by attacks with nuclear, biological, chemical or radiological weapons. Reinsurance coverage from
the federal government under the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2007 is
also limited. Accordingly, the effects of a terrorist attack in the geographic areas we serve may
result in claims and related losses for which we do not have adequate reinsurance. This would
likely cause us to increase our reserves, adversely affect our earnings during the period or
periods affected and, if significant enough, could adversely affect our liquidity and financial
condition. Further, the continued threat of terrorism and the occurrence of terrorist attacks, as
well as heightened security measures and military action in response to these threats and attacks,
may cause significant volatility in global financial markets, disruptions to commerce and reduced
economic activity. These consequences could have an adverse effect on the value of the assets in
our investment portfolio as well as those in our separate accounts. The continued threat of
terrorism also could result in increased reinsurance prices and potentially cause us to retain more
risk than we otherwise would retain if we were able to obtain reinsurance at lower prices.
Terrorist attacks also could disrupt our operations centers in the U.S. or abroad. As a result, it
is possible that any, or a combination of all, of these factors may have a material adverse effect
on our business, consolidated operating results, financial condition and liquidity.

We may incur losses due to our reinsurers’ unwillingness or inability to meet their obligations
under reinsurance contracts and the availability, pricing and adequacy of reinsurance may not be
sufficient to protect us against losses.

As an insurer, we frequently seek to reduce the losses that may arise from catastrophes or
mortality, or other events that can cause unfavorable results of operations, through reinsurance.
Under these reinsurance arrangements, other insurers assume a portion of our losses and related
expenses; however, we remain liable as the direct insurer on all risks reinsured. Consequently,
ceded reinsurance arrangements do not eliminate our obligation to pay claims, and we are subject to
our reinsurers’ credit risk with respect to our ability to recover amounts due from them. Although
we evaluate periodically the financial condition of our reinsurers to minimize our exposure to
significant losses from reinsurer insolvencies, our reinsurers may become financially unsound or
choose to dispute their contractual obligations by the time their financial obligations become due.
The inability or unwillingness of any reinsurer to meet its financial obligations to us could have
a material adverse effect on our consolidated operating results. In addition, market conditions
beyond our control determine the availability and cost of the reinsurance we are able to purchase.
Historically, reinsurance pricing has changed significantly from time to time. No assurances can
be made that reinsurance will remain continuously available to us to the same extent and on the
same terms as are currently available. If we were unable to maintain our current level of
reinsurance or purchase new reinsurance protection in amounts that we consider sufficient and at
prices that we consider acceptable, we would have to either accept an increase in our net liability
exposure, reduce the amount of business we write, or develop other alternatives to reinsurance.



Our
consolidated results of operations, financial condition and cash flows may be materially
adversely affected by unfavorable loss development.

Our success, in part, depends upon our ability to accurately assess the risks associated with the
businesses that we insure. We establish loss reserves to cover our estimated liability for the
payment of all unpaid losses and loss expenses incurred with respect to premiums earned on the
policies that we write. Loss reserves do not represent an exact calculation of liability. Rather,
loss reserves are estimates of what we expect the ultimate settlement and administration of claims
will cost, less what has been paid to date. These estimates are based upon actuarial and
statistical projections and on our assessment of currently available data, as well as estimates of
claims severity and frequency, legal theories of liability and other factors. Loss reserve
estimates are refined periodically as experience develops and claims are reported and settled.
Establishing an appropriate level of loss reserves is an inherently uncertain process. Because of
this uncertainty, it is possible that our reserves at any given time will prove inadequate.
Furthermore, since estimates of aggregate loss costs for prior accident years are used in pricing
our insurance products, we could later determine that our products were not priced adequately to
cover actual losses and related loss expenses in order to generate a profit. To the extent we
determine that losses and related loss expenses are emerging unfavorably to our initial
expectations, we will be required to increase reserves. Increases in reserves would be recognized
as an expense during the period or periods in which these determinations are made, thereby
adversely affecting our results of operations for the related period or periods. Depending on the
severity and timing of any changes in these estimated losses, such determinations could have a
material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations,
financial condition and cash
flows.

We are particularly vulnerable to losses from the incidence and severity of catastrophes, both
natural and man-made, the occurrence of which may have a material adverse effect on our financial
condition, consolidated results of operations and liquidity.

Our property and casualty insurance operations expose us to claims arising out of catastrophes.
Catastrophes can be caused by various unpredictable events, including earthquakes, hurricanes,
hailstorms, severe winter weather, fires, tornadoes, explosions and other natural or man-made
disasters. We also face substantial exposure to losses resulting from acts of terrorism, disease
pandemics and political instability. The geographic distribution of our business subjects us to
catastrophe exposure for natural events occurring in a number of areas, including, but not limited
to, hurricanes in Florida, the Gulf Coast, the Northeast and the Atlantic coast regions of the
United States, and earthquakes in California and the New Madrid region of the United States. We
expect that increases in the values and concentrations of insured property in these areas will
continue to increase the severity of catastrophic events in the future. In the aftermath of the
2004 and 2005 hurricane season, third-party catastrophe loss models for hurricane loss events were
updated to incorporate medium-term forecasts of increased hurricane frequency and severity. In
addition, changing climate conditions, primarily rising global temperatures, may be increasing, or
may in the future increase, the frequency and severity of natural catastrophes such as hurricanes.
Our life insurance operations are also exposed to risk of loss from catastrophes. For example,
natural or man-made disasters or a disease pandemic such as could arise from avian flu, could
significantly increase our mortality and morbidity experience. Policyholders may be unable to meet
their obligations to pay premiums on our insurance policies or make deposits on our investment
products. Our liquidity could be constrained by a catastrophe, or multiple catastrophes, which
could result in extraordinary losses or a further downgrade of our
debt or financial strength ratings from their levels as of
February 10, 2009. In
addition, in part because accounting rules do not permit insurers to reserve for such catastrophic
events until they occur, claims from catastrophic events could have a material adverse effect on
our financial condition, consolidated results of operations and cash flows.

Competitive activity may adversely affect our market share and financial results, which could have
a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

The insurance industry is highly competitive. Our competitors include other insurers and, because
many of our products include an investment component, securities firms, investment advisers, mutual
funds, banks and other financial institutions. In recent years, there has been substantial
consolidation and convergence among companies in the insurance and financial services industries
resulting in increased competition from large, well-capitalized insurance and financial services
firms that market products and services similar to ours. The current economic environment has only
served to further increase competition. Many of these firms also have been able to increase their
distribution systems through mergers or contractual arrangements. These competitors compete with
us for producers such as brokers and independent agents and for our employees. Larger competitors
may have lower operating costs and an ability to absorb greater risk while maintaining their
financial strength ratings, thereby allowing them to price their products more competitively.
These highly competitive pressures could result in increased pricing pressures on a number of our
products and services, particularly as competitors seek to win market share, and may harm our
ability to maintain or increase our profitability. In addition, as actual or potential future
downgrades occur, and if our competitors have not been similarly downgraded, sales of our products
could be significantly reduced. Because of the highly competitive nature of the insurance
industry, there can be no assurance that we will continue to effectively compete with our industry
rivals, or that competitive pressure will not have a material adverse effect on our business,
results of operations and financial condition.



We may experience unfavorable judicial or legislative developments that could have a material
adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.

The Hartford is involved in claims litigation arising in the ordinary course of business, both as a
liability insurer defending or providing indemnity for third-party claims brought against insureds
and as an insurer defending coverage claims brought against it. The Hartford accounts for such
activity through the establishment of unpaid loss and loss adjustment expense reserves. The
Company is also involved in legal actions that do not arise in the ordinary course of business,
some of which assert claims for substantial amounts. Pervasive or dramatic changes in the judicial
environment relating to matters such as trends in the size of jury awards, developments in the law
relating to the liability of insurers or tort defendants, and rulings concerning the availability
or amount of certain types of damages could cause our ultimate liabilities to change from our
current expectations. Similarly, changes in federal or state tort litigation laws or other
applicable laws could have the same effect. It is not possible to predict changes in the judicial
and legislative environment and their impact on the future development of the adequacy of our loss
reserves, particularly reserves for longer-tailed lines of business, including asbestos and
environmental reserves. Similarly, changes in the judicial and legislative environment can
adversely affect our ability to price our products. To the extent that judicial or legislative
developments cause our ultimate liabilities to increase from our current expectations, they could
have a material adverse effect on the Company’s consolidated results of operations, financial
condition and liquidity.

Potential changes in domestic and foreign regulation may increase our business costs and required
capital levels, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated operating
results, financial condition and liquidity.

We are subject to extensive laws and regulations. These laws and regulations are complex and
subject to change. Moreover, they are administered and enforced by a number of different
governmental authorities and non-governmental self-regulatory agencies, including foreign
regulators, state insurance regulators, state securities administrators, the Securities and
Exchange Commission, the New York Stock Exchange, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, the
U.S. Department of Justice, the Office of Thrift Supervision, if our application for the U.S.
Treasury Department’s Capital Purchase Program is approved, and state attorneys general, each of
which exercises a degree of interpretive latitude. Consequently, we are subject to the risk that
compliance with any particular regulator’s or enforcement authority’s interpretation of a legal
issue may not result in compliance with another regulator’s or enforcement authority’s
interpretation of the same issue, particularly when compliance is judged in hindsight. In
addition, there is risk that any particular regulator’s or enforcement authority’s interpretation
of a legal issue may change over time to our detriment, or that changes in the overall legal
environment, even absent any change of interpretation by any particular regulator or enforcement
authority, may cause us to change our views regarding the actions we need to take from a legal
risk management perspective, which could necessitate changes to our practices that may, in some
cases, limit our ability to grow and improve the profitability of our business.

State insurance laws regulate most aspects of our U.S. insurance businesses, and our insurance
subsidiaries are regulated by the insurance departments of the states in which they are domiciled,
licensed or authorized to conduct business. U.S. state laws grant insurance regulatory authorities
broad administrative powers with respect to, among other things:

•

licensing companies and agents to transact business;

•

calculating the value of assets to determine compliance with statutory requirements;

•

mandating certain insurance benefits;

•

regulating certain premium rates;

•

reviewing and approving policy forms;

•

regulating unfair trade and claims practices, including through the imposition of
restrictions on marketing and sales practices, distribution arrangements and payment of
inducements;

•

establishing statutory capital and reserve requirements and solvency standards;

•

fixing maximum interest rates on insurance policy loans and minimum rates for guaranteed
crediting rates on life insurance policies and annuity contracts;

•

approving changes in control of insurance companies;

•

restricting the payment of dividends and other transactions between affiliates;

•

establishing assessments and surcharges for guaranty funds, second-injury funds and other
mandatory pooling arrangements;

•

requiring insurers to dividend to policy holders any excess profits; and

•

regulating the types, amounts and valuation of investments.



State insurance regulators and the National Association of Insurance Commissioners, or NAIC,
regularly re-examine existing laws and regulations applicable to insurance companies and their
products. Our international operations are subject to regulation in the relevant jurisdictions in
which they operate, which in many ways is similar to the state regulation outlined above, with
similar related restrictions. Our asset management businesses are also subject to extensive
regulation in the various jurisdictions where they operate. These laws and regulations are
primarily intended to protect investors in the securities markets or investment advisory clients
and generally grant supervisory authorities broad administrative powers. Changes in these laws and
regulations, or in the interpretations thereof, are often made for the benefit of the consumer at
the expense of the insurer and thus could have a material adverse effect on our business,
consolidated operating results, financial condition and liquidity. Compliance with these laws and
regulations is also time consuming and personnel-intensive, and changes in these laws and
regulations may increase materially our direct and indirect compliance costs and other expenses of
doing business, thus having an adverse effect on our business, consolidated operating results,
financial condition and liquidity.

We may experience difficulty in marketing and distributing products through our current and future
distribution channels.

We distribute our annuity, life and certain property and casualty insurance products through a
variety of distribution channels, including brokers, independent agents, broker-dealers, banks,
wholesalers, affinity partners, our own internal sales force and other third-party organizations.
In some areas of our business, we generate a significant portion of our business through individual
third-party arrangements. For example, we generated approximately 71% of our personal lines earned
premium in 2008 under an exclusive licensing arrangement with AARP that continues until January 1,
2020. We periodically negotiate provisions and renewals of these relationships, and there can be
no assurance that such terms will remain acceptable to us or such third parties. An interruption
in our continuing relationship with certain of these third parties could materially affect our
ability to market our products and could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results
and financial condition.

Our
business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity may be adversely affected by
the emergence of unexpected and unintended claim and coverage issues.

As industry practices and legal, judicial, social and other environmental conditions change,
unexpected and unintended issues related to claims and coverage may emerge. These issues may
either extend coverage beyond our underwriting intent or increase the frequency or severity of
claims. In some instances, these changes may not become apparent until some time after we have
issued insurance contracts that are affected by the changes. As a result, the full extent of
liability under our insurance contracts may not be known for many years after a contract is issued,
and this liability may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations,
financial condition and liquidity at the time it becomes known.

Limits
on the ability of our insurance subsidiaries to pay dividends to us
could have a material adverse effect on our
liquidity.

The Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc. is a holding company with no significant operations.
Our principal asset is the stock of our insurance subsidiaries. State insurance regulatory
authorities limit the payment of dividends by insurance subsidiaries. These restrictions and other regulatory requirements affect the ability of our insurance
subsidiaries to make dividend payments. Limits on the ability of the insurance subsidiaries to pay
dividends could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, including our ability to pay
dividends to shareholders and service our debt.

As a property and casualty insurer, the premium rates we are able to charge and the profits we are
able to obtain are affected by the actions of state insurance departments that regulate our
business, the cyclical nature of the business in which we compete and our ability to adequately
price the risks we underwrite, which may have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results
of operations, financial condition and cash flows.

Pricing adequacy depends on a number of factors, including the ability to obtain regulatory
approval for rate changes, proper evaluation of underwriting risks, the ability to project future
loss cost frequency and severity based on historical loss experience adjusted for known trends, our
response to rate actions taken by competitors, and expectations about regulatory and legal
developments and expense levels. We seek to price our property and casualty insurance policies
such that insurance premiums and future net investment income earned on premiums received will
provide for an acceptable profit in excess of underwriting expenses and the cost of paying claims.

State insurance departments that regulate us often propose premium rate changes for the benefit of
the consumer at the expense of the insurer and may not allow us to reach targeted levels of
profitability. In addition to regulating rates, certain states have enacted laws that require a
property and casualty insurer conducting business in that state to participate in assigned risk
plans, reinsurance facilities, joint underwriting associations and other residual market plans, or
to offer coverage to all consumers and often restrict an insurer’s ability to charge the price it
might otherwise charge. In these markets, we may be compelled to underwrite significant amounts of
business at lower than desired rates, participate in the operating losses of residual market plans
or pay assessments to fund operating deficits of state-sponsored funds, possibly leading to an
unacceptable returns on equity. The laws and regulations of many states also limit an insurer’s
ability to withdraw from one or more lines of insurance in the state, except pursuant to a plan
that is approved by the state’s insurance department. Additionally, certain states require
insurers to participate in guaranty funds for impaired or insolvent insurance companies. These
funds periodically assess losses against all insurance companies doing business in the state. Any
of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations.



Additionally, the property and casualty insurance market is historically cyclical, experiencing
periods characterized by relatively high levels of price competition, less restrictive underwriting
standards and relatively low premium rates, followed by periods of relatively low levels of
competition, more selective underwriting standards and relatively high premium rates. Prices tend
to increase for a particular line of business when insurance carriers have incurred significant
losses in that line of business in the recent past or when the industry as a whole commits less of
its capital to writing exposures in that line of business. Prices tend to decrease when recent
loss experience has been favorable or when competition among insurance carriers increases. In a
number of product lines and states, we continue to experience premium rate reductions. In these
product lines and states, there is a risk that the premium we charge may ultimately prove to be
inadequate as reported losses emerge. Even in a period of rate increases, there is a risk that
regulatory constraints, price competition or incorrect pricing assumptions could prevent us from
achieving targeted returns. Inadequate pricing could have a material adverse effect on our
consolidated results of operations.

If we are unable to maintain the availability of our systems and safeguard the security of our data
due to the occurrence of disasters or other unanticipated events, our ability to conduct business
may be compromised, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated results
of operations, financial condition or cash flows.

We use computer systems to store, retrieve, evaluate and utilize customer and company data and
information. Our computer, information technology and telecommunications systems, in turn,
interface with and rely upon third-party systems. Our business is highly dependent on our ability,
and the ability of certain affiliated third parties, to access these systems to perform necessary
business functions, including, without limitation, providing insurance quotes, processing premium
payments, making changes to existing policies, filing and paying claims, administering variable
annuity products and mutual funds, providing customer support and managing our investment
portfolios. Systems failures or outages could compromise our ability to perform these functions in
a timely manner, which could harm our ability to conduct business and hurt our relationships with
our business partners and customers. In the event of a disaster such as a natural catastrophe, an
industrial accident, a blackout, a computer virus, a terrorist attack or war, our systems may be
inaccessible to our employees, customers or business partners for an extended period of time. Even
if our employees are able to report to work, they may be unable to perform their duties for an
extended period of time if our data or systems are disabled or destroyed. Our systems could also
be subject to physical and electronic break-ins, and subject to similar disruptions from
unauthorized tampering with our systems. This may impede or interrupt our business operations and
may have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated operating results, financial
condition or liquidity.

If we experience difficulties arising from outsourcing relationships, our ability to conduct
business may be compromised.

We outsource certain technology and business functions to third parties and expect to do so
selectively in the future. If we do not effectively develop and implement our outsourcing
strategy, third-party providers do not perform as anticipated, or we experience problems with a
transition, we may experience operational difficulties, increased costs and a loss of business that
may have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations.

Potential changes in federal or state tax laws, including changes impacting the availability of the
separate account dividend received deduction, could adversely affect our business, consolidated
operating results or financial condition or liquidity.

Many of the products that the Company sells benefit from one or more forms of tax-favored status
under current federal and state income tax regimes. For example, the Company sells life insurance
policies that benefit from the deferral or elimination of taxation on earnings accrued under the
policy, as well as permanent exclusion of certain death benefits that may be paid to policyholders’
beneficiaries. We also sell annuity contracts that allow the policyholders to defer the recognition
of taxable income earned within the contract. Other products that the Company sells also enjoy
similar, as well as other, types of tax advantages. The Company also benefits from certain tax
benefits, including but not limited to, tax-exempt bond interest, dividends-received deductions,
tax credits (such as foreign tax credits), and insurance reserve deductions.

There is risk that federal and/or state tax legislation could be enacted that would lessen or
eliminate some or all of the tax advantages currently benefiting the Company or its policyholders.
This could occur in the context of deficit reduction or other tax reforms. The effects of any such
changes could result in materially lower product sales, lapses of policies currently held, and/or
our incurrence of materially higher corporate taxes.

We may not be able to protect our intellectual property and may be subject to infringement claims.

We rely on a combination of contractual rights and copyright, trademark, patent and trade secret
laws to establish and protect our intellectual property. Although we use a broad range of measures
to protect our intellectual property rights, third parties may infringe or misappropriate our
intellectual property. We may have to litigate to enforce and protect our copyrights, trademarks,
patents, trade secrets and know-how or to determine their scope, validity or enforceability, which
represents a diversion of resources that may be significant in amount and may not prove successful.
The loss of intellectual property protection or the inability to secure or enforce the protection
of our intellectual property assets could have a material adverse effect on our business and our
ability to compete.

We also may be subject to costly litigation in the event that another party alleges our operations
or activities infringe upon another party’s intellectual property rights. Third parties may have,
or may eventually be issued, patents that could be infringed by our products, methods, processes or
services. Any party that holds such a patent could make a claim of infringement against us. We may
also be subject to claims by third parties for breach of copyright, trademark, trade secret or
license usage rights. Any such claims and any resulting litigation could result in significant
liability for damages. If we were found to have infringed a third-party patent or other
intellectual property rights, we could incur substantial liability, and in some circumstances could
be enjoined from providing certain products or services to our customers or utilizing and
benefiting from certain methods, processes, copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets or licenses, or
alternatively could be required to enter into costly licensing arrangements with third parties, all
of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial
condition.



Item 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS

None.

Item 2. PROPERTIES

The Hartford owns the land and buildings comprising its Hartford location and other properties
within the greater Hartford, Connecticut area which total approximately 2.1 million of the 2.5
million square feet owned by the Company in the aggregate. In addition, The Hartford leases
approximately 5.7 million square feet throughout the United States of America and approximately 1.1
million square feet in other countries. All of the properties owned or leased are used by one or
more of all eleven reporting segments, depending on the location. For more information on
reporting segments, see Part I, Item 1, Business of The Hartford – Reporting Segments. The Company
believes its properties and facilities are suitable and adequate for current operations.

Item 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

The Hartford is involved in claims litigation arising in the ordinary course of business, both as a
liability insurer defending or providing indemnity for third-party claims brought against insureds
and as an insurer defending coverage claims brought against it. The Hartford accounts for such
activity through the establishment of unpaid loss and loss adjustment expense reserves. Subject to
the uncertainties discussed below under the caption “Asbestos and Environmental Claims,” management
expects that the ultimate liability, if any, with respect to such ordinary-course claims
litigation, after consideration of provisions made for potential losses and costs of defense, will
not be material to the consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash flows of The
Hartford.

The Hartford is also involved in other kinds of legal actions, some of which assert claims for
substantial amounts. These actions include, among others, putative state and federal class actions
seeking certification of a state or national class. Such putative class actions have alleged, for
example, underpayment of claims or improper underwriting practices in connection with various kinds
of insurance policies, such as personal and commercial automobile, property, life and inland
marine; improper sales practices in connection with the sale of life insurance and other investment
products; and improper fee arrangements in connection with mutual funds and structured settlements.
The Hartford also is involved in individual actions in which punitive damages are sought, such as
claims alleging bad faith in the handling of insurance claims. Like many other insurers, The
Hartford also has been joined in actions by asbestos plaintiffs asserting, among other things, that
insurers had a duty to protect the public from the dangers of asbestos and that insurers committed
unfair trade practices by asserting defenses on behalf of their policyholders in the underlying
asbestos cases. Management expects that the ultimate liability, if any, with respect to such
lawsuits, after consideration of provisions made for estimated losses, will not be material to the
consolidated financial condition of The Hartford. Nonetheless, given the large or indeterminate
amounts sought in certain of these actions, and the inherent unpredictability of litigation, an
adverse outcome in certain matters could, from time to time, have a material adverse effect on the
Company’s consolidated results of operations or cash flows in particular quarterly or annual
periods.

Broker Compensation Litigation –

Following the New York Attorney General’s filing of a civil
complaint against Marsh & McLennan Companies, Inc., and Marsh, Inc. (collectively, “Marsh”) in
October 2004 alleging that certain insurance companies, including The Hartford, participated with
Marsh in arrangements to submit inflated bids for business insurance and paid contingent
commissions to ensure that Marsh would direct business to them, private plaintiffs brought several
lawsuits against the Company predicated on the allegations in the Marsh complaint, to which the
Company was not party. Among these is a multidistrict litigation in the United States District
Court for the District of New Jersey. There are two consolidated amended complaints filed in the
multidistrict litigation, one related to conduct in connection with the sale of property-casualty
insurance and the other related to alleged conduct in connection with the sale of group benefits
products. The Company and various of its subsidiaries are named in both complaints. The
complaints assert, on behalf of a putative class of persons who purchased insurance through broker
defendants, claims under the Sherman Act, the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act
(“RICO”), state law, and in the case of the group-benefits products complaint, claims under ERISA.
The claims are predicated upon allegedly undisclosed or otherwise improper payments of contingent
commissions to the broker defendants to steer business to the insurance company defendants. The
district court has dismissed the Sherman Act and RICO claims in both complaints for failure to
state a claim and has granted the defendants’ motions for summary judgment on the ERISA claims in
the group-benefits products complaint. The district court further has declined to exercise
supplemental jurisdiction over the state law claims, has dismissed those state law claims without
prejudice, and has closed both cases. The plaintiffs have appealed the dismissal of the claims in
both consolidated amended complaints, except the ERISA claims.



The Company is also a defendant in two consolidated securities actions and two consolidated
derivative actions filed in the United States District Court for the District of Connecticut. The
consolidated securities actions assert claims on behalf of a putative class of shareholders
alleging that the Company and certain of its executive officers violated Section 10(b) of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 by failing to disclose to the investing public that
The Hartford’s business and growth was predicated on the unlawful activity alleged in the New York
Attorney General’s complaint against Marsh. The consolidated derivative actions, brought by
shareholders on behalf of the Company against its directors and an additional executive officer,
allege that the defendants knew adverse non-public information about the activities alleged in the
Marsh complaint and concealed and misappropriated that information to make profitable stock trades
in violation of their duties to the Company. Defendants filed a motion to dismiss the consolidated
derivative actions in May 2005. Those proceedings are stayed by agreement of the parties. In July
2006, the district court granted defendants’ motion to dismiss the consolidated securities actions,
and the plaintiffs appealed. In November 2008, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second
Circuit vacated the decision and remanded the case to the district court. The Company will renew
its motion to dismiss with respect to issues that the district court did not address in the prior
ruling.

In September 2007, the Ohio Attorney General filed a civil action in Ohio state court alleging that
certain insurance companies, including The Hartford, conspired with Marsh in violation of Ohio’s
antitrust statute. The trial court denied defendants’ motion to dismiss the complaint in July
2008. The Company disputes the allegations and intends to defend this action vigorously.

Investment And Savings Plan ERISA Class Action Litigation

– In November and December 2008,
following a decline in the share price of the Company’s common stock, seven putative class action
lawsuits were filed in the United States District Court for the District of Connecticut on behalf
of certain participants in the Company’s Investment and Savings Plan (“the Plan”), which offers the
Company’s common stock as one of many investment options. These lawsuits allege that the Company
and certain of its officers and employees violated ERISA by allowing the Plan’s participants to
invest in the Company’s common stock and by failing to disclose to the Plan’s participants
information about the Company’s financial condition. These lawsuits seek restitution or damages
for losses arising from the investment of the Plan’s assets in the Company’s common stock during
the alleged class periods. The cases have been consolidated. The Company disputes the allegations
and intends to defend the actions vigorously.

Fair Credit Reporting Act Class Action

– In February 2007, the United States District Court for the
District of Oregon gave final approval of the Company’s settlement of a lawsuit brought on behalf
of a class of homeowners and automobile policy holders alleging that the Company willfully violated
the Fair Credit Reporting Act by failing to send appropriate notices to new customers whose initial
rates were higher than they would have been had the customer had a more favorable credit report.
The settlement was made on a claim-in, nationwide-class basis and required eligible class members
to return valid claim forms postmarked no later than June 28, 2007. The Company has paid $84.3 to
eligible claimants in connection with the settlement. The Company has sought reimbursement from
the Company’s Excess Professional Liability Insurance Program for the portion of the settlement in
excess of the Company’s $10 self-insured retention. Certain insurance carriers participating in
that program have disputed coverage for the settlement, and one of the excess insurers has
commenced an arbitration to resolve the dispute. Management believes it is probable that the
Company’s coverage position ultimately will be sustained.

Call-Center Patent Litigation

– In June 2007, the holder of twenty-one patents related to automated
call flow processes, Ronald A. Katz Technology Licensing, LP (“Katz”), brought an action against
the Company and various of its subsidiaries in the United States District Court for the Southern
District of New York. The action alleges that the Company’s call centers use automated processes
that willfully infringe the Katz patents. Katz previously has brought similar patent-infringement
actions against a wide range of other companies, none of which has reached a final adjudication of
the merits of the plaintiff’s claims, but many of which have resulted in settlements under which
the defendants agreed to pay licensing fees. The case was transferred to a multidistrict
litigation in the United States District Court for the Central District of California, which is
currently presiding over other Katz patent cases. In August 2008, the Company reached a settlement
under which the Company purchased a license under the patent portfolio held by Katz in exchange for
a payment of an immaterial amount.

Asbestos and Environmental Claims

– As discussed in Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations under the caption “Other Operations (Including
Asbestos and Environmental Claims)”, The Hartford continues to receive asbestos and environmental
claims that involve significant uncertainty regarding policy coverage issues. Regarding these
claims, The Hartford continually reviews its overall reserve levels and reinsurance coverages, as
well as the methodologies it uses to estimate its exposures. Because of the significant
uncertainties that limit the ability of insurers and reinsurers to estimate the ultimate reserves
necessary for unpaid losses and related expenses, particularly those related to asbestos, the
ultimate liabilities may exceed the currently recorded reserves. Any such additional liability
cannot be reasonably estimated now but could be material to The Hartford’s consolidated operating
results, financial condition and liquidity.

In June 2008, The Hartford’s Board of Directors authorized an incremental $1 billion stock
repurchase program which was in addition to the previously announced $2 billion program. The
Company’s repurchase authorization permits purchases of common stock, which may be in the open
market or through privately negotiated transactions. The Company also may enter into derivative
transactions to facilitate future repurchases of common stock. The timing of any future
repurchases will be dependent upon several factors, including the market price of the Company’s
securities, the Company’s capital position, consideration of the effect of any repurchases on the
Company’s financial strength or credit ratings, the Company’s potential participation in the CPP,
and other corporate considerations. The repurchase program may be modified, extended or terminated
by the Board of Directors at any time. As of December 31, 2008, The Hartford has completed the $2
billion stock repurchase program and has $807 remaining for stock repurchase under the $1 billion
repurchase program.

Total revenues of The Hartford are impacted by net investment income and mark-to-market effects of equity securities held for trading
supporting the international variable annuity business, which have corresponding amounts credited to policyholders within benefits
losses and loss adjustment expenses. 2008 revenues include net investment losses on equity securities held for trading of $10.3
billion. Also included in 2008 revenues are net realized capital losses of $5.9 billion.

[2]

2008 includes net realized capital losses of $3.6 billion, after-tax, including $2.5 billion, after-tax, in impairments.

2004 includes a $216 tax benefit related to agreement with the IRS on the resolution of matters pertaining to tax years prior to 2004.

[3]

2004 includes a $23 after-tax charge related to the cumulative effect of accounting change for the Company’s adoption of the American
Institute of Certified Public Accountants (“AICPA”) issued Statement of Position 03-1, “Accounting and Reporting by Insurance
Enterprises for Certain Nontraditional Long-Duration Contracts and for Separate Accounts”.

[4]

Due to the net loss for the year ended December 31, 2008, no allocation of the net loss was made to the preferred shareholders under
the two-class method in the calculation of basic earnings per share, as the preferred shareholders had no contractual obligation to
fund the net losses of the Company. In the absence of the net loss, any such income would be allocated to the preferred shareholders
based on the weighted average number of preferred shares outstanding as of December 31, 2008.

As a result of the net loss in the year ended December 31, 2008, FASB No.128, “Earnings per
Share” (“SFAS 128”) requires the Company to use basic weighted average common shares outstanding
in the calculation of the year ended December 31, 2008 diluted earnings (loss) per share, since
the inclusion of the assumed conversion of convertible preferred shares to common of 5.0 and
shares for stock compensation plans of 1.3 would have been antidilutive to the earnings per
share calculation. In the absence of the net loss, weighted average common shares outstanding
and dilutive potential common shares would have totaled 313.0.

[5]

Mutual funds are owned by the shareholders of those funds and not by the Company. As a
result, they are not reflected in total assets in the Company’s balance sheet.

OVERVIEW

The Hartford is an insurance and financial services company with operations dating back to 1810.
The Company is headquartered in Connecticut and is organized into two major operations: Life and
Property & Casualty, each containing reporting segments. Within the Life and Property & Casualty
operations, The Hartford conducts business principally in eleven reporting segments. Corporate
primarily includes the Company’s debt financing and related interest expense, as well as other
capital raising activities and purchase accounting adjustments.

Life is organized into four groups which are comprised of six reporting segments: The Retail
Products Group (“Retail”) and Individual Life segments make up the Individual Markets Group. The
Retirement Plans and Group Benefits segments make up the Employer Markets Group. The Institutional
Solutions Group (“Institutional”) and International segments each make up their own group. Through
Life the Company provides retail and institutional investment products such as variable and fixed
annuities, mutual funds, private placement life insurance and retirement plan services, individual
life insurance products including variable universal life, universal life, interest sensitive whole
life and term life; and group benefit products, such as group life and group disability insurance.

Property & Casualty is organized into five reporting segments: the underwriting segments of
Personal Lines, Small Commercial, Middle Market and Specialty Commercial (collectively “Ongoing
Operations”), and the Other Operations segment. Through Property & Casualty the Company provides a
number of coverages, as well as insurance-related services, to businesses throughout the United
States, including workers’ compensation, property, automobile, liability, umbrella, specialty
casualty, marine, livestock, fidelity and surety, professional liability and director’s and
officer’s liability coverages. Property & Casualty also provides automobile, homeowners, and
home-based business coverage to individuals throughout the United States, as well as
insurance-related services to businesses.

Many of the principal factors that drive the profitability of The Hartford’s Life and Property &
Casualty operations are separate and distinct. To present its operations in a more meaningful and
organized way, management has included separate overviews within the Life and Property & Casualty
sections of the MD&A. For further overview of Life’s profitability and analysis, see page 70. For
further overview of Property & Casualty’s profitability and
analysis, see page 94.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES

The preparation of financial statements, in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”), requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent
assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues
and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ, and in the past have
differed, from those estimates.

The Company has identified the following estimates as critical in that they involve a higher degree
of judgment and are subject to a significant degree of variability: property and casualty reserves,
net of reinsurance; life estimated gross profits used in the valuation and amortization of assets
and liabilities associated with variable annuity and other universal life-type contracts; living
benefits required to be fair valued; valuation of investments and derivative instruments;
evaluation of other-than-temporary impairments on available-for-sale securities; pension and other
postretirement benefit obligations; contingencies relating to corporate litigation and regulatory
matters; and goodwill impairment. In developing these estimates management makes subjective and
complex judgments that are inherently uncertain and subject to material change as facts and
circumstances develop. Although variability is inherent in these estimates, management believes
the amounts provided are appropriate based upon the facts available upon compilation of the
financial statements.

Property and Casualty Reserves, Net of Reinsurance

The Hartford establishes property and casualty reserves to provide for the estimated costs of
paying claims under insurance policies written by the Company. These reserves include estimates
for both claims that have been reported and those that have not yet been reported, and include
estimates of all expenses associated with processing and settling these claims. Estimating the
ultimate cost of future losses and loss adjustment expenses is an uncertain and complex process.
This estimation process is based largely on the assumption that past developments are an
appropriate predictor of future events and involves a variety of actuarial techniques that analyze
experience, trends and other relevant factors. Reserve estimates can change over time because of
unexpected changes in the external environment. Potential external factors include (1) changes in
the inflation rate for goods and services related to covered damages such as medical care, hospital
care, auto parts, wages and home repair, (2) changes in the general economic environment that could
cause unanticipated changes in the claim frequency per unit insured, (3) changes in the litigation
environment as evidenced by changes in claimant attorney representation in the claims negotiation
and settlement process, (4) changes in the judicial environment regarding the interpretation of
policy provisions relating to the determination of coverage and/or the amount of damages awarded
for certain types of damages, (5) changes in the social environment regarding the general attitude
of juries in the determination of liability and damages, (6) changes in the legislative environment
regarding the definition of damages and (7) new types of injuries caused by new types of injurious
exposure: past examples include breast implants, lead paint and construction defects. Reserve
estimates can also change over time because of changes in internal company operations. Potential
internal factors include (1) periodic changes in claims handling procedures, (2) growth in new
lines of business where exposure and loss development patterns are not well established or (3)
changes in the quality of risk selection in the underwriting process. In the case of assumed
reinsurance, all of the above risks apply. In addition, changes in ceding company case reserving
and reporting patterns can create additional factors that need to be considered in estimating the
reserves. Due to the inherent complexity of the assumptions used, final claim settlements may vary
significantly from the present estimates, particularly when those settlements may not occur until
well into the future.



Through both facultative and treaty reinsurance agreements, the Company cedes a share of the risks
it has underwritten to other insurance companies. The Company’s net reserves for loss and loss
adjustment expenses include anticipated recovery from reinsurers on unpaid claims. The estimated
amount of the anticipated recovery, or reinsurance recoverable, is net of an allowance for
uncollectible reinsurance.

Reinsurance recoverables include an estimate of the amount of gross loss and loss adjustment
expense reserves that may be ceded under the terms of the reinsurance agreements, including
incurred but not reported unpaid losses. The Company calculates its ceded reinsurance projection
based on the terms of any applicable facultative and treaty reinsurance, including an estimate of
how incurred but not reported losses will ultimately be ceded by reinsurance agreement.
Accordingly, the Company’s estimate of reinsurance recoverables is subject to similar risks and
uncertainties as the estimate of the gross reserve for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses.

The Company provides an allowance for uncollectible reinsurance, reflecting management’s best
estimate of reinsurance cessions that may be uncollectible in the future due to reinsurers’
unwillingness or inability to pay. The Company analyzes recent developments in commutation
activity between reinsurers and cedants, recent trends in arbitration and litigation outcomes in
disputes between reinsurers and cedants and the overall credit quality of the Company’s reinsurers.
Where its contracts permit, the Company secures future claim obligations with various forms of
collateral, including irrevocable letters of credit, secured trusts, funds held accounts and
group-wide offsets. The allowance for uncollectible reinsurance was $379 as of December 31, 2008,
including $254 related to Other Operations and $125 related to Ongoing Operations.

Due to the inherent uncertainties as to collection and the length of time before reinsurance
recoverables become due, it is possible that future adjustments to the Company’s reinsurance
recoverables, net of the allowance, could be required, which could have a material adverse effect
on the Company’s consolidated results of operations or cash flows in a particular quarter or annual
period.

The Hartford, like other insurance companies, categorizes and tracks its insurance reserves for its
segments by “line of business”, such as property, auto physical damage, auto liability, commercial
multi-peril package business, workers’ compensation, general liability professional liability and
fidelity and surety. Furthermore, The Hartford regularly reviews the appropriateness of reserve
levels at the line of business level, taking into consideration the variety of trends that impact
the ultimate settlement of claims for the subsets of claims in each particular line of business.
In addition, within the Other Operations segment, the Company has reserves for asbestos and
environmental (“A&E”) claims. Adjustments to previously established reserves, which may be
material, are reflected in the operating results of the period in which the adjustment is
determined to be necessary. In the judgment of management, information currently available has
been properly considered in the reserves established for losses and loss adjustment expenses.
Incurred but not reported (“IBNR”) reserves represent the difference between the estimated ultimate
cost of all claims and the actual reported loss and loss adjustment expenses (“reported losses”).
Reported losses represent cumulative loss and loss adjustment expenses paid plus case reserves for
outstanding reported claims. Company actuaries evaluate the total reserves (IBNR and case
reserves) on an accident year basis. An accident year is the calendar year in which a loss is
incurred, or, in the case of claims-made policies, the calendar year in which a loss is reported.

The following table shows loss and loss adjustment expense reserves by line of business and by
operating segment as of December 31, 2008, net of reinsurance:

Reserving for non-A&E reserves within Ongoing and Other Operations

How non-A&E reserves are set

Reserves are set by line of business within the various operating segments. As indicated in the
above table, a single line of business may be written in one or more of the segments. Case
reserves are established by a claims handler on each individual claim and are adjusted as new
information becomes known during the course of handling the claim. Lines of business for which loss
data (e.g., paid losses and case reserves) emerge (i.e., is reported) over a long period of time
are referred to as long-tail lines of business. Lines of business for which loss data emerge more
quickly are referred to as short-tail lines of business. Within the Company’s Ongoing Operations,
the shortest-tail lines of business are property and auto physical damage. The longest tail lines
of business within Ongoing Operations include workers’ compensation, general liability, and
professional liability. Assumed reinsurance, which is within Other Operations, is also long-tail
business.

For short-tail lines of business, emergence of paid loss and case reserves is credible and likely
indicative of ultimate losses. For long-tail lines of business, emergence of paid losses and case
reserves is less credible in the early periods and, accordingly, may not be indicative of ultimate
losses.

An expected loss ratio is used in initially recording the reserves for both short-tail and
long-tail lines of business. This expected loss ratio is determined through a review of prior
accident years’ loss ratios and expected changes to earned pricing, loss costs, mix of business,
ceded reinsurance and other factors that are expected to impact the loss ratio for the current
accident year. For short-tail lines, IBNR for the current accident year is initially recorded as
the product of the expected loss ratio for the period, earned premium for the period and the
proportion of losses expected to be reported in future calendar periods for the current accident
period. For long-tailed lines, IBNR reserves for the current accident year are initially recorded
as the product of the expected loss ratio for the period and the earned premium for the period,
less reported losses for the period.

Company reserving actuaries, who are independent of the business units, regularly review reserves
for both current and prior accident years using the most current claim data. These reserve reviews
incorporate a variety of actuarial methods and judgments and involve rigorous analysis. Most
non-A&E reserves are reviewed fully each quarter, including loss reserves for property, auto
physical damage, auto liability, package business, workers’ compensation, most general liability,
professional liability and fidelity and surety. Other non-A&E reserves are reviewed semi-annually
(twice per year) or annually. These include, but are not limited to, reserves for losses incurred
before 1988, allocated loss adjustment expenses, assumed reinsurance, latent exposures such as
construction defects, unallocated loss adjustment expense and all other non-A&E exposures within
Other Operations. For reserves that are reviewed semi-annually and annually, management monitors
the emergence of paid and reported losses in the intervening quarters to either confirm that its
estimate of ultimate losses should not change or, if necessary, perform a reserve review to
determine whether the reserve estimate should change.

For most lines of business, a variety of actuarial methods are reviewed and the actuaries select
methods and specific assumptions appropriate for each line of business based on the current
circumstances affecting that line of business. These selections incorporate input, as judged by
the reserving actuaries to be appropriate, from claims personnel, pricing actuaries and operating
management on reported loss cost trends and other factors that could affect the reserve estimates.
The output of the reserve reviews are reserve estimates that are referred to herein as the
“actuarial indication”.

The actuarial techniques or methods used primarily include paid and reported loss development,
frequency / severity, expected loss ratio and Bornhuetter-Ferguson techniques. Within any one line
of business, a variety of techniques are used. Within any one line of business, certain methods
are generally given more influence in determining the actuarial indication. The methods that are
given more influence vary within a line of business based primarily on the maturity of the accident
year, the mix of business and the particular internal and external influences impacting the claims
experience or the methods. The following is a discussion of the most common methods used; these
methods are not used for every line of business or every accident year within a line of business.

Paid Development method

. Historical data, organized by accident period and calendar period, is
used to develop paid loss development patterns, which are then applied to current paid losses by
accident period to estimate ultimate losses. The paid development method is also used to estimate
reserves for allocated loss adjustments expenses (“ALAE”).

Paid development techniques do not use information about case reserves and, therefore, are not
affected by changes in case reserving practices. Paid development techniques can, however, be
significantly affected by changes in claim closure patterns. Paid development techniques for
longer-tailed lines are generally less useful for more recent accident years since a low percentage
of ultimate losses are paid to date in early periods of development and small changes in paid
losses can have a large impact on estimated ultimate losses.

Reported Development method.

Historical data, organized by accident period and calendar period, is
used to develop reported loss development patterns, which are then applied to current reported
losses by accident period to estimate ultimate losses. The reported losses used in this analysis
refer to cumulative paid losses plus case reserves and do not include IBNR.

Compared to the paid development technique, the reported development technique has the advantage
that a higher percentage of ultimate losses are reflected in reported losses than in cumulative
paid losses. The reported development technique estimates only the unreported losses rather than
the total unpaid losses. While the reported development technique takes advantage of information
contained in the case reserves, estimates determined from this technique are affected by changes in
case reserving practices.

Both paid and reported development techniques assume that historical development patterns are
predictive of future development patterns.



Frequency / Severity methods

. Historical data is used to develop claim count development patterns
and those patterns are applied to the number of current reported claims to estimate ultimate claim
counts. Estimated ultimate claim counts are multiplied by an estimated average severity (i.e., an
average cost per claim) to calculate estimated ultimate losses. Average severity is estimated by
fitting historical severity data to a trend line and making assumptions about how the current
environment would affect claim severity. In making assumptions about the current environment,
industry data is used where such data is available and appropriate.

The advantage of frequency / severity techniques is that frequency estimates are generally easier
to predict and external information can be used to supplement internal data in making severity
estimates.

Expected Loss Ratio method

. Loss ratios for prior accident years are used to determine the
appropriate expected loss ratio for the current accident year after applying anticipated changes in
rates, pricing and loss costs. The current accident year expected loss ratio is multiplied by
earned premium to calculate estimated ultimate losses.

Expected Loss Ratio techniques are useful for early periods of maturity on long-tailed lines of
business, where very little paid or reported loss information is available.

Bornhuetter-Ferguson method

. This method is a combination of the expected loss ratio method and
the paid development or reported development method, where the paid or reported loss development
method is given more weight as an accident year matures.

Berquist-Sherman method

. This method is used in cases where historical development patterns may be
inappropriate for use in estimating ultimate losses of recent accident years. Under this method,
the pattern of historical reported losses is adjusted for changes in case reserve adequacy and the
pattern of historical paid losses is adjusted for changes in claim settlement rates.

For all lines of business, variations of the above methods are used. Examples of variation within
the paid and reported development methods include:

•

The accident period used may vary (e.g., year, quarter, or month);

•

The Company may analyze the data by coverage (e.g., bodily injury separate from property
damage);

•

There may be adjustments for unusual loss activity;

•

For ALAE, the Company uses patterns of the relationship between paid ALAE and paid losses.

Examples of variation within the frequency /severity methods include:

•

For one sub-set of professional liability business, management estimates frequency, not
through historical claim count development, but through an analysis of the securities class
actions filed and policy listings;

•

For some methods, management projects severity on only open claims;

•

In the commercial liability lines, the Company performs the frequency / severity technique
only on claims over a certain size;

For each line of business, certain methods are given more influence than other methods. The
discussion below gives a general indication of which methods are preferred by line of business.
Because the actuarial estimates are generated at a much finer level of detail than line of business
(e.g., by distribution channel, coverage, accident period), this description should not be assumed
to apply to each coverage and accident year within a line of business. Also, as circumstances
change, the methods that are given more influence will change. For example, for Personal Lines
auto liability claims, reported development techniques are currently given less emphasis in making
estimates for recent accident years because case reserving practices have been changing in the
recent past. If case reserving practices become more stable, reported development techniques may
be given more weight.

Property and Auto Physical Damage.

These lines are fast-developing and paid and reported
development techniques are used. The Company performs and relies primarily on reported development
techniques and frequency/severity and Bornhuetter-Ferguson techniques for the most immature
accident months.

Auto Liability — Personal Lines.

For auto liability, and bodily injury in particular, the Company
performs a greater number of techniques than it does for property and auto physical damage,
including paid and reported development methods, frequency/severity approaches, and
Berquist-Sherman techniques. The Company generally uses the reported development method for older
accident years and the frequency/severity and Berquist-Sherman methods for more recent accident
years. Recent periods are heavily influenced by changes in case reserve practices and changing
disposal rates; the frequency/severity techniques are not affected as much by these changes and the
Berquist-Sherman techniques specifically adjust for changes in case reserve adequacy and claim
disposal rates.

Auto Liability — Commercial Lines, Package Business and Short-Tailed General Liability.

As with
Personal Lines auto liability, the Company performs a variety of techniques, including the paid and
reported development methods and frequency / severity techniques. For older, more mature accident
years, management finds that reported development techniques are best. For more recent accident
years, management typically prefers frequency / severity techniques that allow it to make
assumptions about the frequency of larger claims.

Long-Tailed General Liability, Fidelity and Surety and Large Deductible Workers’ Compensation

. For
these long-tailed lines of business, the Company generally relies on the expected loss ratio,
Bornhuetter-Ferguson and reported development techniques. Management generally weights these
techniques together, relying more heavily on the expected loss ratio method at early ages of
development and more on the reported development method as an accident year matures.



Workers’ Compensation

. Workers’ compensation is the Company’s single largest reserve line of
business and management does the largest amount of actuarial analysis on this line of business.
Methods performed include paid and reported development, variations on expected loss ratio methods,
and an in-depth analysis on the largest states. Paid development patterns are historically very
stable in the Company’s workers’ compensation business, so paid techniques are preferred for older
accident periods. For more recent periods, paid techniques are less predictive of the ultimate
liability since such a low percentage of ultimate losses are paid in early periods of development.
Accordingly, for more recent accident periods, the Company generally relies more heavily on a
state-by-state analysis and the expected loss ratio approach.

Professional Liability.

Reported and paid loss developments patterns for this line tend to be
volatile. Therefore, the Company typically relies on frequency and severity techniques.

Assumed Reinsurance and All Other within Other Operations.

For these lines, management tends to
rely on the reported development techniques. In assumed reinsurance, assumptions are influenced by
information gained from claim and underwriting audits.

Allocated Loss Adjustment Expenses (ALAE).

For some lines of business (e.g., professional
liability and assumed reinsurance), ALAE and losses are analyzed together. For most lines of
business, however, ALAE is analyzed separately, using paid development techniques and an analysis
of the relationship between ALAE and loss payments.

Unallocated Loss Adjustment Expense (ULAE).

ULAE is analyzed separately from loss and ALAE. For
most lines of business, incurred ULAE costs to be paid in the future are projected based on an
expected cost per claim year and the anticipated claim closure pattern and the ratio of paid ULAE
to paid loss.

The final step in the reserve review process involves a comprehensive review by senior reserving
actuaries who apply their judgment and, in concert with senior management, determine the
appropriate level of reserves based on the various information that has been accumulated. Numerous
factors are considered in this determination process including, but not limited to, the assessed
reliability of key loss trends and assumptions that may be significantly influencing the current
actuarial indications, the maturity of the accident year, pertinent trends observed over the recent
past, the level of volatility within a particular line of business, and the improvement or
deterioration of actuarial indications in the current period as compared to the prior periods. In
general, changes are made more quickly to more mature accident years and less volatile lines of
business. Total recorded net reserves, excluding asbestos and
environmental, were higher than the actuarial indication of the
reserves by 3.8% as of December 31, 2008 compared to 2.9% as of
December 31, 2007.

During 2008, there were numerous changes to non-A&E reserve estimates. Among other loss
developments in 2008, these changes included a $156 release of reserves for workers’ compensation
claims, primarily related to accident years 2000 to 2007, a $105 release of general liability
claims, primarily related to accident years 2001 to 2007, and a $75 release of reserves for
professional liability claims related to accident years 2003 through 2006. See “Reserves” within
the Property & Casualty MD&A for further discussion of reserve developments.

Current trends contributing to reserve uncertainty

The Hartford is a multi-line company in the property and casualty business. The Hartford is
therefore subject to reserve uncertainty stemming from a number of conditions, including but not
limited to those noted above, any of which could be material at any point in time for any segment.
Certain issues may become more or less important over time as conditions change. As various market
conditions develop, management must assess whether those conditions constitute a long-term trend
that should result in a reserving action (i.e., increasing or decreasing the reserve).

Within the commercial segments and the Other Operations segment, the Company has exposure to claims
asserted for bodily injury as a result of long-term or continuous exposure to harmful products or
substances. Examples include, but are not limited to, pharmaceutical products, silica and lead
paint. The Company also has exposure to claims from construction defects, where property damage or
bodily injury from negligent construction is alleged. The Company also has exposure to claims
asserted against religious institutions and other organizations relating to molestation or abuse.
Such exposures may involve potentially long latency periods and may implicate coverage in multiple
policy periods. These factors make reserves for such claims more uncertain than other bodily
injury or property damage claims. With regard to these exposures, the Company is monitoring trends
in litigation, the external environment, the similarities to other mass torts and the potential
impact on the Company’s reserves.

In Personal Lines, reserving estimates are generally less variable than for the Company’s other
property and casualty segments. This is largely due to the coverages having relatively shorter
periods of loss emergence. Estimates, however, can still vary due to a number of factors,
including interpretations of frequency and severity trends and their impact on recorded reserve
levels. Severity trends can be impacted by changes in internal claim handling and case reserving
practices in addition to changes in the external environment. These changes in claim practices
increase the uncertainty in the interpretation of case reserve data, which increases the
uncertainty in recorded reserve levels. In addition, the introduction of new products has lead to
a different mix of business by type of insured than the Company experienced in the past. Beginning
in 2004, the Company introduced its Dimensions auto and homeowners product for Agency business and
beginning in 2007, the Company introduced its Next Generation Auto product for AARP customers. In
general, the Company now has a lower proportion of preferred risks than in the past. Such a change
in mix increases the uncertainty of the reserve projections, since historical data and reporting
patterns may not be applicable to the new business.



In both Small Commercial and Middle Market, workers’ compensation is the Company’s single biggest
line of business and the line of business with the longest pattern of loss emergence. Reserve
estimates for workers’ compensation are particularly sensitive to assumptions about medical
inflation and the changing use of medical care procedures. In addition, changes in state
legislative and regulatory environments impact the Company’s estimates. These changes increase the
uncertainty in the application of development patterns. In addition, over the past several
accident years, the Company has experienced favorable claim frequency on workers’ compensation
claims. The Company’s reserve estimates assume that reported losses for recent accident years will
continue to emerge favorably and that severity will not be adversely impacted by the lower volume
of reported claims.

In the Specialty Commercial segment, many lines of insurance, such as excess insurance and large
deductible workers’ compensation insurance, are “long-tail” lines of insurance. For long-tail
lines, the period of time between the incidence of the insured loss and either the reporting of the
claim to the insurer, the settlement of the claim, or the payment of the claim can be substantial,
and in some cases, several years. As a result of this extended period of time for losses to
emerge, reserve estimates for these lines are more uncertain (i.e., more variable) than reserve
estimates for shorter-tail lines of insurance. Estimating required reserve levels for large
deductible workers’ compensation insurance is further complicated by the uncertainty of whether
losses that are attributable to the deductible amount will be paid by the insured; if such losses
are not paid by the insured due to financial difficulties, the Company would be contractually
liable. Another example of reserve variability relates to reserves for directors and officers
insurance. There is potential volatility in the required level of reserves due to the continued
uncertainty regarding the number and severity of class action suits, including uncertainty
regarding the Company’s exposure to losses arising from the collapse of the sub-prime mortgage
market. Additionally, the Company’s exposure to losses under directors and officers insurance
policies is primarily in excess layers, making estimates of loss more complex. The current
financial market turmoil has increased the number of shareholder class action lawsuits against our
insureds or their directors and officers and this trend could continue for some period of time.

Impact of changes in key assumptions on reserve volatility

As stated above, the Company’s practice is to estimate reserves using a variety of methods,
assumptions and data elements. Within its reserve estimation process for reserves other than
asbestos and environmental, the Company does not derive statistical loss distributions or
confidence levels around its reserve estimate and, as a result, does not have reserve range
estimates to disclose.

The reserve estimation process includes explicit assumptions about a number of factors in the
internal and external environment. Across most lines of business, the most important assumptions
are future loss development factors applied to paid or reported losses to date. For most lines,
the reported loss development factor is most important. In workers’ compensation, paid loss
development factors are also important. The trend in loss costs is also a key assumption,
particularly in the most recent accident years, where loss development factors are less credible.

The following discussion includes disclosure of possible variation from current estimates of loss
reserves due to a change in certain key assumptions. Each of the impacts described below is
estimated individually, without consideration for any correlation among key assumptions or among
lines of business. Therefore, it would be inappropriate to take each of the amounts described
below and add them together in an attempt to estimate volatility for the Company’s reserves in
total. The estimated variation in reserves due to changes in key assumptions is a reasonable
estimate of possible variation that may occur in the future, likely over a period of several
calendar years. It is important to note that the variation discussed is not meant to be a
worst-case scenario, and therefore, it is possible that future variation may be more than the
amounts discussed below.

Recorded reserves for auto liability, net of reinsurance, are $2.3 billion across all lines, $1.6
billion of which is in Personal Lines. Personal auto liability reserves are shorter-tailed than
other lines of business (such as workers’ compensation) and, therefore, less volatile. However,
the size of the reserve base means that future changes in estimates could be material to the
Company’s results of operations in any given period. The key assumption for Personal Lines auto
liability is the annual loss cost trend, particularly the severity trend component of loss costs.
A review of Insurance Services Office (“ISO”) data suggests that annual growth in industry severity
since 1999 has varied from +1% to +6%. The ISO data shows recent severity changes to be in the
middle of this range. A 2.5 point change in assumed annual severity is within historical variation
for the industry and for the Company. A 2.5 point change in assumed annual severity for the two
most recent accident years would change the estimated net reserve need by $90, in either direction.
Assumed annual severity for accident years prior to the two most recent accident years is likely
to have minimal variability.

Recorded reserves for workers’ compensation, net of reinsurance, are $6.3 billion in total for
Ongoing Operations. Paid loss development patterns are a key assumption for this line of business,
particularly for more mature accident years. Historically, paid loss development patterns have
been impacted by, among other things, medical cost inflation. The Company has reviewed the
historical variation in reported loss development patterns. If the reported loss development
patterns change by 4%, the estimated net reserve need would change by $400, in either direction. A
4% change in reported loss development patterns is within historical variation, as measured by the
variation around the average development factors as reported in statutory accident year reports.

Recorded reserves for general liability, net of reinsurance, are $2.3 billion in total for Ongoing
Operations. Reported loss development patterns are a key assumption for this line of business,
particularly for more mature accident years. Historically, assumptions on reported loss
development patterns have been impacted by, among other things, emergence of new types of claims
(e.g., construction defect claims) or a shift in the mixture between smaller, more routine claims
and larger, more complex claims. The Company has reviewed the historical variation in reported
loss development patterns. If the reported loss development patterns change by 11%, the estimated
net reserve need would change by $300, in either direction. An 11% change in reported loss
development patterns is within historical variation, as measured by the variation around the
average development factors as reported in statutory accident year reports.



Similar to general liability, assumed casualty reinsurance is affected by reported loss development
pattern assumptions. In addition to the items identified above that would affect both direct and
reinsurance liability claim development patterns, there is also an impact to assumed reporting
patterns for any changes in claim notification from ceding companies to the reinsurer. Recorded net
reserves for HartRe assumed reinsurance business, excluding asbestos and environmental liabilities,
within Other Operations were $562 as of December 31, 2008. If the reported loss development
patterns underlying the Company’s net reserves for HartRe assumed casualty reinsurance change by
10%, the estimated net reserve need would change by $245, in either direction. A 10% change in
reported loss development patterns is within historical variation, as measured by the variation
around the average development factors as reported in statutory accident year reports.

Reserving for Asbestos and Environmental Claims within Other Operations

How A&E reserves are set

The Company continues to receive asbestos and environmental claims. Asbestos claims relate
primarily to bodily injuries asserted by people who came in contact with asbestos or products
containing asbestos. Environmental claims relate primarily to pollution and related clean-up costs.

The Company wrote several different categories of insurance contracts that may cover asbestos and
environmental claims. First, the Company wrote primary policies providing the first layer of
coverage in an insured’s liability program. Second, the Company wrote excess policies providing
higher layers of coverage for losses that exhaust the limits of underlying coverage. Third, the
Company acted as a reinsurer assuming a portion of those risks assumed by other insurers writing
primary, excess and reinsurance coverages. Fourth, subsidiaries of the Company participated in the
London Market, writing both direct insurance and assumed reinsurance business.

In establishing reserves for asbestos claims, the Company evaluates its insureds’ estimated
liabilities for such claims using a ground-up approach. The Company considers a variety of
factors, including the jurisdictions where underlying claims have been brought, past, pending and
anticipated future claim activity, disease mix, past settlement values of similar claims, dismissal
rates, allocated loss adjustment expense, and potential bankruptcy impact.

Similarly, a ground-up exposure review approach is used to establish environmental reserves. The
Company’s evaluation of its insureds’ estimated liabilities for environmental claims involves
consideration of several factors, including historical values of similar claims, the number of
sites involved, the insureds’ alleged activities at each site, the alleged environmental damage at
each site, the respective shares of liability of potentially responsible parties at each site, the
appropriateness and cost of remediation at each site, the nature of governmental enforcement
activities at each site, and potential bankruptcy impact.

Having evaluated its insureds’ probable liabilities for asbestos and/or environmental claims, the
Company then evaluates its insureds’ insurance coverage programs for such claims. The Company
considers its insureds’ total available insurance coverage, including the coverage issued by the
Company. The Company also considers relevant judicial interpretations of policy language and
applicable coverage defenses or determinations, if any.

Evaluation of both the insureds’ estimated liabilities and the Company’s exposure to the insureds
depends heavily on an analysis of the relevant legal issues and litigation environment. This
analysis is conducted by the Company’s lawyers and is subject to applicable privileges.

For both asbestos and environmental reserves, the Company also compares its historical direct net
loss and expense paid and reported experience, and net loss and expense paid and reported
experience year by year, to assess any emerging trends, fluctuations or characteristics suggested
by the aggregate paid and reported activity.

Once the gross ultimate exposure for indemnity and allocated loss adjustment expense is determined
for its insureds by each policy year, the Company calculates its ceded reinsurance projection based
on any applicable facultative and treaty reinsurance and the Company’s experience with reinsurance
collections.

Uncertainties Regarding Adequacy of Asbestos and Environmental Reserves

With regard to both environmental and particularly asbestos claims, significant uncertainty limits
the ability of insurers and reinsurers to estimate the ultimate reserves necessary for unpaid
losses and related expenses. Traditional actuarial reserving techniques cannot reasonably estimate
the ultimate cost of these claims, particularly during periods where theories of law are in flux.
The degree of variability of reserve estimates for these exposures is significantly greater than
for other more traditional exposures. In particular, the Company believes there is a high degree
of uncertainty inherent in the estimation of asbestos loss reserves.

In the case of the reserves for asbestos exposures, factors contributing to the high degree of
uncertainty include inadequate loss development patterns, plaintiffs’ expanding theories of
liability, the risks inherent in major litigation, and inconsistent emerging legal doctrines.
Furthermore, over time, insurers, including the Company, have experienced significant changes in
the rate at which asbestos claims are brought, the claims experience of particular insureds, and
the value of claims, making predictions of future exposure from past experience uncertain.
Plaintiffs and insureds also have sought to use bankruptcy proceedings, including “pre-packaged”
bankruptcies, to accelerate and increase loss payments by insurers. In addition, some
policyholders have asserted new classes of claims for coverages to which an aggregate limit of
liability may not apply. Further uncertainties include insolvencies of other carriers and
unanticipated developments pertaining to the Company’s ability to recover reinsurance for asbestos
and environmental claims. Management believes these issues are not likely to be resolved in the
near future.



In the case of the reserves for environmental exposures, factors contributing to the high degree of
uncertainty include expanding theories of liability and damages, the risks inherent in major
litigation, inconsistent decisions concerning the existence and scope of coverage for environmental
claims, and uncertainty as to the monetary amount being sought by the claimant from the insured.

It is also not possible to predict changes in the legal and legislative environment and their
effect on the future development of asbestos and environmental claims. Although potential Federal
asbestos-related legislation was considered by the Senate in 2006, it is uncertain whether such
legislation will be reconsidered or enacted in the future and, if enacted, what its effect would be
on the Company’s aggregate asbestos liabilities.

The reporting pattern for assumed reinsurance claims, including those related to asbestos and
environmental claims, is much longer than for direct claims. In many instances, it takes months or
years to determine that the policyholder’s own obligations have been met and how the reinsurance in
question may apply to such claims. The delay in reporting reinsurance claims and exposures adds to
the uncertainty of estimating the related reserves.

Given the factors described above, the Company believes the actuarial tools and other techniques it
employs to estimate the ultimate cost of claims for more traditional kinds of insurance exposure
are less precise in estimating reserves for its asbestos and environmental exposures. For this
reason, the Company relies on exposure-based analysis to estimate the ultimate costs of these
claims and regularly evaluates new information in assessing its potential asbestos and
environmental exposures.

A number of factors affect the variability of estimates for asbestos and environmental reserves
including assumptions with respect to the frequency of claims, the average severity of those claims
settled with payment, the dismissal rate of claims with no payment and the expense to indemnity
ratio. The uncertainty with respect to the underlying reserve assumptions for asbestos and
environmental adds a greater degree of variability to these reserve estimates than reserve
estimates for more traditional exposures. While this variability is reflected in part in the size
of the range of reserves developed by the Company, that range may still not be indicative of the
potential variance between the ultimate outcome and the recorded reserves. The recorded net
reserves as of December 31, 2008 of $2.18 billion ($1.90 billion and $275 for asbestos and
environmental, respectively) is within an estimated range, unadjusted for covariance, of $1.80
billion to $2.42 billion. The process of estimating asbestos and environmental reserves remains
subject to a wide variety of uncertainties, which are detailed in Note 12 of Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements. The Company believes that its current asbestos and environmental reserves
are reasonable and appropriate. However, analyses of further developments could cause the Company
to change its estimates and ranges of its asbestos and environmental reserves, and the effect of
these changes could be material to the Company’s consolidated operating results, financial
condition and liquidity. If there are significant developments that affect particular exposures,
reinsurance arrangements or the financial condition of particular reinsurers, the Company will make
adjustments to its reserves or to the amounts recoverable from its reinsurers.

Total Property & Casualty Reserves, Net of Reinsurance

In the opinion of management, based upon the known facts and current law, the reserves recorded for
the Company’s property and casualty businesses at December 31, 2008 represent the Company’s best
estimate of its ultimate liability for losses and loss adjustment expenses related to losses
covered by policies written by the Company. However, because of the significant uncertainties
surrounding reserves, and particularly asbestos exposures, it is possible that management’s
estimate of the ultimate liabilities for these claims may change and that the required adjustment
to recorded reserves could exceed the currently recorded reserves by an amount that could be
material to the Company’s results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.



Life Estimated Gross Profits Used in the Valuation and Amortization of Assets and Liabilities
Associated with Variable Annuity and Other Universal Life-Type Contracts

Accounting Policy and Assumptions

Life’s deferred policy acquisition costs asset and present value of future profits (“PVFP”)
intangible asset (hereafter, referred to collectively as “DAC”) related to investment contracts and
universal life-type contracts (including variable annuities) are amortized in the same way, over
the estimated life of the contracts acquired using the retrospective deposit method. Under the
retrospective deposit method, acquisition costs are amortized in proportion to the present value of
estimated gross profits (“EGPs”). EGPs are also used to amortize other assets and liabilities on
the Company’s balance sheet, such as sales inducement assets and unearned revenue reserves (“URR”).
Components of EGPs are used to determine reserves for guaranteed minimum death, income and
universal life secondary guarantee benefits accounted for and collectively referred to as “SOP 03-1
reserves”. The specific breakdown of the most significant EGP based balances by segment is as
follows:

For most contracts, the Company estimates gross profits over a 20 year horizon as estimated profits
emerging subsequent to that timeframe are immaterial. The Company uses other amortization bases
for amortizing DAC, such as gross costs (net of reinsurance), as a replacement for EGPs when EGPs
are expected to be negative for multiple years of the contract’s life. Actual gross profits, in a
given reporting period, that vary from management’s initial estimates result in increases or
decreases in the rate of amortization, commonly referred to as a “true-up”, which are recorded in
the current period. The true-up recorded for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007, and 2006 was
an increase (decrease) to amortization of $404 (of which $194 is attributed to accelerated DAC
amortization for the Company’s 3Win product in Japan as further discussed under the “Japan Variable
Annuities” section below), $(6), and $41, respectively.



Products sold in a particular year are aggregated into cohorts. Future gross profits for each
cohort are projected over the estimated lives of the underlying contracts, and are, to a large
extent, a function of future account value projections for variable annuity products and to a
lesser extent for variable universal life products. The projection of future account values
requires the use of certain assumptions. The assumptions considered to be important in the
projection of future account value, and hence the EGPs, include separate account fund performance,
which is impacted by separate account fund mix, less fees assessed against the contract holder’s
account balance, surrender and lapse rates, interest margin, mortality, and hedging costs. The
assumptions are developed as part of an annual process and are dependent upon the Company’s current
best estimates of future events. The Company’s current 20 year separate account return assumption
is approximately 7.2% (after fund fees, but before mortality and expense charges) for U.S. products
and 5.1% (after fund fees, but before mortality and expense charges) in aggregate for all Japanese
products, but varies from product to product. The Company estimates gross profits using the mean
of EGPs derived from a set of stochastic scenarios that have been calibrated to our estimated
separate account return. The following table summarizes the general impacts to individual variable
annuity EGPs and earnings for DAC amortization caused by changes in separate account returns,
mortality and future lapse rate assumptions:

In addition to changes to the assumptions described above, changes to other policyholder behaviors
such as resets, partial surrenders, reaction to price increases, and asset allocations could cause
EGPs to fluctuate.

Estimating future gross profits is a complex process requiring considerable judgment and the
forecasting of events well into the future. Given the current volatility in the capital markets
and the evaluation of other factors, the Company will continually evaluate its separate account
return estimation process and may change that process from time to time.

The Company plans to complete a comprehensive assumption study and refine its estimate of future
gross profits during the third quarter of each year. Upon completion of an assumption study, the
Company revises its assumptions to reflect its current best estimate, thereby changing its estimate
of projected account values and the related EGPs in the DAC, sales inducement and unearned revenue
reserve amortization models as well as SOP 03-1 reserving models. The DAC asset, as well as the
sales inducement asset, unearned revenue reserves and SOP 03-1 reserves are adjusted with an
offsetting benefit or charge to income to reflect such changes in the period of the revision, a
process known as “Unlocking”. An Unlock that results in an after-tax benefit generally occurs as a
result of actual experience or future expectations of product profitability being favorable
compared to previous estimates. An Unlock that results in an after-tax charge generally occurs as
a result of actual experience or future expectations of product profitability being unfavorable
compared to previous estimates.



In addition to when a comprehensive assumption study is completed, revisions to best estimate
assumptions used to estimate future gross profits are necessary when the EGPs in the Company’s
models fall outside of an independently determined reasonable range of EGPs. The Company performs
a quantitative process each quarter to determine the reasonable range of EGPs. This process
involves the use of internally developed models, which run a large number of stochastically
determined scenarios of separate account fund performance. Incorporated in each scenario are
assumptions with respect to lapse rates, mortality and expenses, based on the Company’s most recent
assumption study. These scenarios are run for the Company’s individual variable annuity businesses
in the United States and Japan, the Company’s Retirement Plans businesses, and for the Company’s
individual variable universal life business and are used to calculate statistically significant
ranges of reasonable EGPs. The statistical ranges produced from the stochastic scenarios are
compared to the present value of EGPs used in the Company’s models. If EGPs used in the Company’s
models fall outside of the statistical ranges of reasonable EGPs, an “Unlock” would be necessary.
If EGPs used in the Company’s models fall inside of the statistical ranges of reasonable EGPs, the
Company will not solely rely on the results of the quantitative analysis to determine the necessity
of an Unlock. In addition, the Company considers, on a quarterly basis, other qualitative factors
such as product, regulatory and policyholder behavior trends and may also revise EGPs if those
trends are expected to be significant and were not or could not be included in the statistically
significant ranges of reasonable EGPs. As of December 31, 2008, the EGPs used in the Company’s
models fell within the statistical ranges of reasonable EGPs. As a result of this statistical test
and review of qualitative factors, the Company did not “Unlock” the EGPs used in the Company’s
models during the fourth quarter of 2008.

Unlock and Sensitivity Analysis

As described above, as of September 30 2008, the Company completed a comprehensive study of
assumptions underlying EGPs, resulting in an Unlock. The study covered all assumptions, including
mortality, lapses, expenses, interest rate spreads, hedging costs, and separate account returns, in
substantially all product lines. The new best estimate assumptions were applied to the current
policy related in-force or account values to project future gross profits. The after-tax impact on
the Company’s assets and liabilities as a result of the Unlock during the third quarter of 2008 was

As a result of the Unlock, death benefit reserves in Retail, increased $389, pre-tax, offset by an increase of $273,

increase of $25, pre-tax, in reinsurance recoverables.

[2]

The following were the most significant contributors to the Unlock amounts recorded during the third quarter of 2008:

•

Actual separate account returns from the period ending July 31, 2007 to September 30,
2008 were significantly below our aggregated estimated return.

•

The Company reduced its 20 year projected separate account return assumption from 7.8%
to 7.2% in the U.S.

•

In Retirement Plans, the Company reduced its estimate of future fees as plans meet
contractual size limits (“breakpoints”) causing a lower fee schedule to apply and the
Company increased its assumption for future deposits by existing plan participants.

[2]

The following were the most significant contributors to the unlock amounts recorded during the third quarter of 2007:

•

Actual separate account returns were above our aggregated estimated return.

•

During the third quarter of 2007, the Company estimated gross profits using the mean of
EGPs derived from a set of stochastic scenarios that have been calibrated to our estimated
separate account return as compared to prior year where we used a single deterministic
estimation. The impact of this change in estimation was a benefit of $13, after-tax, for
Japan variable annuities and $20, after-tax, for U.S. variable annuities.

•

As part of its continual enhancement to its assumption setting processes and in
connection with its assumption study, the Company included dynamic lapse behavior
assumptions. Dynamic lapses reflect that lapse behavior will be different depending upon
market movements. The impact of this assumption change along with other base lapse rate
changes was an approximate benefit of $40, after-tax, for U.S. variable annuities.

The Company performs sensitivity analyses with respect to the effect certain assumptions have on
EGPs and the related DAC, sales inducement, unearned revenue reserve and SOP 03-1 reserve balances.
Each of the sensitivities illustrated below are estimated individually, without consideration for
any correlation among the key assumptions. Therefore, it would be inappropriate to take each of
the sensitivity amounts below and add them together in an attempt to estimate volatility for the
respective EGP-related balances in total. In addition, the tables below only provide sensitivities
on separate account returns and lapses. While those two assumptions are critical in projecting
EGPs, as described above, many additional assumptions are necessary to project EGPs and to
determine an Unlock amount. As a result, actual Unlock amounts may vary from those calculated by
using the sensitivities below. The following tables depict the estimated sensitivities for U.S.
variable annuities and Japan variable annuities:

U.S. Variable Annuities

Effect on EGP-related

(Increasing separate account returns and decreasing lapse rates generally result in benefits. Decreasing

balances if unlocked

separate account returns and increasing lapse rates generally result in charges.)

(after-tax) [1]

$

20 – $40

[3]

$

10 – $25

[2]

If we changed our future separate account return rate by 1% from our aggregated
estimated future return

$

90 – $120

If we changed our future lapse rate by 1% from our estimated aggregate future lapse rate

$

50 – $80

[2]

Japan Variable Annuities

Effect on EGP-related

(Increasing separate account returns and decreasing lapse rates generally result in benefits. Decreasing

balances if unlocked

separate account returns and increasing lapse rates generally result in charges.)

(after-tax) [1]

If actual separate account returns were 1% above or below our aggregated estimated return

$

[4] [5]

If actual lapse rates were 1% above or below our estimated aggregate lapse rate

$

[2]

If we changed our future separate account return rate by 1% from our aggregated
estimated future return

$

50 – $70

If we changed our future lapse rate by 1% from our estimated aggregate future lapse rate

$

10 – $25

[2]

[1]

These sensitivities are reflective of the results of our 2008 assumption studies. The Company’s EGP models assume that
separate account returns are earned linearly and that lapses occur linearly (except for certain dynamic lapse features)
throughout the year. Similarly, the sensitivities assume that differential separate account and lapse rates are linear and
parallel and persist for one year from September 30, 2008, the date of our third quarter 2008 Unlock, and reflect all
current in-force and account value data, including the corresponding market levels, allocation of funds, policyholder
behavior and actuarial assumptions. These sensitivities are not perfectly linear nor perfectly symmetrical for increases
and decreases. As such, extrapolating results over a wide range will decrease the accuracy of the sensitivities’
predictive ability. Sensitivity results are, in part, based on the current “in-the-moneyness” of various guarantees
offered with the products. Future market conditions could significantly change the sensitivity results.

[2]

Sensitivity around lapses assumes lapses increase or decrease consistently across all cohort years and products.



[3]

The overall actual return generated by the U.S. variable annuity separate accounts is dependent on several factors,
including the relative mix of the underlying sub-accounts among bond funds and equity funds as well as equity sector
weightings and as a result of the large proportion of separate account assets invested in U.S. equity markets, the
Company’s overall U.S. separate account fund performance has been reasonably correlated to the overall performance of the
S&P 500 although no assurance can be provided that this correlation will continue in the future. Since September 30,
2008, the date of the last unlock, the actual return on U.S. variable annuity assets has been 21% below our estimated
aggregate return. The Company estimates the actual return would need to drop by an additional 6% since December 31, 2008,
before EGPs in the Company’s models fall outside of the statistical ranges of reasonable EGPs.

[4]

The overall actual return generated by the Japan variable annuity separate accounts is influenced by the variable annuity
products offered in Japan as well as the wide variety of funds offered within the sub-accounts of those products. The
actual return is also dependent upon the relative mix of the underlying sub-accounts among the funds. Unlike in the U.S.,
there is no global index or market that reasonably correlates with the overall Japan actual separate account fund
performance. Since September 30, 2008, the date of the last unlock, the actual return on Japan variable annuity assets has
been 15.5% below our estimated aggregate return. The Company estimates the actual return would need to drop by an
additional 7.5% since December 31, 2008, before EGPs in the Company’s models fall outside of the statistical ranges of
reasonable EGPs.

[5]

For the Company’s 3Win product in Japan, decreases in the contract holder’s account value (which is partially dependent
upon equity market movements due to fixed contractual investment allocations) of greater than 20% of the initial deposit
require the contract holder to withdraw 80% of their initial deposit without penalty or recover their initial investment
through a payout annuity. The exercise of these options results in an acceleration of the amount of DAC amortization in a
specific reporting period. During the fourth quarter of 2008 approximately 97% of all 3Win contractholders had account
values that fell by 20% or more from their initial deposit. This resulted in accelerated amortization of DAC in the fourth
quarter of 2008 of $194, pre-tax. Further declines in equity markets during 2009 could cause the entire remaining DAC
balance of $11 to be amortized.

An “Unlock” only revises EGPs to reflect current best estimate assumptions. With or without an
Unlock, and even after an Unlock occurs, the Company must also test the aggregate recoverability of
the DAC and sales inducement assets by comparing the existing DAC balance to the present value of
future EGPs. In addition, the Company routinely stress tests its DAC and sales inducement assets
for recoverability against severe declines in its separate account assets, which could occur if the
equity markets experienced a significant sell-off, as the majority of policyholders’ funds in the
separate accounts is invested in the equity market. As of December 31, 2008, the Company believed
U.S. individual and Japan individual variable annuity EGPs could fall, through a combination of
negative market returns, lapses and mortality, by at least 6% and 49%, respectively, before
portions of its DAC and sales inducement assets would be unrecoverable. The extent of the charge
against earnings upon the DAC and sales inducement assets becoming unrecoverable is dependent upon
how much further beyond the thresholds listed above variable annuity EGPs decline. The Company
estimates that for every 1% decline in variable annuity EGPs beyond the thresholds listed above,
the DAC and sales inducements write-off would be $65 and $12, after-tax, for U.S. variable annuity
and Japan variable annuity, respectively. If, at the end of any quarter, the EGPs in the Company’s
models fall outside of the statistical ranges of reasonable EGPs, see footnote [3] above, and the
Company has exceeded the threshold for recoverability, the Company will first “Unlock” the future
EGPs to reflect the Company’s revised best estimates and second will re-test for recoverability.

Living Benefits Required to be Fair Valued

The Company offers certain variable annuity products with a guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefit
(“GMWB”) rider in the U.S., Japan and the U.K. The Company also offers a guaranteed minimum
accumulation benefit (“GMAB”) with a variable annuity product offered in Japan. As of December 31,
2008 and December 31, 2007, the fair values of the GMWB
liabilities are $6.6 billion and $715,
respectively. As of December 31, 2008 the fair value of the GMAB liability is $0. As of December
31, 2007 the fair value of the GMAB was an asset of $2 because the present value of the fees
expected to be earned in the future exceeded the present value claims expected to be paid in the
future. Due to significant market declines in the fourth quarter of 2008, a large majority of the
Company’s in force Japan 3 Win policies, which include a GMAB feature, annuitized or surrendered
free of charge in the fourth quarter of 2008. See Note 4 of Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements for a description of the Japan GMAB.

Fair values for GMWB and GMAB contracts are calculated based upon internally developed models
because active, observable markets do not exist for those items. Below is a description of the
Company’s fair value methodologies for guaranteed benefit liabilities, the related reinsurance and
customized derivatives, all accounted for under SFAS 133, prior to the adoption of SFAS 157 and
subsequent to adoption of SFAS 157.



Pre-SFAS 157 Fair Value

Prior to January 1, 2008, the Company used the guidance prescribed in SFAS 133 and other related
accounting literature on fair value which represented the amount for which a financial instrument
could be exchanged in a current transaction between knowledgeable, unrelated willing parties.
However, under that accounting literature, when an estimate of fair value was made for liabilities
where no market observable transactions existed for that liability or similar liabilities, market
risk margins were only included in the valuation if the margin was identifiable, measurable and
significant. If a reliable estimate of market risk margins was not obtainable, the present value
of expected future cash flows under a risk neutral framework, discounted at the risk free rate of
interest, was the best available estimate of fair value in the circumstances (“Pre-SFAS 157 Fair
Value”). The Pre-SFAS 157 Fair Value was calculated based on actuarial and capital market
assumptions related to projected cash flows, including benefits and related contract charges, over
the lives of the contracts, incorporating expectations concerning policyholder behavior such as
lapses, fund selection, resets and withdrawal utilization (for the customized derivatives,
policyholder behavior is prescribed in the derivative contract). Because of the dynamic and
complex nature of these cash flows, best estimate assumptions and a Monte Carlo stochastic process
involving the generation of thousands of scenarios that assume risk neutral returns consistent with
swap rates and a blend of observable implied index volatility levels were used. Estimating these
cash flows involved numerous estimates and subjective judgments including those regarding expected
markets rates of return, market volatility, correlations of market index returns to funds, fund
performance, discount rates and policyholder behavior. At each valuation date, the Company assumed
expected returns based on:

•

risk-free rates as represented by the current LIBOR forward curve rates;

•

forward market volatility assumptions for each underlying index based primarily on a blend
of observed market “implied volatility” data;

•

correlations of market returns across underlying indices based on actual observed market
returns and relationships over the ten years preceding the valuation date;

•

three years of history for fund regression; and

•

current risk-free spot rates as represented by the current LIBOR spot curve to determine
the present value of expected future cash flows produced in the stochastic projection process.

As many guaranteed benefit obligations are relatively new in the marketplace, actual policyholder
behavior experience is limited. As a result, estimates of future policyholder behavior are
subjective and based on analogous internal and external data. As markets change, mature and evolve
and actual policyholder behavior emerges, management continually evaluates the appropriateness of
its assumptions for this component of the fair value model.

Fair Value Under SFAS 157

The Company’s SFAS 157 fair value is calculated as an aggregation of the following components:
Pre-SFAS 157 Fair Value; Actively-Managed Volatility Adjustment; Credit Standing Adjustment; Market
Illiquidity Premium; and Behavior Risk Margin. The resulting aggregation is reconciled or
calibrated, if necessary, to market information that is, or may be, available to the Company, but
may not be observable by other market participants, including reinsurance discussions and
transactions. The Company believes the aggregation of each of these components, as necessary and
as reconciled or calibrated to the market information available to the Company, results in an
amount that the Company would be required to transfer, for a liability or receive for an asset, to
market participants in an active liquid market, if one existed, for those market participants to
assume the risks associated with the guaranteed minimum benefits and the related reinsurance and
customized derivatives required to be fair valued. The SFAS 157 fair value is likely to materially
diverge from the ultimate settlement of the liability as the Company believes settlement will be
based on our best estimate assumptions rather than those best estimate assumptions plus risk
margins. In the absence of any transfer of the guaranteed benefit liability to a third party, the
release of risk margins is likely to be reflected as realized gains in future periods’ net income.
Each of the components described below are unobservable in the marketplace and require subjectivity
by the Company in determining their value.

•

Actively-Managed Volatility Adjustment.

This component incorporates the basis differential
between the observable index implied volatilities used to calculate the Pre-SFAS 157 component
and the actively-managed funds underlying the variable annuity product. The Actively-Managed
Volatility Adjustment is calculated using historical fund and weighted index volatilities.

•

Credit Standing Adjustment.

This component makes an adjustment that market participants
would make to reflect the risk that guaranteed benefit obligations or the GMWB reinsurance
recoverables will not be fulfilled (“nonperformance risk”). SFAS 157 explicitly requires
nonperformance risk to be reflected in fair value. The Company calculates the Credit Standing
Adjustment by using default rates provided by rating agencies, adjusted for market
recoverability, reflecting the long-term nature of living benefit obligations and the priority
of payment on these obligations versus long-term debt.

•

Market Illiquidity Premium.

This component makes an adjustment that market participants
would require to reflect that guaranteed benefit obligations are illiquid and have no market
observable exit prices in the capital markets.

•

Behavior Risk Margin.

This component adds a margin that market participants would require
for the risk that the Company’s assumptions about policyholder behavior used in the Pre-SFAS
157 model could differ from actual experience. The Behavior Risk Margin is calculated by
taking the difference between adverse policyholder behavior assumptions and the best estimate
assumptions used in the Pre-SFAS 157 model using interest rate and volatility assumptions that
the Company believes market participants would use in developing risk margins.



In valuing the embedded derivative, the Company attributes to the derivative a portion of fees
collected from the contract holder equal to the present value of future claims (the “Attributed
Fees”). Attributed Fees in dollars are determined at the inception of each quarterly cohort by
setting the dollars equal to the present value of expected claims. The Attributed Fees, in basis
points, are determined by dividing the Attributed Fees in dollars by the present value of account
value. The Attributed Fees in basis points are locked-in for each quarterly cohort. Recent
capital markets conditions, in particular high equity index volatility and low interest rates have
increased the Attributed Fees for recent cohorts to a level above our rider fees.

Capital market assumptions can significantly change the value of embedded derivative living benefit
guarantees. For example, independent future decreases in equity market returns, future decreases
in interest rates and future increases in equity index volatility will all have the effect of
increasing the value of the embedded derivative liability as of December 31, 2008 resulting in a
realized loss in net income. Furthermore, changes in policyholder behavior can also significantly
change the value of the GMWB. For example, independent future increases in fund mix towards equity
based funds vs. bond funds, future increases in withdrawals, future decreasing mortality, future
increasing usage of the step-up feature and decreases in lapses will all have the effect of
increasing the value of the GMWB embedded derivative liability as of December 31, 2008 resulting in
a realized loss in net income. Independent changes in any one of these assumptions moving in the
opposite direction will have the effect of decreasing the value of the embedded derivative
liability as of December 31, 2008 resulting in a realized gain in net income. As markets change,
mature and evolve and actual policyholder behavior emerges, management continually evaluates the
appropriateness of its assumptions. In addition, management regularly evaluates the valuation
model, incorporating emerging valuation techniques where appropriate, including drawing on the
expertise of market participants and valuation experts.

Valuation of Investments and Derivative Instruments

The Hartford’s investments in fixed maturities include bonds, redeemable preferred stock and
commercial paper. These investments, along with certain equity securities, which include common
and non-redeemable preferred stocks, are classified as “available-for-sale” and are carried at fair
value. The after-tax difference from cost or amortized cost is reflected in stockholders’ equity
as a component of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (“AOCI”), after adjustments for the effect
of deducting the life and pension policyholders’ share of the immediate participation guaranteed
contracts and certain life and annuity deferred policy acquisition costs and reserve adjustments.
The equity investments associated with the variable annuity products offered in Japan are recorded
at fair value and are classified as “trading” with changes in fair value recorded in net investment
income. Policy loans are carried at outstanding balance. Mortgage loans on real estate are
recorded at the outstanding principal balance adjusted for amortization of premiums or discounts
and net of valuation allowances, if any. Short-term investments are carried at amortized cost,
which approximates fair value. Limited partnerships and other alternative investments are reported
at their carrying value with the change in carrying value accounted for under the equity method and
accordingly the Company’s share of earnings are included in net investment income. Recognition of
limited partnerships and other alternative investment income is delayed due to the availability of
the related financial statements, as private equity and other funds are generally on a three-month
delay and hedge funds are on a one-month delay. Accordingly, income at December 31, 2008 may not
include the full impact of current year changes in valuation of the underlying assets and
liabilities. Other investments primarily consist of derivatives instruments which are carried at
fair value.

Valuation
of Fixed Maturity, Short-Term and Equity Securities, Available-for-Sale

The fair value for fixed maturity, short-term and equity securities, available-for-sale, is
determined by management after considering one of three primary sources of information: third party
pricing services, independent broker quotations or pricing matrices. Security pricing is applied
using a “waterfall” approach whereby publicly available prices are first sought from third party
pricing services, the remaining unpriced securities are submitted to independent brokers for
prices, or lastly, securities are priced using a pricing matrix. Typical inputs used by these
three pricing methods include, but are not limited to, reported trades, benchmark yields, issuer
spreads, bids, offers, and/or estimated cash flows and prepayments speeds. Based on the typical
trading volumes and the lack of quoted market prices for fixed maturities, third party pricing
services will normally derive the security prices through recent reported trades for identical or
similar securities making adjustments through the reporting date based upon available market
observable information as outlined above. If there are no recent reported trades, the third party
pricing services and brokers may use matrix or model processes to develop a security price where
future cash flow expectations are developed based upon collateral performance and discounted at an
estimated market rate. Included in the pricing of asset-backed securities (“ABS”), collateralized
mortgage obligations (“CMOs”), and mortgage-backed securities (“MBS”) are estimates of the rate of
future prepayments of principal over the remaining life of the securities. Such estimates are
derived based on the characteristics of the underlying structure and prepayment speeds previously
experienced at the interest rate levels projected for the underlying collateral. Actual prepayment
experience may vary from these estimates.

Prices from third party pricing services are often unavailable for securities that are rarely
traded or are traded only in privately negotiated transactions. As a result, certain securities
are priced via independent broker quotations which utilize inputs that may be difficult to
corroborate with observable market based data. Additionally, the majority of these independent
broker quotations are non-binding. A pricing matrix is used to price securities for which the
Company is unable to obtain either a price from a third party pricing service or an independent
broker quotation. The pricing matrix used by the Company begins with current spread levels to
determine the market price for the security. The credit spreads, as assigned by a knowledgeable
private placement broker, incorporate the issuer’s credit rating and a risk premium, if warranted,
due to the issuer’s industry and the security’s time to maturity. The issuer-specific yield
adjustments, which can be positive or negative, are updated twice per year, as of June 30 and
December 31, by the private placement broker and are intended to adjust security prices for
issuer-specific factors. The Company assigns a credit rating to these securities based upon an
internal analysis of the issuer’s financial strength.



The Company performs a monthly analysis on the prices and credit spreads received from third
parties to ensure that the prices represent a reasonable estimate of the fair value. This process
involves quantitative and qualitative analysis and is overseen by investment and accounting
professionals. Examples of procedures performed include, but are not limited to, initial and
on-going review of third party pricing services methodologies, review of pricing statistics and
trends, back testing recent trades and monitoring of trading volumes. In addition, the Company
ensures whether prices received from independent brokers represent a reasonable estimate of fair
value through the use of internal and external cash flow models developed based on spreads, and
when available, market indices. As a result of this analysis, if the Company determines that there
is a more appropriate fair value based upon the available market data, the price received from the
third party is adjusted accordingly. At December 31, 2008, the Company made fair value
determinations which lowered prices received from third party pricing services and brokers by a
total of $139. The securities adjusted had an amortized cost and fair value after the adjustment
of $623 and $232, respectively, and were primarily commercial mortgage-backed securities (“CMBS”).

In accordance with SFAS 157, the Company has analyzed the third party pricing services valuation
methodologies and related inputs, and has also evaluated the various types of securities in its
investment portfolio to determine an appropriate SFAS 157 fair value hierarchy level based upon
trading activity and the observability of market inputs. The SFAS 157 fair value hierarchy
prioritizes the inputs in the valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three broad
levels (Level 1 — quoted prices in active markets for identical assets, Level 2 — significant
observable inputs, or Level 3 — significant unobservable inputs). For further discussion of SFAS
157, see Note 4 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Based on this, each price
was classified into Level 1, 2, or 3. Most prices provided by third party pricing services are
classified into Level 2 because the inputs used in pricing the securities are market observable.

Due to a general lack of transparency in the process that brokers use to develop prices, most
valuations that are based on brokers’ prices are classified as Level 3. Some valuations may be
classified as Level 2 if the price can be corroborated. Internal matrix priced securities,
primarily consisting of certain private placement debt, are also classified as Level 3. The matrix
pricing of certain private placement debt includes significant non-observable inputs, the
internally determined credit rating of the security and an externally provided credit spread.

available-for-sale, by pricing source and SFAS 157 hierarchy level as of December 31, 2008.

The fair value of a financial instrument is the amount at which the instrument could be exchanged
in a current transaction between knowledgeable, unrelated willing parties using inputs, including
assumptions and estimates, a market participant would utilize. As the estimated fair value of a
financial instrument utilizes assumptions and estimates, the amount that may be realized may differ
significantly.

Valuation of Derivative Instruments, excluding embedded derivatives within liability contracts

Derivative instruments are reported on the consolidated balance sheets at fair value and are
reported in Other Investments and Other Liabilities. Derivative instruments are fair valued using
pricing valuation models, which utilize market data inputs or independent broker quotations. As of
December 31, 2008 and 2007, 94% and 89% of derivatives, respectively, based upon notional values,
were priced by valuation models, which utilize independent market data. The remaining derivatives
were priced by broker quotations. The derivatives are valued using mid-market level inputs, with
the exception of the customized swap contracts that hedge GMWB liabilities, that are predominantly
observable in the market. Inputs used to value derivatives include, but are not limited to,
interest swap rates, foreign currency forward and spot rates, credit spreads and correlations,
interest and equity volatility and equity index levels. The Company performs a monthly analysis on
derivative valuations which includes both quantitative and qualitative analysis. Examples of
procedures performed include, but are not limited to, review of pricing statistics and trends, back
testing recent trades, analyzing the impacts of changes in the market environment, and review of
changes in market value for each derivative including those derivatives priced by brokers.

Derivative instruments classified as Level 3 include complex derivatives, primarily consisting of
equity options and swaps, interest rate derivatives which have interest rate optionality, certain
credit default swaps, and long-dated interest rate swaps. These derivative instruments are valued
using pricing models which utilize both observable and unobservable inputs and, to a lesser extent,
broker quotations. A derivative instrument that is priced using both observable and unobservable
inputs will be classified as a Level 3 financial instrument in its entirety if the unobservable
input is significant in developing the price.

The Company utilizes derivative instruments to manage the risk associated with certain assets and
liabilities. However, the derivative instrument may not be classified with the same fair value
hierarchy level as the associated assets and liabilities.

Evaluation of Other-Than-Temporary Impairments on Available-for-Sale Securities

One of the significant estimates related to available-for-sale securities is the evaluation of
investments for other-than-temporary impairments. If a decline in the fair value of an
available-for-sale security is judged to be other-than-temporary, a charge is recorded in net
realized capital losses equal to the difference between the fair value and cost or amortized cost
basis of the security. In addition, for securities expected to be sold, an other-than-temporary
impairment charge is recognized if the Company does not expect the fair value of a security to
recover to cost or amortized cost prior to the expected date of sale. The fair value of the
other-than-temporarily impaired investment becomes its new cost basis. For fixed maturities, the
Company accretes the new cost basis to par or to the estimated future cash flows over the expected
remaining life of the security by adjusting the security’s yield.

The evaluation of securities for impairments is a quantitative and qualitative process, which is
subject to risks and uncertainties and is intended to determine whether declines in the fair value
of investments should be recognized in current period earnings. The risks and uncertainties
include changes in general economic conditions, the issuer’s financial condition or future
prospects, the effects of changes in interest rates or credit spreads and the expected recovery
period. The Company has a security monitoring process overseen by a committee of investment and
accounting professionals (“the committee”) that identifies securities that, due to certain
characteristics, as described below, are subjected to an enhanced analysis on a quarterly basis.
Based on this evaluation, during 2008, the Company concluded $4.0 billion of unrealized losses were
other-than-temporarily impaired and as of December 31, 2008, the Company’s unrealized losses on
available-for-sale securities of $14.6 billion were temporarily impaired.

Securities not subject to Emerging Issues Task Force (“EITF”) Issue No. 99-20, “Recognition of
Interest Income and Impairment on Purchased Beneficial Interests and Beneficial Interests That
Continued to Be Held by a Transferor in Securitized Financial Assets” (“non-EITF Issue No. 99-20
securities”) that are in an unrealized loss position, are reviewed at least quarterly to determine
if an other-than-temporary impairment is present based on certain quantitative and qualitative
factors. The primary factors considered in evaluating whether a decline in value for non-EITF
Issue No. 99-20 securities is other-than-temporary include: (a) the length of time and extent to
which the fair value has been less than cost or amortized cost of the security, (b) the financial
condition, credit rating and future prospects of the issuer, (c) whether the debtor is current on
contractually obligated interest and principal payments and (d) the intent and ability of the
Company to retain the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for recovery.

Through September 30, 2008, for securitized financial assets with contractual cash flows, including
those subject to EITF Issue No. 99-20, the Company periodically updated its best estimate of cash
flows over the life of the security. The Company’s best estimate of cash flows used severe
economic recession assumptions due to market uncertainty, similar to those the Company believed
market participants would use. If the fair value of a securitized financial asset was less than
its cost or amortized cost and there has been an adverse change in timing or amount of anticipated
future cash flows since the last revised estimate, an other-than-temporary impairment charge was
recognized. The Company also considered its intent and ability to retain a temporarily depressed
security until recovery. Estimating future cash flows is a quantitative and qualitative process
that incorporates information received from third party sources along with certain internal
assumptions and judgments regarding the future performance of the underlying collateral. In
addition, projections of expected future cash flows may change based upon new information regarding
the performance of the underlying collateral. Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2008, the Company
implemented FSP No. EITF 99-20-1, “Amendments to the Impairment Guidance of EITF Issue No. 99-20”
(see Note 1 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements). Upon implementation, the
Company continued to utilize the impairment process described above, however, rather than
exclusively relying upon market participant assumptions, management judgment was also used in
assessing the probability that an adverse change in future cash flows has occurred.

Each quarter, during this analysis, the Company asserts its intent and ability to retain until
recovery those securities judged to be temporarily impaired. Once identified, these securities are
systematically restricted from trading unless approved by the committee. The committee will only
authorize the sale of these securities based on predefined criteria that relate to events that
could not have been reasonably foreseen. Examples of the criteria include, but are not limited to,
the deterioration in the issuer’s creditworthiness, a change in regulatory requirements or a major
business combination or major disposition.

Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit Obligations

The Company maintains a U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plan (the “Plan”) that covers
substantially all employees, as well as unfunded excess plans to provide benefits in excess of
amounts permitted to be paid to participants of the Plan under the provisions of the Internal
Revenue Code. The Company has also entered into individual retirement agreements with certain
retired directors providing for unfunded supplemental pension benefits. In addition, the Company
provides certain health care and life insurance benefits for eligible retired employees. The
Company maintains international plans which represent an immaterial percentage of total pension
assets, liabilities and expense and, for reporting purposes, are combined with domestic plans.



Pursuant to accounting principles related to the Company’s pension and other postretirement
obligations to employees under its various benefit plans, the Company is required to make a
significant number of assumptions in order to calculate the related liabilities and expenses each
period. The two economic assumptions that have the most impact on pension and other postretirement
expense are the discount rate and the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. In
determining the discount rate assumption, the Company utilizes a discounted cash flow analysis of
the Company’s pension and other postretirement obligations and currently available market and
industry data. The yield curve utilized in the cash flow analysis is comprised of bonds rated Aa
or higher with maturities primarily between zero and thirty years. Based on all available
information, it was determined that 6.25% was the appropriate discount rate as of December 31, 2008
to calculate the Company’s pension and other postretirement obligation. Accordingly, the 6.25%
discount rate will also be used to determine the Company’s 2009 pension and other postretirement
expense. At December 31, 2007, the discount rate was also 6.25%.

As of December 31, 2008, a 25 basis point increase/decrease in the discount rate would
decrease/increase the pension and other postretirement obligations by $116 and $9, respectively.
However, because the Company employs a duration overlay program to adjust the duration of the fixed
income component of the Plan assets to better match the duration of the liabilities, the funded
status of the pension benefits would only increase/decrease by $43.

The Company determines the expected long-term rate of return assumption based on an analysis of the
Plan portfolio’s historical compound rates of return since 1979 (the earliest date for which
comparable portfolio data is available) and over 5 year and 10 year periods. The Company selected
these periods, as well as shorter durations, to assess the portfolio’s volatility, duration and
total returns as they relate to pension obligation characteristics, which are influenced by the
Company’s workforce demographics. In addition, the Company also applies long-term market return
assumptions utilized in Life’s DAC analysis to an investment mix that generally anticipates 60%
fixed income securities, 20% equity securities and 20% alternative assets to derive an expected
long-term rate of return. Based upon these analyses, management maintained the long-term rate of
return assumption at 7.30% as of December 31, 2008. This assumption will be used to determine the
Company’s 2009 expense. The long-term rate of return assumption at December 31, 2007, that was used
to determine the Company’s 2008 expense, was also 7.30%.

Pension expense reflected in the Company’s net income was $122, $131 and $152 in 2008, 2007 and
2006, respectively. The Company estimates its 2009 pension expense will be approximately $134,
based on current assumptions. To illustrate the impact of these assumptions on annual pension
expense for 2009 and going forward, a 25 basis point decrease in the discount rate will increase
pension expense by approximately $12 and a 25 basis point change in the long-term asset return
assumption will increase/decrease pension expense by approximately $9.

In 2008, the deterioration of the global economy, together with the current credit crisis, caused
significant volatility in interest rates and equity prices, which caused actual asset returns of
the Plan’s investment portfolios to be less than expected. As provided for under SFAS No. 87, the
Company uses a five-year averaging method to determine the market-related value of Plan assets,
which is used to determine the expected return component of pension expense. Under this
methodology, asset gains/losses that result from returns that differ from the Company’s long-term
rate of return assumption are recognized in the market-related value of assets on a level basis
over a five year period. The difference between actual asset returns for the plans of $(441) and
$331 for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively, as compared to expected returns
of $279 and $283 for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively, will be fully
reflected in the market-related value of plan assets over the next five years using the methodology
described above. The level of actuarial net losses continues to exceed the allowable amortization
corridor as defined under SFAS No. 87. Based on the 6.25% discount rate selected as of December
31, 2008 and taking into account estimated future minimum funding, the difference between actual
and expected performance in 2008 will increase annual pension expense in future years. The
increase in pension expense will be approximately $30 in 2009 and will increase ratably to an
increase of approximately $205 in 2014.

Contingencies Relating to Corporate Litigation and Regulatory Matters

Management follows the requirements of SFAS No. 5 “Accounting for Contingencies.” This statement
requires management to evaluate each contingent matter separately. A loss is recorded if probable
and reasonably estimable. Management establishes reserves for these contingencies at its “best
estimate,” or, if no one number within the range of possible losses is more probable than any
other, the Company records an estimated reserve at the low end of the range of losses.

The Company has a quarterly monitoring process involving legal and accounting professionals. Legal
personnel first identify outstanding corporate litigation and regulatory matters posing a
reasonable possibility of loss. These matters are then jointly reviewed by accounting and legal
personnel to evaluate the facts and changes since the last review in order to determine if a
provision for loss should be recorded or adjusted, the amount that should be recorded, and the
appropriate disclosure. The outcomes of certain contingencies currently being evaluated by the
Company, which relate to corporate litigation and regulatory matters, are inherently difficult to
predict, and the reserves that have been established for the estimated settlement amounts are
subject to significant changes. In view of the uncertainties regarding the outcome of these
matters, as well as the tax-deductibility of payments, it is possible that the ultimate cost to the
Company of these matters could exceed the reserve by an amount that would have a material adverse
effect on the Company’s consolidated results of operations or cash flows in a particular quarterly
or annual period.



Goodwill Impairment

SFAS No. 142, “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets,” requires that goodwill balances be reviewed
for impairment at least annually or more frequently if events occur or circumstances change that
would indicate that a triggering event, as defined in SFAS 142, has occurred. A reporting unit is
defined as an operating segment or one level below an operating segment. Most of the Company’s
reporting units, for which goodwill has been allocated, are equivalent to the Company’s operating
segments as there is no discrete financial information available for the separate components of the
segment or all of the components of the segment have similar economic characteristics. The fixed
and variable annuity components of Individual Annuity have been aggregated into one reporting unit;
the 401(k), 457 and 403(b) components of Retirement have been aggregated into one reporting unit;
the variable life, universal life and term life components of Individual Life have been aggregated
into one reporting unit; the private placement life insurance and institutional investment products
components of the Institutional Solutions Group have been aggregated into one reporting unit; the
group disability and group life components of Group Benefits have been aggregated into one
reporting unit; the Japan, Brazil and U.K. components of International have been aggregated into
one reporting unit, and the homeowners and automobile components of Personal Lines have been
aggregated into one reporting unit. In circumstances where the components of an operating segment
constitute a business for which discrete financial information is available and segment management
regularly reviews the operating results of that component such as with Other Retail, which combined
with Individual Annuity constitutes the Retail operating segment, and Hartford Financial Products,
the Company has classified those components as reporting units.

As of December 31, 2008, the Company had goodwill allocated to the following reporting units:

The goodwill impairment test follows a two step process as defined in SFAS 142. In the first step,
the fair value of a reporting unit is compared to its carrying value. If the carrying value of a
reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the second step of the impairment test is performed for
purposes of measuring the impairment. In the second step, the fair value of the reporting unit is
allocated to all of the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit to determine an implied
goodwill value. This allocation is similar to a purchase price allocation performed in purchase
accounting. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit goodwill exceeds the implied goodwill
value, an impairment loss shall be recognized in an amount equal to that excess.

Management’s determination of the fair value of each reporting unit incorporates multiple inputs
including discounted cash flow calculations, peer company price to earnings multiples, the level of
the Company’s own share price and assumptions that market participants would make in valuing the
reporting unit. Other assumptions include levels of economic capital, future business growth,
earnings projections, assets under management for Life reporting units and the weighted average
cost of capital used for purposes of discounting. Decreases in the amount of economic capital
allocated to a reporting unit, decreases in business growth, decreases in earnings projections and
increases in the weighted average cost of capital will all cause the reporting unit’s fair value to
decrease.

The Company completed its annual goodwill assessment for the individual reporting units within Life
and Property & Casualty as of January 1, 2008 and September 30, 2008, respectively. The conclusion
reached as a result of the annual goodwill impairment testing was that the fair value of each
reporting unit, for which goodwill had been allocated, was in excess of the respective reporting
unit’s carrying value (the first step of the goodwill impairment test).



However, as noted above, goodwill is reassessed at an interim date if certain circumstances occur
which would cause the entity to conclude that it was more likely than not that the carrying value
of one or more of its reporting units would be in excess of the respective reporting unit’s fair
value. As a result of the sharp decline in the equity markets during the fourth quarter of 2008
and a sharp decline in The Hartford’s share price below book value per share, the Company
concluded, in connection with the preparation of its year end financial statements, that the
conditions had been met to warrant an interim goodwill impairment test.

The Company believes one of the significant drivers in the decline of its traded per share price is
the risks associated with the death and living benefit guarantees offered with the products sold by
the Individual Annuity and International reporting units and the related U.S. GAAP and statutory
requirements.

As a result of the testing performed during the fourth quarter of 2008, which included the effects
of decreasing sales outlooks and declining equity markets on future earnings, the fair value for
each reporting unit continued to be in excess of the respective reporting unit’s carrying value
except for the Life Individual Annuity and International reporting units. For both of these
reporting units, the Company concluded that the fair value of the reporting unit had declined
significantly, as evidenced by the decline in the Company’s share price, due to the significant
risks associated with the product suite discussed above. As a result of the step 2 analysis, the
allocation of the fair value of the Individual Annuity and International reporting units to their
respective assets and liabilities as of December 31, 2008 indicated an implied level of goodwill of
$0 for both reporting units. Therefore, the Company recorded an impairment charge of $730 and $15
of goodwill which had been allocated to the Individual Annuity and International reporting units,
respectively.

The goodwill impairment charge of $745 included $323 that had resulted from the Company’s buyback
of the Life operations in 2000. The buyback goodwill was reported in Corporate but had been
allocated to Life reporting units for purposes of goodwill impairment testing, including $308 to
Individual Annuity and $15 to International. This portion of the impairment was recorded in
Corporate. The remaining impairment charge of $422 was recorded in Individual Annuity and related
to the Company’s prior acquisitions of Planco, Inc. and Fortis Financial Group, Inc.

If current market conditions persist during 2009, in particular, if the Company’s share price
remains below book value per share, or if the Company’s actions to limit risk associated with its
products or investments causes a significant change in any one reporting unit’s fair value, the
Company may need to reassess goodwill impairment at the end of each quarter as part of an annual or
interim impairment test. Subsequent reviews of goodwill could result in additional impairment of
goodwill during 2009.

Operating Results

Year ended December 31, 2008 compared to the year ended December 31, 2007

Net income decreased primarily due to decreases in Life of $4.0 billion for the year ended December
31, 2008 compared to the year ended December 31, 2007. Additionally, Property & Casualty net
income decreased $1.4 billion for the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to the year ended
December 31, 2007. Corporate results decreased primarily due to a goodwill impairment charge of
$323, after-tax.

The decrease in Life’s net income was due to the following:

•

Realized losses increased as compared to the comparable prior year period primarily due to
impairments on investment securities and net losses from the adoption of SFAS 157. For further
discussion, please refer to the Realized Capital Gains and Losses by Segment table under
Life’s Operating Section of the MD&A.

•

Life recorded a DAC unlock charge of $941, after-tax, during the third quarter of 2008 as
compared to a DAC unlock benefit of $210, after-tax, during the third quarter of 2007. See
Critical Accounting Estimates with Managements Discussion and Analysis for a further
discussion on the DAC unlock.

•

Declines in assets under management in Retail, primarily driven by market depreciation of
$37.8 billion for Individual Annuity and $20.2 billion for retail mutual funds during 2008,
drove declines in fee income compared to 2007.

•

Net investment income on securities, available-for-sale, and other declined primarily due
to declines in limited partnership and other alternative investments income and a decrease in
investment yield for fixed maturities.

•

A goodwill impairment of $274, after-tax, in Retail.

•

The effect of the triggering of the guaranteed minimum income benefit for the 3 Win product
was $151, after-tax.

Property & Casualty results changed from net income of $1.5 billion in 2007 to net income of $92 in
2008, largely due to a $1.1 billion after-tax increase in net realized capital losses on
investments, a $325 after-tax decrease in net investment income and a $238 after-tax increase in
current accident year catastrophes, partially offset by a $147 after-tax net release of prior
accident year reserves in 2008.

•

Ongoing Operations’ net income decreased by $1.3 billion in 2008, from net income of $1.5
billion in 2007 to net income of $189 in 2008. Before income taxes, Ongoing Operations’
results deteriorated by $1.9 billion, primarily due to a $1.5 billion increase in net realized
capital losses on investments, a $383 decrease in net investment income and a $366 increase in
current accident year catastrophes, partially offset by a $210 increase in net favorable prior
accident year development and more favorable underwriting results from personal auto and
workers’ compensation lines of business. The increase in net realized capital losses of $1.5
billion in 2008 was primarily due to impairments of subordinated fixed maturities and
preferred equity securities in the financial services sector as well as of securitized assets.
Contributing to the $383 decrease in net investment income was a change from net income to
net losses on limited partnerships and other alternative investments in 2008 and decreased
fixed maturity income. The $366 increase in current accident year catastrophes was largely
due to losses incurred from hurricane Ike in September of 2008 and an increase in losses from
tornadoes and thunderstorms in the South and Midwest. The $210 increase in net favorable
prior accident year development was primarily due to larger net reserve releases for workers’
compensation, professional liability and personal auto liability claims.

•

Other Operations reported a net loss of $97 in 2008 compared to net income of $30 in 2007.
Before income taxes, Other Operations’ results deteriorated by $184, primarily due to a $196
increase in net realized capital losses on investments, largely driven by impairments of
subordinated fixed maturities and preferred equity securities in the financial services sector
as well as of securitized assets, and a $51 decrease in net investment income, partially
offset by a $64 decrease in net unfavorable prior accident year reserve development.

Year ended December 31, 2007 compared to the year ended December 31, 2006

Net income increased primarily due to increases in Life of $117 for the year ended December 31,
2007 compared to the year ended December 31, 2006. Additionally, Property & Casualty net income
decreased $12 for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to the year ended December 31, 2006.
Also included in the year ended December 31, 2007 is an increase in reserve for regulatory matters
of $30, after-tax, of which $21 and $9 relates to Life and Property & Casualty, respectively.



The increase in Life’s net income was due to the following:

•

The DAC unlock benefit of $210 recorded in the third quarter of 2007.

•

Increased income on asset growth in the variable annuity, mutual fund, retirement and
institutional businesses.

Partially offsetting the increase in Life’s net income were the following:

•

Increased non-deferrable individual annuity asset based commissions.

•

Unfavorable mortality in Individual Life.

•

Increased DAC amortization in Group Benefits due to the adoption of Statement of Position
05-1, “Accounting by Insurance Enterprises for Deferred Acquisition Costs in Connection with
Modifications or Exchanges of Insurance Contracts” (“SOP 05-1”).

•

During the first quarter of 2006, the Company achieved favorable settlements in several
cases brought against the Company by policyholders regarding their purchase of broad-based
leveraged corporate owned life insurance (“leveraged COLI”) policies in the early to mid-1990s
and therefore, released a reserve for these matters of $34, after-tax.

•

Realized losses increased for the year ended December 31, 2007 as compared to the
comparable prior year periods primarily due to net losses on GMWB derivatives and impairments.

Property & Casualty net income decreased by $12 for the year ended December 31, 2007.
Ongoing Operations’ net income decreased by $77 for the year, while Other Operations improved its
results by $65, primarily due to a reduction in unfavorable loss reserve development.

•

Ongoing Operations’ net income decreased by $77, primarily due to a $92 after-tax decrease
in underwriting results and a change from net realized capital gains of $29, after-tax, in
2006 to net realized capital losses of $104, after-tax, in 2007. The decrease in underwriting
results and the change to net realized capital losses was partially offset by a $150 after-tax
increase in net investment income. The decrease in underwriting results was primarily driven
by an increase in the loss and loss adjustment expense ratio before catastrophes and prior
accident year development and an increase in insurance and operating costs and dividends,
partially offset by a reduction in prior accident year reserves for workers’ compensation
business.

•

Other Operations reported net income of $30 in 2007 compared to a net loss of $35 in 2006.
The improvement in results was primarily due to a decrease in unfavorable prior accident year
reserve development, partially offset by a change from net realized gains in 2006 to net
realized losses in 2007 and a decrease in net investment income.

Net Realized Capital Gains and Losses

See “Investment Results” in the Investments section and the “Realized Capital Gains and Losses by
Segment” table within the Life section of the MD&A.

Income Taxes

The effective tax rate for 2008, 2007 and 2006 was 40%, 26%, and 24%, respectively. The principal
causes of the difference between the effective rate and the U.S. statutory rate of 35% for 2008,
2007 and 2006 were tax-exempt interest earned on invested assets and the separate account dividends
received deduction (“DRD”). This caused an increase in the tax benefit on the 2008 pre-tax loss
and a decrease in the tax expense on the 2007 and 2006 pre-tax income. Income taxes paid in 2008,
2007 and 2006 were $253, $451, and $179 respectively. For additional information, see Note 13 of
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

The separate account dividends-received deduction (“DRD”) is estimated for the current year using
information from the prior year-end, adjusted for current year equity market performance and other
appropriate factors, including estimated levels of corporate dividend payments. The estimated DRD
was updated in the third quarter for the provision-to-filed-return adjustments, and in the fourth
quarter based on current year ultimate mutual fund distributions and fee income from the Company’s
variable insurance products. The actual current year DRD varied from earlier estimates based on,
but not limited to, changes in eligible dividends received by the mutual funds, amounts of
distributions from these mutual funds, amounts of short-term capital gains and asset values at the
mutual fund level and the Company’s taxable income before the DRD. Given recent financial markets’
volatility, the Company intends to review its DRD computations on a quarterly basis, beginning in
2009. The Company recorded benefits of $176, $155 and $174 related to the separate account DRD in
the years ended December 31, 2008, December 31, 2007 and December 31, 2006, respectively. The 2008
benefit included a benefit of $9 related to a true-up of the prior year tax return, the 2007
benefit included a charge of $1 related to a true-up of the prior year tax return, and the 2006
benefit included a benefit of $6 related to true-ups of prior years’ tax returns.

In Revenue Ruling 2007-61, issued on September 25, 2007, the IRS announced its intention to issue
regulations with respect to certain computational aspects of the DRD on separate account assets
held in connection with variable annuity contracts. Revenue Ruling 2007-61 suspended Revenue
Ruling 2007-54, issued in August 2007 that purported to change accepted industry and IRS
interpretations of the statutes governing these computational questions. Any regulations that the
IRS may ultimately propose for issuance in this area will be subject to public notice and comment,
at which time insurance companies and other members of the public will have the opportunity to
raise legal and practical questions about the content, scope and application of such regulations.
As a result, the ultimate timing and substance of any such regulations are unknown, but they could
result in the elimination of some or all of the separate account DRD tax benefit that the Company
receives. Management believes that it is highly likely that any such regulations would apply
prospectively only.



The Company receives a foreign tax credit (“FTC”) against its U.S. tax liability for foreign taxes
paid by the Company including payments from its separate account assets. The separate account FTC
is estimated for the current year using information from the most recent filed return, adjusted for
the change in the allocation of separate account investments to the international equity markets
during the current year. The actual current year FTC can vary from the estimates due to actual
FTCs passed through by the mutual funds. The Company recorded benefits of $16, $11 and $17 related
to separate account FTC in the years ended December 31, 2008, December 31, 2007 and December 31,
2006, respectively. These amounts included benefits related to true-ups of prior years’ tax
returns of $4, $0 and $7 in 2008, 2007 and 2006 respectively.

The Company’s unrecognized tax benefits increased by $15 during 2008 as a result of tax positions
taken on the Company’s 2007 tax return and expected to be taken on its 2008 tax return, bringing
the total unrecognized tax benefits to $91 as of December 31, 2008. This entire amount, if it were
recognized, would affect the effective tax rate.

Outlooks

The Hartford provides projections and other forward-looking information in the “Outlook” sections
within MD&A. The “Outlook” sections contain many forward-looking statements, particularly relating
to the Company’s future financial performance. These forward-looking statements are estimates
based on information currently available to the Company, are made pursuant to the safe harbor
provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and are subject to the
precautionary statements set forth in the introduction to MD&A above. Actual results are likely to
differ, and in the past have differed, materially from those forecast by the Company, depending on
the outcome of various factors, including, but not limited to, those set forth in each “Outlook”
section and in Item 1A, Risk Factors.

Outlook

During 2008, the Company has been negatively impacted by conditions in the global financial
markets and economic conditions in general. As these conditions persist in 2009, the Company would
anticipate that it would continue to be negatively impacted,
including the effect of rating
downgrades that have occurred and those that could occur in the future. See Risk Factors in
Item 1A.

Life

Retail

In the long-term, management continues to believe the market for retirement products will expand as
individuals increasingly save and plan for retirement. Demographic trends suggest that as the
“baby boom” generation matures, a significant portion of the United States population will allocate
a greater percentage of their disposable incomes to saving for their retirement years due to
uncertainty surrounding the Social Security system and increases in average life expectancy.

Near-term, the industry and the Company are experiencing lower variable annuity sales as a result
of recent market turbulence and uncertainty in the U.S. financial system. Current market pressures
are also increasing the expected claim costs, the cost and volatility of hedging programs, and the
level of capital needed to support living benefit guarantees. Some companies have already begun to
increase the price of their guaranteed living benefits and change the level of guarantees offered.
In 2009, the Company intends to adjust pricing levels and take certain actions to reduce the risks
in its variable annuity product features in order to address the risks and costs associated with
variable annuity benefit features in the current economic environment and explore other risk
limiting techniques such as increased hedging or other reinsurance structures. Competitor
reaction, including the extent of competitor risk limiting strategies, is difficult to predict and
may result in a decline in Retail’s market share.

Significant declines in equity markets and increased equity market volatility are also likely to
continue to impact the cost and effectiveness of our GMWB hedging program. Continued equity market
volatility could result in material losses in our hedging program. For more information on the
GMWB hedging program, see the Equity Risk Management section within Capital Markets Risk
Management.

During periods of volatile equity markets, policyholders may allocate more of their variable
account assets to the fixed account options and fixed annuities may see increased deposits. In the
fourth quarter of 2008, the Company has seen an increase in fixed annuity deposits compared to
prior quarters. Management expects this trend to continue throughout 2009 or until the equity
markets begin to stabilize and improve.



For the retail mutual fund business net sales can vary significantly depending on market
conditions. The Company has seen a decline in mutual fund deposits and net flows during the fourth
quarter as a result of increased equity market volatility and the declines in equity values
throughout the fourth quarter. As this business continues to evolve, success will be driven by
diversifying net sales across the mutual fund platform, delivering superior investment performance
and creating new investment solutions for current and future mutual fund shareholders.

The decline in assets under management as a result of continued declines in the equity markets
throughout 2008 have decreased the extent of the scale efficiencies that Retail has benefited from
in recent years. The significant reduction in assets under management has resulted in revenues
declining faster than expenses causing lower earnings during the fourth quarter of 2008 and
management expects this strain to continue in 2009. Management will continue to actively evaluate
its expense structure to ensure the business is controlling costs while maintaining its level of
service to our customers.

Individual Life

Sales and account values for variable universal life products have been under pressure due to
continued equity market volatility and declines. For the year ended December 31, 2008, variable
universal life sales and account values decreased 30% and 34%, respectively, compared to prior
year. Continued volatility and declines in the equity markets may reduce the attractiveness of
variable universal life products and put additional strain on future earnings as variable life fees
earned by the Company are driven by the level of assets under management. The variable universal
life mix was 40% of total life insurance in-force for the year ended December 31, 2008.

Future sales for all products will be influenced by the Company’s management of current
distribution relationships, including recent merger and consolidation activity, and the development
of new sources of distribution, while offering competitive and innovative new products and product
features. The current economic environment poses both opportunities and challenges for future
sales; while life insurance products respond well to consumer demand for financial security and
wealth accumulation solutions, individuals may be reluctant to transfer funds when market
volatility has recently resulted in significant declines in investment values. In addition, the
availability and terms of capital solutions in the marketplace, as discussed below, to support
universal life products with secondary guarantees, may influence future growth.

Effective November 1, 2007, Individual Life reinsured the policy liability related to statutory
reserves in universal life with secondary guarantees to a captive reinsurance subsidiary. These
reserves are calculated under prevailing statutory reserving requirements as promulgated under
Actuarial Guideline 38, “The Application of the Valuation of Life Insurance Policies Model
Regulation”. An unaffiliated standby third party letter of credit supports a portion of the
statutory reserves that have been ceded to this subsidiary. As of December 31, 2008, the
transaction provided approximately $429 of statutory capital relief associated with the Company’s
universal life products with secondary guarantees. The Company expects this transaction to
accommodate future statutory capital needs for in-force business and new business written through
approximately December 31, 2009. The use of the letter of credit will result in a decline in net
investment income and increased expenses in future periods for Individual Life. As its business
evolves in this product line, Individual Life will evaluate the need for, and availability of, an
additional capital transaction, which may impact the capacity to write these policies in the
future.

For risk management purposes, Individual Life accepts and retains up to $10 in risk on any one
life. Individual Life uses reinsurance where appropriate to mitigate earnings volatility; however,
death claim experience may lead to periodic short-term earnings volatility. Individual Life is
currently evaluating and preparing to implement changes to its reinsurance structure in 2009 in an
effort to balance the overall profitability of its business while minimizing earnings volatility
associated with higher retention limits.

Individual Life continues to face uncertainty surrounding estate tax legislation, aggressive
competition from other life insurance providers, reduced availability and higher price of
reinsurance, and the current regulatory environment related to reserving for term insurance and
universal life products with no-lapse guarantees. These risks may have a negative impact on
Individual Life’s future earnings.

Retirement Plans

The future financial results of the Retirement Plans segment will depend on Life’s ability to
increase assets under management across all businesses, achieve scale in areas with a high degree
of fixed costs and maintain its investment spread earnings on the general account products sold
largely in the 403(b)/457 business. Disciplined expense management will continue to be a focus and
additional investments in service and technology will occur.

During 2008, the Company completed three Retirement Plans acquisitions. The acquisition of part of
the defined contribution record keeping business of Princeton Retirement Group gives Life a
foothold in the business of providing recordkeeping services to large financial firms which offer
defined contribution plans to their clients and at acquisition added $2.9 billion in mutual funds
to Retirement Plans assets under management and $5.7 billion of assets under administration. The
acquisition of Sun Life Retirement Services, Inc., at acquisition added $15.8 billion in Retirement
Plans assets under management across 6,000 plans and provides new service locations in Boston,
Massachusetts and Phoenix, Arizona. The acquisition of TopNoggin LLC., provides web-based
technology to address data management, administration and benefit calculations. These three
acquisitions were not accretive to 2008 net income. Furthermore, net income as a percentage of
assets is expected to be lower in 2009 reflecting a full year of the new business mix represented
by the acquisitions, which includes larger, more institutionally priced plans, predominantly
executed on a mutual fund platform, and the cost of maintaining multiple technology platforms
during the integration period.



Given the recent market declines and increased volatility during the fourth quarter of 2008, the
Company has seen and expects that growth in Retirement deposits will be negatively affected if
businesses reduce their workforces and offer more modest salary increases and as workers
potentially allocate less to retirement accounts in the near term. The severe decline in equity
markets in the second half of 2008 has significantly reduced Retirement Plans assets under
management, which has strained its net income. This earnings strain is expected to continue
throughout 2009 or until the equity markets improve.

Group Benefits

Group Benefits’ sales may fluctuate based on the competitive pricing environment in the
marketplace. In 2008, the Company generated fully insured ongoing premium growth in
the group life and disability operations. During 2007, the Company completed a
renewal rights transaction associated with its medical stop loss business, which caused lower
earned premium and sales growth in 2008. The Company anticipates relatively stable loss ratios and
expense ratios based on underlying trends in the in-force business and disciplined new business and
renewal underwriting. The Company has not seen a meaningful impact in disability loss ratios as a
result of the recent economic downturn. While claims incidence may increase during a recession,
the Company would expect the impact to the disability loss ratio to be within the normal range of
volatility.

The current economic downturn has resulted in rising unemployment combined with the potential for
employees to lessen spending on the Company’s products may impact future premium growth.
Nonetheless, employees continue to look to the workplace for a broader and ever expanding array of
insurance products. As employers design benefit strategies to attract and retain employees, while
attempting to control their benefit costs, management believes that the need for the Company’s
products will continue to expand. This combined with the significant number of employees who
currently do not have coverage or adequate levels of coverage, creates opportunities for our
products and services.

International

Financial results depend on the account values of our customers, which are affected by equity, bond
and currency markets. Periods of favorable market performance will increase assets under
management and thus increase fee income earned on those assets, while unfavorable market
performance will have the reverse effect. In addition, higher or lower account value levels,
whether driven by market or currency impacts on the underlying investments, will generally reduce
or increase, respectively, certain costs for individual annuities to the Company, such as
guaranteed minimum death benefits (“GMDB”), guaranteed minimum income benefits (“GMIB”), guaranteed
minimum accumulation benefits (“GMAB”) and guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefits (“GMWB”). In
addition, International’s financial results are significantly impacted by the exchange rate between
the U.S. dollar and the Japanese yen. Prudent expense management is also an important component of
product financial results.

Due to significant market declines in the fourth quarter, approximately 97% of our in-force 3 Win
policies, or $3.1 billion in account value, have triggered the associated GMIB. As a result of the
GMIB trigger, the majority of our 3 Win policies annuitized or surrendered free of charge in the
fourth quarter of 2008. This significantly and negatively impacted fourth quarter net flows and
will continue to reduce future profitability. For further details on the trigger of the GMIB associated with the 3 Win
product, see Unlock and Sensitivity Analysis within Critical Accounting Estimates.

Competition has increased dramatically in the Japanese market from both domestic and foreign
insurers. In addition to seeing new entrants in the Japanese market, our existing competitors are
rapidly introducing new products, some of which include shorter guarantee periods as well as
ratcheting guarantee features and higher equity asset allocation. This increase in competition
has impacted current deposits and is expected to negatively impact future deposit levels. In
addition, the Company continues to evaluate product designs that meet customers’ needs while
maintaining prudent risk management. During the second and third quarters of 2008, the Company
launched a new product called “Rising Income/Care Story,” which is a GMWB variable annuity combined
with a nursing care rider, as well as the new product “Plus 5,” which is a 10-year GMAB variable
annuity with a 5% bonus at year 10. The success of the Company’s product offerings will ultimately
be based on customer acceptance in an increasingly competitive environment.

During 2008 the Company has experienced lower than expected surrenders and related surrender fees.
In addition, the Company has experienced significant market declines and therefore some of the
product guarantees have increased in cost. Specifically, the trigger of the 3 Win product,
referenced above, has reduced variable annuity assets under management and will negatively impact
overall financial results and is expected to result in a lower return on assets than in prior
years.

In 2009, the Company intends to review its variable annuity product features in an effort to reduce
the risks and costs associated with variable annuity benefit features in the current economic
environment.



Institutional

Institutional’s markets are highly competitive from a pricing perspective, and a small number of
cases often account for a significant portion of deposits. Most Institutional product issuances
depend on pricing levels as well as the Company’s credit ratings and perceived financial stability
and may be negatively impacted by rating agency downgrades of the
Company that have occurred during February 2009 or could occur in the
future.

During 2008, the Company ceased issuance of retail and institutional funding agreement backed
notes, largely due to the change in customer preference to FDIC-insured products. Prospectively,
the Company will issue only Guaranteed Investment Contracts (GIC) and on a limited basis, funding
agreements. The Company will be disciplined and opportunistic in capturing new GIC and funding
agreement opportunities, and accordingly, deposits in 2009 are expected to be substantially lower
than 2008 amounts. The Company expects stable value products will experience negative net flows in
2009 as contractual maturities and the payments associated with certain contracts which allow an
investor to accelerate principal repayments (after a defined notice period of typically thirteen
months). Approximately $3.9 billion of account value will be paid out on stable value contracts
during 2009. As of December 31, 2008, Institutional has no remaining contracts that contain an
unexercised investor option feature that allows for contract surrender at book value. The Company
has the option to accelerate the repayment of principal for certain other stable value products and
will evaluate calling these contracts individually based upon the financial benefits to the
Company.

The net income of this segment will depend on Institutional’s ability to increase assets under
management, mix of business, net investment spread and investment performance. The net investment
spread, discussed in the Performance Measures section of this MD&A, has declined in 2008 versus
prior year amounts and we expect investment spread will remain pressured in 2009 due to the
anticipated performance of limited partnerships and other alternative investments as well as the
decline in short term interest rates.

Property & Casualty

In 2009, management expects Ongoing Operations written premium to be flat to slightly lower,
reflecting the continuation of competitive market conditions. However, written premium growth in
2009 may be significantly lower if the economy deteriorates more than management expects or if the
market perceives greater uncertainty about the financial strength of the Company as a result of
reductions in the financial strength ratings of the Company’s property and casualty subsidiaries
that have occurred or could occur.

Within the Personal Lines segment, the Company expects written premium to be flat to modestly
higher in 2009, with growth in AARP partially offset by a decline in Agency. The Company expects
personal auto written premium to be flat to modestly higher and homeowners’ written premium to be
flat to slightly lower. The expected increase in AARP written premium will be largely driven by
continued direct marketing to AARP members and an expansion of underwriting appetite through the
continued roll-out of the “Next Gen Auto” product. The expected decline in Agency written premium
will be driven by the Company’s decision to stop renewing Florida homeowners’ policies sold through
agents. Apart from the effect of non-renewing Florida homeowners business in Agency, management
expects a slight increase in Agency written premium driven by appointing more agents and increasing
market penetration in select markets.

In 2009, the Company expects to increase its auto and homeowners written premium generated from
direct sales to the consumer and from agents selling the AARP product. In 2008, the Company
launched a brand and channel expansion pilot in four states: Arizona, Illinois, Tennessee and
Minnesota and expects to expand the initiative to additional states in 2009. In the targeted
states, the Company will increase Personal Lines brand advertising and launch direct marketing
efforts beyond its existing AARP program. In addition, certain agents in the targeted states will
be authorized to offer the Company’s AARP product.

While carriers in the personal lines industry will continue to compete on price, management expects
that written pricing in Personal Lines will continue to increase modestly in 2009 in response to
rising loss costs. For the Company, written pricing in 2008 increased 2% in both auto and
homeowners.

Within Small Commercial, management expects written premium in 2009 to be flat to slightly lower,
primarily driven by an increase in workers’ compensation written premium with an expected decline
in commercial auto written premium. Contributing to the expected increase in workers’ compensation
written premium will be an expansion of underwriting appetite in selected industries and an
expansion of business written through payroll service providers. In 2008, average premium per
policy in Small Commercial is expected to continue to decline due to written pricing decreases, a
lower average premium on Next Generation Auto business and the potential for an increase in
mid-term endorsements as insureds reduce coverage due to the economic downturn. Written pricing in
Small Commercial decreased by 2% in 2008.

Management expects that 2009 written premium for Middle Market will be lower as the Company takes a
disciplined approach to evaluating and pricing risks in the face of declines in written pricing.
Written pricing for Middle Market business declined by 5% in 2008 and while management expects
written pricing to begin to stabilize in 2009, management expects carriers will continue to price
new business more aggressively than renewals. Management expects to compete for new business and
protect renewals in Middle Market by, among other actions, refining its pricing models, increasing
its willingness to write more workers’ compensation business on a mono-line basis and writing
larger property policies and umbrella general liability policies.

Within Specialty Commercial, management expects written premium to be flat to slightly lower,
primarily driven by a decrease in property written premium, largely offset by an increase in
professional liability, fidelity and surety written premium and an increase in casualty written
premium.



Excluding catastrophes and prior accident year development, Ongoing Operations underwriting margins
will likely decline in 2009 due primarily to increases in both the loss and loss adjustment expense
ratio as well as the expense ratio, partially offset by lower anticipated policyholder dividends.
The Ongoing Operations’ 2009 accident year loss and loss adjustment expense ratio before
catastrophes is expected to increase due to mid single-digit increases in claim cost severity and
continued earned pricing decreases in commercial lines, partially offset by moderately favorable
claim frequency.

For auto business, emerged claim frequency in 2008 was favorable to the prior year and claim
severity was slightly higher. In 2009, management expects claim severity will increase and claim
frequency will be less favorable than it was in 2008. Non-catastrophe loss costs of homeowners
claims increased in 2008 due to higher claim frequency and severity and management expects loss
costs to continue to increase in 2009, driven by higher claim severity.

Small Commercial experienced favorable frequency on workers’ compensation claims in recent accident
years and management expects favorable frequency to continue for the 2009 accident year though not
as favorable as it has been. While the Company experienced favorable non-catastrophe property
losses on package business and commercial auto claims in 2008, management expects that severity
will increase for non-catastrophe property claims in 2009 and that frequency will be less
favorable.

For Middle Market, management expects an increase in claim cost severity in 2009 across all lines,
although the increase in claim severity for non-catastrophe property claims will not likely be as
high as it was in 2008 when the Company experienced a number of individually large property losses.
Partially offsetting the expected increase in severity is an expectation of moderately lower
frequency.

On professional liability business within Specialty Commercial, the Company expects its losses from
the fallout of the sub-prime mortgage market and from the alleged Madoff fraud to be manageable
based on several factors. Principal among them is the diversified nature of the product and
customer portfolio, with the majority of the Company’s total in-force professional liability net
written premium derived from policyholders with privately-held ownership and, therefore, relatively
low shareholder class action exposure. The Company’s average net limit exposed is $8 at an average
attachment point of $74 on reported claims or notices of potential claims on sub-prime exposed
policies. While the Madoff alleged fraud case continues to evolve, based on the involved parties
noted in press reports to date, the Company expects a limited number of its policies will be
exposed and, based on the net limits expected to be at risk, does not expect its losses from the
Madoff case will be material.

The Ongoing Operations expense ratio is expected to increase in 2009, in part, due to a lower
expected earned premium in Middle Market, the amortization of a higher amount of acquisition costs
on AARP business and an increase in the cost of investments in technology to support future growth.
The policyholder dividend ratio was unusually high in 2008 due to the accrual of $26 in dividends
due to certain workers’ compensation policyholders as a result of underwriting profits. (See the
Property and Casualty MD&A section for further discussion.)

Current accident year catastrophe losses in 2008, at 5.3 percent of Ongoing Operations’ earned
premium, were higher than the long-term historical average due principally to hurricane Ike and
higher than average losses from tornadoes and thunderstorms in the South and Midwest. While
catastrophe losses vary significantly from year to year and are unpredictable, management has
assumed that catastrophe losses in 2009 will be closer to 3% to 3.5% of earned premium. The
Company will continue to manage its exposure to catastrophe losses through the ongoing assessment
of its risk, disciplined underwriting and the use of reinsurance and other risk transfer
alternatives, as appropriate. As of January 1, 2009, the Company’s retention under its principal
property catastrophe reinsurance program remained at $250 per catastrophe event. With the January
1, 2009 renewal, the cost of the Company’s principal property catastrophe reinsurance program
increased modestly.

Driven primarily by an expected increase in loss costs and underwriting expenses, the Company
expects the Ongoing Operations’ combined ratio before catastrophes and prior accident year
development in 2009 to be higher than the 88.9 achieved in 2008. At the segment level, the
combined ratio before catastrophes and prior accident year development is expected to be higher in
2009 for Personal Lines, Small Commercial and Middle Market as increases in loss costs are expected
to outpace earned pricing. For Specialty Commercial, management expects that the combined ratio
before catastrophes and prior accident year development for 2009 will be in line with the ratio for
2008.

Property & Casualty operating cash flow is expected to be less favorable in 2009 than in 2008,
although still positive. Based upon the current interest rate and credit environment, Property &
Casualty expects a slightly higher investment portfolio yield for 2009.

The Other Operations segment will continue to manage the discontinued operations of the Company as
well as claims (and associated reserves) related to asbestos, environmental and other exposures.
The Company will continue to review various components of all of its reserves on a regular basis.
The Company expects to perform its regular reviews of asbestos liabilities in the second quarter of
2009, Other Operations reinsurance recoverables and the allowance for uncollectible reinsurance in
the second quarter 2009, and environmental liabilities in the third quarter of 2009. If there are
significant developments that affect particular exposures, reinsurance arrangements or the
financial condition of particular reinsurers, the Company will make adjustments to its reserves, or
the portion of liabilities it expects to cede to reinsurers.



LIFE

Executive Overview

Life provides retail and institutional investment products such as variable and fixed annuities,
mutual funds, PPLI, and retirement plan services, individual life insurance and group benefit
products, such as group life and group disability insurance.

Retail offers individual variable and fixed market value adjusted (“MVA”) annuities, retail mutual
funds, 529 college savings plans, Canadian and offshore investment products.

Individual Life sells a variety of life insurance products, including variable universal life,
universal life, interest sensitive whole life and term life.

Retirement Plans offers retirement plan products and services to corporations and municipalities
under Section 401(k), 403(b) and 457 plans.

Group Benefits provides individual members of employer groups, associations, affinity groups and
financial institutions with group life, accident and disability coverage, along with other products
and services, including voluntary benefits and group retiree health.

International, which has operations located in Japan, Brazil, Ireland and the United Kingdom,
provides investments, retirement savings and other insurance and savings products to individuals
and groups outside the United States and Canada.

Institutional provides customized investment, insurance, and income solutions to select markets.
Products include structured settlements, institutional annuities (primarily terminal funding
cases), stable value products, and income annuities. Furthermore, Institutional offers variable
private placement life insurance (“PPLI”) owned by corporations and high net worth individuals, as
well as mutual funds owned by institutional investors.

Life charges direct operating expenses to the appropriate segment and allocates the majority of
indirect expenses to the segments based on an intercompany expense arrangement. Inter-segment
revenues primarily occur between Life’s Other category and the reporting segments. These amounts
primarily include interest income on allocated surplus and interest charges on excess separate
account surplus.

Life derives its revenues principally from: (a) fee income, including asset management fees, on
separate account and mutual fund assets and mortality and expense fees, as well as cost of
insurance charges; (b) net investment income on general account assets; (c) fully insured premiums;
and (d) certain other fees. Asset management fees and mortality and expense fees are primarily
generated from separate account assets, which are deposited with Life through the sale of variable
annuity and variable universal life products and from mutual funds. Cost of insurance charges are
assessed on the net amount at risk for investment-oriented life insurance products. Premium
revenues are derived primarily from the sale of group life, group disability and individual term
insurance products.

Life’s expenses essentially consist of interest credited to policyholders on general account
liabilities, insurance benefits provided, amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs,
expenses related to selling and servicing the various products offered by the Company, dividends to
policyholders, and other general business expenses.

Life’s financial results in its variable annuity, mutual fund and, to a lesser extent, variable
universal life businesses, depends largely on the amount of the contract holder account value or
assets under management on which it earns fees and the level of fees charged. Changes in account
value or assets under management are driven by two main factors: net flows, which measure the
success of the Company’s asset gathering and retention efforts, and the market return of the funds,
which is heavily influenced by the return realized in the equity markets. Net flows are comprised
of new sales and other deposits less surrenders, death benefits, policy charges and annuitizations
of investment type contracts, such as variable annuity contracts. In the mutual fund business, net
flows are known as net sales. Net sales are comprised of new sales less redemptions by mutual fund
customers. Life uses the average daily value of the S&P 500 Index as an indicator for evaluating
market returns of the underlying account portfolios in the United States. Relative financial
results of variable products is highly correlated to the growth in account values or assets under
management since these products generally earn fee income on a daily basis. Equity market
movements could also result in benefits for or charges against deferred acquisition costs. See the
Critical Accounting Estimates section of the MD&A for further information on DAC unlocks. During
2008, primarily as a result of current market conditions, the Company recorded an unlock charge of
$932.

The profitability of Life’s fixed annuities and other “spread-based” products depends largely on
its ability to earn target spreads between earned investment rates on its general account assets
and interest credited to policyholders. Profitability is also influenced by operating expense
management including the benefits of economies of scale in the administration of its United States
variable annuity businesses in particular. In addition, the size and persistency of gross profits
from these businesses is an important driver of earnings as it affects the rate of amortization of
deferred policy acquisition costs.

Life’s profitability in its individual life insurance and group benefits businesses depends largely
on the size of its in force block, the adequacy of product pricing and underwriting discipline,
actual mortality and morbidity experience, and the efficiency of its claims and expense management.



Performance Measures

Fee Income

Fee income is largely driven from amounts collected as a result of contractually defined
percentages of assets under management. These fees are generally collected on a daily basis. For
individual life insurance products, fees are contractually defined as percentages based on levels
of insurance, age, premiums and deposits collected and contract holder value. Life insurance fees
are generally collected on a monthly basis. Therefore, the growth in assets under management
either through positive net flows or net sales, or favorable equity market performance will have a
favorable impact on fee income. Conversely, either negative net flows or net sales, or unfavorable
equity market performance will reduce fee income.

Year ended December 31, 2008 compared to year ended December 31, 2007

Assets under management, across all businesses have had substantial reductions in values from prior
year primarily due to declines in equity markets during 2008. The changes in line of business
assets under management have also been affected by:

•

Retail U.S. individual variable annuity recorded increased negative net flows as a result
of increased competition and equity market volatility.

•

Retail Mutual funds has seen positive net sales as a result of diversified sales growth.

•

Individual Life insurance in-force growth has occurred across multiple product lines,
including term, universal life and variable universal life.

•

Retirement Plans group annuities has seen positive net flows driven by higher deposits as a
result of the expanded sales force obtained through the 2008 acquisitions.



•

Retirement Plans mutual funds reflects an increase of $18.7 billion from the acquisition of
servicing rights of Sun Life Retirement Services, Inc and Princeton Retirement Group, both of
which closed in the first quarter of 2008. Net sales for 2008 reflect expected outflows on
the acquired business.

•

International — Japan Annuities has seen positive net flows and favorable effects from
currency exchange rates for 2008. Net flows have decreased in Japan annuities due the 3 Win
trigger and to increased competition from domestic and foreign insurers, particularly
competition relating to products offered with living benefit guarantees.

Year ended December 31, 2007 compared to year ended December 31, 2006

•

Increases in Retail U.S. individual variable annuity account values as of December 31, 2007
can be primarily attributed to market growth during the year and improved net flows due to an
increase in sales.

•

In addition to strong positive net flows, market appreciation and diversified sales growth
during the year contributed to Retail mutual funds assets under management growth.

•

Individual Life variable universal life account values increased primarily due to market
appreciation and positive net flows. Life insurance in-force increased from the prior periods
due to business growth.

•

Retirement Plans account values increased for the year ended December 31, 2007 due to
positive net flows driven by ongoing contributions and market appreciation during the year.

•

International — Japan annuity account values continue to grow as a result of positive net
flows and a strengthening of the yen versus the dollar offset by a decline in market
performance throughout the year

Net Investment Spread

Management evaluates performance of certain products based on net investment spread. These
products include those that have insignificant mortality risk, such as fixed annuities, certain
general account universal life contracts and certain institutional contracts. Net investment
spread is determined by taking the difference between the earned rate and the related crediting
rates on average general account assets under management. The net investment spreads shown below
are for the total portfolio of relevant contracts in each segment and reflect business written at
different times. When pricing products, the Company considers current investment yields and not
the portfolio average. Net investment spread can be volatile period over period, which can have a
significant positive or negative effect on the operating results of each segment. Investment
earnings can also be influenced by factors such as the actions of the Federal Reserve and a
decision to hold higher levels of short-term investments. The volatile nature of net investment
spread is driven primarily by prepayment premiums on securities and earnings on limited partnership
and other alternative investments.

Net investment spread is calculated as a percentage of general account assets and expressed in
basis points (“bps”):

Year ended December 31, 2008 compared to year ended December 31, 2007

•

Retail — Individual Annuity, Individual Life, Retirement Plans and Institutional net
investment spread decreased primarily due to negative earnings on limited partnership and
other alternative investment income in 2008 compared to strong earnings in these classes in
2007 and lower yields on fixed maturities, partially offset by reduced credited rates.

Year ended December 31, 2007 compared to year ended December 31, 2006

•

Retail — Individual Annuity, Individual Life, Retirement Plans and Institutional net
investment spreads increased primarily due to a higher allocation of investments in higher
yield/higher risk investment classes, including limited partnerships and other alternative
investments and relative strong performance of this asset class in 2007.



Premiums

Traditional insurance type products, such as those sold by Group Benefits, collect premiums from
policyholders in exchange for financial protection for the policyholder from a specified insurable
loss, such as death or disability. These premiums together with net investment income earned from
the overall investment strategy are used to pay the contractual obligations under these insurance
contracts. Two major factors, new sales and persistency, impact premium growth. Sales can
increase or decrease in a given year based on a number of factors, including but not limited to,
customer demand for the Company’s product offerings, pricing competition, distribution channels and
the Company’s reputation and ratings. Persistency refers to the percentage of policies remaining
in-force from year-to-year.

•

Earned premiums and other considerations include $1, $27 and $12 in buyout premiums for the
years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Total premiums and other
considerations, excluding buyouts, increased in 2008 compared to 2007 due to increases in
sales and persistency that were offset by lower premiums in the medical stop loss business as
a result of the renewal rights transaction that closed during the second quarter of 2007. The
increase in premiums and other considerations for Group Benefits in 2007 compared to 2006 was
driven by growth in the block of business.

•

Fully insured ongoing sales, excluding buyouts, increased in 2008 from 2007 primarily due
to national account and small case sales growth. Fully insured ongoing sales, excluding
buyouts, declined in 2007 from 2006 primarily due to fewer large national account sales, and
the small case competitive environment remained intense. The Company also completed a
renewal rights arrangement associated with its medical stop loss business during the second
quarter of 2007 eliminating new sales related to this business. In addition, there was an
anticipated decrease in association life sales from an unusually high comparable prior year
period.

Expenses

There are three major categories for expenses. The first major category of expenses is benefits
and losses. These include the costs of mortality and morbidity, particularly in the group benefits
business, and mortality in the individual life businesses, as well as other contractholder benefits
to policyholders. In addition, traditional insurance type products generally use a loss ratio
which is expressed as the amount of benefits incurred during a particular period divided by total
premiums and other considerations, as a key indicator of underwriting performance. Since Group
Benefits occasionally buys a block of claims for a stated premium amount, the Company excludes this
buyout from the loss ratio used for evaluating the underwriting results of the business as buyouts
may distort the loss ratio.

The second major category is insurance operating costs and expenses, which is commonly expressed in
a ratio of a revenue measure depending on the type of business. The third major category is the
amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs and the present value of future profits, which is
typically expressed as a percentage of pre-tax income before the cost of this amortization (an
approximation of actual gross profits). Retail — Individual Annuity business accounts for the
majority of the amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs and present value of future
profits for Life.

Year ended December 31, 2008 compared to year ended December 31, 2007

•

The Retail DAC amortization ratio (individual annuity), excluding the effects of the 2008
Unlock and realized losses, increased due to the impairment of goodwill in the fourth quarter
of 2008, which reduced pre tax earnings but did not affect EGPs. Excluding the impacts of the
goodwill impairment, realized losses, and DAC Unlock, the DAC amortization ratio was 43.3%,
which reflects the 2008 effect of changes in assumptions made as part of the 2007 and 2008
Unlocks.

•

The Retail general insurance expense ratio increased due to the impact of a declining asset
base on relatively consistent expenses.

•

Individual Life death benefits increased, primarily due to growth of life insurance
in-force and unfavorable mortality.

•

Group Benefits loss ratio decreased due to favorable disability and medical stop loss
experience partially offset by unfavorable mortality.

•

Group Benefits expense ratio, excluding buyouts decreased primarily due to lower commission
expense.

•

International — Japan DAC amortization ratio, excluding DAC Unlock and certain realized
gains or losses, increased due to actual gross profits being less than expected as a result of
lower fees earned on declining assets resulting in negative true-ups and a higher DAC
amortization rate, as well as the accelerated amortization associated with the impact of the 3
Win trigger.

•

Institutional general insurance expense ratio is unchanged, as additional product
development expenses were offset by higher assets under management.

Year ended December 31, 2007 compared to year ended December 31, 2006

•

Retail — Individual Annuity general insurance expense ratio increased in 2007 primarily due
to higher service and technology costs.

•

The Retail DAC amortization ratio (individual annuity) excluding DAC Unlock declined in
2007, primarily due to increased net investment income on allocated capital and an increase in
limited partnership and other alternative investment income.

•

Individual Life death benefits increased in 2007 primarily due to growth of life insurance
in-force and unfavorable mortality.

•

Group Benefits expense ratio, excluding buyouts, increased in 2007 primarily due to higher
DAC amortization.

•

Institutional general insurance expense ratio decreased in 2007 primarily due to higher
assets under management.



Profitability

Management evaluates the rates of return various businesses can provide as an input in determining
where additional capital should be invested to increase net income and shareholder returns. The
Company uses the return on assets for the individual annuity business for evaluating profitability.
In Group Benefits and Individual Life, after-tax margin is a key indicator of overall
profitability.

Year ended December 31, 2008 compared to year ended December 31, 2007

•

The decrease in Individual Annuity’s ROA, excluding realized gains (losses) and the effect
of the DAC Unlock, reflects the write-off of goodwill of $274 after-tax, or 19.4 bps; lower
limited partnership and other alternative investment income; and the net effect of lower fees.

•

The decrease in Individual Life’s after-tax margin, excluding realized gains (losses) and
the effect of the DAC Unlock, was due to lower net investment income from limited partnership
and other alternative investments, unfavorable mortality expense, reduced net investment
income associated with a more efficient capital approach for our secondary guarantee universal
life business which released assets supporting capital and lower variable life insurance fees
from equity market declines, partially offset by life insurance in-force growth, lower
credited rates and higher surrender charges.

•

The decrease in Retirement Plans ROA, excluding realized gains (losses) and the effect of
the DAC Unlock, was primarily driven by an increase in assets under management due to the
acquired rights to service $18.7 billion in mutual funds, comprised of $15.8 billion in mutual
funds from Sun Life Retirement Services, Inc., and $2.9 billion in mutual funds from Princeton
Retirement Group, both of which closed in the first quarter of 2008. The acquired blocks of
assets produce a lower ROA as they are comprised of mutual fund assets and assets under
administration as opposed to traditional annuity contracts. Also contributing to the decrease
was lower yields on fixed maturity investments and a decline in limited partnership and other
alternative investment income, higher service and technology costs and additional expenses
associated with the acquisitions. Partially offsetting these decreases were tax benefits
primarily associated with DRD.



•

The Group Benefit increase in after-tax margin was primarily due to the favorable expense ratio.

•

International-Japan ROA, excluding realized gains (losses) and the effect of the DAC
Unlock, declined due to lower earned fees as a result of declining account values, lower
surrender fees due to a reduction in lapses and an increase in the DAC amortization rate due
to lower actual gross profits, as well as the accelerated DAC amortization associated with the
3 Win trigger.

•

The decrease in Institutional’s ROA, excluding realized gains (losses), is primarily due to
a decline in limited partnership and other alternative investment income. The decrease is
also due to unfavorable mortality and lower yields on fixed maturity investments.

Year ended December 31, 2007 compared to year ended December 31, 2006

•

The increase in Individual
Annuity’s ROA, excluding realized gains (losses) and DAC Unlock,
was primarily due to increased net investment income on allocated capital and an increase in
limited partnership and other alternative investment income. This was partially offset by an
increase in the effective tax rate as a result of revisions in the estimates of the separate
account DRD and FTC.

•

Individual Life’s decrease in after-tax margin, excluding realized gains (losses) and DAC
Unlock, was primarily due to unfavorable mortality experience.

•

The decrease in Retirement Plan’s ROA, excluding realized gains (losses) and DAC Unlock,
was primarily due to a shift in product mix resulting in lower fees as a percent of assets.

•

The increase in Institutional’s ROA, excluding realized gains (losses) and DAC Unlock, was
primarily due to an increase in limited partnership and other alternative investment income
and increased net investment income on allocated capital.

•

The increase in the Group Benefits after-tax margin, excluding buyouts, excluding realized
gains (losses), was due to an improvement in the loss ratio, partially offset by higher DAC
amortization.

The transition impact related to the SFAS 157 adoption was a reduction
in revenues of $650 for the year ended December 31, 2008. For further
discussion of the SFAS 157 transition impact, refer to Note 4 of the
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

[3]

The transition impact related to the SFAS 157 adoption was a reduction
in net income of $220 for the year ended December 31, 2008. For
further discussion of the SFAS 157 transition impact, refer to Note 4
of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Year ended December 31, 2008 compared to the year ended December 31, 2007

The decrease in Life’s net income was due to the following:

•

Realized losses increased as compared to the comparable prior year period primarily due to
net losses from the adoption of SFAS 157 and impairments on investment securities. For further
discussion, please refer to the Realized Capital Gains and Losses by Segment table under
Life’s Operating Section of the MD&A.

•

Life recorded a DAC unlock charge of $941, after-tax, during the third quarter of 2008 as
compared to a DAC unlock benefit of $210, after-tax, during the third quarter of 2007. See
Critical Accounting Estimates with Managements Discussion and Analysis for a further
discussion on the DAC unlock.

•

Declines in assets under management in Retail, primarily driven by market depreciation of
$37.8 billion for Individual Annuity and $20.2 billion for retail mutual funds during 2008,
drove declines in fee income compared to 2007.



•

Net investment income on securities, available-for-sale, and other declined primarily due
to declines in limited partnership and other alternative investments income and a decrease in
investment yield for fixed maturities.

•

A goodwill impairment of $274, after-tax, in Retail.

•

The effect of the triggering of the guaranteed minimum income benefit for the 3 Win product
was $151, after-tax.

Year ended December 31, 2007 compared to the year ended December 31, 2006

The increase in Life’s net income was due to the following:

•

The DAC Unlock benefit of $210 recorded in the third quarter of 2007.

•

Increased income on asset growth in the variable annuity, mutual fund, retirement and
institutional businesses.

Partially offsetting the increase in Life’s net income were the following:

•

Increased non-deferrable individual annuity asset based commissions.

•

Unfavorable mortality in Individual Life.

•

Increased DAC amortization in Group Benefits due to the adoption of SOP 05-1.

•

During the first quarter of 2006, the Company achieved favorable settlements in several
cases brought against the Company by policyholders regarding their purchase of broad-based
leveraged corporate owned life insurance (“leveraged COLI”) policies in the early to mid-1990s
and therefore, released a reserve for these matters of $34, after-tax.

•

Realized losses increased for the year ended December 31, 2007 as compared to the
comparable prior year periods primarily due to net losses on GMWB derivatives and impairments.

The circumstances giving rise to the changes in these components are as follows:

Year ended December 31, 2008 compared to the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006

Gross Gains and Losses on Sale

•

Gross gains and losses on
sales for the year ended December
31, 2008 primarily resulted from the
decision to reallocate the portfolio
to securities with more favorable
risk/return profiles. Also included
was a gain of $141 from the sale of
a synthetic CDO, as well as losses
on sales of HIMCO managed CLOs in
the first quarter. For more
information regarding these CLO
losses, refer to the Variable
Interest Entities section below.
During the year ended December 31,
2008, securities sold at a loss were
depressed, on average, approximately
2% at the respective period’s
impairment review date and were
deemed to be temporarily impaired.

•

Gross gains and losses on
sales for the year ended December
31, 2007 were primarily comprised of
corporate securities. During the
year ended December 31, 2007,
securities sold at a loss were
depressed, on average, approximately
1% at the respective period’s
impairment review date and were
deemed to be temporarily impaired.

•

Gross gains on sales for the
year ended December 31, 2006 were
primarily within fixed maturities
and were concentrated in U.S.
government, corporate and foreign
government securities. Gross losses
on sale for the year ended December
31, 2006 were primarily within fixed
maturities and were concentrated in
the corporate and CMBS sectors.

predominately on the internal
reinsurance of the Japan variable
annuity business, which is entirely
offset in AOCI, resulting from
appreciation of the Yen and credit
derivative losses of $222 due to
significant credit spread widening.
Also included were losses on HIMCO
managed CLOs in the first quarter
and derivative related losses of $39
in the third quarter due to
counterparty default related to the
bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers
Holdings Inc. For more information
regarding the CLO losses, refer to
the Variable Interest Entities
section below.

•

Other, net losses for the
year ended December 31, 2007 were
primarily driven by the change in
value of non-qualifying derivatives
due to credit spread widening as
well as fluctuations in interest
rates and foreign currency exchange
rates. Credit spreads widened
primarily due to the deterioration
in the U.S. housing market,
tightened lending conditions and the
market’s flight to quality
securities.

•

Other, net losses for the
year ended December 31, 2006 were
primarily driven from the change in
value of non-qualifying derivatives
due to fluctuations in interest
rates and foreign currency exchange
rates. These losses were partially
offset by a before-tax benefit of
$25 received from the WorldCom
security settlement.

Retail focuses on the savings and retirement needs of the growing number of individuals who are
preparing for retirement, or have already retired, through the sale of individual variable and
fixed annuities, mutual funds and other investment products. Life is both a leading writer of
individual variable annuities and a top seller of individual variable annuities through banks in
the United States.

Year ended December 31, 2008 compared to the year ended December 31, 2007

Net income decreased primarily as a result of increased realized capital losses, the impact of the
2008 Unlock charge, the impairment of goodwill attributed to the individual annuity line of
business and the effect of equity market declines on variable annuity and mutual fund fee income.
Included in net realized capital losses in 2008 were changes in value on GMWB derivatives,
impairments, and the adoption of SFAS 157 during the first quarter of 2008. For further discussion
of the SFAS 157 transition impact, see Note 4 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial
Statements. For further discussion of realized capital losses, see the Realized Capital Gains and
Losses by Segment table under Life’s Operating Section of the MD&A. For further discussion of the
2008 and 2007 Unlock; and the impairment of goodwill, see the Critical Accounting Estimates section
of the MD&A. The following other factors contributed to the changes in net income:

Fee income and other

•

Fee income and other decreased $360 primarily
as a result of lower variable annuity fee income due
to a decline in average account values. The decrease
in average variable annuity account values can be
attributed to market depreciation of $38.2 billion
and net outflows of $6.2 billion during the year.
Net outflows were driven by surrender activity
resulting from the aging of the variable annuity
in-force block of business; increased sales
competition, particularly competition related to
guaranteed living benefits, and volatility in the
equity markets. Also contributing to the decrease in
fee income was lower mutual fund fees due to
declining assets under management primarily driven by
market depreciation of $20.1 billion, partially
offset by $2.8 billion of net flows.

Earned Premiums

•

Earned Premiums increased primarily due to an
increase in life contingent premiums combined with a
decrease in reinsurance premiums as a result of the
lapsing of business covered by reinsurance and the
significant decline in the equity markets.



Net investment income

•

Net investment income was
lower primarily due to a $77 decline
in income from limited partnerships
and other alternative investments,
combined with lower yields on fixed
maturity investments due to interest
rate declines, partially offset by
an increase in general account
assets from increased fixed account
sales.

Net realized capital losses

•

Net realized capital losses
increased primarily as a result of
losses on GMWB derivatives of
$(631); the adoption of SFAS 157
during the first quarter of 2008,
which resulted in realized capital
losses of $(616); and impairments of
$(474).

Benefits, losses and loss adjustment
expenses

•

Benefits, losses and loss
adjustment expenses increased
primarily as a result of the impact
of the 2008 Unlock which increased
the benefit ratio used in the
calculation of GMDB reserves.

Insurance operating costs and other
expenses

•

Insurance operating costs
and other expenses decreased
primarily as a result of lower non
deferrable asset based trail
commissions due to equity market
declines.

Amortization of deferred policy
acquisition costs and present value
of future profits (“DAC”)

•

Amortization of DAC
increased primarily due to the
impact of the 2008 Unlock charge as
compared to the 2007 Unlock benefit.
This was partially offset by a DAC
benefit associated with the adoption
of SFAS 157 at the beginning of the
first quarter of 2008.

Goodwill impairment

•

As a result of testing
performed during the fourth quarter
of 2008, all goodwill attributed to
the individual annuity business in
Retail was deemed to be impaired and
was written down to $0. For further
discussion of this impairment, see
the Critical Accounting Estimates
section of the MD&A.

Income tax expense (benefit)

•

The effective tax rate
increased from 21% to 41% for the
year ended December 31, 2008 as
compared to the prior year primarily
due to losses before income taxes in
2008 compared to pre-tax earnings in
2007. The impact of DRD and other
permanent differences caused an
increase in the tax benefit to above
35% on the 2008 pre tax loss and a
decrease in the tax expense on the
2007 pre tax income.



Year ended December 31, 2007 compared to the year ended December 31, 2006

Net income in Retail increased for the year ended December 31, 2007, primarily driven by lower
amortization of DAC resulting from the unlock benefit in the third quarter of 2007, fee income
growth in the variable annuity and mutual fund businesses, partially offset by increased
non-deferrable individual annuity asset based commissions and mutual fund commissions. In
addition, realized capital losses increased $294 for the year ended December 31, 2007 as compared
to 2006. For further discussion, see Realized Capital Gains and Losses by Segment table under
Life’s Operating Section of the MD&A. A more expanded discussion of income growth is presented
below:

Fee income and other

•

Fee income increased for the
year ended December 31, 2007
primarily as a result of growth in
variable annuity average account
values. The year-over-year increase
in average variable annuity account
values can be attributed to market
appreciation of $7.4 billion during
the year. Variable annuities had
net outflows of $2.7 billion in
2007. Net outflows were driven by
surrender activity due to the aging
of the variable annuity in force
block of business and increased
sales competition, particularly
competition related to guaranteed
living benefits.

•

Mutual fund fee income
increased 23% for the year ended
December 31, 2007 due to increased
assets under management driven by
net sales of $5.5 billion and market
appreciation of $4.4 billion during
2007.

Net investment income

•

Net investment income
declined for the year ended December
31, 2007 due to a decrease in
variable annuity fixed option
account values of 11% or $635. The
decrease in these account values can
be attributed to a combination of
transfers into separate accounts and
surrender activity. Offsetting this
decrease in net investment income
was an increase in the returns from
limited partnership and other
alternative investment income of $14
for the year ended December 31,
2007.

Insurance operating costs and other
expenses

•

Insurance operating costs
and other expenses increased for the
year ended December 31, 2007. These
increases were principally driven by
mutual fund commission increases of
$75 for the year ended December 31,
2007 due to growth in deposits of
29%. In addition, non-deferrable
variable annuity asset based
commissions increased $67 for the
year ended December 31, 2007 due to
a 4% growth in assets under
management, as well as an increase
in the number of contracts reaching
anniversaries when trail commission
payments begin.

Amortization of deferred policy
acquisition costs and present value
of future profits (“DAC”)

•

Lower amortization of DAC
resulted from the unlock benefit
during the third quarter of 2007 as
compared to an unlock expense during
the fourth quarter of 2006. For
further discussion, see Unlock and
Sensitivity Analysis in the Critical
Accounting Estimates section of the
MD&A.

Income tax expense (benefit)

•

The effective tax rate
increased from 7% to 21% for the
year ended December 31, 2007 from
the prior year due to an increase in
income before income taxes and
revisions in the estimates of the
separate account DRD which resulted
in an incremental tax of $17, and
foreign tax credits.

Individual Life provides life insurance solutions to a wide array of business intermediaries to
solve the wealth protection, accumulation and transfer needs of their affluent, emerging affluent
and small business insurance clients.

Year ended December 31, 2008 compared to the year ended December 31, 2007

Net income decreased for the year ended December 31, 2008, driven primarily by significantly higher
realized capital losses and the impacts of the Unlock in the third quarter of 2008 as compared to
the third quarter of 2007. For further discussion on the Unlock, see Unlock and Sensitivity
Analysis in the Critical Accounting Estimates section of the MD&A. For further discussion of net
realized capital losses, see Realized Capital Gains and Losses by Segment table under Life’s
Operating Section of the MD&A. The following other factors contributed to the changes in net
income:

Fee income and other

•

Fee income and other
increased primarily due to an
increase in cost of insurance
charges of $45 as a result of
growth in guaranteed universal life
insurance in-force and fees on
higher surrenders of $12 due to
internal exchanges from
non-guaranteed universal life
insurance to variable universal
life insurance. Partially
offsetting these increases are the
impacts of the 2008 and 2007
Unlocks as well as lower variable
life fees as a result of equity
market declines.

Earned premiums

•

Earned premiums, which
include premiums for ceded
reinsurance, decreased primarily
due to increased ceded reinsurance
premiums due to life insurance
in-force growth.

Net investment income

•

Net investment income
decreased primarily due to lower
income from limited partnership and
other alternative investments,
lower yields on fixed maturity
investments, and reduced net
investment income associated with a
more efficient capital approach for
our secondary guarantee universal
life business, which released
assets supporting capital and the
related net investment income
earned on those assets (described
further in the “Outlook” section),
partially offset by growth in
general account values.

Benefits, losses and loss adjustment
expenses

•

Benefits, losses and loss
adjustment expenses increased as a
result of higher death benefits
consistent with a larger life
insurance in-force and unfavorable
mortality, as well as the impact of
the 2008 Unlock.



Insurance operating costs and other
expenses

•

Insurance operating costs
and other increased less than the
growth of in-force business as a
result of active expense management
efforts.

Amortization of deferred policy
acquisition costs and present value
of future profits (“DAC”)

•

Amortization of DAC
increased primarily as a result of
the unlock expense in 2008 as
compared to the unlock benefit in
2007, partially offset by reduced
DAC amortization primarily
attributed to net realized capital
losses. This increase in DAC
amortization had a partial offset in
amortization of deferred revenues,
included in fee income.

Income tax expense (benefit)

•

Income tax benefits were a
result of lower income before income
taxes primarily due to an increase
in realized capital losses and DAC
amortization.

Year ended December 31, 2007 compared to the year ended December 31, 2006

Net income increased for the year ended December 31, 2007, driven primarily by the unlock benefit
in the third quarter of 2007 as compared to an unlock expense in the fourth quarter of 2006
partially offset by unfavorable mortality in 2007. For further discussion on the Unlock, see
Unlock and Sensitivity Analysis in the Critical Accounting Estimates section of the MD&A. The year
ended December 31, 2006 also included favorable revisions to prior period DAC estimates of $7,
after-tax. A more expanded discussion of income growth is presented below:

Fee income and other

•

Fee income and other
decreased primarily due to the
impacts of the 2007 and 2006
Unlocks. Offsetting the impacts of
the Unlocks, fee income increased
primarily due to higher cost of
insurance charges, the largest
component of fee income, of $35
primarily driven by growth in
variable universal and universal
life insurance in-force. Variable
fee income increased consistent
with the growth in variable
universal life insurance account
value.

Earned premiums

•

Earned premiums, which
include premiums for ceded
reinsurance, decreased primarily
due to increased ceded reinsurance
premiums.

Net investment income

•

Net investment income
increased consistent with growth in
general account values. Individual
Life earned additional net
investment income throughout 2007
associated with higher returns from
limited partnerships and other
alternative investments.

Benefits, losses and loss adjustment
expenses

•

Benefits, losses and loss
adjustment expenses increased due
to life insurance in-force growth
and unfavorable mortality.

Insurance operating costs and other
expenses

•

Insurance operating costs
and other expenses increased in
2007 consistent with life insurance
in-force growth.

Amortization of deferred policy
acquisition costs and present value
of future profits (“DAC”)

•

Lower amortization of DAC
resulted from the unlock benefit in
2007 as compared to an unlock
expense in 2006. This decrease in
DAC amortization had a partial
offset in amortization of deferred
revenues, included in fee income.

In 2007, Life began selling mutual fund based products in the 403(b) market.

[3]

During the year ended December 31, 2008, Life acquired the rights to service mutual fund assets from Sun Life Retirement
Services, Inc., and Princeton Retirement Group.

[4]

During the year ended December 31, 2008, Life acquired the rights to service assets under administration (“AUA”) from
Princeton Retirement Group. Servicing revenues from AUA are based on the number of plan participants and do not vary
directly with asset levels. As such, they are not included in AUM upon which asset based returns are calculated.

The Retirement Plans segment primarily offers customized wealth creation and financial protection
for corporate, government and tax-exempt employers through its two business units, 403(b)/457 and
401(k).

Year ended December 31, 2008 compared to the year ended December 31, 2007

Net income in Retirement Plans decreased due to higher net realized capital losses, the DAC Unlock
in 2008 as compared to 2007 and increased operating expenses partially offset by growth in fee
income. For further discussion of net realized capital losses, see Realized Capital Gains and
Losses by Segment table under Life’s Operating section of the MD&A. For further discussion of the
2008 and 2007 Unlocks see Critical Accounting Estimates section of the MD&A. The following other
factors contributed to the changes in net income:

Fee income and other

•

Fee income and other
increased primarily due to $109 of
fees earned on assets relating to
the acquisitions in the first
quarter of 2008. Offsetting this
increase was lower annuity fees
driven by lower average account
values as a result of market
depreciation of $7.3 billion,
partially offset by positive net
flows of $2.4 billion over the past
four quarters.

Net investment income

•

Net investment income
declined due to a decrease in the
returns from limited partnership and
other alternative investment income
of $33, partially offset by growth
in general account assets.

Insurance operating costs and other
expenses

•

Insurance operating costs
and other expenses increased
primarily attributable to operating
expenses associated with the
acquired businesses. Also
contributing to higher insurance
operating costs were higher trail
commissions resulting from an aging
portfolio and higher service and
technology costs.

Amortization of deferred policy
acquisition costs and present value
of future profits

•

Amortization of deferred
policy acquisition costs increased
as a result of the higher Unlock in
the third quarter of 2008 as
compared to the Unlock in the third
quarter of 2007, partially offset by
lower DAC amortization associated
with lower gross profits. For
further discussion, see Unlock and
Sensitivity Analysis in the Critical
Accounting Estimates section of the
MD&A.

Income tax expense (benefit)

•

The income tax benefit for
2008 as compared to the prior year
periods income tax expense was due
to lower income before income taxes
primarily due to increased realized
capital losses and increased tax
benefits associated with the
dividends received deduction of $12.



Year ended December 31, 2007 compared to the year ended December 31, 2006

Net income in Retirement Plans decreased for the year ended December 31, 2007 due to higher
amortization of DAC as a result of the unlock expense in the third quarter of 2007, partially
offset by a growth in fee income. In addition, realized capital losses increased $25 for the year
ended December 31, 2007 as compared to the prior year period. For further discussion, see Realized
Capital Gains and Losses by Segment table under Life’s Operating Section of the MD&A. The
following other factors contributed to the changes in income:

Fee income and other

•

Fee income increased for the
year ended December 31, 2007
primarily due to an increase in
401(k) average account values. This
growth in 401(k) business is
primarily driven by positive net
flows of $1.8 billion over the past
four quarters resulting from strong
sales and increased ongoing
deposits. Market appreciation
contributed an additional $888 to
assets under management in 2007.

Net investment income

•

Net investment income
increased for the year ended
December 31, 2007 for 403(b)/457
business due to growth in general
account assets along with an
increase in return on limited
partnership and other alternative
investments.

Benefits, losses and loss adjustment
expenses

•

Benefits, losses and loss
adjustment expenses and earned
premiums decreased for the year
ended December 31, 2007 primarily
due to a large case annuitization in
the 401(k) business of $12 which
occurred in the first quarter of
2006. This decrease was partially
offset by an increase in interest
credited resulting from the growth
in general account assets.

Insurance operating costs and other
expenses

•

Insurance operating costs
and other expenses increased for the
year ended December 31, 2007,
primarily attributable to greater
assets under management aging beyond
their first year resulting in higher
trail commissions. Also contributing
to higher insurance operating costs
for the year ended December 31, 2007
were higher service and technology
costs.

Amortization of deferred policy
acquisition costs and present value
of future profits

•

Higher amortization of DAC
resulted from the unlock expense in
the third quarter of 2007 as
compared to an unlock benefit in the
fourth quarter of 2006. For further
discussion, see Unlock and
Sensitivity Analysis in the Critical
Accounting Estimates section of the
MD&A.

The Group Benefits segment provides employers, associations, affinity groups and financial
institutions with group life, accident and disability coverage, along with other products and
services, including voluntary benefits, and group retiree health. The Company also offers
disability underwriting, administration, claims processing services and reinsurance to other
insurers and self-funded employer plans.

Group Benefits has a block of financial institution business that is experience rated. This
business comprised approximately 9% to 10% of the segment’s 2008, 2007 and 2006 premiums and other
considerations (excluding buyouts) respectively, and, on average, 4% to 5% of the segment’s 2008,
2007 and 2006 net income, excluding realized capital gains and losses.

Year ended December 31, 2008 compared to the year ended December 31, 2007

The decrease in net income for the year ended December 31, 2008, was primarily due to increased
realized capital losses. For further discussion, see Realized Capital Gains and Losses by Segment
table under Life’s Operating Section of the MD&A. The following other factors contributed to the
changes in net income:

Premiums and other considerations

•

Premiums and other
considerations increased largely due
to business growth driven by new
sales and persistency over the last
twelve months.

Net investment income

•

Net investment income
decreased primarily as a result of
lower yields on fixed maturity
investments and lower limited
partnership and other alternative
investment returns of $33.

Loss ratio

•

The segment’s loss ratio
(defined as benefits, losses and
loss adjustment expenses as a
percentage of premiums and other
considerations excluding buyouts)
decreased due to favorable
disability and medical stop loss
experience partially offset by
unfavorable mortality.

Expense ratio

•

The segment’s expense ratio,
excluding buyouts decreased compared
to the prior year due primarily to
lower commission expenses.



Year ended December 31, 2007 compared to the year ended December 31, 2006

Net income increased in Group Benefits for the year ended December 31, 2007, primarily due to
higher earned premiums, higher net investment income, a gain on a renewal rights transaction
associated with the Company’s medical stop loss business and a change in assumptions underlying the
valuation of long term disability claims incurred in 2007. Partially offsetting the higher net
income was increased DAC amortization due to the adoption of SOP 05-1. In addition, realized
capital losses increased $17 for the year ended December 31, 2007 as compared to the prior year
period. For further discussion, see Realized Capital Gains and Losses by Segment table under
Life’s Operating Section of the MD&A. A more expanded discussion of income growth is presented
below:

Premiums and other considerations

•

Premiums and other
considerations increased largely due
to business growth driven by new
sales and persistency over the last
twelve months.

Net investment income

•

Net investment income
increased due to a higher invested
asset base and increased interest
income on allocated surplus.

Loss ratio

•

The segment’s loss ratio
(defined as benefits, losses and
loss adjustment expenses as a
percentage of premiums and other
considerations excluding buyouts)
for the year ended December 31,
2007, decreased slightly. Loss
ratios experience volatility in
period over period comparisons due
to fluctuation in mortality and
morbidity experience. Additionally
there was a change in assumptions
underlying the valuation of long
term disability claims incurred in
2007.

Expense ratio

•

The segment’s expense ratio,
excluding buyouts, for the year
ended December 31, 2007, increased
primarily due to higher DAC
amortization resulting from a
shorter amortization period
following the adoption of SOP 05-1.

further discussion of the SFAS 157 transition impact, refer to Note 4
of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

[3]

Japan fixed annuity and other account values includes an increase due
to the net triggering impact of the GMIB pay-out annuity account value
for the 3 Win product of $2.0 billion.

International, with operations in Japan, Brazil, Ireland and the United Kingdom, focuses on the
savings and retirement needs of the growing number of individuals outside the United States who are
preparing for retirement, or have already retired, through the sale of variable annuities, fixed
annuities and other insurance and savings products. The Company’s Japan operation is the largest
component of the International segment.



Year ended December 31, 2008 compared to the year ended December 31, 2007

Net income decreased for the year ended December 31, 2008 as a result of the 2008 Unlock versus the
2007 Unlock along with increased realized capital losses from the adoption of SFAS 157, which
resulted in a net realized capital loss of $34 during the first quarter of 2008, the impact of the
3 Win trigger, impairment charges, increases in insurance operating costs and other expenses,
partially offset by an increase in fee income. For further discussion on the Unlock and 3 Win
trigger, see Unlock and Sensitivity Analysis in the Critical Accounting Estimates section of the
MD&A. For further discussion of the SFAS 157 transition impact, see Note 4 of the Notes to the
Consolidated Financial Statements. For further discussion of realized capital losses, see Realized
Capital Gains and losses by Segment table under Life’s Operating Section of the MD&A. The
following other factors contributed to the changes in net income:

Fee income

•

Fee income increased primarily due to growth in Japan’s variable annuity average
assets under management. The increase in average assets under management over the past four
quarters was driven by deposits of $3.0 billion and a $6.6 billion increase due to foreign
currency exchange translation as the yen strengthened compared to the U.S. dollar. Deposits
and favorable foreign currency exchange were offset by unfavorable market performance of
$10.9 billion.

Benefits, losses
and loss adjustment
expenses

•

Benefits, losses and loss adjustment expense increased as a result of the impacts of
the Unlock in the third quarter of 2008 as compared to the third quarter of 2007, the impact
of the 3 Win trigger, as well as higher GMDB net amount at risk and increased claims costs.
For further discussion of the 3 Win trigger, see Unlock and Sensitivity Analysis in the Critical
Accounting Estimates section of the MD&A.

Insurance operating
costs and other
expenses

•

Insurance operating costs and other expenses increased due to the growth and
strategic investment in the Japan and Other International operations, as well as lower
capitalization of deferred policy acquisition costs, as acquisition costs exceeded pricing
allowables.

Amortization of
deferred policy
acquisition costs

•

Amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs increased as a result of the
impacts of the Unlock in the third quarter of 2008 as compared to the third quarter of 2007,
as well as the accelerated amortization associated with the 3 Win trigger. For further
discussion of the 3 Win trigger see Unlock and Sensitivity Analysis in the Critical
Accounting Estimates section of the MD&A.

Income Tax expense

•

Income tax expense decreased primarily as a result of a decline in income before
taxes.

Year ended December 31, 2007 compared to the year ended December 31, 2006

Net income decreased for the year ended December 31, 2007 due to a lower unlock benefit in 2007
compared with 2006 and an increase in realized capital losses of $28 for the year ended December
31, 2007 as compared to the prior year period. Losses were partially offset by increased fee
income driven by growth in assets under management. For further discussion, see Realized Capital
Gains and Losses by Segment table under Life’s Operating Section of the MD&A. The following other
factors contributed to the change in income:

Fee income

•

Fee income increased for the
year ended December 31, 2007
primarily due to growth in Japan’s
variable annuity assets under
management. As of December 31,
2007, Japan’s variable annuity
assets under management were $35.8
billion, an increase of $6.1 billion
or 21% from the prior year period.
The increase in assets under
management was driven by positive
net flows of $4.5 billion, partially
offset by unfavorable market
performance of $620, which includes
the impact of foreign currency
movements on the Japanese customer’s
foreign assets and a $2.3 billion
increase due to foreign currency
exchange translation as the yen
strengthened compared to the U.S.
dollar.

Benefits, losses and
loss adjustment
expenses

•

The increase in benefits,
losses and loss adjustment expenses
for the year ended December 31, 2007
over the prior year period was due
to the unlock benefit in the fourth
quarter of 2006 exceeding the unlock
benefit in the third quarter of
2007. For further discussion, see
Unlock and Sensitivity Analysis in
the Critical Accounting Estimates
section of the MD&A.

Insurance operating
costs and other
expenses

•

Insurance operating costs
and other expenses increased for the
year ended December 31, 2007 due to
the growth in the Japan operation.

Amortization of deferred policy
acquisition costs and present
value of future profits

•

Higher amortization of DAC
resulted primarily from a decrease
in the 2007 unlock benefit compared
with the prior year period, as well
as overall growth of operations.
For further discussion, see Unlock
and Sensitivity Analysis in the
Critical Accounting Estimates
section of the MD&A.

contracts. Furthermore, Institutional offers individual products including income annuities and
longevity assurance.

Year ended December 31, 2008 compared to the year ended December 31, 2007

Net income in Institutional decreased primarily due to increased net realized capital losses and
lower net investment income. For additional discussion of realized capital losses, see Realized
Capital Gains and Losses by Segment table under Life’s Operating Section of the MD&A. Further
discussion of income is presented below:

Fee income and other

•

Fee income
and other decreased
primarily due to lower
front-end loads on private
placement life insurance
(“PPLI”) cases during 2008.
PPLI collects front-end
loads recorded in fee
income, offset by
corresponding premium taxes
reported in insurance
operating costs and other
expenses. For 2008 and
2007, PPLI deposits of $247
and $5.2 billion,
respectively, resulted in
fee income due to front-end
loads of $2 and $107,
respectively.

Earned premiums

•

Earned
premiums decreased as
compared to the prior year
due to greater amounts of
life contingent business
sold in 2007. The decrease
in earned premiums was
offset by a corresponding
decrease in benefits,
losses, and loss adjustment
expenses.

Net investment income

•

Net
investment income declined
due to a decrease in returns
from limited partnership and
other alternative
investments income of
$(127), lower yields on
fixed maturity investments
indexed to LIBOR, and lower
assets under management.
The decline in yield on
fixed maturities was largely
offset by a corresponding
decrease in interest
credited on liabilities
reported in benefits,
losses, and loss adjustment
expenses. Assets under
management decreased
primarily due to stable
value outflows.

Benefits, losses and loss adjustment expenses

•

Benefits,
losses and loss adjustment
expenses decreased primarily
due to lower reserve
increases as the result of
lower sales in life
contingent business, as well
as lower interest credited
on liabilities indexed to
LIBOR. The decrease was
partially offset by $8
greater mortality loss.

Insurance operating costs and other expenses

•

Insurance
operating costs and other
expenses decreased due to a
decline in premium tax,
driven by reduced PPLI
deposits, partially offset
by discontinued
administrative system
projects and product
development expenses.

Income tax expense (benefit)

•

The income
tax benefit increased
compared to the prior year
primarily due to a decline
in income before taxes
primarily due to increased
realized capital losses.



Year ended December 31, 2007 compared to the year ended December 31, 2006

Net income in Institutional decreased for the year ended December 31, 2007 primarily due to
increased realized capital losses of $151 as compared to 2006. For further discussion, see
Realized Capital Gains and Losses by Segment table under Life’s Operating Section of the MD&A.
Offsetting the impact of realized capital losses, Institutional’s net income increased driven by
higher assets under management, combined with increased returns on general account assets,
primarily due to limited partnership and other alternative investment income. The following other
factors contributed to the changes in income:

Fee income and other

•

Fee income increased for the year ended December 31, 2007 primarily due to higher Mutual Fund and PPLI assets under management on net
flows and change in market appreciation of $5.8 billion and $2.1 billion, respectively, during the year. In addition, PPLI collects front-end loads
recorded in fee income, offset by corresponding premium taxes reported in insurance operating costs and other expenses. During the year ended December
31, 2007, PPLI had deposits of $5.2 billion, which resulted in an increase in fee income due to front-end loads of $107.

Earned premiums

•

Earned premiums increased for the year ended December 31, 2007 primarily as a result of increased structured settlement life contingent
sales, and one large terminal funding life contingent case sold in the third quarter. This increase in earned premiums was offset by a corresponding
increase in benefits, losses and loss adjustment expenses.

Net investment income

•

Net investment income increased due to higher assets under management resulting from positive net flows of $1.5 billion during the
year, and higher returns on limited partnerships and other alternative investments. Net flows were favorable primarily as a result of the Company’s
funding agreement backed Investor Notes program.

Benefits, losses and loss adjustment expenses

•

Benefits, losses and loss adjustment expenses increased as compared to the comparable prior year period primarily due to higher assets
under management, in addition to one large terminal funding life contingent case sold in the third quarter of 2007.

Insurance operating costs and other expenses

•

Insurance operating costs and other expenses increased due to greater premium tax, driven by increased PPLI deposits.

Income tax expense (benefit)

•

The change in income taxes was due to lower income before income taxes primarily driven by the increase in realized capital losses.

Insurance operating costs and other expenses

•

Insurance operating costs and other expenses decreased for the year ended December 31, 2008 as
compared to the prior year period, primarily due to a charge of $21 for regulatory matters in the second quarter of
2007 and reallocation of expenses to the applicable lines of business in 2008.

Year ended December 31, 2007 compared to the year ended December 31, 2006

Insurance operating costs and other expenses

•

During the first quarter of 2006, the Company achieved favorable settlements in several cases brought
against the Company by policyholders regarding their purchase of broad-based leveraged corporate owned life insurance
(“leveraged COLI”) policies in the early to mid-1990s. The Company ceased offering this product in 1996. Based on the
favorable outcome of these cases, together with the Company’s current assessment of the few remaining leveraged COLI
cases, the Company reduced its estimate of the ultimate cost of these cases as of June 30, 2006. This reserve reduction,
recorded in insurance operating costs and other expenses, resulted in an after-tax benefit of $34.

•

Also contributing to the increase in insurance operating costs and other expenses was $18, after-tax, of
interest charged by Corporate on the amount of capital held by the Life operations in excess of the amount needed to
support the capital requirements of the Life Operations for the year ended December 31, 2007

•

The Company recorded a reserve in the second quarter of 2007 for market regulatory matters of $21,
after-tax. During the year, the Company recorded an insurance recovery of $9, after-tax, against the litigation costs
associated with the regulatory matters.

PROPERTY & CASUALTY

Executive Overview

Property & Casualty is organized into five reporting segments: the underwriting segments of
Personal Lines, Small Commercial, Middle Market and Specialty Commercial (collectively “Ongoing
Operations”); and the Other Operations segment. Property & Casualty provides a number of
coverages, as well as insurance related services, to businesses throughout the United States,
including workers’ compensation, property, automobile, liability, umbrella, specialty casualty,
marine, livestock, fidelity, surety, professional liability and directors and officers’ liability
coverages. Property & Casualty also provides automobile, homeowners and home-based business
coverage to individuals throughout the United States as well as insurance-related services to
businesses.

Property & Casualty derives its revenues principally from premiums earned for insurance coverages
provided to insureds, investment income, and, to a lesser extent, from fees earned for services
provided to third parties and net realized capital gains and losses. Premiums charged for
insurance coverages are earned principally on a pro rata basis over the terms of the related
policies in force.

Service fees principally include revenues from third party claims administration services provided
by Specialty Risk Services and revenues from member contact center services provided through the
AARP Health program.

Total Property & Casualty Financial Highlights

Earned Premiums

Earned premium growth is an objective for Personal Lines, Small Commercial and Middle Market.
Earned premium growth is not a specific objective for Specialty Commercial since Specialty
Commercial is largely comprised of transactional businesses where premium writings may fluctuate
based on the segment’s view of perceived market opportunity. Written premiums are earned over the
policy term, which is six months for certain Personal Lines auto business and 12 months for
substantially all of the remainder of the Company’s business. Written pricing, new business growth
and premium renewal retention are factors that contribute to growth in written and earned premium.

Year ended December 31, 2008 compared to the year ended December 31, 2007

Earned Premiums

Total Property & Casualty earned premiums decreased $158, or 2%, primarily due to lower earned
premiums in Middle Market and Specialty Commercial, partially offset by increased earned premiums
in Personal Lines.

Personal Lines

•

Earned premium grew by $37, or 1%, due
to a $97, or 4%, increase in AARP earned premiums,
partially offset by a $60, or 5%, decrease in Agency
and other earned premiums. AARP earned premiums grew
primarily due to modest earned pricing increases for
both auto and homeowners and the effect of new
business premium outpacing non-renewals in the last
nine months of 2007. Agency earned premium decreased
$43, or 4%, largely due to a decline in new business
premium and premium renewal retention since the
middle of 2007, partially offset by the effect of
modest earned pricing increases.

Small Commercial

•

Earned premium decreased slightly, to
$2,724, as a decrease in commercial auto was largely
offset by an increase in worker’s compensation.
Earned premium decreases were largely due to the
effect of non-renewals outpacing new business for
commercial auto business in 2008 and to earned
pricing decreases, largely offset by new business
outpacing non-renewals in workers’ compensation
business over the last nine months of 2007 and first
nine months of 2008.

Middle Market

•

Earned premium decreased by $121, or
5%, driven primarily by decreases in commercial auto,
workers’ compensation and general liability. Earned
premium decreases were driven primarily by a decline
in earned pricing in 2008 and the effect of
non-renewals outpacing new business in commercial
auto and general liability over the last nine months
of 2007 and first nine months of 2008, partially
offset by the effect of new business outpacing
non-renewals in workers’ compensation since the
fourth quarter of 2007.

Specialty Commercial

•

Earned premium decreased by $64, or
4%, driven primarily by a decrease in property earned
premiums and, to a lesser extent, casualty earned
premiums. Property earned premiums decreased due
largely to the Company’s decision to stop writing
specialty property business with large, national
accounts and lower new business and renewal retention
for core excess and surplus lines business. Casualty
earned premiums decreased primarily because of lower
earned premium from captive programs and a decline in
new business premium on loss-sensitive business
written with larger accounts over the last nine
months of 2007 and first three months of 2008.

Year ended December 31, 2007 compared to the year ended December 31, 2006

Earned Premiums

Total Property & Casualty earned premiums increased by $63 due to an increase in Personal Lines and
Small Commercial, partially offset by a decrease in Middle Market and Specialty Commercial.

Personal Lines

•

Earned premium grew by $129, or 3%,
primarily due to an increase in AARP and Agency
earned premiums. AARP earned premium grew primarily
due to an increase in the size of the AARP target
market, the effect of direct marketing programs and
the effect of cross selling homeowners insurance to
insureds who have auto policies. Agency earned
premium grew as a result of an increase in the number
of agency appointments and further refinement of the
Dimensions class plans. Partially offsetting this
growth was the effect of the sale of the Omni
non-standard auto business in the fourth quarter of
2006 which accounted for $127 of earned premium in
2006. Excluding Omni, Personal Lines’ earned
premiums grew $251, or 7%, for the year ended
December 31, 2007.

Small Commercial

•

Earned premium increased $84, or 3%,
primarily due to new business premiums outpacing
non-renewals for workers’ compensation business over
the last six months of 2006 and the first six months
of 2007.

Middle Market

•

Earned premium decreased by $103, or
4%, driven by decreases in all lines, including
commercial auto, general liability, workers’
compensation and property. Earned premium decreases
were driven by declines in earned pricing and premium
renewal retention in all lines and a decline in new
business premiums in all lines except workers’
compensation.

Specialty Commercial

•

Earned premium decreased by $47, or
3%, primarily driven by a decrease in casualty and
property and a decrease in earned premiums assumed
under inter-segment arrangements, partially offset by
an increase in professional liability, fidelity and
surety.

Year ended December 31, 2008 compared to the year ended December 31, 2007

Net income decreased by $1,415, from net income of $1,507 in 2007 to net income of $92 in 2008,
primarily driven by an increase in net realized capital losses and a decrease in net investment
income.

Realized capital gains (losses)

Gross gains (losses) on sales, net

•

Gross gains and losses on sales in 2008 primarily resulted from the sale of corporate fixed maturities resulting from the decision to reallocate the
portfolio to securities with more favorable risk/return profiles. Also included were losses on sales of CLOs in the first quarter for which HIMCO is the collateral
manager. For more information regarding losses on the sale of HIMCO managed CLOs, refer to the Variable Interest Entities section of the “Investments” section of the
MD&A.

•

Gross gains and losses on sales in 2007 were primarily comprised of sales of foreign government, corporate, and municipal fixed maturity securities.

Impairments

•

Impairments of $1.5 billion in 2008 were primarily of subordinated fixed maturities and preferred equities within the financial services sector, as well
as of securitized assets. (See the Other-Than-Temporary Impairments discussion within “Investment Results” in the “Investments” section of the MD&A for more
information on the impairments recorded in 2008).

Other, net

•

Other, net realized capital losses in 2008 were primarily related to net losses on credit derivatives as a result of credit spread widening on credit
derivatives that assume credit exposure. Also included were derivative related losses of $7 for the year ended December 31, 2008 due to counterparty default related to
the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.

•

Other, net realized capital losses in 2007 primarily resulted from the change in value associated with credit derivatives due to credit spreads widening.
Credit spreads widened primarily due to the deterioration in the U.S. housing market, tightened lending conditions, and the market’s flight to quality securities.

Net investment income

•

Investment income decreased $434, or 26%, due to a change from net income to net losses on limited partnerships and other alternative investments in 2008
and decreased fixed maturity income. The net losses on limited partnerships and other alternative investments were largely due to negative returns on hedge funds and
real estate partnerships as a result of the lack of liquidity in the financial markets and credit spreads widening. The decrease in income from fixed maturities was
attributable to lower income on variable rate securities due to declines in short term interest rates as well as an increased allocation to lower yielding U.S.
Treasuries and short-term investments.



Underwriting results

•

Underwriting results before
catastrophes and prior accident year
reserve development increased by $145 as
the result of a lower current accident year
loss and loss adjustment expense ratio
before catastrophes, partially offset by
the effect of the decline in earned
premiums in Middle Market and Specialty
Commercial. The 2008 results benefited
from a lower current accident year loss and
loss adjustment expense ratio before
catastrophes for Small Commercial and
Middle Market workers’ compensation claims,
lower claim frequency on Personal Lines
auto claims and lower non-catastrophe loss
costs on Small Commercial package business,
partially offset by higher non-catastrophe
losses on Middle Market property and
Personal Lines homeowners’ business.

•

The $366 increase in current
accident year catastrophe losses was
primarily due to more severe catastrophes
in 2008, including losses from hurricane
Ike and tornadoes and thunderstorms in the
South and Midwest.

•

The change to favorable
prior accident year reserve development was
largely due to a $210 increase in net
favorable reserve development in Ongoing
Operations, driven largely by an increase
in net reserve releases for workers’
compensation, professional liability and
personal auto liability claims. Refer to
the “Reserves” section of the MD&A for
further discussion.

Net servicing and other income

•

The $21 decrease in net
servicing income was primarily driven by a
decrease in servicing income from the AARP
Health program, Specialty Risk Services and
the Write Your Own flood program and the
write-off of software used in administering
policies for third parties.

Income tax expense

•

Income taxes changed from
income tax expense of $570 in 2007 to an
income tax benefit of $95 in 2008. Despite
near break-even pre-tax income in 2008,
there was a net income tax benefit in 2008
because the income tax benefit on realized
capital losses was greater than the income
tax expense on all other components of
pre-tax income. A portion of the Company’s
net investment income was generated from
tax-exempt securities.



Year ended December 31, 2007 compared to the year ended December 31, 2006

Net income decreased by $12, or 1%, in 2007, primarily driven by a decrease in Ongoing Operations’
current accident year underwriting results before catastrophes and a change to net realized capital
losses, largely offset by an increase in net investment income and a decrease in Other Operations’
net unfavorable reserve development.

Underwriting results

•

Current accident year underwriting results before catastrophes decreased by $256, primarily due to a higher loss and loss adjustment expense ratio before
catastrophes and prior accident year development, partially offset by the effect of exiting the Omni non-standard auto business, which generated a current accident year
underwriting loss before catastrophes in 2006. The higher current accident year loss and loss adjustment expense ratio before catastrophes was driven by increased severity
on Personal Lines auto liability claims, increased frequency on Personal Lines auto property damage claims and, to a lesser extent, increased severity on Personal Lines
homeowners claims and a higher loss and loss adjustment expense ratio for both Small Commercial package business and Middle Market workers’ compensation claims.

•

Current accident year catastrophe losses decreased by $22. The largest catastrophe losses in 2007 were from wildfires in California, spring windstorms in
the Southeast and Northeast, tornadoes and thunderstorms in the Midwest and a December ice storm in the Midwest. Catastrophes in 2006 included tornadoes and hail storms in
the Midwest and windstorms in Texas and on the East coast.

•

The $248 reduction in net unfavorable prior accident year development was due to a $167 decrease in unfavorable reserve development in Other Operations and
an $81 increase in net favorable reserve development in Ongoing Operations. The lower adverse development in Other Operations was primarily due to a $243 charge in 2006 to
recognize the effect of the Equitas agreement and strengthening of the allowance for uncollectible reinsurance, partially offset by a $99 strengthening of reserves in 2007,
primarily related to an adverse arbitration decision. The $81 increase in net favorable reserve development in Ongoing Operations was primarily due to a $151 release of
workers’ compensation loss and loss adjustment expenses reserves in 2007 related to accident years 2002 to 2006, partially offset by an $83 net release of prior accident
year hurricane reserves in 2006. Refer to the “Reserves” section of the MD&A for further discussion.

Realized capital gains (losses)

Gross gains (losses) on sales, net

•

Gross gains and losses on sales in 2007 were primarily comprised of sales of foreign government, corporate, and municipal fixed maturity securities.

•

Gross gains on sales in 2006 were primarily from sales of corporate, foreign government and municipal fixed maturity securities. Gross losses on sales in
2006 were primarily from sales of corporate fixed maturities and CMBS.

Impairments

•

Impairments in 2007 primarily consisted of impairments of asset-backed securities backed by sub-prime residential mortgage loans and impairments of corporate
securities in the financial services and homebuilders sectors. (See the Other-than-Temporary Impairments discussion within Investment Results for more information on the
impairments recorded in 2007.)

Other, net

•

Other net realized capital losses in 2007 were primarily due to decreases in the fair value of non-qualifying derivatives attributable to credit spreads
widening. Credit spreads widened primarily due to the deterioration in the U.S. housing market, tightened lending conditions, and the market’s flight to quality securities.

Net investment income

•

Primarily driving the $201 increase in net investment income was a higher average invested asset base and income earned from a higher portfolio yield. The
increase in the average invested asset base contributing to the increase in investment income was primarily due to positive operating cash flows, partially offset by the
return of capital to Corporate. Contributing to the increase in net investment income was an increase in income from limited partnerships and other alternative
investments, driven by a higher yield on these investments and shifting a greater allocation of investments to these asset classes.

Other expenses

•

The $26 increase in other expenses was primarily due to $49 of interest charged by Corporate on the amount of capital held by the Property & Casualty
operation in excess of the amount needed to support the capital requirements of the Property & Casualty operation, partially offset by a reduction in the estimated cost of
legal settlements in 2007.

Income tax expense

•

Income taxes increased by $19, reflecting the increase in pre-tax income from 2006 to 2007, partially offset by a $20 benefit in 2007 from a tax true-up.



Key Performance Ratios and Measures

The Company considers several measures and ratios to be the key performance indicators for the
property and casualty underwriting businesses. The following table and the segment discussions for
the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 include various ratios and measures of
profitability. Management believes that these ratios and measures are useful in understanding the
underlying trends in The Hartford’s property and casualty insurance underwriting business.
However, these key performance indicators should only be used in conjunction with, and not in lieu
of, underwriting income for the underwriting segments of Personal Lines, Small Commercial, Middle
Market and Specialty Commercial and net income for the Property & Casualty business as a whole,
Ongoing Operations and Other Operations. These ratios and measures may not be comparable to other
performance measures used by the Company’s competitors.

Ongoing Operations earned premium growth

Personal Lines

•

The decrease in the earned premium
growth rate from 2007 to 2008 was due to a
significantly lower growth rate on AARP business and
a change to declining earned premium in Agency,
partially offset by the effect of the sale of Omni in
2006 which lowered the growth rate in 2007.
Excluding Omni, Personal Lines earned premium grew 7%
in 2007. The effects of larger declines in auto and
homeowners’ new business premium and a change to
declining homeowners’ renewal retention since the
middle of 2007 were largely offset by the effect of a
change to modest earned pricing increases in auto.

Small Commercial

•

The earned premium growth rate in 2008
was reduced from moderate earned premium increases in
2007 to no growth in 2008. The decrease in the
growth rate was primarily attributable to slightly
larger earned pricing decreases in 2008 compared to
2007 and a change to decreasing premium renewal
retention since the middle of 2007.

Middle Market

•

Earned premium declined in the
mid-single digits in both 2007 and 2008. The effect
of slightly larger earned pricing decreases in 2008
has been largely offset by the effect of a change to
new business growth since the second quarter of 2008.

Specialty Commercial

•

Earned premium decreased by 4% in 2008
compared to a decrease of 3% in 2007. A larger
earned premium decrease in property and a change from
earned premium growth in professional liability,
fidelity and surety in 2007 to no growth in 2008, was
partially offset by an improvement in the rate of
earned premium decline in casualty. Property earned
premium decreased more significantly in 2008 than in
2007 due, in part, to a decision to stop writing
specialty property business with large, national
accounts. Also contributing to the larger decrease
in property earned premium in 2008 were the effects
of a change to decreasing earned pricing and a change
to decreasing new business in 2008 on core excess and
surplus lines business. The change to no growth in
professional liability, fidelity and surety earned
premium in 2008 was largely due to larger earned
pricing decreases in 2008 than in 2007 and a change
to declining new business in professional liability
since the third quarter of 2007.



Ongoing Operations combined ratio

For 2008, the Ongoing Operations’ combined ratio was relatively flat at 90.7 as a 1.7 point
increase in net favorable non-catastrophe prior accident year reserve development and a 1.6 point
reduction in the current accident year combined ratio before catastrophes and prior year
development was almost entirely offset by a 3.2 point increase in catastrophes, driven by higher
current accident year catastrophes.

Combined ratio before catastrophes and prior accident year development

•

The
combined ratio
before catastrophes
and prior accident
year development
decreased by 1.6
points, to 88.9, as
the effects of a
lower loss and loss
adjustment expense
ratio for Small
Commercial and
Middle Market
workers’
compensation
claims, lower claim
frequency on
Personal Lines auto
claims and lower
non-catastrophe
losses on Small
Commercial package
business were
partially offset by
earned pricing
decreases across
the commercial
lines businesses
and higher
non-catastrophe
losses on Middle
Market property and
Personal Lines
homeowners’
business.

Catastrophes

•

The
catastrophe ratio
increased by 3.2
points, primarily
due to an increase
in current accident
year catastrophes
in 2008, driven by
losses from
hurricane Ike and
losses from
tornadoes and
thunderstorms in
the South and
Midwest.

Non-catastrophe prior accident year development

•

Net
non-catastrophe
prior accident year
reserve development
in Ongoing
Operations was more
favorable in 2008
than in 2007.
Favorable
non-catastrophe
reserve development
of 3.2 points, or
$333, in 2008
included, among
other reserve
changes, a $156
release of reserves
for workers’
compensation
claims, primarily
related to accident
years 2000 to 2007,
a $105 release of
general liability
claims, primarily
related to accident
years 2001 to 2007,
and a $75 release
of reserves for
professional
liability claims
related to accident
years 2003 through
2006. See the
“Reserves” section
for a discussion of
prior accident year
reserve development
for Ongoing
Operations in 2008.

Other Operations net income (loss)

•

Other Operations reported a net loss of $97 in 2008
compared to net income of $30 in 2007. The change
from net income in 2007 to a net loss in 2008 was
primarily due to an increase in net realized
capital losses and lower net investment income,
partially offset by a decrease in net unfavorable
prior accident year reserve development. See the
Other Operations segment MD&A for further
discussion.

Investment yield and average invested assets

•

In 2008, the after-tax investment yield decreased
due to a change from net income to net losses from
limited partnerships and other alternative
investments in 2008 and, to a lesser extent, a
lower investment yield for fixed maturities.

•

Average annual invested assets at cost increased
modestly due to positive operating cash flows,
partially offset by the effects of impairments of
securities and dividends paid to Corporate.



Year ended December 31, 2007 compared to the year ended December 31, 2006

Ongoing Operations earned premium growth

Personal Lines

•

The decrease in the earned premium
growth rate from 2006 to 2007 was due to the
Company’s exit from the Omni non-standard auto
business. Omni, which was sold in the fourth quarter
of 2006, accounted for $127 of earned premium in
2006. Excluding Omni, the Personal Lines earned
premium growth rate was 7% in both 2006 and 2007. In
2007, an increase in the growth rate of AARP earned
premium was offset by the effect of a decrease in the
growth rate of Agency earned premium.

Small Commercial

•

The decrease in the earned premium
growth rate was primarily attributable to a decrease
in new business written premium and premium renewal
retention over the last six months of 2006 and the
first six months of 2007. Also contributing to the
lower growth rate was a decrease in earned pricing.

Middle Market

•

The change from an increase in earned
premium in 2006 to a decrease in earned premium in
2007 was primarily attributable to earned pricing
decreases, a decrease in new business written premium
over the last six months of 2006 and the first six
months of 2007 and a decrease in premium renewal
retention over the first six months of 2007.

Specialty Commercial

•

The rate of decline in Specialty
Commercial earned premium slowed in 2007, primarily
due to a lower earned premium decrease in casualty
and property, partially offset by a lower earned
premium increase in professional liability, fidelity
and surety. Casualty earned premium experienced a
larger decrease in 2006, primarily because of a
decrease in 2006 earned premium from a single captive
insured program that expired in 2005. Earned premium
decreases in property were larger in 2006 than in
2007 as a result of a strategic decision in 2006 not
to renew certain accounts with properties in
catastrophe-prone areas. The growth rate in
professional liability, fidelity and surety earned
premium slowed in 2007 due to a decrease in earned
pricing and a decline in new business growth and
premium renewal retention.

Ongoing Operations combined ratio

For the year ended December 31, 2007, the Ongoing Operations’ combined ratio increased 1.5 points,
to 90.8, due to a 2.5 point increase in the combined ratio before catastrophes and prior accident
year development, partially offset by a 0.8 point improvement in prior accident year reserve
development and the effect of the sale of Omni in the fourth quarter of 2006. Omni had a higher
combined ratio before catastrophes and prior accident year development than other business written
by the Company.

Combined ratio before catastrophes and prior accident year development

•

The
increase in the
combined ratio
before catastrophes
and prior accident
year development,
from 88.0 to 90.5,
was primarily due
to a 1.4 point
increase in the
current accident
year loss and loss
adjustment expense
ratio before
catastrophes and,
to a lesser extent,
an increase in the
expense ratio. The
increase in the
loss and loss
adjustment expense
ratio before
catastrophes and
prior accident year
development was
primarily due to
increased severity
on Personal Lines
auto liability
claims, increased
frequency on
Personal Lines auto
property damage
claims and, to a
lesser extent,
increased severity
on Personal Lines
homeowners claims
and a higher loss
and loss adjustment
expense ratio for
both Small
Commercial package
business and Middle
Market workers’
compensation
claims.
Contributing to the
increase in the
expense ratio was
the effect of a $41
reduction of
estimated Florida
Citizens’
assessments in 2006
related to the 2005
Florida hurricanes.

Catastrophes

•

The
catastrophe ratio
increased,
primarily due to
the effect of net
favorable reserve
development of
prior accident year
catastrophe losses
in 2006. In 2006,
the Company
recognized $83 of
net reserve
releases related to
the 2005 and 2004
hurricanes.

Non-catastrophe prior accident year development

•

Net
non-catastrophe
prior accident year
reserve development
was slightly
unfavorable in
2006, but favorable
in 2007. Favorable
reserve development
in 2007 was largely
attributable to the
release of reserves
for workers’
compensation
claims, primarily
related to accident
years 2002 to 2006.
See the “Reserves”
section for a
discussion of prior
accident year
reserve development
for Ongoing
Operations in 2007.

Other Operations net income (loss)

•

Other Operations reported net income of $30 in 2007 compared to a net loss of $35 in 2006.
The improvement in results was primarily due to a decrease in unfavorable prior accident year
reserve development, partially offset by a change from net realized gains in 2006 to net
realized losses in 2007 and a decrease in net investment income. See the Other Operations
segment MD&A for further discussion.



Investment yield and average invested assets

•

In 2007, the after-tax investment yield increased due to a higher yield on limited
partnerships and other alternative investments and mortgage loans as well as due to a change
in asset mix, including shifting a greater share of investments to these asset classes.

•

The average annual invested assets at cost increased as a result of positive operating cash
flows and an increase in collateral held from increased securities lending activities.

How Property & Casualty seeks to earn income

Net income is a measure of profit or loss used in evaluating the performance of Total Property &
Casualty and the Ongoing Operations and Other Operations segments. Within Ongoing Operations, the
underwriting segments of Personal Lines, Small Commercial, Middle Market and Specialty Commercial
are evaluated by The Hartford’s management primarily based upon underwriting results. Underwriting
results within Ongoing Operations are influenced significantly by changes in earned premium and the
adequacy of the Company’s pricing. Underwriting profitability over time is also greatly influenced
by the Company’s underwriting discipline, which seeks to manage exposure to loss through favorable
risk selection and diversification, its management of claims, its use of reinsurance and its
ability to manage its expense ratio which it accomplishes through economies of scale and its
management of acquisition costs and other underwriting expenses.

Pricing adequacy depends on a number of factors, including the ability to obtain regulatory
approval for rate changes, proper evaluation of underwriting risks, the ability to project future
loss cost frequency and severity based on historical loss experience adjusted for known trends, the
Company’s response to rate actions taken by competitors, and expectations about regulatory and
legal developments and expense levels. Property & Casualty seeks to price its insurance policies
such that insurance premiums and future net investment income earned on premiums received will
cover underwriting expenses and the ultimate cost of paying claims reported on the policies and
provide for a profit margin. For many of its insurance products, Property & Casualty is required
to obtain approval for its premium rates from state insurance departments.

In setting its pricing, Property & Casualty assumes an expected level of losses from natural or
man-made catastrophes that will cover the Company’s exposure to catastrophes over the long-term.
In most years, however, Property & Casualty’s actual losses from catastrophes will be more or less
than that assumed in its pricing due to the significant volatility of catastrophe losses.
Insurance Services Office, Inc. (“ISO”) defines a catastrophe loss as an event that causes $25 or
more in industry insured property losses and affects a significant number of property and casualty
policyholders and insurers.

Given the lag in the period from when claims are incurred to when they are reported and paid, final
claim settlements may vary from current estimates of incurred losses and loss expenses,
particularly when those payments may not occur until well into the future. Reserves for lines of
business with a longer lag (or “tail”) in reporting are more difficult to estimate. Reserve
estimates for longer tail lines are initially set based on loss and loss expense ratio assumptions
estimated when the business was priced and are adjusted as the paid and reported claims develop,
indicating that the ultimate loss and loss expense ratio will differ from the initial assumptions.
Adjustments to previously established loss and loss expense reserves, if any, are reflected in
underwriting results in the period in which the adjustment is determined to be necessary.

The investment return, or yield, on Property & Casualty’s invested assets is an important element
of the Company’s earnings since insurance products are priced with the assumption that premiums
received can be invested for a period of time before loss and loss adjustment expenses are paid.
For longer tail lines, such as workers’ compensation and general liability, claims are paid over
several years and, therefore, the premiums received for these lines of business can generate
significant investment income. Due to the need to maintain sufficient liquidity to satisfy claim
obligations, the vast majority of Property & Casualty’s invested assets have been held in fixed
maturities, including, among other asset classes, corporate bonds, municipal bonds, government
debt, short-term debt, mortgage-backed securities and asset-backed securities.

Through its Other Operations segment, Property & Casualty is responsible for managing operations of
The Hartford that have discontinued writing new or renewal business as well as managing the claims
related to asbestos and environmental exposures.

Definitions of key ratios and measures

Written and earned premiums

Written premium is a statutory accounting financial measure which represents the amount of premiums
charged for policies issued, net of reinsurance, during a fiscal period. Earned premium is a U.S.
GAAP and statutory measure. Premiums are considered earned and are included in the financial
results on a pro rata basis over the policy period. Management believes that written premium is a
performance measure that is useful to investors as it reflects current trends in the Company’s sale
of property and casualty insurance products. Written and earned premium are recorded net of ceded
reinsurance premium.

Reinstatement premiums

Reinstatement premium represents additional ceded premium paid for the reinstatement of the amount
of reinsurance coverage that was reduced as a result of a reinsurance loss payment.



Policies in force

Policies in force represent the number of policies with coverage in effect as of the end of the
period. The number of policies in force is a growth measure used for Personal Lines, Small
Commercial and Middle Market and is affected by both new business growth and premium renewal
retention.

Written pricing increase (decrease)

Written pricing increase (decrease) over the comparable period of the prior year includes the
impact of rate filings, the impact of changes in the value of the rating bases and individual risk
pricing decisions. A number of factors impact written pricing increases (decreases) including
expected loss costs as projected by the Company’s pricing actuaries, rate filings approved by state
regulators, risk selection decisions made by the Company’s underwriters and marketplace
competition. Written pricing changes reflect the property and casualty insurance market cycle.
Prices tend to increase for a particular line of business when insurance carriers have incurred
significant losses in that line of business in the recent past or the industry as a whole commits
less of its capital to writing exposures in that line of business. Prices tend to decrease when
recent loss experience has been favorable or when competition among insurance carriers increases.

Earned pricing increase (decrease)

Written premiums are earned over the policy term, which is six months for certain Personal Lines
auto business and 12 months for substantially all of the remainder of the Company’s business.
Because the Company earns premiums over the 6 to 12 month term of the policies, earned pricing
increases (decreases) lag written pricing increases (decreases) by 6 to 12 months.

New business written premium

New business written premium represents the amount of premiums charged for policies issues to
customers who were not insured with the Company in the previous policy term. New business written
premium plus renewal policy written premium equals total written premium.

Premium renewal retention

Premium renewal retention represents the ratio of net written premium in the current period that is
not derived from new business divided by total net written premium of the prior period.
Accordingly, premium renewal retention includes the effect of written pricing changes on renewed
business. In addition, the renewal retention rate is affected by a number of other factors,
including the percentage of renewal policy quotes accepted and decisions by the Company to
non-renew policies because of specific policy underwriting concerns or because of a decision to
reduce premium writings in certain lines of business or states. Premium renewal retention is also
affected by advertising and rate actions taken by competitors.

Loss and loss adjustment expense ratio

The loss and loss adjustment expense ratio is a measure of the cost of claims incurred in the
calendar year divided by earned premium and includes losses incurred for both the current and prior
accident years. Among other factors, the loss and loss adjustment expense ratio needed for the
Company to achieve its targeted return on equity fluctuates from year to year based on changes in
the expected investment yield over the claim settlement period, the timing of expected claim
settlements and the targeted returns set by management based on the competitive environment.

The loss and loss adjustment expense ratio is affected by claim frequency and claim severity,
particularly for shorter-tail property lines of business, where the emergence of claim frequency
and severity is credible and likely indicative of ultimate losses. Claim frequency represents the
percentage change in the average number of reported claims per unit of exposure in the current
accident year compared to that of the previous accident year. Claim severity represents the
percentage change in the estimated average cost per claim in the current accident year compared to
that of the previous accident year. As one of the factors used to determine pricing, the Company’s
practice is to first make an overall assumption about claim frequency and severity for a given line
of business and then, as part of the ratemaking process, adjust the assumption as appropriate for
the particular state, product or coverage.

Current accident year loss and loss adjustment expense ratio before catastrophes

The current accident year loss and loss adjustment expense ratio before catastrophes is a measure
of the cost of non-catastrophe claims incurred in the current accident year divided by earned
premiums. Management believes that the current accident year loss and loss adjustment expense
ratio before catastrophes is a performance measure that is useful to investors as it removes the
impact of volatile and unpredictable catastrophe losses and prior accident year reserve
development.

Current accident year catastrophe ratio

The current accident year catastrophe ratio represents the ratio of catastrophe losses (net of
reinsurance) to earned premiums for catastrophe claims incurred during the current accident year.
A catastrophe is an event that causes $25 or more in industry insured property losses and affects a
significant number of property and casualty policyholders and insurers. The catastrophe ratio
includes the effect of catastrophe losses, but does not include the effect of reinstatement
premiums.



Prior accident year loss and loss adjustment expense ratio

The prior year loss and loss adjustment expense ratio represents the increase (decrease) in the
estimated cost of settling catastrophe and non-catastrophe claims incurred in prior accident years
as recorded in the current calendar year divided by earned premiums.

Expense ratio

The expense ratio is the ratio of underwriting expenses, excluding bad debt expense, to earned
premiums. Underwriting expenses include the amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs and
insurance operating costs and expenses. Deferred policy acquisition costs include commissions,
taxes, licenses and fees and other underwriting expenses and are amortized over the policy term.

Policyholder dividend ratio

The policyholder dividend ratio is the ratio of policyholder dividends to earned premium.

Combined ratio

The combined ratio is the sum of the loss and loss adjustment expense ratio, the expense ratio and
the policyholder dividend ratio. This ratio is a relative measurement that describes the related
cost of losses and expenses for every $100 of earned premiums. A combined ratio below 100.0
demonstrates underwriting profit; a combined ratio above 100.0 demonstrates underwriting losses.

Catastrophe ratio

The catastrophe ratio (a component of the loss and loss adjustment expense ratio) represents the
ratio of catastrophe losses (net of reinsurance) to earned premiums. By their nature, catastrophe
losses vary dramatically from year to year. Based on the mix and geographic dispersion of premium
written and estimates derived from various catastrophe loss models, the Company’s expected
catastrophe ratio over the long-term is 3.0 to 3.5 points. See “Risk Management Strategy” below
for a discussion of the Company’s catastrophe risk management program that serves to mitigate the
Company’s net exposure to catastrophe losses. Catastrophe losses used to calculate the catastrophe
ratio do not include the effect of reinstatement premiums or assessments.

Combined ratio before catastrophes and prior accident year development

The combined ratio before catastrophes and prior accident year development represents the combined
ratio for the current accident year, excluding the impact of catastrophes. The Company believes
this ratio is an important measure of the trend in profitability since it removes the impact of
volatile and unpredictable catastrophe losses and prior accident year reserve development.

Underwriting results

Underwriting results is a before-tax measure that represents earned premiums less incurred losses,
loss adjustment expenses, underwriting expenses and policyholder dividends. The Hartford believes
that underwriting results provides investors with a valuable measure of before-tax profitability
derived from underwriting activities, which are managed separately from the Company’s investing
activities. Within Ongoing Operations, the underwriting segments of Personal Lines, Small
Commercial, Middle Market and Specialty Commercial are evaluated by management primarily based upon
underwriting results. Underwriting results is also presented for Ongoing Operations and Other
Operations. A reconciliation of underwriting results to net income for Ongoing Operations and
Other Operations is set forth in their respective discussions herein.

The investment yield, or return, on the Company’s invested assets primarily includes interest
income on fixed maturity investments. Based upon the fair value of Property & Casualty’s
investments as of December 31, 2008 and 2007, approximately 82% and 89%, respectively, of invested
assets were held in fixed maturities. A number of factors affect the yield on fixed maturity
investments, including fluctuations in interest rates and the level of prepayments. The Company
also invests in equity securities, mortgage loans, limited partnership arrangements and other
alternative investments.

Property & Casualty’s insurance business has been written by a number of writing companies that,
under a pooling arrangement, participate in the Hartford Fire Insurance Pool, the lead company of
which is the Hartford Fire Insurance Company (“Hartford Fire”).

Property & Casualty maintains one portfolio of invested assets for all business written by the
Hartford Fire Insurance Pool companies, including business reported in both the Ongoing Operations
and Other Operations segments. Separate investment portfolios are maintained within Other
Operations for the runoff of international assumed reinsurance claims and for the runoff business
of Heritage Holdings, Inc., including its subsidiaries, Excess Insurance Company Ltd., First State
Insurance Company and Heritage Reinsurance Company, Ltd. Within the Hartford Fire Insurance Pool,
invested assets are attributed to Ongoing Operations and Other Operations pursuant to the Company’s
capital attribution process.

The Hartford attributes capital to each line of business or segment using an internally-developed,
risk-based capital attribution methodology that incorporates management’s assessment of the
relative risks within each line of business or segment, as well as the capital requirements of
external parties, such as regulators and rating agencies. Net investment income earned on the
Hartford Fire invested asset portfolio is allocated between Ongoing Operations and Other Operations
based on the allocation of invested assets to each segment and the expected investment yields
earned by each segment. Net investment income earned on the separate portfolios within Other
Operations is recorded entirely within Other Operations. Based on the Company’s method of
allocating net investment income for the Hartford Fire Insurance Pool and the net investment income
earned by Other Operations on its separate investment portfolios, in 2008, the after-tax investment
yield for Ongoing Operations was 3.2% and the after-tax investment yield for Other Operations was
3.6%.



Net realized capital gains (losses)

When fixed maturity, equity or other investments are sold, any gain or loss is reported in net
realized capital gains (losses). Individual securities may be sold for a variety of reasons,
including a decision to change the Company’s asset allocation in response to market conditions and
the need to liquidate funds to meet large claim settlements. Accordingly, net realized capital
gains (losses) for any particular period are not predictable and can vary significantly. In
addition, net realized capital gains (losses) include other-than-temporary impairments in the fair
value of investments, changes in the fair value of non-qualifying derivatives and hedge
ineffectiveness on qualifying derivative instruments. Refer to the Investment section of MD&A for
further discussion of net investment income and net realized capital gains (losses).

Reserves

Reserving for property and casualty losses is an estimation process. As additional experience and
other relevant claim data become available, reserve levels are adjusted accordingly. Such
adjustments of reserves related to claims incurred in prior years are a natural occurrence in the
loss reserving process and are referred to as “reserve development”. Reserve development that
increases previous estimates of ultimate cost is called “reserve strengthening”. Reserve
development that decreases previous estimates of ultimate cost is called “reserve releases”.
Reserve development can influence the comparability of year over year underwriting results and is
set forth in the paragraphs and tables that follow. The “prior accident year development (pts.)” in
the following table represents the ratio of reserve development to earned premiums. For a detailed
discussion of the Company’s reserve policies, see Notes 1, 11 and 12 of Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements and the Critical Accounting Estimates section of the MD&A.

Based on the results of the quarterly reserve review process, the Company determines the
appropriate reserve adjustments, if any, to record. Recorded reserve estimates are changed after
consideration of numerous factors, including but not limited to, the magnitude of the difference
between the actuarial indication and the recorded reserves, improvement or deterioration of
actuarial indications in the period, the maturity of the accident year, trends observed over the
recent past and the level of volatility within a particular line of business. In general, changes
are made more quickly to more mature accident years and less volatile lines of business. For
information regarding reserving for asbestos and environmental claims within Other Operations,
refer to the Other Operations segment discussion.

As part of its quarterly reserve review process, the Company is closely monitoring reported loss
development in certain lines where the recent emergence of paid losses and case reserves could
indicate a trend that may eventually lead the Company to change its estimate of ultimate losses in
those lines. If, and when, the emergence of reported losses is determined to be a trend that
changes the Company’s estimate of ultimate losses, prior accident year reserves would be adjusted
in the period the change in estimate is made.

For example, the Company has experienced favorable emergence of reported workers’ compensation
claims for recent accident years and, during 2008, released workers’ compensation reserves in Small
Commercial and Middle Market by a total of $156, primarily related to accident years 2000 to 2007.
If reported losses on workers’ compensation claims for recent accident years continue to emerge
favorably, reserves could be reduced further.

The Company has also seen favorable emergence during 2008 on Personal Lines auto liability claims.
The severity of reported claims for the 2005 through 2007 accident years and the frequency of
reported claims for the 2008 accident year have been lower than expected and reserves were released
in the third and fourth quarter of 2008 as a result. If these favorable trends continue, future
releases are possible.

The Company expects to perform its regular reviews of asbestos liabilities in the second quarter of
2009, Other Operations’ reinsurance recoverables and the allowance for uncollectible reinsurance in
the second quarter of 2009 and environmental liabilities in the third quarter of 2009. If there
are significant developments that affect particular exposures, reinsurance arrangements or the
financial conditions of particular reinsurers, the Company will make adjustments to its reserves,
or the portion of liabilities it expects to cede to reinsurers.

Current accident year catastrophes

For 2008, net current accident year catastrophe loss and loss adjustment expenses totaled $543, of
which $237 related to hurricane Ike. In addition to the $237 of net catastrophe loss and loss
adjustment expenses from hurricane Ike, the Company incurred $20 of assessments due to hurricane
Ike. The following table shows total current accident year catastrophe impacts in the year ended
December 31, 2008:

A portion of the gross incurred loss and loss adjustment expenses are recoverable from reinsurers
under the Company’s principal catastrophe reinsurance program in addition to other reinsurance
programs. Reinsurance recoveries under the Company’s principal catastrophe reinsurance program,
which covers multiple lines of business, are allocated to the segments in accordance with a
pre-established methodology that is consistent with the method used to allocate the ceded premium
to each segment.

The Company’s estimate of ultimate loss and loss expenses arising from hurricanes and other
catastrophes is based on covered losses under the terms of the policies. The Company does not
provide residential flood insurance on its Personal Lines homeowners policies so the Company’s
estimate of hurricane losses on Personal Lines homeowners business does not include any provision
for damages arising from flood waters. The Company acts as an administrator for the Write Your Own
flood program on behalf of the National Flood Insurance Program under FEMA, for which it earns a
fee for collecting premiums and processing claims. Under the program, the Company services both
personal lines and commercial lines flood insurance policies and does not assume any underwriting
risk. As a result, catastrophe losses in the above table do not include any losses related to the
Write Your Own flood program.

During 2008, the Company’s re-estimates of prior accident year reserves included the following
significant reserve changes:

Ongoing Operations

•

Released workers’ compensation reserves primarily related to accident years 2000 to 2007 by
$156. These reserve releases are a continuation of favorable developments first recognized in
2005 and recognized in both 2006 and 2007. The reserve releases in 2008 resulted from a
determination that workers’ compensation losses continue to develop even more favorably from
prior expectations due, in part, to state legal reforms, including in California and Florida,
and underwriting actions as well as cost reduction initiatives first instituted in 2003. In
particular, the state legal reforms and underwriting actions have resulted in lower than
expected medical claim severity. The $156 reserve release represented 3% of the Company’s net
reserves for workers’ compensation claims as of December 31, 2007.

•

Released reserves for general liability claims primarily related to the 2001 to 2007 accident
years by $105. Beginning in the third quarter of 2007, the Company observed that reported
losses for high hazard and umbrella general liability claims, primarily related to the 2001 to
2006 accident years, were emerging favorably and this caused management to reduce its estimate
of the cost of future reported claims for these accident years, resulting in a reserve release
in each quarter since the third quarter of 2007. During 2008, the Company observed that this
favorable trend continued with the 2007 accident year. The number of reported claims for this
line of business has been lower than expected, a trend first observed in 2005. Over time,
management has come to believe that the lower than expected number of claims reported to date
will not be offset by a higher than expected number of late reported claims. The $105 reserve
release represented 4% of the Company’s net reserves for general liability claims as of
December 31, 2007.

•

Released reserves for professional liability claims for accident years 2003 to 2006 by $75.
During 2008, the Company updated its analysis of certain professional liability claims and the
new analysis showed that claim severity for directors and officers losses in the 2003 to 2006
accident years were favorable to previous expectations, resulting in a reduction of reserves.
The analysis also showed favorable emergence of claim severity on errors and omission policy
claims for the 2004 and 2005 accident years, resulting in a release of reserves. The $75
reserve release represented 13% of the Company’s net reserves for professional liability
claims as of December 31, 2007.

•

Released reserves for Personal Lines auto liability claims by $46, principally related to
AARP business for the 2005 through 2007 accident years. Beginning in the first quarter of
2008, management observed an improvement in emerged claim severity for the 2005 through 2007
accident years attributed, in part, to changes made in claim handling procedures in 2007. In
the third and fourth quarter of 2008, the Company recognized that favorable development in
reported severity was a sustained trend and, accordingly, management reduced its reserve
estimate. The $46 reserve release represented 3% of the Company’s net reserves for Personal
Lines auto liability claims as of December 31, 2007.

•

Released commercial auto liability reserves by $27, primarily related to accident years 2002
to 2007. Management has observed fewer than previously expected large losses in accident
years 2006 and 2007 and lower than previously expected severity on large claims in accident
years 2002 to 2005. In 2008, management recognized that favorable development in reported
claim severity was a sustained trend and, accordingly, management reduced its estimate of the
reserves. The $27 reserve release represented 9% of the Company’s net reserves for Middle
Market commercial auto liability claims as of December 31, 2007.

•

Released reserves for extra-contractual liability claims under non-standard personal auto
policies by $24. As part of the agreement to sell its non-standard auto insurance business in
November, 2006, the Company continues to be obligated for certain extra-contractual liability
claims arising prior to the date of sale. Reserve estimates for extra-contractual liability
claims are subject to significant variability depending on the expected settlement of
individually large claims and, during 2008, the Company determined that the settlement value
of a number of these claims was expected to be less than previously anticipated, resulting in
a $24 release of reserves. The $24 reserve release represented 1% of the Company’s net
reserves for Personal Lines auto liability claims as of December 31, 2007.

•

Released reserves for construction defect claims in Specialty Commercial by $10 for accident
years 2005 and prior due to lower than expected reported claim activity. Lower than expected
claim activity was first noted in the first quarter of 2007 and continued throughout 2007. In
the first quarter of 2008, management determined that this was a verifiable trend and reduced
reserves accordingly. The $10 reserve release represented 1% of the Company’s net reserves
for Specialty Commercial general liability claims as of December 31, 2007.

•

Strengthened reserves for general liability and products liability claims primarily for
accident years 2004 and prior by $67 for losses expected to emerge after 20 years of
development. In 2007, management observed that long outstanding general liability claims have
been settling for more than previously anticipated and, during the first quarter of 2008, the
Company increased the estimate of late development of general liability claims. The $67
reserve strengthening represented 3% of the Company’s net reserves for general liability
claims as of December 31, 2007.

•

Strengthened reserves for allocated loss adjustment expenses on national account general
liability claims within Specialty Commercial by $25. Allocated loss adjustment expense
reserves on general liability excess and umbrella claims were strengthened for accident years
2004 and prior as the Company observed that the cost of settling these claims has exceeded
previous expectations. The $25 reserve strengthening represented 2% of the Company’s net
reserves for Specialty Commercial general liability claims as of December 31, 2007.



Other Operations

•

During the third quarter of 2008, the Company completed its annual ground up environmental
reserve evaluation. As part of this evaluation, the Company reviewed all of its open direct
domestic insurance accounts exposed to environmental liability as well as assumed reinsurance
accounts and its London Market exposures for both direct insurance and assumed reinsurance.
The Company found estimates for individual cases changed based upon the particular
circumstances of each account. These changes were case specific and not as a result of any
underlying change in the current environment. In addition, the decline in the reporting of
new accounts and sites has been slower than anticipated in our previous review. The net
effect of these changes resulted in a $53 increase in net environmental reserves.

•

During the second quarter of 2008, the Company completed its annual ground up asbestos
reserve evaluation. As part of this evaluation, the Company reviewed all of its open direct
domestic insurance accounts exposed to asbestos liability as well as assumed reinsurance
accounts and its London Market exposures for both direct insurance and assumed reinsurance.
The Company found estimates for individual cases changed based upon the particular
circumstances of each account. These changes were case specific and not as a result of any
underlying change in the current environment. The net effect of these changes resulted in a
$50 increase in net asbestos reserves.

•

Among other net reserve re-estimates for Other Operations in 2008, the Company recognized
favorable prior year development of $30 on its HartRe assumed reinsurance liabilities as the
result of lower than expected reported losses and $25 of adverse development for assumed
reinsurance obligations of the Company’s Bermuda operations.

During the year ended December 31, 2007, the Company’s reestimates of prior accident year reserves
included the following significant reserve changes.

Ongoing Operations

•

Released Small Commercial workers’ compensation reserves by $151, primarily related to
accident years 2002 to 2006. This reserve release is a continuation of favorable developments
first recognized in 2005 and 2006. The workers’ compensation reserve releases in 2007
resulted from a determination that workers’ compensation losses continue to develop even more
favorably from prior expectations due to the California and Florida legal reforms and
underwriting actions as well as cost reduction initiatives first instituted in 2003. In
particular, the state legal reforms and underwriting actions have resulted in lower than
expected medical claim severity. In addition, the Company determined that paid losses related
to workers’ compensation policies sold through payroll service providers were emerging
favorably, leading to a release of reserves for the 2003 to 2006 accident years. The $151
reserve release represented 9% of the Company’s net reserves for Small Commercial workers’
compensation claims as of December 31, 2006.

•

Released reserves for Middle Market general liability claims related to the 2003 to 2006
accident years by $49. Beginning in the third quarter of 2007, the Company observed that
reported losses for high hazard and umbrella general liability claims for the 2003 to 2006
accident years were emerging favorably and this caused management to reduce its estimate of
the cost of future reported claims for these accident years, resulting in a reserve release in
the third and fourth quarter of 2007. This reserve development is unrelated to the reserve
strengthening in 2005 and 2006 of other Middle Market general liability claims which developed
unfavorably due to higher than anticipated loss payments beyond four years of development. The
$49 reserve release represented 6% of the Company’s net reserves for Middle Market general
liability claims as of December 31, 2006.

•

Released Small Commercial workers’ compensation reserves related to accident years 2000 and
prior by $33. The severity of workers’ compensation medical claims for these accident years
has emerged favorably to previous expectations. As the continued development of these claims
has resulted in a sustained favorable trend, management released reserves in the fourth
quarter of 2007. The $33 reserve release represented 2% of the Company’s net reserves for
Small Commercial workers’ compensation claims as of December 31, 2006.

•

Recorded a $30 net release of reserves for Small Commercial package business related to the
2003 to 2006 accident years. Reserve reviews completed during 2007 identified that the
frequency of reported liability claims on Small Commercial package business policies for these
accident years was lower than the previously expected frequency. In addition, reported loss
costs on property coverages have emerged favorably for the 2006 accident year. In recognition
of these trends, in the second and fourth quarter of 2007, management reduced reserves by a
total of $30. The $30 reserve release represented 3% of the Company’s net reserves for Small
Commercial package business claims as of December 31, 2006.

•

Released reserves for commercial surety business by $22 for accident years 2003 to 2006.
Reported losses for commercial surety business have been emerging favorably resulting in the
Company lowering its estimate of ultimate unpaid losses during the third quarter of 2007. The
$22 reserve release represented 14% of the Company’s net reserves for fidelity and surety
claims as of December 31, 2006.

•

Released Middle Market commercial auto liability reserves by $18 for accident years 2003 and
2004. Since the first quarter of 2007, reported losses for commercial auto liability claims
in these accident years have emerged favorably although management did not determine that this
was a verifiable trend until the third quarter of 2007 when it released the reserves. The $18
reserve release represented 6% of the Company’s net reserves for Middle Market auto liability
claims as of December 31, 2006.

•

Released reserves for Personal Lines auto liability claims for accident years 2002 to 2006 by
$16. This reserve release was a continuation of trends first observed in 2006. During the
first quarter of 2006, the Company released auto liability reserves related to the 2005
accident year due to frequency emerging favorable to initial expectations. During the second
quarter of 2006, the Company observed that loss cost severity on auto liability claims for the
2004 accident year was emerging favorable to initial expectations and released reserves to
recognize this trend. For each of the 2002 to 2006 accident years, the Company has continued
to observe favorable trends in reported severity and, in the fourth quarter of 2007, the
Company released an additional $16 in reserves. The $16 reserve release represented 1% of the
Company’s net reserves for Personal Lines auto liability claims as of December 31, 2006.

•

Released reserves for errors and omissions claims for accident year 2005 by $15. During the
fourth quarter of 2007, the Company updated its analysis of certain professional liability
claims and the new analysis showed that claims under errors and omissions policies were
emerging favorable to initial expectations, resulting in this reserve release. The $15
reserve release represented 3% of the Company’s net reserves for professional liability claims
as of December 31, 2006.

•

Strengthened Specialty Commercial workers’ compensation reserves by $47, primarily related to
accident years 1987 to 2001. Management has been observing larger than expected increases in
loss cost severity, particularly on high deductible and excess policies. The $47 reserve
strengthening represented 2% of the Company’s net reserves for Specialty Commercial workers’
compensation claims as of December 31, 2006.



•

Strengthened Middle Market workers’ compensation reserves by $40 for accident years 1973 and
prior, primarily driven by a reduction in reinsurance recoverables from the commutation of
certain reinsurance treaties. Due to the commutations, within the past two years, net paid
losses on these claims have begun to emerge unfavorably to initial expectations and, during
2007, the Company determined that this trend in higher paid losses would ultimately result in
unpaid losses settling for more than management’s previous estimates. The $40 reserve
strengthening represented 2% of net reserves for Middle Market workers’ compensation claims as
of December 31, 2006.

•

Strengthened general liability reserves by $39 for accident years more than 20 years old.
The Company has experienced an increase in defense costs for certain mass tort claims and,
during 2007, the Company determined that the increase in defense costs was a sustained trend
that resulted in an increase in reserves. The $39 reserve strengthening represented 2% of the
Company’s net reserves for general liability claims as of December 31, 2006.

•

Strengthened reserves for Specialty Commercial general and products liability claims by $34,
primarily related to the 1987 to 1997 accident years. Reported losses on general and products
liability claims have been emerging unfavorably to previous expectations and loss adjustment
expenses have been higher than expected on late emerging claims. The $34 reserve
strengthening represented 3% of the Company’s net reserves for Specialty Commercial general
liability claims as of December 31, 2006.

•

Also during 2007, the Company refined its processes for allocating IBNR reserves by accident
year, resulting in a reclassification of $347 of IBNR reserves from the 2003 to 2006 accident
years to the 2002 and prior accident years. This reclassification of reserves by accident
year had no effect on total recorded reserves within any segment or on total recorded reserves
for any line of business within a segment.

Other Operations

•

During the second quarter of 2007, an arbitration panel found that a Hartford subsidiary,
established as a captive reinsurance company in the 1970s by The Hartford’s former parent, ITT
Corporation (“ITT”), had additional obligations to ITT’s primary insurance carrier under ITT’s
captive insurance program, which ended in 1993. When ITT spun off The Hartford in 1995, the
former captive became a Hartford subsidiary. The arbitration concerned whether certain claims
could be presented to the former captive in a different manner than ITT’s primary insurance
carrier historically had presented them. The Company recorded a charge of $99 principally as
a result of this adverse arbitration decision.

•

The Company completed its environmental reserve evaluation and increased its environmental
reserves by $25. As part of this evaluation, the Company reviewed all of its open direct
domestic insurance accounts exposed to environmental liability as well as assumed reinsurance
accounts and its London Market exposures for both direct and assumed reinsurance. The Company
found estimates for individual cases changed based upon the particular circumstances of each
account. These changes were case specific and not as a result of any underlying change in the
current environment.

Market, $11 in Specialty Commercial and $7 in Other Operations.

During the year ended December 31, 2006, the Company’s re-estimates of prior accident year reserves
included the following significant reserve changes.

Ongoing Operations

•

Released net reserves related to prior year hurricanes by a total of $83, including $57 for
hurricanes Katrina and Rita in 2005 and $26 for hurricanes Charley, Frances and Jeanne in
2004. Initial reserve estimates for the 2005 and 2004 hurricanes were higher because of the
difficulty claim adjusters had in accessing the most significantly impacted areas and
initially higher estimates of the cost of building materials and contractors due to “demand
surge”. As the reported claims have matured, the estimated settlement value of the claims has
decreased from the initial estimates. The ultimate estimate for hurricane Katrina was
increased in the first quarter of 2006 because of higher than expected claim reporting,
particularly in Personal Lines. Net loss reserves within Specialty Commercial decreased,
primarily because hurricane Katrina losses on specialty property business were reimbursable
under a specialty property reinsurance treaty as well as under the Company’s principal
property catastrophe reinsurance program. After the first quarter of 2006, Katrina new claim
intake abated and settlement percentages increased, resulting in a reduction of reserves in
the last nine months of 2006. In addition, the rate of newly reported compensable claims for
Rita and the 2004 hurricanes was less than expected, resulting in a reduction of reserves for
these hurricanes.

•

Released Personal Lines auto liability reserves by $31 related to the fourth accident quarter
of 2005 as a result of better than expected frequency trends. During the third and fourth
quarter of 2005, the Company had reduced the 2005 accident year loss and loss adjustment
expense ratio for Personal Lines auto liability claims related to the first three accident
quarters of 2005. Favorable frequency for the fourth accident quarter of 2005 emerged during
the fourth quarter of 2005. However, the Company did not release reserves at that time, since
reserve indications at only three months of development were not reliable. The Company
released reserves in 2006 after further development indicated that early indications of
reduced frequency were representative of a real trend. The $31 reserve release represented 2%
of the Company’s net reserves for Personal Lines auto liability claims as of December 31,
2005.



•

Strengthened reserves for personal auto liability claims by $30 due to an increase in
estimated severity on claims where the Company is exposed to losses in excess of policy
limits. From the Company’s reserve review during the first quarter of 2006, the Company
determined that the facts and circumstances necessitated an increase in the reserve estimate.
The $30 of reserve strengthening represented 2% of the Company’s net reserves for Personal
Lines auto liability claims as of December 31, 2005.

•

Strengthened Middle Market general liability loss and loss adjustment expense reserves by $20
for accident years 1998 to 2005, primarily as a result of increasing allocated loss adjustment
expenses associated with closing older claims. The $20 of reserve strengthening represented
2% of the Company’s net reserves for general liability claims as of December 31, 2005.

•

Released allocated loss adjustment expense reserves by $58 for accident years 2003 to 2005,
primarily for workers’ compensation business and package business, as a result of cost
reduction initiatives implemented by the Company to reduce allocated loss adjustment expenses
for both legal and non-legal expenses. The Company began implementing cost reduction
initiatives in late 2003. It was initially uncertain what effect those efforts would have on
controlling allocated loss adjustment expenses. During 2004, favorable trends started to
emerge, particularly on shorter-tailed auto liability claims, but it was not clear if these
trends would be sustained. In early 2005, favorable trends continued and the Company analyzed
claims involving legal expenses separate from claims that do not involve legal expenses. This
analysis included a review of the trends in the number of claims involving legal expenses, the
average expenses incurred and trends in legal expenses. During the second quarter of 2005,
the Company released allocated loss adjustment expense reserves on shorter-tailed auto
liability claims as the favorable trends on shorter-tailed business emerged more quickly and
were determined to be reliable. During both the second and fourth quarter of 2006, the
Company determined that the favorable development on package business and workers’
compensation business had become a verifiable trend and, accordingly, reserves were reduced.
The $58 release represented 1% of total net reserves for workers’ compensation and package
business as of December 31, 2005.

•

Released Personal Lines auto liability reserves related to AARP and other affinity business
by $22. AARP auto liability reserves for accident year 2004 were reduced as a result of
favorable loss cost severity trends. AARP auto liability severity, as measured by reported
data, began declining in 2005; however, the Company was uncertain whether this trend would
prove persistent over time since paid loss data did not support a decline. During the second
quarter of 2006, the Company determined that all the metrics supported a decline in severity
estimates and, therefore, the Company released reserves. Auto liability reserves for other
affinity business related to accident years 2003 to 2005 were reduced to recognize favorable
developments in loss costs that have emerged. The $22 reserve release represented 1% of the
Company’s net reserves for Personal Lines auto liability claims as of December 31, 2005.

•

Strengthened construction defect claim reserves by $45 for accident years 1997 and prior as a
result of an increase in claim severity trends. In 2004, two large construction defects
claims were reported, but these were not viewed as an indication of an increase in the
severity trend for all claims. In 2005, two additional large cases were reported. Management
performed an expanded review of construction defects claims in the second quarter of 2006.
Based on the expanded review and additional reported claim experience, management concluded
that reported losses would likely continue at a higher level in the future and this resulted
in strengthening the recorded reserves. The $35 of reserve strengthening in Specialty
Commercial represented 4% of the Company’s net reserves for Specialty Commercial general
liability claims as of December 31, 2005. The $10 of strengthening in Middle Market
represented 1% of net reserves for Middle Market general liability claims as of December 31,
2005.

•

Strengthened Specialty Commercial workers’ compensation allocated loss adjustment expense
reserves by $20 for loss adjustment expense payments expected to emerge after 20 years of
development. During 2005, the Company had done an in-depth study of loss payments expected to
emerge after 20 years of development. At that time, it was believed that allocated loss
adjustment expenses for a particular subset of business (primary policies on national accounts
business) developed more quickly than allocated loss adjustment expenses for smaller insureds
and that a similar reserve strengthening for national accounts business was not required.
During the second quarter of 2006, the Company’s reserve review indicated that the development
pattern for this business should be adjusted to be more consistent with that for smaller
insureds. Because the Company has written very little of this business in recent years, the
increase in reserves affects accident years 1995 and prior. The $20 of reserve strengthening
represented 1% of the Company’s net reserves for Specialty Commercial workers’ compensation
claims as of December 31, 2005.

Other Operations

•

Reduced the reinsurance recoverable asset associated with older, longer-term casualty
liabilities by $243. The Company reviewed the reinsurance recoverables and allowance for
uncollectible reinsurance associated with older, long-term casualty liabilities in the second
quarter 2006. As a result of this study, and the outcome of an agreement that resolved, with
minor exception, all of the Company’s ceded and assumed domestic reinsurance exposures with
Equitas, Other Operations recorded prior accident year development of $243.

•

Strengthened environmental reserves by $43 as a result of an environmental reserve evaluation
completed in the third quarter of 2006. As part of this evaluation, the Company reviewed all
of its domestic direct and assumed reinsurance accounts exposed to environmental liability.
The Company also examined its London Market exposures for both direct insurance and assumed
reinsurance. The Company found estimates for individual cases changed based upon the
particular circumstances of each account, although the review found no underlying cause or
change in the claim environment. The $43 of reserve strengthening represented 2% of the
Company’s net reserves for asbestos and environmental claims as of December 31, 2005.



Impact of Re-estimates

As explained in connection with the Company’s discussion of Critical Accounting Estimates, the
establishment of property and casualty reserves is an estimation process, using a variety of
methods, assumptions and data elements. Ultimate losses may vary significantly from the current
estimates. Many factors can contribute to these variations and the need to change the previous
estimate of required reserve levels. Subsequent changes can generally be thought of as being the
result of the emergence of additional facts that were not known or anticipated at the time of the
prior reserve estimate and/or changes in interpretations of information and trends.

The table below shows the range of annual reserve re-estimates experienced by The Hartford over the
past four years. The amount of prior accident year development (as shown in the reserve
rollforward) for a given calendar year is expressed as a percent of the beginning calendar year
reserves, net of reinsurance. The percentage relationships presented are significantly influenced
by the facts and circumstances of each particular year and by the fact that only the last four
years are included in the range. Accordingly, these percentages are not intended to be a
prediction of the range of possible future variability. See “Impact of key assumptions on reserve
volatility” within Critical Accounting Estimates for further discussion of the potential for
variability in recorded loss reserves.

Over the past ten years, reserve re-estimates for total Property & Casualty ranged from (1.3)% to 21.5%. Excluding the reserve
strengthening for asbestos and environmental reserves, over the past ten years reserve re-estimates for total Property & Casualty
ranged from (3.0)% to 1.6%.

The potential variability of the Company’s Property & Casualty reserves would normally be expected
to vary by segment and the types of loss exposures insured by those segments. Illustrative factors
influencing the potential reserve variability for each of the segments are discussed under Critical
Accounting Estimates.

Risk Management Strategy

The Hartford’s property and casualty operations have processes to manage risk to natural disasters,
such as hurricanes and earthquakes, and other perils, such as terrorism. The Hartford’s risk
management processes include, but are not limited to, disciplined underwriting protocols, exposure
controls, sophisticated risk modeling, risk transfer, and capital management strategies.

In managing risk, The Hartford’s management processes involve establishing underwriting guidelines
for both individual risks, including individual policy limits, and in aggregate, including
aggregate exposure limits by geographic zone and peril. The Company establishes risk limits and
actively monitors the risk exposures as a percent of Property & Casualty statutory surplus. For
natural catastrophe perils, the Company generally limits its estimated loss to natural catastrophes
from a single 250-year event prior to reinsurance to less than 30% of statutory surplus of the
Property & Casualty operations and its estimated loss to natural catastrophes from a single
250-year event after reinsurance to less than 15% of statutory surplus of the Property & Casualty
operations. From time to time, the estimated loss to natural catastrophes from a single 250-year
event prior to reinsurance may fluctuate above or below 30% of statutory surplus due to changes in
modeled loss estimates, exposures, or statutory surplus. Currently, the Company’s estimated
pre-tax loss to a single 250-year natural catastrophe event prior to reinsurance is 31% of
statutory surplus of the Property & Casualty operations and the Company’s estimated pre-tax loss
net of reinsurance is less than 15% of statutory surplus of the Property & Casualty operations.
For terrorism, the Company monitors its exposure in major metropolitan areas to a single-site
conventional terrorism attack scenario, and manages its potential estimated loss, including
exposures resulting from the Company’s Group Life operations, to less than $1.3 billion, which is
approximately 10% of the combined statutory surplus of the Life and Property & Casualty operations
as of December 31, 2008. Among the 251 locations specifically monitored by the Company, the
largest estimated modeled loss arising from a single event is approximately $1.2 billion. The
Company monitors exposures monthly and employs both internally developed and vendor-licensed loss
modeling tools as part of its risk management discipline.

Use of Reinsurance

In managing risk, The Hartford utilizes reinsurance to transfer risk to well-established and
financially secure reinsurers. Reinsurance is used to manage aggregations of risk as well as
specific risks based on accumulated property and casualty liabilities in certain geographic zones.
All treaty purchases related to the Company’s property and casualty operations are administered by
a centralized function to support a consistent strategy and ensure that the reinsurance activities
are fully integrated into the organization’s risk management processes.



A variety of traditional reinsurance products are used as part of the Company’s risk management
strategy, including excess of loss occurrence-based products that protect property and workers’
compensation exposures, and individual risk or quota share arrangements, that protect specific
classes or lines of business. There are no significant finite risk contracts in place and the
statutory surplus benefit from all such prior year contracts is immaterial. Facultative
reinsurance is also used to manage policy-specific risk exposures based on established underwriting
guidelines. The Hartford also participates in governmentally administered reinsurance facilities
such as the Florida Hurricane Catastrophe Fund (“FHCF”), the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program
established under The Terrorism Risk Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2007 (“TRIPRA”) and
other reinsurance programs relating to particular risks or specific lines of business.

The Company has several catastrophe reinsurance programs, including reinsurance treaties that cover
property and workers’ compensation losses aggregating from single catastrophe events. The
following table summarizes the primary catastrophe treaty reinsurance coverages that the Company
has in place as of January 1, 2009:

The per occurrence limit on the FHCF treaty is $382 for the 6/1/2008 to 6/1/2009 treaty year
based on the Company’s election to purchase additional limits under the “Temporary Increase in
Coverage Limit (TICL)” statutory provision in excess of the coverage the Company is required
to purchase from the FHCF.

In addition to the property catastrophe reinsurance coverage described in the above table, the
Company has other treaties and facultative reinsurance agreements that cover property catastrophe
losses on an aggregate excess of loss and on a per risk basis. The principal property catastrophe
reinsurance program and other reinsurance programs include a provision to reinstate limits in the
event that a catastrophe loss exhausts limits on one or more layers under the treaties.



In addition to the reinsurance protection provided by The Hartford’s reinsurance program described
above, the Company has fully collateralized reinsurance coverages from Foundation Re and Foundation
Re II for losses sustained from qualifying hurricane and earthquake loss events and other
qualifying catastrophe losses. Foundation Re and Foundation Re II are Cayman Islands reinsurance
companies which financed the provision of the reinsurance through the issuance of catastrophe
bonds. Under the terms of the treaties with Foundation Re and Foundation Re II, the Company is
reimbursed for losses from natural disaster events using a customized industry index contract
designed to replicate The Hartford’s own catastrophe losses, with a provision that the actual
losses incurred by the Company for covered events, net of reinsurance recoveries, cannot be less
than zero.

The following table summarizes the terms of the reinsurance treaties with Foundation Re and
Foundation Re II that were in place as of January 1, 2009:

As of December 31, 2008, there have been no events that are expected to trigger a recovery under
any of the reinsurance programs with Foundation Re or Foundation Re II and, accordingly, the
Company has not recorded any recoveries from the associated reinsurance treaties.

Estimated Catastrophe Exposures

The Company uses third party models to estimate the potential loss resulting from various
catastrophe events and the potential financial impact those events would have on the Company’s
financial position and results of operations. The following table shows modeled loss estimates
before expected reinsurance recoveries and after expected reinsurance recoveries. The loss
estimates represent total property losses for hurricane events and property and workers’
compensation losses for earthquake events resulting from a single event. The estimates provided
are based on 250-year return period loss estimates, which have a 0.4% likelihood of being exceeded
in any single year. The net loss estimates assume that the Company would be able to recover all
losses ceded to reinsurers under its reinsurance programs. There are various methodologies used in
the industry to estimate the potential property and workers’ compensation losses that would arise
from various catastrophe events and companies may use different models and assumptions in their
estimates. Therefore, the Company’s estimates of gross and net losses arising from a 250-year
hurricane or earthquake event may not be comparable to estimates provided by other companies.
Furthermore, the Company’s estimates are subject to significant uncertainty and could vary
materially from the actual losses that would arise from these events.



The Company’s modeled loss estimates are derived by averaging 21 modeled loss events representing a
250-year return period loss. For the peril of earthquake, the 21 events averaged to determine the
modeled loss estimate include events occurring in California as well as the Northwestern,
Northeastern, Southeastern and Midwestern regions of the United States with associated magnitudes
ranging from 6.9 to 7.9 on the Richter scale. For the peril of hurricane, the 21 events averaged
to determine the modeled loss estimate include category 3, 4 and 5 events in Florida as well as
other Southeastern, Northeastern and Gulf region landfalls.

Terrorism

The Company is exposed to losses from terrorist attacks, including losses caused by nuclear,
biological, chemical or radiological weapons (NBCR) attacks. For terrorism, private sector
catastrophe reinsurance capacity is limited and generally unavailable for terrorism losses caused
by nuclear, biological, chemical or radiological weapons attacks. As such, the Company’s principal
reinsurance protection against large-scale terrorist attacks is the coverage currently provided
through the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program Reauthorization Act (“TRIPRA”). On December 26, 2007,
the President signed TRIPRA extending the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of 2002 (“TRIA”) through the
end of 2014. TRIPRA provides a backstop for insurance-related losses resulting from any “act of
terrorism” certified by the Secretary of the Treasury, in concurrence with the Secretary of State
and Attorney General, that result in industry losses in excess of $100. In addition, TRIPRA
revised the TRIA definition of a certified “act of terrorism” by removing the requirement that an
act be committed “on behalf of any foreign person or foreign interest.” As a result, domestic acts
of terrorism can now be certified as “acts of terrorism” under the program, subject to the other
requirements of TRIPRA. Under the program, in any one calendar year, the federal government would
pay 85% of covered losses from a certified act of terrorism after an insurer’s losses exceed 20% of
the company’s eligible direct commercial earned premiums of the prior calendar year, up to a
combined annual aggregate limit for the federal government and all insurers of $100 billion. If an
act of terrorism or acts of terrorism result in covered losses exceeding the $100 billion annual
industry aggregate limit, a future Congress would be responsible for determining how additional
losses in excess of $100 billion will be paid.

Among other items, TRIPRA required that the President’s Working Group on Financial Markets (“PWG”)
continue to perform an analysis regarding the long-term availability and affordability of insurance
for terrorism risk.  Among the findings detailed in the PWG’s initial report, released October 2,
2006, were that the high level of uncertainty associated with predicting the frequency of terrorist
attacks, coupled with the unwillingness of some insurance policyholders to purchase insurance
coverage, makes predicting long term development of the terrorism risk market difficult, and that
there is likely little potential for future market development for nuclear, biological, chemical
and radiological (“NBCR”) coverage.  A December 2008 study by the U.S. Government Accountability
Office (GAO) found that property and casualty insurers still generally seek to exclude NBCR
coverage from their commercial policies when permitted. However, while nuclear, pollution and
contamination exclusions are contained in many property and liability insurance policies, the GAO
report concluded that such exclusions may be subject to challenges in court because they were not
specifically drafted to address terrorist attacks. Furthermore, workers’ compensation policies
generally have no exclusions or limitations. The GAO found that commercial property and casualty
policyholders, including companies that own high-value properties in large cities, generally
reported that they could not obtain NBCR coverage. Commercial property and casualty insurers
generally remain unwilling to offer NBCR coverage because of uncertainties about the risk and the
potential for catastrophic losses.

The Texas Windstorm Insurance Association (“TWIA”)

The Texas Windstorm Insurance Association (“TWIA”) provides hail and windstorm coverage to Texas
residents of 14 counties along the Texas Gulf coast who are unable to obtain insurance from other
carriers. Insurance carriers who write property insurance in the state of Texas, including The
Hartford, are required to be members of TWIA and are obligated to pay assessments in the event that
TWIA losses exceed funds on hand, the available funds in the Texas Catastrophe Reserve Trust Fund
(“CRTF”) and any available reinsurance. Assessments are allocated to carriers based on their share
of premium writings in the state of Texas, as defined.

During 2008, the board of directors of TWIA notified its member companies that it would assess them
$100 to cover TWIA losses from hurricane Dolly and a total of $430 for hurricane Ike. For
hurricane Dolly, the Company’s share of the assessment was $4, which was recorded as incurred
losses within current accident year catastrophes in 2008.



For hurricane Ike, the TWIA board indicated that the first $370 of TWIA losses from hurricane Ike
would be covered by the CRTF, but that the cost of TWIA losses and reinstatement premium above that
amount would be funded by assessments. Of the $430 in assessments, $230 is to fund the first $230
of TWIA losses in excess of the $370 available in the CRTF and $200 is to fund additional
reinsurance premiums that TWIA must pay to reinstate a layer of coverage that reimburses TWIA for
up to $1.5 billion of TWIA losses in excess of $600 per occurrence. Thus, TWIA’s assessment notice
for $430 is based on an estimate that TWIA losses from hurricane Ike will total approximately $2.1
billion. If TWIA losses exceed $2.1 billion, the entire amount in excess of $2.1 billion would be
recovered from assessing member companies according to their market share. In notifying member
companies, TWIA’s board of directors stated that actual TWIA losses will likely be greater than
$2.1 billion and management has accrued a total of $27 in assessments for Ike based on an estimate
that TWIA’s Ike losses will be approximately $2.5 billion and that TWIA assessments to the industry
will ultimately be approximately $830. Of the $27 in assessments for Ike recorded in 2008, $7 has
been recorded as incurred losses within current accident year catastrophes and $20 has been
recorded as insurance operating costs and expenses.

Through premium tax credits, member companies may recoup a portion of Ike-related assessments made
to cover the first $2.1 billion of TWIA losses and may recoup all of the Ike-related assessments
made to fund losses in excess of that amount. None of the assessments for hurricane Dolly may be
recouped. Under generally accepted accounting principles, the Company is required to accrue the
assessments in the period the assessments become probable and estimable and the obligating event
has occurred. However, premium tax credits may not be recorded as an asset until the related
premium is earned and TWIA requires that premium tax credits be spread over a period of at least
five years. The Company estimates that of the $27 of accrued assessments for Ike, it will
ultimately be able to recoup $20 through premium tax credits.

Florida Citizens Assessments

Citizens Property Insurance Corporation in Florida (“Citizens”) provides property insurance to
Florida homeowners and businesses that are unable to obtain insurance from other carriers,
including for properties deemed to be “high risk”. Citizens maintains a Personal Lines account, a
Commercial Lines account and a High Risk account. If Citizens incurs a deficit in any of these
accounts, Citizens may impose a “regular assessment” on other insurance carriers in the state to
fund the deficits, subject to certain restrictions and subject to approval by the Florida Office of
Insurance Regulation. Carriers are then permitted to surcharge policyholders to recover the
assessments over the next few years. Citizens may also opt to finance a portion of the deficits
through issuing bonds and may impose “emergency assessments” on other insurance carriers to fund
the bond repayments. Unlike with regular assessments, however, insurance carriers only serve as a
collection agent for emergency assessments and are not required to remit surcharges for emergency
assessments to Citizens until they collect surcharges from policyholders. Under generally accepted
accounting principles, the Company is required to accrue for regular assessments in the period the
assessments become probable and estimable and the obligating event has occurred. Surcharges to
recover the amount of regular assessments may not be recorded as an asset until the related premium
is written. Emergency assessments that may be levied by Citizens are not recorded in the income
statement.

In 2006, Citizens assessed the Company to fund deficits arising from hurricane losses in 2004 and
2005. In 2006, the Company reduced its estimate of Citizens assessments by $41 from the amount
that had been originally estimated in 2005.

Reinsurance Recoverables

Reinsurance recoverables represent loss and loss adjustment expenses recoverable from a number of
entities, including reinsurers and pools. As shown in the following table, a portion of the total
gross reinsurance recoverable relates to the Company’s mandatory participation in various
involuntary assigned risk pools and the value of annuity contracts held under structured settlement
agreements. Reinsurance recoverables due from mandatory pools are backed by the financial strength
of the property and casualty insurance industry. Annuities purchased from third party life
insurers under structured settlements are recognized as reinsurance recoverables in cases where the
Company has not obtained a release from the claimant. Of the remaining gross reinsurance
recoverable as of December 31, 2008 and 2007, the following table shows the portion of recoverables
due from companies rated by A.M. Best.

Based on A.M. Best ratings as of December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively.

Where its contracts permit, the Company secures future claim obligations with various forms of
collateral, including irrevocable letters of credit, secured trusts, funds held accounts and group
wide offsets. As part of its reinsurance recoverable review, the Company analyzes recent
developments in commutation activity between reinsurers and cedants, recent trends in arbitration
and litigation outcomes in disputes between cedants and reinsurers and the overall credit quality
of the Company’s reinsurers. Due largely to investment losses sustained by reinsurers in 2008, the
financial strength ratings of some reinsurers have been downgraded and the financial strength
ratings of other reinsurers have been put on negative watch. Nevertheless, as indicated in the
above table, approximately 98% of the gross reinsurance recoverables due from reinsurers rated by
A.M. Best were rated A- (excellent) or better as of December 31, 2008. Due to the inherent
uncertainties as to collection and the length of time before such amounts will be due, it is
possible that future adjustments to the Company’s reinsurance recoverables, net of the allowance,
could be required, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s consolidated results
of operations or cash flows in a particular quarterly or annual period.

Annually, the Company completes an evaluation of the reinsurance recoverable asset associated with
older, long-term casualty liabilities reported in the Other Operations segment. As a result of
this evaluation, the Company reduced its net reinsurance recoverable by $243 in 2006. See the
“Other Operations” section of the MD&A for further discussion.

Monitoring Reinsurer Security

To manage the potential credit risk resulting from the use of reinsurance, management evaluates the
credit standing, financial performance, management and operational quality of each potential
reinsurer. Through that process, the Company maintains a list of reinsurers approved for
participation on all treaty and facultative reinsurance placements. The Company’s approval
designations reflect the differing credit exposure associated with various classes of business.
Participation authorizations are categorized along property, short-tail casualty and long-tail
casualty lines. In addition to defining participation eligibility, the Company regularly monitors
each active reinsurer’s credit risk exposure in the aggregate and limits that exposure based upon
independent credit rating levels.

Unless otherwise specified, the following discussion speaks to changes for the year ended December
31, 2008 compared to the year ended December 31, 2007 and the year ended December 31, 2007 compared

Year ended December 31, 2008 compared to the year ended December 31, 2007

Net income

Net income decreased by $1,288, from $1,477 in 2007 to $189 in 2008, due primarily to an increase
in net realized capital losses and a decrease in net investment income.

Net realized capital losses increased by $1,509

The increase in net realized capital losses of $1,509 in 2008 was primarily due to realized losses
in 2008 from impairments of subordinated fixed maturities and preferred equity securities in the
financial services sector as well as of securitized assets. (See the Other-Than-Temporary
Impairments discussion within “Investment Results” in the “Investments” section of the MD&A for
more information on the impairments recorded in 2008).



Net investment income decreased by $383

Primarily driving the $383 decrease in net investment income were a change from net income to net
losses on limited partnerships and other alternative investments in 2008 and decreased fixed
maturity income. The net losses on limited partnerships and other alternative investments in 2008
were largely due to negative returns on hedge funds and real estate partnerships as a result of the
lack of liquidity in the financial markets and credit spread widening. The decrease in income from
fixed maturities was attributable to lower income on variable rate securities due to declines in
short term interest rates as well as an increased allocation to lower
yielding U.S. Treasuries and
short-term investments.

Underwriting results decreased by $12

Earned premium decreased by $160

Ongoing Operations’ earned premium decreased by $160, or 2%, primarily due to a 5% decrease in
Middle Market and a 4% decrease in Specialty Commercial. Refer to the earned premium discussion in
the Executive Overview section of the Property & Casualty MD&A for further discussion of the
decrease in earned premium.

Losses and loss adjustment expenses decreased by $146

Current accident year losses and loss adjustment expenses before catastrophes decreased by
$302

Ongoing Operations’ current accident year losses and loss adjustment expenses before catastrophes
decreased by $302 due to a decrease in the current accident year loss and loss adjustment expense
ratio before catastrophes and a decrease in earned premium. The current accident year loss and
loss adjustment expense ratio before catastrophes decreased by 1.9 points, to 61.9, due primarily
to decreases in Personal Lines, Small Commercial and Middle Market.



Personal Lines

•

The current accident year
loss and loss adjustment expense
ratio before catastrophes in
Personal Lines decreased by 1.4
points, primarily due to favorable
expected frequency on auto liability
claims and the effect of earned
pricing increases for both auto and
homeowners, partially offset by
increased frequency and severity of
non-catastrophe losses on
homeowners’ business.

Small Commercial

•

The current accident year
loss and loss adjustment expense
ratio before catastrophes in Small
Commercial decreased by 5.2 points,
primarily due to a lower loss and
loss adjustment expense ratio for
workers’ compensation business and,
to a lesser extent, a lower loss and
loss adjustment expense ratio for
package business. The lower loss
and loss adjustment expense ratio
for workers’ compensation business
was primarily due to lower expected
claim frequency, partially offset by
the effect of earned pricing
decreases.

Middle Market

•

The current accident year
loss and loss adjustment expense
ratio before catastrophes in Middle
Market decreased by 1.0 point,
primarily due to a lower loss and
loss adjustment expense ratio for
workers’ compensation and general
liability business, largely offset
by higher non-catastrophe losses on
property and marine business and the
effect of earned pricing decreases.
The higher non-catastrophe losses on
property business were driven by
increased severity, including a
number of large individual claims,
and the higher non-catastrophe
losses on marine business were
primarily driven by increased
frequency.

Specialty Commercial

•

The current accident year
loss and loss adjustment expense
ratio before catastrophes in
Specialty Commercial increased by
1.5 points, primarily due to a
higher loss and loss adjustment
ratio on directors and officers
insurance in professional liability
driven by earned pricing decreases.

Current accident year catastrophes increased by $366

Current accident year catastrophe losses of $543, or 5.3 points, in 2008 were higher than current
accident year catastrophe losses of $177, or 1.7 points, in 2007, primarily due to losses from
hurricane Ike and tornadoes and thunderstorms in the South and Midwest.

An increase in net favorable prior accident year reserve development of $210

Net favorable prior accident year reserve development increased from net favorable development of
$145, or 1.4 points, in 2007, to net favorable development of $355, or 3.4 points, in 2008. Among
other reserve developments, net favorable development in 2008 included a $156 release of workers’
compensation reserves, primarily related to accident years 2000 to 2007, a $105 release of general
liability reserves, primarily related to accident years 2001 to 2007 and a $75 release of reserves
for directors’ and officers insurance and errors and omissions insurance claims related to accident
years 2003 to 2006. Refer to the “Reserves” section of the MD&A for further discussion of the
prior accident year reserve development in 2008.

Net favorable reserve development of $145 in 2007 included several changes in reserves, including a
$151 release of workers’ compensation loss and loss adjustment expense reserves, primarily for
accident years 2002 to 2006. Refer to the “Reserves” section of the MD&A for further discussion of
the prior accident year reserve development in 2007.

Operating expenses decreased by $2

The $9 decrease in the amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs was primarily due to the
decrease in earned premium, partially offset by the amortization of higher acquisition costs on
AARP business and higher underwriting costs in Middle Market. Insurance operating costs and
expenses increased by $7, primarily due to higher IT costs and an estimated $20 of assessments owed
to TWIA to fund Texas Gulf Coast losses sustained by TWIA in 2008 due to hurricane Ike, partially
offset by lower compensation-related costs. The expense ratio increased by 0.3 points, to 26.6,
primarily due to the amortization of higher acquisition costs on AARP business and higher
underwriting costs in Middle Market and the increase in insurance operating costs and expenses.

Net servicing income decreased by $21

The decrease in net servicing income was primarily driven by a decrease in servicing income from
the AARP Health program, Specialty Risk Services and the Write Your Own flood program and the
write-off of software used in administering policies for third parties.

A $608 change from income tax expense to an income tax benefit

Income taxes changed from income tax expense of $575 in 2007 to an income tax benefit of $33 in
2008. Despite pre-tax income in 2008, there was a net income tax benefit in 2008 because the
income tax benefit on realized capital losses was greater than the income tax expense on all other
components of pre-tax income. A portion of the Company’s net investment income was generated from
tax-exempt securities.



Year ended December 31, 2007 compared to the year ended December 31, 2006

Net income decreased by $77, or 5%, due primarily to a decrease in underwriting results and an
increase in net realized capital losses, partially offset by an increase in net investment income.

Underwriting results decreased by $142

Underwriting results decreased by $142, from $1,111 to $969, with a corresponding 1.5 point
increase in the combined ratio, from 89.3 to 90.8, due to:

Sale of Omni

The Company sold its Omni non-standard auto business in the fourth quarter of 2006. Omni accounted
for an underwriting loss of $52 in 2006, including $127 of earned premiums, $140 of loss and loss
adjustment expenses, $30 of amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs and $9 of insurance
operating costs and expenses.

Earned premium increased by $63

Ongoing Operations’ earned premium increased by $63, or 1%, to $10,491, driven by a 3% increase in
both Personal Lines and Small Commercial, partially offset by a 4% decrease in Middle Market and a
3% decrease in Specialty Commercial. Excluding Omni, earned premium increased by $185, or 2%.
Refer to the earned premium discussion in the Executive Overview section of the Property & Casualty
MD&A for further discussion of the increase in earned premium.

Losses and loss adjustment expenses increased by $82

Current accident year loss and loss adjustment expenses before catastrophes increased by
$185

Ongoing Operations’ current accident year loss and loss adjustment expenses before catastrophes
increased by $185 in 2007, to $6,692, due largely to an increase in the current accident year loss
and loss adjustment expense ratio and an increase in earned premium, partially offset by a decrease
due to the sale of Omni. Excluding Omni, the current accident year loss and loss adjustment
expense ratio before catastrophes increased by 1.7 points, to 63.8, due to an increase in the
current accident year loss and loss adjustment expense ratio before catastrophes of 3.3 points in
Personal Lines, 1.4 points in Small Commercial and 1.9 points in Middle Market, partially offset by
a decrease in the current accident year loss and loss adjustment expense ratio before catastrophes
of 1.8 points in Specialty Commercial.



Personal Lines

•

Excluding the effect of
Omni, the 3.3 point increase in the
current accident year loss and loss
adjustment expense ratio before
catastrophes in Personal Lines was
primarily due to increased severity
on auto liability claims, increased
frequency on auto property damage
claims and, to a lesser extent,
increased severity on homeowners
claims, partially offset by the
effect of earned pricing increases
in homeowners.

Small Commercial

•

The 1.4 point increase in
the current accident year loss and
loss adjustment expense ratio before
catastrophes in Small Commercial was
primarily due to a higher loss ratio
and loss adjustment expense ratio
for package business and commercial
auto claims, partially offset by a
lower loss and loss adjustment
expense ratio for workers’
compensation claims.

Middle Market

•

The 1.9 point increase in
the current accident year loss and
loss adjustment expense ratio before
catastrophes in Middle Market was
primarily due to a higher loss and
loss adjustment expense ratio for
workers’ compensation, general
liability and commercial auto claims
driven, in part, by earned pricing
decreases. For commercial auto,
loss costs increased for both
liability and property damage
claims.

Specialty Commercial

•

The 1.8 point decrease in
the current accident year loss and
loss adjustment expense ratio before
catastrophes in Specialty Commercial
was primarily due to a lower loss
and loss adjustment ratio on
directors and officers insurance in
professional liability, partially
offset by a higher loss and loss
adjustment expense ratio on casualty
business.

Current accident year catastrophes decreased by $22

Current accident year catastrophe losses decreased by $22, from $199, or 1.9 points, in 2006 to
$177, or 1.7 points, in 2007. The largest catastrophe losses in 2007 were from wildfires in
California, spring windstorms in the Southeast and Northeast, tornadoes and thunderstorms in the
Midwest and a December ice storm in the Midwest. Catastrophes in 2006 included tornadoes and hail
storms in the Midwest and windstorms in Texas and on the East coast.

Increase in net favorable prior accident year reserve development by $81

Net favorable prior accident year reserve development increased from $64, or 0.6 points, in 2006 to
$145, or 1.4 points, in 2007. Net favorable reserve development of $145 in 2007 included several
changes in reserves, including a $151 release of workers’ compensation loss and loss adjustment
expense reserves, primarily for accident years 2002 to 2006. Refer to the “Reserves” section of
the MD&A for further discussion of the prior accident year reserve development in 2007.

The $64 of net favorable prior accident year development in 2006 included several changes in
reserves, including an $83 net release of prior accident year hurricane reserves. Refer to the
“Reserves” section of the MD&A for further discussion of the prior accident year reserve
development in 2006.

Operating expenses increased by $123

The 0.7 point increase in the expense ratio and the 0.3 point increase in the policyholder dividend
ratio was primarily due to an increase in insurance operating costs and expenses. Insurance
operating costs and expenses increased by $125, partly because insurance operating costs and
expenses in 2006 included the effect of a $41 reduction of estimated Citizens’ assessments related
to the 2005 Florida hurricanes. Also contributing to the increase in insurance and operating costs
and expenses was a $34 increase in policyholder dividends due largely to a $20 increase in the
estimated amount of dividends payable to certain workers’ compensation policyholders due to
underwriting profits. Apart from the effect of Citizens assessments and policyholder dividends,
insurance operating costs and expenses increased by $50, primarily due to an increase in IT costs
and an increase in non-deferrable salaries and benefits and other internal operating costs.

Despite the increase in earned premium, amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs remained
relatively flat from 2006 to 2007 due to the effect of the sale of Omni. Excluding the effect of
Omni, amortization increased by $28, or 1%, primarily driven by the 2% growth in earned premiums
excluding Omni. In 2006, Omni accounted for $127 of earned premiums and $30 of amortization.

Net investment income increased by $214

Primarily driving the $214 increase in net investment income was a higher average invested asset
base and income earned from a higher portfolio yield. The increase in the average invested asset
base contributing to the increase in investment income was primarily due to positive operating cash
flows, partially offset by the return of capital to Corporate. Contributing to the increase in net
investment income was an increase in income from limited partnerships and other alternative
investments, driven by a higher yield on these investments and shifting a greater allocation of
investments to these asset classes.



Net realized capital losses increased by $143

Net realized capital losses increased from $17 in 2006 to $160 in 2007, primarily due to an
increase in impairments and decreases in the fair value of non-qualifying
derivatives attributable to changes in value associated with credit derivatives due to credit
spread widening. Impairments in 2007 primarily consisted of impairments of
asset-backed securities backed by sub-prime residential mortgage loans and impairments of corporate
securities in the financial services and homebuilders sectors. (See the Other-Than-Temporary
Impairments discussion within Investment Results for more information on the impairments recorded
in 2007).

Other expenses increased by $26

Other expenses increased by $26, primarily due to $49 of interest charged by Corporate on the
amount of capital held by the Property & Casualty operation in excess of the amount needed to
support the capital requirements of the Property & Casualty operation, partially offset by a
reduction in the estimated cost of legal settlements in 2007.



PERSONAL LINES

Personal Lines sells automobile, homeowners and home-based business coverages directly to the
consumer and through a network of independent agents. Most of the Company’s personal lines
business sold directly to the consumer is to the members of AARP through a direct marketing
operation. Up until the sale of the business on November 30, 2006, the Company also sold
non-standard auto insurance through the Company’s Omni Insurance Group, Inc. (“Omni”) subsidiary.
Personal Lines also operates a member contact center for health insurance products offered through
the AARP Health program. The Hartford’s exclusive licensing arrangement with AARP continues until
January 1, 2020 for automobile, homeowners and home-based business. The AARP Health program
agreement continues through 2009.

Earned Premiums

Year ended December 31, 2008 compared to the year ended December 31, 2007

Earned premiums increased $37, or 1%, due primarily to earned premium growth in AARP, partially
offset by earned premium decreases in Agency and Other.

•

AARP earned premium grew $97, reflecting modest earned pricing increases for both auto and
homeowners and the effect of new business premium outpacing non-renewals in the last nine
months of 2007. New business has offset non-renewals in 2008 and new business in 2008 has
been driven by growth in the size of the AARP target market, the effect of direct marketing
programs and the effect of cross selling homeowners insurance to insureds who have auto
policies.

•

Agency earned premium decreased by $43 as the effect of a decline in new business premium
and premium renewal retention since the middle of 2007 was partially offset by the effect of
modest earned pricing increases. The market environment continues to be intensely
competitive. The increase in advertising for auto business among the top carriers is also
occurring with homeowners’ business, particularly in non-coastal and non-catastrophe prone
areas. In 2008, a number of Personal Lines carriers began to increase rates although a
significant portion of the market continues to compete heavily on price.

•

Other earned premium decreased by $17, primarily due to a decision to reduce other affinity
business.

Auto earned premium was relatively flat in 2008 as the effect of earned pricing increases of 1% was
largely offset by a decrease in new business since the middle of 2007. Homeowners’ earned premium
grew 3% largely due to earned pricing increases of 3%.

New business premium

•

Both auto and homeowners’
new business written premium
decreased in 2008. Auto new
business decreased by $60, or 14%,
including decreases in both AARP and
Agency. Homeowners’ new business
decreased by $34, or 24%, including
decreases in both AARP and Agency.
AARP new business written premium
decreased primarily due to lower
auto and homeowners’ policy
conversion rates, driven by
increased competition, including the
effect of price decreases by some
carriers and the effect of continued
advertising among carriers for new
business. Agency new business
written premium decreased primarily
due to price competition driven, in
part, by a greater number of agents
using comparative rating software to
obtain quotes from multiple
carriers.

Premium renewal retention

•

Premium renewal retention
for auto decreased from 88% to 87%,
driven primarily by a decrease in
policy retention for both AARP and
Agency business, partially offset by
the effect of modest written pricing
increases in 2008. Premium renewal
retention for homeowners decreased
from 96% to 89% driven by a decrease
in retention for both AARP and
Agency business. The decrease in
premium renewal retention for AARP
homeowners’ business was driven by
increased price competition by some
carriers and mandated homeowners
rate declines in Florida for AARP
policies. The decrease in premium
renewal retention for Agency
homeowners’ business was due, in
part, to Florida policyholders
non-renewing as a result of the
Company’s decision to stop renewing
Florida homeowners’ policies sold
through agents.

Earned pricing increase (decrease)

•

Auto earned pricing
increases of 1% represent the
portion of the 2% increase in
written pricing for 2008 that is
reflected in earned premium. While
auto written pricing was flat in
2007, in 2008 the Company has
increased auto insurance rates in
certain states for certain classes
to maintain profitability in the
face of rising loss costs. Although
moderating, written pricing
increases in 2008 included the
effect of policyholders purchasing
newer vehicle models in place of
older models. Homeowners’ earned
pricing increases of 3% primarily
reflect the earning of a blend of
mid-single digit written pricing
increases recognized over the last
nine months of 2007 and 2% written
pricing increases recognized in the
first nine months of 2008. Written
pricing increases in homeowners were
largely driven by increases in
coverage limits due to rising
replacement costs.

Policies in-force

•

The number of policies
in-force decreased slightly for both
auto and homeowners, primarily due
to a 7% decline in the number of
Agency policies in-force, partially
offset by a 1% increase in the
number of AARP policies in-force.

Year ended December 31, 2007 compared to the year ended December 31, 2006

Earned premiums increased $129, or 3%, primarily due to earned premium growth in both AARP and
Agency, partially offset by a reduction in Other earned premium.

•

AARP earned premium grew $215, or 9%, reflecting growth in the size of the AARP target
market, the effect of direct marketing programs and the effect of cross selling homeowners
insurance to insureds who have auto policies.

•

Agency earned premium grew $55, or 5%, as a result of an increase in the number of agency
appointments and further refinement of the Dimensions class plans first introduced in 2003.
Dimensions allows Personal Lines to write a broader class of risks. The plan, which is
available through the Company’s network of independent agents, was enhanced beginning in the
third quarter of 2006 as “Dimensions with Auto Packages” and the enhanced plan is now offered
in 34 states with four distinct package offerings as of December 31, 2007.

•

Other earned premium decreased by $141, primarily due to the sale of Omni on November 30,
2006 and a strategic decision to reduce other affinity business. Omni accounted for earned
premiums of $127 for the year ended December 31, 2006.



The earned premium growth in AARP and Agency was primarily due to auto and homeowners new business
written premium outpacing non-renewals over the last six months of 2006 and the first six months of
2007.

Auto earned premium grew slightly, by $30, or 1%, for the year ended December 31, 2007, primarily
due to new business outpacing non-renewals in AARP and Agency over the last six months of 2006 and
the first six months of 2007, partially offset by the effect of the sale of Omni. Before
considering the effect of the sale of Omni, auto earned premium grew $152, or 6%, for the year
ended December 31, 2007. Homeowners’ earned premium grew $99, or 10%, primarily due to earned
pricing increases and due to new business outpacing non-renewals in AARP business over the last six
months of 2006 and the first six months of 2007 and new business outpacing non-renewals in Agency
over the last three months of 2006 and the first six months of 2007.

New business premium

•

Omni accounted for $25 of
new business written premium during
the 2006 calendar year. Excluding
Omni business, auto new business
written premium decreased by $20, or
5%, to $424, for the year ended
December 31, 2007. The decrease in
auto new business premium was due to
a decrease in AARP and Agency auto
new business as a result of
increased competition. Homeowners’
new business written premium
decreased by $21, or 13%, primarily
due to a decrease in Agency new
business, partially offset by an
increase in AARP new business.

Premium renewal retention

•

Premium renewal retention
for auto increased from 87% to 88%
for the year ended December 31,
2007, primarily due to the sale of
the Omni non-standard auto business
during 2006, which had a lower
premium renewal retention than the
Company’s standard auto business.
Excluding Omni business, premium
renewal retention decreased
slightly, from 89% to 88%, as
renewal retention remained flat in
AARP and decreased in Agency.
Premium renewal retention for
homeowners increased from 94% to 96%
for the year ended December 31,
2007, primarily due to an increase
in retention of Agency business.

Earned pricing increase (decrease)

•

The trend in earned pricing
during 2007 was primarily a
reflection of the written pricing
changes in the last six months of
2006 and the first six months of
2007. Written pricing remained flat
in auto primarily due to an extended
period of favorable results
factoring into the rate setting
process. Homeowners’ written
pricing continued to increase due
largely to increases in insurance to
value and an increase in the value
of insured properties. Insurance to
value is the ratio of the amount of
insurance purchased to the value of
the insured property.

Policies in-force

•

Consistent with the growth
in earned premium, the number of
policies in-force has increased in
auto and homeowners. The growth in
policies in-force does not
correspond directly with the growth
in earned premiums due to the effect
of earned pricing changes and
because policy in-force counts are
as of a point in time rather than
over a period of time.

Earned premiums increased $37, or 1%, primarily due to earned premium growth in AARP, partially
offset by a decrease in Agency and Other earned premium. Refer to the earned premium section above
for further discussion.

Losses and loss adjustment expenses increased by $52

Current accident year losses and loss adjustment expenses before catastrophes decreased by
$34

Personal Lines current accident year losses and loss adjustment expenses before catastrophes
decreased by $34, to $2,542, due to a decrease in the current accident year loss and loss
adjustment expense ratio before catastrophes, partially offset by the effect of higher earned
premium. The current accident year loss and loss adjustment expense ratio before catastrophes
decreased by 1.4 points, to 64.8. The decrease was primarily due to favorable expected frequency
on auto liability claims and the effect of earned pricing increases for both auto and homeowners,
partially offset by increased frequency and severity of non-catastrophe losses on homeowners
business.

Current accident year catastrophes increased by $133

Current accident year catastrophe losses of $258, or 6.6 points, in 2008 were higher than current
accident year catastrophe losses of $125, or 3.2 points, in 2007, primarily due to losses from
hurricane Ike and tornadoes and thunderstorms in the South and Midwest.

Net favorable prior accident year reserve development increased by $47

Net favorable reserve development of $51 in 2008 included a $46 release of auto liability reserves,
primarily related to accident years 2005 to 2007 and a $24 release of reserves for
extra-contractual liability claims under non-standard personal auto policies. Net favorable
reserve development of $4 in 2007 included a $16 release of reserves for loss and allocated loss
and loss adjustment expenses on Personal Lines auto liability claims for accident years 2002 to
2006.

Operating expenses increased by $27

Amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs increased by $16, driven primarily by the
increase in earned premium and the amortization of a higher amount of acquisition costs for AARP
business. Insurance operating costs and expenses increased by $11, primarily due to an estimated
$10 of assessments owed to TWIA in 2008. The expense ratio increased 0.4 points, to 22.8, due to
the increase in insurance operating costs and expenses and the amortization of a higher amount of
acquisition costs on AARP business.

Sale of Omni

The Company sold its Omni non-standard auto business in the fourth quarter of 2006. Omni accounted
for an underwriting loss of $52 in 2006, including $127 of earned premiums, $140 of loss and loss
adjustment expenses, $30 of amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs and $9 of insurance
operating costs and expenses.

Earned premium increased by $129

Personal Lines earned premium increased by $129, or 3%, to $3,889, primarily driven by an increase
in AARP and Agency earned premium, partially offset by a decrease of $122 due to the sale of Omni
in 2006. Refer to the earned premium discussion for a description of the increase in earned
premium.

Losses and loss adjustment expenses increased by $219

Current accident year loss and loss adjustment expenses before catastrophes increased by
$180

Personal Lines current accident year loss and loss adjustment expenses before catastrophes
increased by $180 in 2007, to $2,576, due to an increase in earned premium and an increase in the
current accident year loss and loss adjustment expense ratio before catastrophes, partially offset
by a decrease due to the sale of Omni. Excluding the effect of Omni, the current accident year
loss and loss adjustment expense ratio before catastrophes increased by 3.3 points, to 66.2. The
increase was primarily due to a higher loss and loss adjustment expense ratio for auto liability
claims, increased frequency on auto property damage claims and, to a lesser extent, increased
severity on homeowners claims, partially offset by the effect of earned pricing increases in
homeowners. The higher loss and loss adjustment expense ratio for auto liability claims was
primarily driven by increased bodily injury severity.

Current accident year catastrophes increased by $5

Current accident year catastrophe losses of $125, or 3.2 points, in 2007 were slightly higher than
current accident year catastrophe losses of $120, or 3.2 points, in 2006. The largest catastrophe
losses in 2007 were from wildfires in California, spring windstorms in the Southeast and Northeast,
tornadoes and thunderstorms in the Midwest and a December ice storm in the Midwest. Catastrophes
losses during 2006 included tornadoes and hail storms in the Midwest and windstorms in Texas and on
the East coast.

Net favorable prior accident year reserve development decreased by $34

Net favorable prior accident year reserve development decreased from $38, or 1.0 point, in 2006 to
$4, or 0.1 points, in 2007. Net favorable reserve development of $4 in 2007 included a $16 release
of reserves for loss and allocated loss and loss adjustment expenses on Personal Lines auto
liability claims for accident years 2002 to 2006.

Net favorable prior accident year reserve development of $38 in 2006 included a $53 reduction in
prior accident year reserves for auto liability claims related to accident years 2003 to 2005 and a
$23 reduction in hurricane catastrophe reserves related to the 2004 and 2005 hurricanes, partially
offset by a $30 increase in reserves for personal auto liability claims due to an increase in
estimated severity on claims where the Company is exposed to losses in excess of policy limits.

Operating expenses increased by $17

The expense ratio decreased by 0.3 points, to 22.4, in 2007, due largely to an increase in
insurance operating costs and expenses. Omni accounted for $9 of insurance operating costs and
expenses in 2006. Excluding Omni, insurance operating costs and expenses increased by $31, or 14%,
primarily due to the effect of a $19 reduction of estimated Citizen’s assessments in 2006 related
to 2005 Florida hurricanes. Also contributing to the increase in insurance and operating costs was
an increase in AARP distribution costs and other insurance operating costs, partially offset by
lower IT costs.

Omni accounted for $30 of amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs in 2006. Excluding
Omni, amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs increased by $25, or 4%, driven primarily
by the increase in earned premium.



SMALL COMMERCIAL

primarily throughout the United States, with up to $5 in annual payroll, $15 in annual revenues or
$15 in total property values. This segment offers workers’ compensation, property, automobile,
liability and umbrella coverages.

Earned Premiums

Year ended December 31, 2008 compared to the year ended December 31, 2007

Earned premiums for the Small Commercial segment were down slightly as a decrease in commercial
auto was largely offset by an increase in worker’s compensation. The earned premium decrease was
largely due to the effect of non-renewals outpacing new business for commercial auto business in
2008 and to earned pricing decreases, largely offset by new business outpacing non-renewals in
workers’ compensation business over the last nine months of 2007 and the first nine months of 2008.
While the Company has focused on increasing new business from its agents and expanding writings in
certain territories, actions taken by some of the Company’s competitors to increase market share
and increase business appetite in certain classes of risks and actions taken by the Company to
reduce workers’ compensation rates in certain states have contributed to the decrease in written
premiums from 2007 to 2008.

New business premium

•

New business written premium
was down $35, or 7%, driven by a
decrease in new package and
commercial automobile business. New
business for package and commercial
auto business declined due to
increased competition despite the
use of lower pricing on targeted
accounts and an increase in
commissions paid to agents. New
business written premium for
workers’ compensation was up
modestly.

Premium renewal retention

•

Premium renewal retention
decreased from 84% to 82% due
largely to the effect of a decrease
in retention of workers’
compensation business, including the
effect of larger written pricing
decreases.

Earned pricing increase (decrease)

•

Earned pricing decreased for
workers’ compensation and commercial
auto and was flat for package
business. As written premium is
earned over the 12-month term of the
policies, the earned pricing changes
during 2008 were primarily a
reflection of written pricing
decreases of 2% over the last nine
months of 2007 and 2% over the first
nine months of 2008.

Policies in-force

•

While earned premium was
slightly down for 2008, the number
of policies in-force has increased
2%. The growth in policies in-force
does not correspond directly with
the change in earned premiums due to
the effect of changes in earned
pricing and changes in the average
premium per policy.



Year ended December 31, 2007 compared to the year ended December 31, 2006

Earned premiums for the Small Commercial segment increased $84, or 3%, primarily due to new
business premiums outpacing non-renewals for workers’ compensation business over the last six
months of 2006 and the first six months of 2007.

New business premium

•

New business written premium
for Small Commercial decreased by
$52, or 10%, as increased
competition led to a reduction in
new business for workers’
compensation, package business and
commercial auto. While the Company
has focused on increasing new
business from its agents and
expanding writings in certain
territories, actions taken by some
of the Company’s competitors to
increase market share and increase
business appetite in certain classes
of risks may be contributing to the
Company’s lower new business growth.
Also contributing to the decrease
in new business premium is lower
average premium per account partly
due to writing more liability-only
policies.

Premium renewal retention

•

Premium renewal retention
for Small Commercial decreased due,
in part, to lower retention of
larger accounts and a reduction in
average premium per account.

Earned pricing increase (decrease)

•

As written premium is earned
over the 12-month term of the
policies, the earned pricing changes
during 2007 are primarily a
reflection of the written pricing
changes over the last six months of
2006 and the first six months of
2007.

Policies in-force

•

Consistent with the increase
in earned premium, the number of
policies in force has increased. The
growth in policies in force does not
correspond directly with the change
in earned premiums due to the effect
of changes in earned pricing,
changes in the average premium per
policy and because policy in force
counts are as of a point in time
rather than over a period of time.

Losses and loss adjustment expenses increased by $67

Current accident year losses and loss adjustment expenses before catastrophes decreased by
$147

Small Commercial’s current accident year losses and loss adjustment expenses before catastrophes
decreased by $147 in 2008, to $1,447, primarily due to a 5.2 point decrease in the current accident
year loss and loss adjustment expense ratio before catastrophes, to 53.1. The decrease in this
ratio was primarily due to a lower loss and loss adjustment expense ratio for workers’ compensation
business and, to a lesser extent, a lower loss and loss adjustment expense ratio for package
business. Workers’ compensation claim frequency has been trending favorably for recent accident
years due to improved workplace safety and underwriting actions and the lower loss and loss
adjustment expense ratio for the 2008 accident year includes an assumption that this lower of claim
frequency would continue for the 2008 accident year. The loss and loss adjustment expense ratio
for the 2007 accident year recorded in 2007 did not give as much credence to this lower level of
claim frequency. The effect of lower claim frequency for workers’ compensation claims was
partially offset by the effect of earned pricing decreases.

Current accident year catastrophes increased by $94

Current accident year catastrophe losses of $122, or 4.5 points, in 2008 were higher than current
accident year catastrophe losses of $28, or 1.0 point, in 2007, primarily due to hurricane Ike and
tornadoes and thunderstorms in the South and Midwest.

Net favorable prior accident year development decreased by $120

Net favorable prior accident year development of $89 in 2008 included a $92 release of workers’
compensation reserves related to accident years 2000 to 2007. Net favorable reserve development of
$209 in 2007 included a $151 release of workers’ compensation loss and loss adjustment expense
reserves for accident years 2002 to 2006, a $33 release of workers’ compensation loss reserves
accident years 1987 to 2000 and a $30 release of loss reserves for package business for accident
years 2003 to 2006.

Operating expenses decreased by $8

Insurance operating costs and expenses decreased by $9, primarily due to lower compensation-related
and servicing costs, partially offset by an estimated $7 of TWIA assessments in 2008. Amortization
of deferred policy acquisition costs of $636 was relatively flat consistent with the change in
earned premium. The expense ratio decreased slightly in 2008, to 29.1, driven by the decrease in
insurance operating costs and expenses.



Year ended December 31, 2007 compared to the year ended December 31, 2006

Underwriting results increased by $86, from $422 to $508, with a corresponding 2.7 point

discussion for a description of the increase in earned premium.

Losses and loss adjustment expenses decreased by $55

Current accident year loss and loss adjustment expenses before catastrophes increased by
$85

Small Commercial current accident year loss and loss adjustment expenses before catastrophes
increased by $85 in 2007, to $1,594, due to an increase in earned premium and a 1.4 point increase
in the current accident year loss and loss adjustment expense ratio before catastrophes, to 58.3.
The 1.4 point increase in the current accident year loss and loss adjustment expense ratio before
catastrophes was primarily due to a higher loss ratio and loss adjustment expense ratio for package
business and commercial auto claims, partially offset by a lower loss and loss adjustment expense
ratio for workers’ compensation claims. The higher loss and loss adjustment expense ratio on
package business was primarily driven by an increase in the number of individual large losses and
the higher loss and loss adjustment expense ratio for auto claims was driven, in part, by earned
pricing decreases. Expected loss and loss adjustment expenses on workers’ compensation claims for
the 2007 accident year were lower as the assumed level of medical claim severity was not as high as
it had been for the 2006 accident year.

Current accident year catastrophes decreased by $6

Current accident year catastrophe losses in 2007 of $28, or 1.0 point, were moderately lower than
current accident year catastrophes of $34, or 1.3 points, in 2006. The largest catastrophe losses
in 2007 were from spring windstorms in the Southeast and Northeast, tornadoes and thunderstorms in
the Midwest and wildfires in California. Catastrophes in 2006 included tornadoes and hail storms
in the Midwest.

Increase in net favorable prior accident year development by $134

Net favorable prior accident year reserve development increased from $75, or 2.8 points, in 2006 to
$209, or 7.6 points, in 2007. Net favorable reserve development of $209 in 2007 included a $151
release of workers’ compensation loss and loss adjustment expense reserves for accident years 2002
to 2006, a $33 release of workers’ compensation loss reserves accident years 1987 to 2000 and a $30
release of loss reserves for package business for accident years 2003 to 2006.

Net favorable reserve development of $75 in 2006 included a $33 reduction in allocated loss
adjustment expense reserves, primarily for workers’ compensation and package business related to
accident years 2003 to 2005, and a $22 reduction in prior accident year catastrophe reserves in
2006 related to hurricanes Katrina, Rita and Wilma in 2005 and hurricanes Charley, Frances and
Jeanne in 2004.

Operating expenses increased by $53

The 0.7 point increase in the expense ratio and the 0.4 point increase in the policyholder dividend
ratio was primarily due to an increase in insurance operating costs and expenses. Insurance
operating costs increased by $52 due to an increase in IT and other operating costs, a $10 decrease
in estimated Citizens’ assessments in 2006 and a $10 increase in policyholder dividends in 2007.
The increase in policyholder dividends in 2007 was largely attributable to a $10 increase in the
estimated amount of dividends payable to certain workers’ compensation policyholders due to
underwriting profits. Despite a 3% increase in earned premium, amortization of deferred policy
acquisition costs was relatively flat from 2006 to 2007 due largely to an increase in
non-deferrable salaries and benefits and other internal operating costs.



MIDDLE MARKET

Middle Market provides standard commercial insurance coverage to middle market commercial
businesses, primarily throughout the United States, with greater than $5 in annual payroll, $15 in
annual revenues or $15 in total property values. This segment offers workers’ compensation,

Earned Premiums

Year ended December 31, 2008 compared to the year ended December 31, 2007

Earned premiums for the Middle Market segment decreased by $121, or 5%, driven primarily by
decreases in commercial auto, workers’ compensation and general liability. Earned premium
decreases were primarily due to a decline in earned pricing in 2008 and the effect of non-renewals
outpacing new business in commercial auto and general liability over the last nine months of 2007
and the first nine months of 2008, partially offset by the effect of new business written premium
outpacing non-renewals in workers’ compensation since the fourth quarter of 2007.

New business premium

•

New business written premium increased by $26, or 7%, in 2008 as an increase in new
business written premium for workers’ compensation was partially offset by a decrease in new
business for general liability, marine and commercial auto. While continued price competition
and the effect of some state-mandated rate reductions in workers’ compensation has lessened the
attractiveness of new business in certain lines and regions, the Company has increased new
business for workers’ compensation due, in part, to the effect of targeting business in selected
industries and regions of the country.

Premium renewal

retention

•

Premium renewal retention increased from 78% to 79% due largely to an increase in
retention of property and marine business, partially offset by the effect of larger written
pricing decreases on workers’ compensation and property business. The Company continued to take
actions to protect renewals in 2008, including the use of reduced pricing on targeted accounts.

Earned pricing

decrease

•

Earned pricing decreased in all lines of business, including workers’ compensation,
commercial auto, general liability, property and marine. As written premium is earned over the
12-month term of the policies, the earned pricing decreases in 2008 were primarily a reflection
of mid-single digit written pricing decreases over the last nine months of 2007 and the first
nine months of 2008. A number of carriers have continued to compete fairly aggressively on
price, particularly on larger accounts within Middle Market, which has contributed to mid-single
digit price decreases across the industry.

Policies in-force

•

The number of policies in-force increased by 3%, due largely to growth on smaller
accounts.



Year ended December 31, 2007 compared to the year ended December 31, 2006

Earned premiums for the Middle Market segment decreased by $103, or 4%. The decrease was primarily
due to earned pricing decreases and a decrease in new business written premium and premium renewal
retention over the last six months of 2006 and the first six months of 2007.

New business premium

•

The decrease in new business
written premium was primarily due to
continued price competition and the
effect of state-mandated rate
reductions in workers’ compensation.
New business written premium
declined in all lines except
workers’ compensation. As written
premium is earned over the 12-month
term of the policies, the earned
pricing changes during 2007 were
primarily a reflection of the
written pricing changes over the
last six months of 2006 and the
first six months of 2007.

Premium renewal retention

•

The decrease in premium
renewal retention was primarily due
to continued price competition and
the effect of state-mandated rate
reductions in workers’ compensation.
Premium renewal retention decreased
in all lines of business, including
property, commercial auto, general
liability, workers’ compensation and
marine.

Earned pricing increase (decrease)

•

Earned pricing decreased in
all lines of business, including
property, commercial auto, general
liability, workers’ compensation and
marine.

Policies in-force

•

Despite the decrease in
earned premium, the number of
policies in force has increased.
The change in policies in force does
not correspond directly with the
change in earned premiums due to a
reduction in the average premium per
policy and because policy in force
counts are as of a point in time
rather than over a period of time.

decreases in commercial auto, workers’ compensation and general liability. Refer to the earned
premium section for further discussion.

Losses and loss adjustment expenses decreased by $118

Current accident year losses and loss adjustment expenses before catastrophes decreased by
$101

Middle Market current accident year losses and loss adjustment expenses before catastrophes
decreased by $101 due largely to a decrease in earned premium. Before catastrophes, the current
accident year loss and loss adjustment expense ratio decreased by 1.0 point, to 63.5, primarily due
to a lower loss and loss adjustment expense ratio on workers’ compensation and general liability
business, largely offset by higher non-catastrophe losses on property and marine business and the
effect of earned pricing decreases. The higher non-catastrophe losses on property business were
driven by increased severity, including a number of large individual claims, and the higher
non-catastrophe losses on marine business were primarily driven by increased frequency.

Current accident year catastrophes increased by $101

Current accident year catastrophe losses of $116, or 5.1 points, in 2008 were higher than current
accident year catastrophe losses of $15, or 0.6 points, in 2007, primarily due to losses from
hurricane Ike and tornadoes and thunderstorms in the South and Midwest.

Net favorable prior accident year development increased by $118

Net favorable prior accident year reserve development increased from $16, or 0.7 points, in 2007 to
$134, or 5.9 points, in 2008. Net favorable reserve development of $134 in 2008 primarily included
a $90 release of reserves for high hazard and umbrella general liability claims, primarily related
to the 2001 to 2007 accident years, a $64 release of workers’ compensation reserves, primarily
related to accident years 2000 to 2007 and a $27 release of commercial auto liability reserves,
primarily related to accident years 2002 to 2007, partially offset by a $50 strengthening of
reserves for general liability and products liability claims primarily for accident years 2004 and
prior.

Net unfavorable reserve development of $16 in 2007 primarily included a $49 release of general
liability loss and loss adjustment expense reserves for accident years 2003 to 2006 and an $18
release of commercial auto liability reserves for accident years 2003 and 2004, partially offset by
a $40 strengthening of workers’ compensation reserves for accident years 1973 & prior and a $14
strengthening of general liability reserves for accident years more than 20 years old.



Operating expenses decreased by $15

The $16 decrease in the amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs was largely due to the
decrease in earned premium, partially offset by the amortization of higher underwriting costs.
Insurance operating costs and expenses included policyholder dividends of $21 in 2008 and $14 in
2007 which increased primarily due to a $6 increase in the estimated amount of dividends payable to
certain workers’ compensation policyholders due to underwriting profits. Apart from policyholder
dividends, insurance operating costs and expenses decreased by $6 as the effect of lower
compensation-related costs was partially offset by higher IT costs and an estimated $3 of TWIA
assessments in 2008. The expense ratio increased by 0.5 points, to 29.0, due to the amortization
of higher underwriting costs, the TWIA assessments in 2008 and the effect of lower earned premiums,
partially offset by the effect of lower compensation-related costs.

Year ended December 31, 2007 compared to the year ended December 31, 2006

Before catastrophes, the current accident year loss and loss adjustment expense ratio increased by
1.9 points, to 64.5, primarily due to a higher loss and loss adjustment expense ratio for workers’
compensation, general liability and commercial auto claims driven, in part, by earned pricing
decreases. For commercial auto, loss costs increased for both liability and property damage
claims.

Current accident year catastrophes decreased by $21

Current accident year catastrophe losses decreased by $21, from $36, or 1.5 points, in 2006 to $15,
or 0.6 points, in 2007. Compared to 2007, there were more severe catastrophes in 2006, including
tornadoes and hail storms in the Midwest and windstorms in Texas and on the East coast. The
largest catastrophe losses in 2007 were from spring windstorms in the Southeast and wildfires in
California.

Change to favorable prior accident year development by $29

Prior accident year reserve development changed from net unfavorable prior accident year reserve
development of $13, or 0.5 points, in 2006 to net favorable prior accident year reserve development
of $16, or 0.7 points, in 2007. Net favorable reserve development of $16 in 2007 included a $49
release of general liability loss and loss adjustment expense reserves for accident years 2003 to
2006 and an $18 release of commercial auto liability reserves for accident years 2003 and 2004,
partially offset by a $40 strengthening of workers’ compensation reserves for accident years 1973 &
prior and a $14 strengthening of general liability reserves for accident years more than 20 years
old.



Net unfavorable reserve development of $13 in 2006 consisted primarily of a $20 increase in general
liability loss and loss adjustment expense reserves related to accident years 1998 to 2005 and a
$10 increase in marine loss reserves, partially offset by a $25 reduction in allocated loss
adjustment expense reserves for workers’ compensation business related to accident years 2003 to
2005.

Operating expenses increased by $20

The 1.8 point increase in the expense ratio and the 0.4 point increase in the policyholder dividend
ratio was primarily due to an increase in insurance operating costs and expenses and the decrease
in earned premiums. Insurance operating costs and expenses increased by $35, partially due to the
effect of a $12 reduction of estimated Citizens’ assessments related to the 2005 Florida hurricanes
recorded in 2006. Also contributing to the increase in insurance operating costs and expenses was
an increase in IT costs, an increase in non-deferrable salaries and benefits, and an $8 increase in
policyholder dividends. The increase in policyholder dividends was largely due to an $8 increase
in the estimated amount of dividends payable to certain workers’ compensation policyholders due to
underwriting profits.

Amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs decreased by $15, due largely to the decrease in
earned premium and corresponding decrease in acquisition costs.

The difference between written premiums and earned premiums is attributable to the change in

Earned Premiums

Year ended December 31, 2008 compared to the year ended December 31, 2007

Earned premiums for the Specialty Commercial segment decreased by $64, or 4%, primarily due to a
decrease in property earned premiums and, to a lesser extent, casualty earned premiums.

•

Property earned premiums decreased by $46, or 35%, primarily due to the Company’s decision
to stop writing specialty property business with large, national accounts and the effect of
increased competition for core excess and surplus lines business. As a result of increased
competition and capacity for core excess and surplus lines business, the Company has
experienced a decrease in earned pricing, lower new business growth and lower premium renewal
retention since the third quarter of 2007, particularly for catastrophe-exposed business.

•

Casualty earned premiums decreased by $17, or 3%, primarily because of lower earned premium
from captive programs and a decline in new business premium on loss-sensitive business written
with larger accounts over the last nine months of 2007 and first three months of 2008.

•

Professional liability, fidelity and surety earned premium was flat. Earned premium for
professional liability was relatively flat as the effect of earned pricing decreases in 2008
and the effect of a decline in new business written premium over the last nine months of 2007
and the first six months of 2008 were largely offset by the effect of a decrease in the
portion of risks ceded to outside reinsurers. Earned premium for fidelity and surety business
was also relatively flat as a modest decrease in commercial surety was largely offset by a
modest increase in contract surety.

•

Within the “Other” category, earned premium remained relatively flat from 2007 to 2008.
The “Other” category of earned premiums includes premiums assumed under inter-segment
arrangements.

Year ended December 31, 2007 compared to the year ended December 31, 2006

Earned premiums for the Specialty Commercial segment decreased by $47, or 3%, for the year ended
December 31, 2007, primarily due to a decrease in casualty, property and other earned premiums,
partially offset by an increase in professional liability, fidelity and surety earned premiums.

•

Property earned premiums decreased by $11, or 8%, primarily due to lower premium renewal
retention and the effect of an arrangement with Berkshire Hathaway to share premiums written
under subscription policies. Under the arrangement with Berkshire Hathaway that commenced in
the second quarter of 2007, a share of excess and surplus lines business that was previously
written entirely by the Company is now being written in conjunction with Berkshire Hathaway
under subscription policies, whereby both companies share, or participate, in the business
written. The arrangement with Berkshire Hathaway enables the Company to offer its insureds
larger policy limits and thereby enhance its competitive position in the marketplace. The
decrease in earned premium was partially offset by the effect of earned pricing increases, new
business growth, lower reinsurance costs and a decrease in reinstatement premium payable to
reinsurers. Renewal retention has decreased in 2007, primarily due to increased competition
on national account business as well as in the standard excess and surplus lines market.
After experiencing significant rate increases throughout 2006 and smaller rate increases for
the first six months of 2007, written pricing decreased in the last six months of the year.
While new business decreased in the fourth quarter of 2007, new business increased for the
full year, largely
because the Company had significantly curtailed new business in 2006 in order to reduce
catastrophe loss exposures in certain geographic areas.



•

Casualty earned premiums decreased by $36, or 6%, for the year ended December 31, 2007,
primarily because of a decline in new business written premium and lower premium renewal
retention on business written through industry trade groups. Also contributing to the
decrease in earned premiums was an increase in the estimated return premium due to insureds
under retrospectively-rated policies.

•

Professional liability, fidelity and surety earned premium grew $35, or 5%, for the year
ended December 31, 2007 due to an increase in earned premiums in professional liability and
surety business. The increase in earned premium from professional liability business was
primarily due to a decrease in the portion of risks ceded to outside reinsurers and an
increase in the mix of lower limit middle market professional liability premium, partially
offset by the effect of earned pricing decreases and a decrease in new business written
premium. A lower frequency of class action cases in the past couple of years has put downward
pressure on rates during 2006 and 2007. The increase in earned premium from surety business
was primarily due to an increase in public construction spending and construction costs,
resulting in more bonded work programs for current clients and larger bond limits.

•

Within the “other” category, earned premium decreased by $35, or 29%. The “Other” category
of earned premiums includes premiums assumed under inter-segment arrangements. Beginning in
the third quarter of 2006, the Company reduced the premiums assumed by Specialty Commercial
under inter-segment arrangements covering certain liability claims.

Earned premium decreased by $64

Earned premiums for the Specialty Commercial segment decreased by $64, or 4%, primarily due to a
decrease in property and, to a lesser extent, casualty earned premiums. Refer to the earned
premium section above for further discussion.

Losses and loss adjustment expenses decreased by $147

Current accident year losses and loss adjustment expenses before catastrophes decreased by
$20

Specialty Commercial current accident year losses and loss adjustment expenses before catastrophes
decreased by $20 in 2008, to $941, due to a decrease in earned premium, partially offset by an
increase in the loss and loss adjustment expense ratio before catastrophes and prior accident year
development. The loss and loss adjustment expense ratio before catastrophes and prior accident
year development increased by 1.5 points, to 68.1, primarily due to a higher loss and loss
adjustment expense ratio for directors and officers insurance in professional liability, driven by
earned pricing decreases, and a lower mix of property business which has a lower loss and loss
adjustment ratio than other businesses within Specialty Commercial.

Current accident year catastrophes increased by $38

Current accident year catastrophe losses increased $38, or 2.8 points, primarily due to losses from
hurricane Ike.

Change to net favorable prior accident year reserve development by $165

Prior accident year reserve development changed from net unfavorable prior accident year reserve
development of $84, or 5.8 points, in 2007 to net favorable prior accident year reserve development
of $81, or 5.8 points, in 2008. Net favorable prior accident year reserve development of $81 in
2008 primarily included a $75 release of reserves for directors’ and officers insurance and errors
and omissions insurance claims related to accident years 2003 to 2006.

Prior accident year reserve development in 2007 consisted primarily of a $47 strengthening of
workers’ compensation loss and loss adjustment expense reserves for accident years 1987 to 2001, a
$34 strengthening of general liability reserves, primarily related to accident years 1987 to 1997,
and a $25 strengthening of general liability reserves for accident years more than 20 years old.
Partially offsetting the unfavorable reserve development in 2007 was a $22 release of reserves for
surety business for accident years 2003 to 2006.

Operating expenses decreased by $6

Amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs decreased by $10 due to the decrease in earned
premium, partially offset by the effect of an increase in net acquisition costs related to writing
a greater mix of higher net commission small commercial and private directors’ and officers’
insurance. Insurance operating costs and expenses increased by $4, primarily due to an increase in
IT costs. The expense ratio increased by 0.9 points, to 28.3, primarily due to the increase in
insurance operating costs and expenses, the increase in net acquisition costs for directors’ and
officers’ insurance and the effect of the decrease in earned premium.



Year ended December 31, 2007 compared to the year ended December 31, 2006

Losses and loss adjustment expenses decreased by $16

Current accident year loss and loss adjustment expenses before catastrophes decreased by
$64

Specialty Commercial current accident year loss and loss adjustment expenses before catastrophes
decreased by $64 in 2007 to $961, due to a decrease in earned premium and a 1.8 point decrease in
the loss and loss adjustment expense ratio before catastrophes and prior accident year development,
to 66.6. The decrease in the loss and loss adjustment expense ratio before catastrophes and prior
accident year development was driven by a lower loss and loss adjustment ratio on directors and
officers insurance in professional liability and a decrease in non-catastrophe property loss costs
on property business, partially offset by a higher loss and loss adjustment expense ratio on
casualty business.

Increase in net unfavorable prior accident year development by $48

Net unfavorable prior accident year reserve development increased from $36, or 2.5 points, in 2006
to $84, or 5.8 points, in 2007. Net unfavorable prior accident year reserve development of $84 in
2007 consisted primarily of a $47 strengthening of workers’ compensation loss and loss adjustment
expense reserves for accident years 1987 to 2001, a $34 strengthening of general liability
reserves, primarily related to accident years 1987 to 1997, and a $25 strengthening of general
liability reserves for accident years more than 20 years old. Partially offsetting the unfavorable
reserve development in 2007 was a $22 release of reserves for surety business for accident years
2003 to 2006.

Net unfavorable prior accident year reserve development of $36 in 2006 included a $35 strengthening
of reserves for construction defects claims on casualty business for accident years 1997 and prior
and a $20 strengthening of allocated loss adjustment expense reserves on workers’ compensation
policies for claim payments expected to emerge after 20 years of development, partially offset by a
$35 reduction in catastrophe reserves related to the 2005 hurricanes.

Operating expenses increased by $33

Insurance operating costs and expenses increased by $16, primarily due to a $16 increase in
policyholder dividends. The $16 increase in policyholder dividends was largely due to a $10
reduction in estimated policyholder dividends recorded in 2006 and a $7 increase in estimated
policyholder dividends recorded in 2007. The $7 increase in dividends in 2007 was primarily driven
by an increase in the estimated amount of dividends payable to certain workers’ compensation
policyholders due to underwriting profits. Amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs
increased by $17, due largely to an increase in amortization for professional liability, fidelity
and surety business driven largely by the increase in earned premiums for that business and a
reduction in ceding commissions. The expense ratio increased by 1.8 points, to 27.4, due largely
to the reduction in ceding commission on professional liability business and the decrease in earned
premiums.

The Other Operations segment includes operations that are under a single management structure,
Heritage Holdings, which is responsible for two related activities. The first activity is the
management of certain subsidiaries and operations of the Company that have discontinued writing new
business. The second is the management of claims (and the associated reserves) related to
asbestos, environmental and other exposures. The Other Operations book of business contains
policies written from approximately the 1940s to 2003. The Company’s experience has been that this
book of run-off business has, over time, produced significantly higher claims and losses than were
contemplated at inception.

Year ended December 31, 2008 compared to the year ended December 31, 2007

Other Operations reported a net loss of $97 in 2008 compared to net income of $30 in 2007, driven
by the following:

•

A $65 increase in underwriting results, primarily due to a $64 decrease in unfavorable
prior year loss development. Reserve development in 2008 included $50 of asbestos reserve
strengthening and $53 of environmental reserve strengthening. In 2007, reserve development
included $99 principally as a result of an adverse arbitration decision and $25 of
environmental reserve strengthening.

•

A $51 decrease in net investment income, primarily as a result of net losses on limited
partnerships and other alternative investments in 2008 and decreased fixed maturity income.

•

A $196 increase in net realized capital losses, primarily due to realized losses in 2008
from impairments of subordinated fixed maturities and preferred equity securities in the
financial services sector as well as of securitized assets.

•

A $57 increase in income tax benefit, primarily as a result of a change from pre-tax income
in 2007 to a pre-tax loss in 2008.

Year ended December 31, 2007 compared to the year ended December 31, 2006

Other Operations reported net income of $30 in 2007 compared to a net loss of $35 in 2006, driven
by the following:

•

A $156 increase in underwriting results, primarily due to a $167 decrease in unfavorable
prior year loss development. Reserve development in 2007 included $99 principally as a result
of an adverse arbitration decision and $25 of environmental reserve strengthening. In 2006,
reserve development included a $243 reduction in net reinsurance recoverables, $43 of
environmental reserve strengthening and $12 of reserve strengthening for assumed reinsurance.

•

A $13 decrease in net investment income, primarily as a result of a decrease in invested
assets resulting from net losses and loss adjustment expenses paid.

•

A change from $26 of net realized capital gains in 2006 to $12 of net realized capital
losses in 2007, primarily due to an increase in impairments and decreases in
the fair value of non-qualifying derivatives attributable to changes in value associated with
credit derivatives due to credit spreads widening.

•

A $40 decrease in income tax benefit, primarily as a result of a change from a pre-tax loss
in 2006 to pre-tax income in 2007.



Asbestos and Environmental Claims

The Company continues to receive asbestos and environmental claims. Asbestos claims relate
primarily to bodily injuries asserted by people who came in contact with asbestos or products
containing asbestos. Environmental claims relate primarily to pollution and related clean-up costs.

The Company wrote several different categories of insurance contracts that may cover asbestos and
environmental claims. First, the Company wrote primary policies providing the first layer of
coverage in an insured’s liability program. Second, the Company wrote excess policies providing
higher layers of coverage for losses that exhaust the limits of underlying coverage. Third, the
Company acted as a reinsurer assuming a portion of those risks assumed by other insurers writing
primary, excess and reinsurance coverages. Fourth, subsidiaries of the Company participated in the
London Market, writing both direct insurance and assumed reinsurance business.

With regard to both environmental and particularly asbestos claims, significant uncertainty limits
the ability of insurers and reinsurers to estimate the ultimate reserves necessary for unpaid
losses and related expenses. Traditional actuarial reserving techniques cannot reasonably estimate
the ultimate cost of these claims, particularly during periods where theories of law are in flux.
The degree of variability of reserve estimates for these exposures is significantly greater than
for other more traditional exposures. In particular, the Company believes there is a high degree of
uncertainty inherent in the estimation of asbestos loss reserves.

In the case of the reserves for asbestos exposures, factors contributing to the high degree of
uncertainty include inadequate loss development patterns, plaintiffs’ expanding theories of
liability, the risks inherent in major litigation, and inconsistent emerging legal doctrines.
Furthermore, over time, insurers, including the Company, have experienced significant changes in
the rate at which asbestos claims are brought, the claims experience of particular insureds, and
the value of claims, making predictions of future exposure from past experience uncertain.
Plaintiffs and insureds also have sought to use bankruptcy proceedings, including “pre-packaged”
bankruptcies, to accelerate and increase loss payments by insurers. In addition, some policyholders
have asserted new classes of claims for coverages to which an aggregate limit of liability may not
apply. Further uncertainties include insolvencies of other carriers and unanticipated developments
pertaining to the Company’s ability to recover reinsurance for asbestos and environmental claims.
Management believes these issues are not likely to be resolved in the near future.

In the case of the reserves for environmental exposures, factors contributing to the high degree of
uncertainty include expanding theories of liability and damages, the risks inherent in major
litigation, inconsistent decisions concerning the existence and scope of coverage for environmental
claims, and uncertainty as to the monetary amount being sought by the claimant from the insured.

It is also not possible to predict changes in the legal and legislative environment and their
effect on the future development of asbestos and environmental claims. Although potential Federal
asbestos-related legislation was considered by the Senate in 2006, it is uncertain whether such
legislation will be reconsidered or enacted in the future and, if enacted, what its effect would be
on the Company’s aggregate asbestos liabilities.

The reporting pattern for assumed reinsurance claims, including those related to asbestos and
environmental claims, is much longer than for direct claims. In many instances, it takes months or
years to determine that the policyholder’s own obligations have been met and how the reinsurance in
question may apply to such claims. The delay in reporting reinsurance claims and exposures adds to
the uncertainty of estimating the related reserves.

Given the factors described above, the Company believes the actuarial tools and other techniques it
employs to estimate the ultimate cost of claims for more traditional kinds of insurance exposure
are less precise in estimating reserves for its asbestos and environmental exposures. For this
reason, the Company relies on exposure-based analysis to estimate the ultimate costs of these
claims and regularly evaluates new information in assessing its potential asbestos and
environmental exposures.



Reserve Activity

Reserves and reserve activity in the Other Operations segment are categorized and reported as
asbestos, environmental, or “all other”. The “all other” category of reserves covers a wide range
of insurance and assumed reinsurance coverages, including, but not limited to, potential liability
for construction defects, lead paint, silica, pharmaceutical products, molestation and other
long-tail liabilities. In addition, within the “all other” category of reserves, Other Operations
records its allowance for future reinsurer insolvencies and disputes that might affect reinsurance
collectability associated with asbestos, environmental, and other claims recoverable from
reinsurers.

The following table presents reserve activity, inclusive of estimates for both reported and
incurred but not reported claims, net of reinsurance, for Other Operations, categorized by
asbestos, environmental and all other claims, for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006.

Excludes asbestos and environmental net liabilities reported in Ongoing Operations of $12 and $6, respectively, as of
December 31, 2008, $9 and $6, respectively, as of December 31, 2007, and $9 and $6, respectively, as of December 31, 2006.
Total net losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred in Ongoing Operations for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007
and 2006 includes $16, $10 and $11, respectively, related to asbestos and environmental claims. Total net losses and loss
adjustment expenses paid in Ongoing Operations for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 includes $13, $10 and
$12, respectively, related to asbestos and environmental claims.

[3]

Gross of reinsurance, asbestos and environmental reserves, including liabilities in Ongoing Operations, were $2,498 and
$309, respectively, as of December 31, 2008, $2,707 and $290, respectively, as of December 31, 2007, and $3,242 and $362,
respectively, as of December 31, 2006.

[4]

Prior to the second quarter of 2007, the Company evaluated the adequacy of the reserves for unallocated loss adjustment
expenses on a company-wide basis. During the second quarter of 2007, the Company refined its analysis of the reserves at
the segment level, resulting in the reallocation of reserves among segments, including a reallocation of reserves from
Ongoing Operations to Other Operations.

[5]

The one year and average three year net paid amounts for asbestos claims, including Ongoing Operations, were $189 and $283,
respectively, resulting in a one year net survival ratio of 10.0 and a three year net survival ratio of 6.7. Net survival
ratio is the quotient of the net carried reserves divided by the average annual payment amount and is an indication of the
number of years that the net carried reserve would last (i.e. survive) if the future annual claim payments were consistent
with the calculated historical average.

[6]

The Company includes its allowance for uncollectible reinsurance in the “All Other” category of reserves. When the Company
commutes a ceded reinsurance contract or settles a ceded reinsurance dispute, the portion of the allowance for
uncollectible reinsurance attributable to that commutation or settlement, if any, is reclassified to the appropriate cause
of loss.

In the fourth quarters of 2008, 2007 and 2006, the Company completed evaluations of certain of its
non-asbestos and environmental reserves, including its assumed reinsurance liabilities. Based on
these evaluations, the Company recognized favorable prior year development of $30 and $18 in 2008
and 2007, respectively, and unfavorable prior year development of $12 in 2006 for its HartRe
assumed reinsurance liabilities. The improvement in 2008 and 2007 was the result of lower than
expected reported losses. In 2008 and 2007, the favorable HartRe assumed reinsurance development
was offset by unfavorable other non-asbestos and environmental prior year development of $30 and
$17 in 2008 and 2007, respectively, including $25 of adverse development in 2008 for assumed
reinsurance obligations of the Company’s Bermuda operations.

During the third quarters of 2008, 2007 and 2006, the Company completed its annual ground up
environmental reserve evaluations. In each of these evaluations, the Company reviewed all of its
open direct domestic insurance accounts exposed to environmental liability as well as assumed
reinsurance accounts and its London Market exposures for both direct insurance and assumed
reinsurance. In all three years, the Company found estimates for individual cases changed based
upon the particular circumstances of each account. These changes were case specific and not as a
result of any underlying change in the current environment. The Company also found that, during
2008, the decline in the reporting of new accounts and sites has been slower than anticipated in
the previous review. The net
effect of these changes resulted in $53, $25 and $43 increases in net environmental liabilities in
2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The Company currently expects to continue to perform an
evaluation of its environmental liabilities annually.



In reporting environmental results, the Company divides its gross exposure into Direct, which is
subdivided further as: Accounts with future exposure greater than $2.5, Accounts with future
exposure less than $2.5, and Other direct; Assumed Reinsurance; and London Market. The unallocated
amounts in the Other direct category include an estimate of the necessary reserves for
environmental claims related to direct insureds who have not previously tendered environmental
claims to the Company.

An account may move between categories from one evaluation to the next. For example, an account
with future expected exposure of greater than $2.5 in one evaluation may be reevaluated due to
changing conditions and re-categorized as less than $2.5 in a subsequent evaluation or vice versa.

The following table displays gross environmental reserves and other statistics by category as of
December 31, 2008.

During the second quarters of 2008, 2007 and 2006, the Company completed its annual ground up
asbestos reserve evaluations. As part of these evaluations, the Company reviewed all of its open
direct domestic insurance accounts exposed to asbestos liability as well as assumed reinsurance
accounts and its London Market exposures for both direct insurance and assumed reinsurance. In the
second quarter of 2008, the Company found estimates for individual cases changed based upon the
particular circumstances of each account. These changes were case specific and not as a result of
any underlying change in the current environment. The net effect of these changes resulted in a
$50 increase in net asbestos reserves. In 2007 and 2006, these evaluations resulted in no addition
to the Company’s net asbestos reserves. The Company currently expects to continue to perform an
evaluation of its asbestos liabilities annually.

The Company divides its gross asbestos exposures into Direct, Assumed Reinsurance and London
Market. The Company further divides its direct asbestos exposures into the following categories:
Major Asbestos Defendants (the “Top 70” accounts in Tillinghast’s published Tiers 1 and 2 and
Wellington accounts), which are subdivided further as: Structured Settlements, Wellington, Other
Major Asbestos Defendants; Accounts with Future Expected Exposures greater than $2.5, Accounts with
Future Expected Exposures less than $2.5 and Unallocated.

•

Structured Settlements are those accounts where the Company has reached an agreement with
the insured as to the amount and timing of the claim payments to be made to the insured.

•

The Wellington subcategory includes insureds that entered into the “Wellington Agreement”
dated June 19, 1985. The Wellington Agreement provided terms and conditions for how the
signatory asbestos producers would access their coverage from the signatory insurers.

•

The Other Major Asbestos Defendants subcategory represents insureds included in Tiers 1 and
2, as defined by Tillinghast that are not Wellington signatories and have not entered into
structured settlements with The Hartford. The Tier 1 and 2 classifications are meant to
capture the insureds for which there is expected to be significant exposure to asbestos
claims.

•

The Unallocated category includes an estimate of the reserves necessary for asbestos claims
related to direct insureds that have not previously tendered asbestos claims to the Company
and exposures related to liability claims that may not be subject to an aggregate limit under
the applicable policies.

An account may move between categories from one evaluation to the next. For example, an account
with future expected exposure of greater than $2.5 in one evaluation may be reevaluated due to
changing conditions and recategorized as less than $2.5 in a subsequent evaluation or vice versa.

“All Time Paid” represents the total payments with respect to the indicated claim type that have already been made by the
Company as of the indicated balance sheet date. “All Time Ultimate” represents the Company’s estimate, as of the indicated
balance sheet date, of the total payments that are ultimately expected to be made to fully settle the indicated payment
type. The amount is the sum of the amounts already paid (e.g. “All Time Paid”) and the estimated future payments (e.g. the
amount shown in the column labeled “Total Reserves”).

[4]

Survival ratio is a commonly used industry ratio for comparing reserve levels between companies. While the method is
commonly used, it is not a predictive technique. Survival ratios may vary over time for numerous reasons such as large
payments due to the final resolution of certain asbestos liabilities, or reserve re-estimates. The survival ratio is
computed by dividing the recorded reserves by the average of the past three years of payments. The ratio is the calculated
number of years the recorded reserves would survive if future annual payments were equal to the average annual payments for
the past three years. The 3-year gross survival ratio of 5.7 as of December 31, 2008 is computed based on total paid
losses of $1.307 billion for the period from January 1, 2006 to December 31, 2008. As of December 31, 2008, the one year
gross paid amount for total asbestos claims is $294 resulting in a one year gross survival ratio of 8.5.

For paid and incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses reporting, the Company classifies its
asbestos and environmental reserves into three categories: Direct, Assumed — Domestic and London
Market. Direct insurance includes primary and excess coverage. Assumed reinsurance includes both
“treaty” reinsurance (covering broad categories of claims or blocks of business) and “facultative”
reinsurance (covering specific risks or individual policies of primary or excess insurance
companies). London Market business includes the business written by one or more of the Company’s
subsidiaries in the United Kingdom, which are no longer active in the insurance or reinsurance
business. Such business includes both direct insurance and assumed reinsurance.

Of the three categories of claims (Direct, Assumed — Domestic and London Market), direct policies
tend to have the greatest factual development from which to estimate the Company’s exposures.

Assumed reinsurance exposures are inherently less predictable than direct insurance exposures
because the Company may not receive notice of a reinsurance claim until the underlying direct
insurance claim is mature. This causes a delay in the receipt of information at the reinsurer
level and adds to the uncertainty of estimating related reserves.

London Market exposures are the most uncertain of the three categories of claims. As a participant
in the London Market (comprised of both Lloyd’s of London and London Market companies), certain
subsidiaries of the Company wrote business on a subscription basis, with those subsidiaries’
involvement being limited to a relatively small percentage of a total contract placement. Claims
are reported, via a broker, to the “lead” underwriter and, once agreed to, are presented to the
following markets for concurrence. This reporting and claim agreement process makes estimating
liabilities for this business the most uncertain of the three categories of claims.



The following table sets forth, for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, paid and
incurred loss activity by the three categories of claims for asbestos and environmental.

Excludes asbestos and environmental paid and incurred loss and LAE reported in Ongoing
Operations. Total gross loss and LAE incurred in Ongoing Operations for the twelve months
ended December 31, 2008, 2007, and 2006 includes $15, $9 and $10, respectively, related to
asbestos and environmental claims. Total gross loss and LAE paid in Ongoing Operations for
the twelve months ended December 31, 2008, 2007, and 2006 includes $12, $10 and $12,
respectively, related to asbestos and environmental claims.

A number of factors affect the variability of estimates for asbestos and environmental reserves
including assumptions with respect to the frequency of claims, the average severity of those claims
settled with payment, the dismissal rate of claims with no payment and the expense to indemnity
ratio. The uncertainty with respect to the underlying reserve assumptions for asbestos and
environmental adds a greater degree of variability to these reserve estimates than reserve
estimates for more traditional exposures. While this variability is reflected in part in the size
of the range of reserves developed by the Company, that range may still not be indicative of the
potential variance between the ultimate outcome and the recorded reserves. The recorded net
reserves as of December 31, 2008 of $2.18 billion ($1.90 billion and $275 for asbestos and
environmental, respectively) is within an estimated range, unadjusted for covariance, of $1.80
billion to $2.42 billion. The process of estimating asbestos and environmental reserves remains
subject to a wide variety of uncertainties, which are detailed in the “Critical Accounting
Estimates—Property & Casualty Reserves, Net of Reinsurance” section of Management’s Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. The Company believes that its current
asbestos and environmental reserves are reasonable and appropriate. However, analyses of further
developments could cause the Company to change its estimates and ranges of its asbestos and
environmental reserves, and the effect of these changes could be material to the Company’s
consolidated operating results, financial condition and liquidity. If there are significant
developments that affect particular exposures, reinsurance arrangements or the financial condition
of particular reinsurers, the Company will make adjustments to its reserves or to the amounts
recoverable from its reinsurers.

During the second quarter of 2007, an arbitration panel found that a Hartford subsidiary,
established as a captive reinsurance company in the 1970s by The Hartford’s former parent, ITT, had
additional obligations to ITT’s primary insurance carrier under ITT’s captive insurance program,
which ended in 1993. When ITT spun off The Hartford in 1995, the former captive became a Hartford
subsidiary. The arbitration concerned whether certain claims could be presented to the former
captive in a different manner than ITT’s primary insurance carrier historically had presented them.
Principally as a result of this adverse arbitration decision, the Company recorded a charge of
$99.



During the second quarters of 2008, 2007 and 2006, the Company completed its annual evaluations of
the collectability of the reinsurance recoverables and the adequacy of the allowance for
uncollectible reinsurance associated with older, long-term casualty liabilities reported in the
Other Operations segment. The evaluations in the second quarters of 2008 and 2007 resulted in no
addition to the allowance for uncollectible reinsurance. In the second quarter of 2006, the
Company entered into an agreement with Equitas and all Lloyd’s syndicates reinsured by Equitas
(collectively, “Equitas”) that resolved, with minor exception, all of the Company’s ceded and
assumed domestic reinsurance exposures with Equitas, including all of the Company’s reinsurance
recoveries from Equitas under the Blanket Casualty Treaty (BCT). As a result of the settlement
with Equitas and the 2006 reinsurance recoverable evaluation, the Company reduced its net
reinsurance recoverable by $243.

In conducting these evaluations of reinsurance recoverables, the Company used its most recent
detailed evaluations of ceded liabilities reported in the segment. The Company analyzed the
overall credit quality of the Company’s reinsurers, recent trends in arbitration and litigation
outcomes in disputes between cedants and reinsurers, and recent developments in commutation
activity between reinsurers and cedants. The Company also considered the effect of the Equitas
settlement on the collectability of amounts due from other upper-layer reinsurers under the BCT.
The allowance for uncollectible reinsurance reflects management’s current estimate of reinsurance
cessions that may be uncollectible in the future due to reinsurers’ unwillingness or inability to
pay. As of December 31, 2008, the allowance for uncollectible reinsurance for Other Operations
totals $254. The Company currently expects to perform its regular comprehensive review of Other
Operations reinsurance recoverables annually. Uncertainties regarding the factors that affect the
allowance for uncollectible reinsurance could cause the Company to change its estimates, and the
effect of these changes could be material to the Company’s consolidated results of operations or
cash flows.

Consistent with the Company’s long-standing reserving practices, the Company will continue to
review and monitor its reserves in the Other Operations segment regularly and, where future
developments indicate, make appropriate adjustments to the reserves. For a discussion of the
Company’s reserving practices, please see the “Critical Accounting Estimates—Property & Casualty
Reserves, Net of Reinsurance” section of Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations.



INVESTMENTS

General

The Hartford’s investment portfolios are primarily divided between Life and Property & Casualty.
The investment portfolios of Life and Property & Casualty are managed by Hartford Investment
Management Company (“HIMCO”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of The Hartford. HIMCO manages the
portfolios to maximize economic value, while attempting to generate the income necessary to support
the Company’s various product obligations, within internally established objectives, guidelines and
risk tolerances. The portfolio objectives and guidelines are developed based upon the
asset/liability profile, including duration, convexity and other characteristics within specified
risk tolerances. The risk tolerances considered include, for example, asset and credit issuer
allocation limits, maximum portfolio below investment grade (“BIG”) holdings and foreign currency
exposure. The Company attempts to minimize adverse impacts to the portfolio and the Company’s
results of operations due to changes in economic conditions through asset allocation limits,
asset/liability duration matching and through the use of derivatives. For a further discussion of
how the investment portfolio’s credit and market risks are assessed and managed, see the Investment
Credit Risk and Capital Markets Risk Management sections of the MD&A.

HIMCO portfolio managers may sell securities (except those securities in an unrealized loss
position for which the Company has indicated its intent and ability to hold until the price
recovers) due to portfolio guidelines or market technicals or trends. For example, the Company may
sell securities to manage risk, capture market valuation inefficiencies or relative value
opportunities, to remain compliant with internal asset/liability duration matching guidelines, or
to modify a portfolio’s duration to capitalize on interest rate levels or the yield curve slope.

HIMCO believes that advantageously buying and selling securities within a disciplined framework,
provides the greatest economic value for the Company over the long-term.

Return on general account invested assets is an important element of The Hartford’s financial
results. Significant fluctuations in the fixed income or equity markets could weaken the Company’s
financial condition or its results of operations. Additionally, changes in market interest rates
may impact the period of time over which certain investments, such as MBS, are repaid and whether
certain investments are called by the issuers. Such changes may, in turn, impact the yield on
these investments and also may result in re-investment of funds received from calls and prepayments
at rates below the average portfolio yield. Net investment income and net realized capital gains
and losses reduced the Company’s consolidated revenues by $11.9 billion for the year ended December
31, 2008, and contributed to the Company’s consolidated revenues by $4.4 billion and $6.3 billion
for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Net investment income and net
realized capital gains and losses, excluding net investment income from trading securities, reduced
the Company’s consolidated revenues by $1.6 billion for the year ended December 31, 2008, and
contributed to the Company’s consolidated revenues by $4.2 billion and $4.4 billion for the years
ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The reduction to consolidated revenues for 2008,
as compared to prior year periods, is primarily due to a net loss in the value of equity
securities, held for trading, and realized capital losses.

Fluctuations in interest rates affect the Company’s return on, and the fair value of, fixed
maturity investments, which comprised approximately 54% and 61% of the fair value of its invested
assets as of December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Other events beyond the Company’s control,
including changes in credit spreads, a downgrade of an issuer’s credit rating or default of payment
by an issuer, could also adversely impact the fair value of these investments.

The Company invests in private placement securities, mortgage loans and limited partnerships and
other alternative investments in order to further diversify its investment portfolio. These
investment types comprised approximately 20% and 23% of the fair value of its invested assets as of
December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. These security types are typically less liquid than
direct investments in publicly traded fixed income or equity investments. However, generally these
securities have higher yields over the life of the investment to compensate for the liquidity risk.

A decrease in the fair value of any investment that is deemed other-than-temporary would result in
the Company’s recognition of a net realized capital loss in its financial results prior to the
actual sale of the investment. Following the recognition of an other-than-temporary impairment for
fixed maturities, the Company accretes the new cost basis to par or to estimated future value over
the remaining life of the security based on future estimated cash flows by adjusting the security’s
yields. For a further discussion of the evaluation of other-than-temporary impairments, see the
Critical Accounting Estimates section of the MD&A under “Evaluation of Other-Than-Temporary
Impairments on Available-for-Sale Securities”.



Life

The primary investment objective of Life’s general account is to maximize economic value within
acceptable risk parameters, including the management of the interest rate sensitivity of invested
assets, while generating sufficient after-tax income to support policyholder and corporate
obligations, as discussed in the Capital Markets Risk Management section of the MD&A under “Market
Risk — Life”.

These assets primarily support the International variable annuity business. Changes in these balances are also reflected in the respective liabilities.

Total investments decreased $5.7 billion since December 31, 2007 primarily as a result of a decline
in value of equity securities, held for trading, and increased unrealized losses on
available-for-sale securities due to credit spread widening, offset by positive operating cash
flows. The decline in value in equity securities, held for trading, was due to negative market
performance of the underlying investment funds supporting the Japanese variable annuity product and
policyholder transfers from the accumulation to the annuitization phase of the contract. These
losses were partially offset by gains resulting from translation as the Yen strengthened compared
to the U.S. dollar. In addition, Life increased its investment in short-term securities in
preparation for funding liability outflows and to maintain higher than average liquidity while
waiting for market and asset valuations to stabilize. Mortgage loans increased due to
diversification opportunities.

Limited partnerships and other alternative investments decreased by $177 during 2008. Life
continuously evaluates its allocation to limited partnerships and other alternative investments and
has taken steps to reduce its exposure to hedge funds, most of which will occur in 2009. In
addition, HIMCO does not expect significant additions to limited partnerships and other alternative
investments in 2009 except for unfunded commitments. HIMCO closely monitors the impact of these
investments in relationship to the overall investment portfolio and the consolidated balance
sheets.

are derivatives that qualify for hedge accounting under SFAS 133. These derivatives hedge fixed maturities.

[4]

Includes investment income and mark-to-market effects of equity securities, held for trading.

Year ended December 31, 2008 compared to the year ended December 31, 2007

Net investment income, excluding equity securities, held for trading, decreased $452, or 13%, for
the year ended December 31, 2008, compared to the prior year period. The decrease in net
investment income was primarily due to lower yield on variable rate securities due to declines in
short term interest rates, increased allocation to lower yielding U.S. Treasuries and short-term
investments, and a decrease in investment yield for limited partnership and other alternative
investments. The decrease in limited partnerships and other alternative investments yield was
largely due to negative returns on hedge funds and real estate partnerships as a result of the lack
of liquidity in the financial markets and a wider credit spread environment. Based upon the
current interest rate and credit environment, Life expects a slightly higher average portfolio
yield for 2009 as compared to 2008.

The decrease in net investment income on equity securities, held for trading, for the year ended
December 31, 2008 compared to the prior year period was primarily attributed to a decline in the
value of the underlying investment funds supporting the Japanese variable annuity product due to
negative market performance year over year.

Year ended December 31, 2007 compared to the year ended December 31, 2006

Net investment income, excluding securities held for trading, increased $313, or 10%, for the year
ended December 31, 2007, compared to the prior year period. The increase in net investment income
was primarily due to a higher average invested asset base and a higher total portfolio yield. The
increase in the average invested assets base as compared to the prior year period was primarily due
to positive operating cash flows, investment contract sales such as retail and institutional notes,
and universal life-type product sales. Limited partnerships and other alternative investments
contributed to the increase in income compared to the prior year period, despite a lower yield, due
to a greater allocation of investments to this asset class. While the limited partnership and
other alternative investment yield continued to exceed the overall portfolio yield, it decreased
compared to the prior year period primarily due to the market performance of Life’s hedge fund
investments largely due to disruptions in the credit market associated with structured securities.

Net investment income on equity securities, held for trading, for the year ended December 31, 2007
was primarily attributed to a change in the value of the underlying investment funds supporting the
Japanese variable annuity product due to market performance.

foreign currency gains and losses, and other investment gains and losses.

The circumstances giving rise to the changes in these components are as follows:

Year ended December 31, 2008 compared to the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006

Gross Gains and
Losses on Sale

•

Gross gains and losses on sales for the year ended December 31, 2008 primarily resulted from the decision to reallocate the
portfolio to securities with more favorable risk/return profiles. Also included was a gain of $141 from the sale of a synthetic CDO, as
well as losses on sales of HIMCO managed CLOs in the first quarter. For more information regarding these CLO losses, refer to the Variable
Interest Entities section below. During the year ended December 31, 2008, securities sold at a loss were depressed, on average,
approximately 2% at the respective period’s impairment review date and were deemed to be temporarily impaired.

•

Gross gains and losses on sales for the year ended December 31, 2007 were primarily comprised of corporate securities. During the
year ended December 31, 2007, securities sold at a loss were depressed, on average, approximately 1% at the respective period’s impairment
review date and were deemed to be temporarily impaired.

•

Gross gains on sales for the year ended December 31, 2006 were primarily within fixed maturities and were concentrated in U.S.
government, corporate and foreign government securities. Gross losses on sale for the year ended December 31, 2006 were primarily within
fixed maturities and were concentrated in the corporate and CMBS sectors.

Impairments

•

See the Other-Than-Temporary Impairments section that follows for information on impairment losses.

•

See Note 4 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of the SFAS 157 transition impact.

Variable Annuity

Hedge Program

•

See Note 4 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of variable annuity hedge program gains and
losses.

Other

•

Other, net losses for the year ended December 31, 2008 were primarily related to net losses of $291 related to transactional
foreign currency losses predominately on the internal reinsurance of the Japan variable annuity business, which is entirely offset in AOCI,
resulting from appreciation of the Yen and credit derivative losses of $222 due to significant credit spread widening. Also included were
losses on HIMCO managed CLOs in the first quarter and derivative related losses of $39 in the third quarter due to counterparty default
related to the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. For more information regarding the CLO losses, refer to the Variable Interest
Entities section below.

•

Other, net losses for the year ended December 31, 2007 were primarily driven by the change in value of non-qualifying derivatives
due to credit spread widening as well as fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. Credit spreads widened
primarily due to the deterioration in the U.S. housing market, tightened lending conditions and the market’s flight to quality securities.

•

Other, net losses for the year ended December 31, 2006 were primarily driven from the change in value of non-qualifying derivatives
due to fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. These losses were partially offset by a before-tax benefit of
$25 received from the WorldCom security settlement.



Separate Account Products

Separate account products are those for which a separate investment and liability account is
maintained on behalf of the policyholder. The Company’s separate accounts reflect accounts wherein
the policyholder assumes substantially all the risk and reward. Investment objectives for separate
accounts, which consist of the participants’ account balances, vary by fund account type, as
outlined in the applicable fund prospectus or separate account plan of operations. Separate
account products include variable annuities (except those sold in Japan), variable universal life
insurance contracts, 401(k), and variable corporate owned life insurance. The assets and
liabilities associated with variable annuity products sold in Japan and the United Kingdom do not
meet the criteria to be recognized as a separate account because the assets are not legally
insulated from the Company. Therefore, these assets are included with the Company’s general
account assets. As of December 31, 2008 and 2007, the Company’s separate accounts totaled $130.2
billion and $199.9 billion, respectively.

Property & Casualty

The primary investment objective for Property & Casualty’s Ongoing Operations segment is to
maximize economic value while generating sufficient after-tax income to meet policyholder and
corporate obligations. For Property & Casualty’s Other Operations segment, the investment
objective is to ensure the full and timely payment of all liabilities. Property & Casualty’s
investment strategies are developed based on a variety of factors including business needs,
regulatory requirements and tax considerations.

Total investments decreased $6.5 billion since December 31, 2007 primarily as a result of increased
unrealized losses. Unrealized losses increased as a result of market deterioration due to
significant credit spread widening. In addition, P&C increased its investment in short-term
securities to maintain higher than average liquidity while waiting for market and asset valuations
to stabilize.

Limited partnerships and other alternative investments decreased by $94 during 2008. Property &
Casualty continuously evaluates its allocation to limited partnerships and other alternative
investments and has taken steps to reduce its exposure to hedge funds, some of which will occur in
2009. In addition, HIMCO does not expect significant additions to limited partnerships and other
alternative investments in 2009 except for unfunded commitments. HIMCO closely monitors the impact
of these investments in relationship to the overall investment portfolio and the consolidated
balance sheets.

Yields calculated using investment income before investment expenses divided by the monthly weighted average invested
assets at cost, amortized cost, or adjusted carrying value, as applicable excluding collateral received associated with the
securities lending program. Included in the fixed maturity yield is Other income (loss) as it primarily relates to fixed
maturities (see footnote [3] below). Included in the total net investment income yield is investment expense.

[2]

Includes net investment
income on short-term bonds.

[3]

Includes fees associated with securities lending activities of $30, $41 and $0, respectively, for the years ended December
31, 2008, 2007 and 2006. The income from securities lending activities is included within fixed maturities. Also included
are derivatives that qualify for hedge accounting under SFAS 133. These derivatives hedge fixed maturities.

[4]

Due to significant holdings in tax-exempt investments, after-tax net investment income and yield are also included.

Year ended December 31, 2008 compared to the year ended December 31, 2007

Before-tax net investment income decreased $434, or 26%, and after-tax net investment income
decreased $325, or 26%, compared to the prior year period. The decrease in net investment income
was primarily due to lower yield on variable rate securities due to declines in short term interest
rates, increased allocation to lower yielding U.S. Treasuries and short-term investments, and a
decrease in investment yield for limited partnership and other alternative investments. The
decrease in limited partnerships and other alternative investments yield was largely due to
negative returns on hedge funds and real estate partnerships as a result of the lack of liquidity
in the financial markets and a wider credit spread environment. Based upon the current interest
rate and credit environment, Property & Casualty expects a slightly higher average portfolio yield
for 2009 as compared to 2008.

Year ended December 31, 2007 compared to the year ended December 31, 2006

Before-tax net investment income increased $201, or 14%, and after-tax net investment income
increased $139, or 13%, compared to the prior year period. The increase in net investment income
was primarily due to a higher average invested asset base and a higher portfolio yield. The
increase in the average invested asset base as compared to the prior year period, was primarily due
to positive operating cash flows. Limited partnerships and other alternative investments
contributed to the increase in income compared to the prior year period due to a higher portfolio
yield and greater allocation of investments to this asset class.

Year ended December 31, 2008 compared to the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006

Gross Gains and
Losses on Sale

•

Gross gains and losses on sales for the year ended December 31, 2008 primarily resulted from the
decision to reallocate the portfolio to securities with more favorable risk/return profiles. Also
included were losses on sales of HIMCO managed CLOs in the first quarter. For more information regarding
these CLO losses, refer to the Variable Interest Entities section below. During the year ended December
31, 2008, securities sold at a loss were depressed, on average, approximately 2% at the respective
period’s impairment review date and were deemed to be temporarily impaired.

•

Gross gains and losses on sales for the year ended December 31, 2007 were primarily comprised of
foreign government, corporate, and municipal securities. During the year ended December 31, 2007,
securities sold at a loss were depressed, on average, approximately 1% at the respective period’s
impairment review date and were deemed to be temporarily impaired.

•

Gross gains on sales for the year ended December 31, 2006 were concentrated in the corporate,
foreign government and municipal sectors. Gross losses on sales for the year ended December 31, 2006
were concentrated in the corporate and CMBS sectors.

Impairments

•

See the Other-Than-Temporary Impairments section that follows for information on impairment
losses.

Other

•

Other, net losses for the year ended December 31, 2008 were primarily related to net losses on
credit derivatives of $90 as a result of credit spread widening on credit derivatives that assume credit
exposure. Also included were losses on HIMCO managed CLOs in the first quarter and derivative related
losses of $7 during the third quarter due to counterparty default related to the bankruptcy of Lehman
Brothers Holdings Inc. For more information regarding the CLO losses, refer to the Variable Interest
Entities section below.

•

Other, net losses for the year ended December 31, 2007 primarily resulted from the change in
value associated with credit derivatives due to credit spreads widening. Credit spreads widened
primarily due to the deterioration in the U.S. housing market, tightened lending conditions and the
market’s flight to quality securities.

Corporate

The investment objective of Corporate is to raise capital through financing activities to support
the Life and Property & Casualty operations of the Company and to maintain sufficient funds to
support the cost of those financing activities including the payment of interest for The Hartford
Financial Services Group, Inc. (“HFSG”) issued debt and dividends to shareholders of The Hartford’s
common stock. As of December 31, 2008 and 2007, Corporate held $155 and $308, respectively, of
fixed maturity investments, $1.5 billion and $160, respectively, of short-term investments and $73
and $103, respectively, of equity securities, available-for-sale. Short-term investments are
intended to be used for general corporate purposes, which may include the capital and liquidity
needs of our operations. For further information, see “Capital Resources and Liquidity” section
under Liquidity Requirements. As of December 31, 2008 and 2007, a put option agreement for the
Company’s contingent capital facility with a fair value of $43 was included in Other invested
assets. Realized capital gains for the year ended December 31, 2008, included gains of $110
resulting from a decrease in the liability related to certain warrants associated with the Allianz
transaction. For further discussion on Allianz, see the Capital Resources and Liquidity section.

Securities Lending

The Company participates in securities lending programs to generate additional income, whereby
certain domestic fixed income securities are loaned from the Company’s portfolio to qualifying
third party borrowers, in return for collateral in the form of cash or U.S. government securities.
Borrowers of these securities provide collateral of 102% of the market value of the loaned
securities and can return the securities to the Company for cash at varying maturity dates. As of
December 31, 2008, the Company loaned securities with a fair value of $2.9 billion and had received
collateral against the loaned securities in the amount of $3.0 billion. The Company reduced its
securities lending program by $1.4 billion since December 31, 2007 and plans to significantly
reduce its term lending program in 2009 as securities mature.

and, in turn, when the cash collateral would be returned to the borrower.

Variable Interest Entities (“VIE”)

The Company is involved with variable interest entities primarily as a collateral manager and as an
investor through normal investment activities. The Company’s involvement includes providing
investment management and administrative services for a fee and holding ownership or other
interests as an investor. The Company also has involvement with VIEs as a means of accessing
capital.

VIEs may or may not be consolidated on the Company’s consolidated financial statements. When the
Company is the primary beneficiary of the VIE, all of the assets and liabilities of the VIE are
consolidated into the Company’s financial statements. The Company also reports a liability for the
portion of the VIE that represents the minority interest of other investors in the VIE. When the
Company concludes that it is not the primary beneficiary of the VIE, only the fair value of the
Company’s interest in the VIE is recorded in the Company’s financial statements.

As of December 31, 2007, HIMCO was the collateral manager of four VIEs with provisions that allowed
for termination if the fair value of the aggregate referenced bank loan portfolio declined below a
stated level. These VIEs were market value CLOs that invested in senior secured bank loans through
total return swaps. Two of these market value CLOs were consolidated, and two were not
consolidated. During the first quarter of 2008, the fair value of the aggregate referenced bank
loan portfolio declined below the stated level in all four market value CLOs and the total return
swap counterparties terminated the transactions. Three of these CLOs were restructured from market
value CLOs to cash flow CLOs without market value triggers and the remaining CLO terminated in
January 2009. The Company realized a capital loss of $90, before-tax, from the termination of
these CLOs. In connection with the restructurings, the Company purchased interests in two of the
resulting VIEs, one of which the Company is the primary beneficiary. These purchases resulted in
an increase in the Company’s maximum exposure to loss for both consolidated and non-consolidated
VIEs.

At December 31, 2008 and 2007, the Company had relationships with five and seven VIEs,
respectively, where the Company was the primary beneficiary. The following table sets forth the
carrying value of assets and liabilities, and the Company’s maximum exposure to loss on these
consolidated VIEs.

Creditors have no recourse against the Company in the event of default by the VIE.

[2]

The Company’s maximum exposure to loss represents the maximum loss amount that the Company could recognize as a reduction
in net investment income or as a realized capital loss and is the consolidated assets net of liabilities at cost. The
Company has no implied or unfunded commitments to these VIEs.

CLOs represent one fund at December 31, 2008, which is a cash flow CLO financed by issuing debt in
tranches of varying seniority and is a VIE due to the lack of voting equity in the capital
structure. The Company provides collateral management services to the CLO and earns a fee for
those services and also has investments in debt issued by the CLO. Taking those interests into
consideration, the Company has performed a quantitative analysis and determined that it will absorb
a majority of the expected losses or residual returns in the fund and as a result is the primary
beneficiary. Consolidated assets are classified in cash and fixed maturities and consolidated
liabilities are classified in other liabilities. At December 31, 2007, CLOs represent two market
value CLOs, one of which converted to the cash flow CLO described above and the second which
terminated during the fourth quarter of 2008.



At December 31, 2008 and 2007, limited partnerships represent investments in two hedge funds that
are financed by issuing equity shares to investors, and are VIEs based on the lack of decision
making ability held by the equity investors. The primary source of variability generated by these
VIEs is the fund’s investment portfolio and that variability is passed to equity holders. The
Company holds a majority interest in the equity of the funds and as a result will absorb the
majority of the funds’ expected losses or residual returns and therefore is the primary
beneficiary. Consolidated assets and liabilities are classified in other investments and other
liabilities, respectively.

Other investments at December 31, 2008 consist of two investment trusts that are financed by
issuing beneficial interests that do not have voting rights to investors. The Company holds a
majority of the beneficial interests issued by these trusts and as the majority holder, will absorb
a majority of expected losses or residual returns and therefore is the primary beneficiary. The
Company was not the primary beneficiary of one of those trusts at December 31, 2007. Consolidated
assets and liabilities are classified in fixed maturities and other liabilities, respectively. At
December 31, 2007, other investments included three investment trusts, two of which have liquidated
and the third remains at December 31, 2008.

As of December 31, 2008 and 2007, the Company also held significant variable interests in four and
five VIEs, respectively, where the Company is not the primary beneficiary. That determination has
been made based on a quantitative analysis of whether the Company will absorb a majority of the
expected losses or residual returns of the VIE, considering its variable interests as well as those
of other variable interest holders. These investments have been held by the Company for two years.

The following table sets forth the carrying value of assets and liabilities that relate to the
Company’s variable interests in unconsolidated VIEs, and the Company’s maximum exposure to loss
resulting from involvement with those VIEs.

Maximum exposure to loss represents the Company’s investment in securities issued by CLOs/CDOs at cost.

[2]

Maximum exposure to loss represents issuance costs that were incurred to establish the contingent capital facility.

[3]

The Company has no implied or unfunded commitments to these VIEs.

At December 31, 2008, CLOs include one fund that is financed by issuing debt securities in tranches
of varying seniority. That fund is a cash flow CLO and a VIE due to the lack of voting equity in
its capital structure. The Company holds variable interests through fees earned as the collateral
manager and investments in debt and preferred equity issued by the fund with a carrying amount at
December 31, 2008 of $306 and $2, respectively. At December 31, 2007, CLOs represent two market
value CLOs, one of which converted to the cash flow CLO described above and the second for which
the Company is no longer involved with following its conversion from a market value to a cash flow
CLO.

At December 31, 2008 and 2007, CDOs consist of two VIEs that are financed by issuing debt having no
voting rights to investors. The Company has variable interests in each CDO by virtue of its
investment in that debt and fees received as the collateral manager. The carrying amount of the
investment in debt issued by the CDOs is $3 at December 31, 2008 and is classified in fixed
maturities.

Other, at December 31, 2008 and 2007, represents the Company’s variable interest in the Glen Meadow
ABC Trust, which is a put option agreement that requires the trust, at any time, to purchase the
Company’s junior subordinated notes in a maximum principal amount not to exceed $500. There is no
equity investment and thus the trust is a VIE based on that lack of voting equity. The put option
agreement held by the Company is a variable interest in the trust. The carrying amount of that
option at December 31, 2008 classified in other assets is $42 and the carrying value of the
liability for premiums due under the option contract at December 31, 2008 classified in other
liabilities is $40.

Other-Than-Temporary Impairments

The Company has a comprehensive security monitoring process overseen by a committee of investment
and accounting professionals that, on a quarterly basis, identifies securities that could
potentially be other-than-temporarily impaired. When a security is deemed to be
other-than-temporarily impaired, its cost or amortized cost is written down to current fair value
and a realized loss is recorded in the Company’s consolidated statements of operations. For fixed
maturities, the Company accretes the new cost basis to par or to the estimated future value over
the expected remaining life of the security by adjusting the security’s yield. For further
discussion regarding the Company’s other-than-temporary impairment policy, see “Evaluation of
Other-Than-Temporary Impairments on Available-for-Sale Securities” included in the Critical
Accounting Estimates section of the MD&A, Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and

The following discussion provides an analysis of significant other-than-temporary impairments
(“impairments”) recognized during 2008, 2007 and 2006 and the related circumstances giving rise to
the impairments.


For the year ended December 31, 2008, impairments of $3,964 were concentrated in subordinated fixed
maturities and preferred equities within the financial services sector, as well as, in CMBS
securities.

Of the $2,484 of impairments on financial services companies for 2008, the Company does not
anticipate substantial recovery of $850 due to bankruptcy, financial restructurings or concerns
about the issuer’s ability to continue to make contractual payments. The remaining balance
primarily relates to securities that experienced extensive credit spread widening and the Company
could not reasonably assert that the security would recover in value in a reasonable period of time
or the Company did not wish to assert its intent to hold the security until recovery. To the
extent the Company does not sell these securities, the Company expects to recover principal and
interest in accordance with the security’s contractual terms over a period up to and including the
security’s contractual maturity.

Impairments on securitized securities totaled $899 for the year ended December 31, 2008. For these
securities, the Company determines impairments by modeling cash flows in a severe negative economic
outlook scenario. If the results of this cash flow modeling result in
an economic loss, an impairment was taken. The Company continues
to receive contractual principal and interest payments on the majority of CMBS and sub-prime ABS
securities impaired, however the Company is uncertain of its ability to recover principal and
interest in accordance with the security’s original contractual terms.

The remaining impairments of $581 were primarily recorded on securities in various sectors,
primarily high yield non-financial services corporate securities that experienced significant
credit spread widening and for which the Company was uncertain of its intent to retain the
investments for a period of time sufficient to allow for recovery.


For the year ended December 31, 2007, impairments of $483 were concentrated in securitized assets
and corporate fixed maturities. Impairments for securitized assets totaled $249 and were primarily
on securities backed by sub-prime residential mortgage loans rated A and below in the 2006 and 2007
vintage years. Impairments on corporate fixed maturities of $165 were primarily within the
financial services and home builders sectors. The majority of these securities experienced
extensive credit spread widening and the Company could not reasonably assert that the security
would recover in value in a reasonable period of time. For the majority of these securities, the
Company expects to recover principal and interest substantially greater than what the market price
indicates.

The remaining impairments were primarily recorded on securities in various sectors that had
declined in value for which the Company was uncertain of its intent to retain the investments for a
period of time sufficient to allow for recovery.


For the year ended December 31, 2006, impairments were primarily recorded on corporate fixed
maturities and ABS. Other than a $16 impairment on a single issuer in the utilities sector, there
were no other significant impairments (i.e., $15 or greater) recorded on any single security or
issuer. The impairments on ABS primarily related to investments backed by aircraft lease
receivables. Impairments resulted from higher than expected maintenance expenses.



INVESTMENT CREDIT RISK

The Company has established investment credit policies that focus on the credit quality of obligors
and counterparties, limit credit concentrations, encourage diversification and require frequent
creditworthiness reviews. Investment activity, including setting of policy and defining acceptable
risk levels, is subject to regular review and approval by senior management.

The Company invests primarily in securities which are rated investment grade and has established
exposure limits, diversification standards and review procedures for all credit risks including
borrower, issuer and counterparty. Creditworthiness of specific obligors is determined by
consideration of external determinants of creditworthiness, typically ratings assigned by
nationally recognized ratings agencies and is supplemented by an internal credit evaluation.
Obligor, asset sector and industry concentrations are subject to established Company limits and are
monitored on a regular basis.

Other than U.S. government and certain U.S. government agencies backed by the full faith and credit
of the U.S. government, the Company’s only exposure to any credit concentration risk of a single
issuer greater than 10% of the Company’s stockholders’ equity, is the Government of Japan, which
represents $2.3 billion, or 25%, of stockholders’ equity. For further discussion of concentration
of credit risk, see the “Concentration of Credit Risk” section in Note 5 of Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements.

Derivative Instruments

In the normal course of business, the Company uses various derivative counterparties in executing
its derivative transactions. The use of counterparties creates credit risk that the counterparty
may not perform in accordance with the terms of the derivative transaction. The Company has
developed a derivative counterparty exposure policy which limits the Company’s exposure to credit
risk.

The derivative counterparty exposure policy establishes market-based credit limits, favors
long-term financial stability and creditworthiness of the counterparty and typically requires
credit enhancement/credit risk reducing agreements.

The Company minimizes the credit risk of derivative instruments by entering into transactions with
high quality counterparties rated A2/A or better, which are monitored and evaluated by the
Company’s risk management team and reviewed by senior management. In addition, the internal
compliance unit monitors counterparty credit exposure on a monthly basis to ensure compliance with
Company policies and statutory limitations. The Company also maintains a policy of requiring that
derivative contracts, other than exchange traded contracts, currency forward contracts, and certain
embedded derivatives, be governed by an International Swaps and Derivatives Association Master
Agreement which is structured by legal entity and by counterparty and permits right of offset.

The Company has developed credit exposure thresholds which are based upon counterparty ratings.
Credit exposures are measured using the market value of the derivatives, resulting in amounts owed
to the Company by its counterparties or potential payment obligations from the Company to its
counterparties. Credit exposures are generally quantified daily based on the prior business day’s
market value and collateral is pledged to and held by, or on behalf of, the Company to the extent
the current value of derivatives exceeds the contractual thresholds. In accordance with industry
standards and the contractual agreements, collateral is typically settled on the next business day.
The Company has exposure to credit risk for amounts below the exposure thresholds which are
uncollateralized as well as for market fluctuations that may occur between contractual settlement
periods of collateral movements.

The maximum uncollateralized threshold for a derivative counterparty for a single legal entity is
$10, excluding reinsurance derivatives. The Company currently transacts derivatives in five legal entities and therefore the maximum
combined threshold for a single counterparty over all legal entities that use derivatives is $50.
In addition, the Company may have exposure to multiple counterparties in a single corporate family
due to a common credit support provider. As of December 31, 2008, the maximum combined threshold
for all counterparties under a single credit support provider over all legal entities that use
derivatives is $100. Based on the contractual terms of the collateral agreements, these thresholds
may be immediately reduced due to a downgrade in a counterparty’s credit rating.

For the year ended December 31, 2008, the Company has incurred losses of $46 on derivative
instruments due to counterparty default related to the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.
These losses were a result of the contractual collateral threshold amounts and open collateral
calls in excess of such amounts immediately prior to the bankruptcy filing, as well as interest
rate and credit spread movements from the date of the last collateral call to the date of the
bankruptcy filing.

In addition to counterparty credit risk, the Company enters into credit derivative instruments to
manage credit exposure. Credit derivatives used by the Company include credit default swaps,
credit index swaps, and total return swaps.

Credit default swaps involve a transfer of credit risk of one or many referenced entities from one
party to another in exchange for periodic payments. The party that purchases credit protection
will make periodic payments based on an agreed upon rate and notional amount, and for certain
transactions there will also be an upfront premium payment. The second party, who assumes credit
exposure, will typically only make a payment if there is a credit event and such payment will be
equal to the notional value of the swap contract less the value of the referenced security issuer’s
debt obligation. A credit event is generally defined as default on contractually obligated
interest or principal payments or bankruptcy of the referenced entity.

Credit index swaps and total return swaps involve the periodic exchange of payments with other
parties, at specified intervals, calculated using the agreed upon index and notional principal
amounts. Generally, no cash or principal payments are exchanged at the inception of the contract.



The Company uses credit derivatives to assume credit risk from and reduce credit risk to a single
entity, referenced index, or asset pool. The credit default swaps in which the Company assumes
credit risk reference investment grade single corporate issuers, baskets of up to five corporate
issuers and diversified portfolios of corporate issuers. The diversified portfolios of corporate
issuers are established within sector concentration limits and are typically divided into tranches
which possess different credit ratings ranging from AAA through the CCC rated first loss position.
In addition to the credit default swaps that assume credit exposure, the Company also purchases
credit protection through credit default swaps to economically hedge and manage credit risk of
certain fixed maturity investments across multiple sectors of the investment portfolio.

The credit default swaps are carried on the balance sheet at fair value. The Company received
upfront premium payments on certain credit default swaps, which reduces the Company’s overall
credit exposure. The following table summarizes the credit default swaps used by the Company to
manage credit risk within the portfolio, excluding credit default swaps in offsetting positions,
which had a notional amount of $2.6 billion as of December 31, 2008.

During 2008, the Company continued to reduce overall credit risk exposure to general credit spread
movements by both reducing and rebalancing the total notional amount of the credit default swap
portfolio. In addition, all credit derivatives that reference the first loss position of a basket
of corporate issuers were terminated during 2008. The Company’s credit default swap portfolio has
experienced and may continue to experience market value fluctuations based upon certain market
conditions, including credit spread movement of specific referenced entities. For the year ended
December 31, 2008, the Company realized losses of $153, including net periodic coupon settlements,
on credit default swaps.

Prior to the first quarter of 2008, the Company also assumed credit exposure through credit index
swaps referencing AAA rated CMBS indices. During the first and second quarter of 2008, the Company
realized a loss of $100 and $3, before-tax, respectively, as a result of these swaps maturing as
well as the Company eliminating exposure to the remaining swaps by entering into offsetting
positions. As of December 31, 2008, the Company does not have exposure to CMBS through credit
derivatives.

The Company’s investment ratings as a percentage of total fixed maturities experienced a downward
shift from AAA since December 31, 2007 primarily due to rating agency downgrades of monoline
insurers, as well as, downgrades of sub-prime, CMBS, and financial services sector securities. The
movement in both government rated and BB & below securities is attributable to efforts to
reallocate the portfolio to higher quality, risk adverse assets through purchases of U.S.
Treasuries and sales of high yield securities.

The Company’s investment sector allocations as a percentage of total fixed maturities have
significantly changed since December 31, 2007 primarily due to efforts to reallocate the portfolio
to higher quality, risk averse assets, such as U.S. government/government agencies, and recession
resistant sectors, such as consumer non-cyclical, while reducing its exposure to CMBS, financial
services and consumer cyclical sectors.

The available-for-sale net unrealized loss position increased $12.5 billion since December 31, 2007
primarily as a result of credit spread widening, partially offset by declining interest rates and
impairments. Credit spreads widened primarily due to continued deterioration in the U.S. housing
market, tightened lending conditions and the market’s flight to quality securities, as well as, a
U.S. recession and a declining global economy. Despite steps taken by the government to stabilize
the financial system, liquidity and confidence in the markets have not yet been restored. The sectors most significantly impacted
include financial services, residential and commercial mortgage backed investments, and consumer
loan backed investments. The following sections illustrate the Company’s holdings and provide
commentary on these sectors.

Financial Services

Financial companies remain under significant stress driven initially by the housing market collapse
which led to massive asset write-downs, an inability to source capital, funding pressure and a loss
of confidence in the financial system. Numerous government initiatives were put forth over the
course of 2008 to address the seizure in the financial and capital markets, including the injection
of capital into financial institutions through the Treasury’s Capital Purchase Program, and the
establishment of the FDIC Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program (“TLGP”) whereby the FDIC
guarantees newly issued unsecured debt for participating institutions. While the government’s
efforts have provided some stability, financial institutions remain vulnerable to ongoing asset
write-downs, increasing credit losses associated with a deteriorating economy, weak earnings
prospects, and potentially the need for additional capital if losses further weaken current capital
positions.

The Company has exposure to the financial services sector predominantly through banking, insurance
and finance firms. A comparison of fair value to amortized cost is not indicative of the pricing
of individual securities as rating downgrades and impairments have occurred. The following table
represents the Company’s exposure to the financial services sector included in the corporate and
equity securities, available-for-sale lines in the Consolidated Available-for-Sale Securities by
Type table above. Of the Company’s $7.9 billion on a fair value basis, $3.4 billion is senior
debt, $1.9 billion is subordinate and Tier 2 holdings and $2.6 billion is Tier 1 and preferred
exposure. The Company’s exposure to European financial institutions comprises $702 of senior debt,
$816 of subordinate and Tier 2 holdings and $875 of Tier 1 and preferred holdings.

Sub-Prime Residential Mortgage Loans

The Company has exposure to sub-prime and Alt-A residential mortgage backed securities included in
the Consolidated Available-for-Sale Securities by Type table above. These securities continue to
be affected by uncertainty surrounding the decline in home prices, negative technical factors and
deterioration in collateral performance.

The following table presents the Company’s exposure to ABS supported by sub-prime mortgage loans by
current credit quality and vintage year, including direct investments in CDOs that contain a
sub-prime loan component, included in the RMBS and ABS other line in the Consolidated
Available-for-Sale Securities by Type table above. A comparison of fair value to amortized cost is
not indicative of the pricing of individual securities as rating downgrades and impairments have
occurred. Credit protection represents the current weighted average percentage, excluding wrapped
securities, of the outstanding capital structure subordinated to the Company’s investment holding
that is available to absorb losses before the security incurs the first dollar loss of principal.
The table below excludes the Company’s exposure to Alt-A residential mortgage loans, with an
amortized cost and fair value of $305 and $197, respectively, as of December 31, 2008, and $366 and
$357, respectively, as of December 31, 2007. These securities were primarily backed by 2007
vintage year collateral and rated A and above.

The vintage year represents the year the underlying loans in the pool were originated.

[2]

The Company’s exposure to second lien residential mortgages is composed primarily of loans to prime and Alt-A borrowers, of which approximately over
half were wrapped by monoline insurers. These securities are included in the table above and have an amortized cost and fair value of $173 and $82,
respectively, as of December 31, 2008 and $260 and $217, respectively, as of December 31, 2007.

[3]

As of December 31, 2008, the weighted average life of the sub-prime residential mortgage portfolio was 3.8 years.

[4]

Approximately 84% of the portfolio is backed by adjustable rate mortgages.

[5]

The credit qualities above include downgrades which have shifted the portfolio from higher rated assets to lower
rated assets since December 31, 2007.



Commercial Mortgage Loans

The Company has observed weakness in commercial real estate market fundamentals and expects
continued pressure on these fundamentals including increased vacancies, rising delinquencies, lower
rent growth and declining property values. The following tables represent the Company’s exposure
to CMBS bonds, commercial real estate CDOs, and IOs by current credit quality and vintage year. A
comparison of fair value to amortized cost is not indicative of the pricing of individual
securities as rating downgrades and impairments have occurred. Credit protection represents the
current weighted average percentage of the outstanding capital structure subordinated to the
Company’s investment holding that is available to absorb losses before the security incurs the
first dollar loss of principal. This credit protection does not include any equity interest or
property value in excess of outstanding debt.

represents the year the pool of loans was originated.

In addition to commercial mortgage backed securities, the Company has whole loan commercial real
estate investments. The carrying value of mortgage loans on real estate was $6.5 billion and $5.4
billion as of December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The Company’s mortgage loans are
collateralized by a variety of commercial and agricultural properties. The mortgage loans are
diversified both geographically throughout the United States and by property type.

At December 31, 2008, the Company held delinquent mortgage loans on three properties with a
carrying value of $91 which were deemed impaired and accordingly, a valuation allowance of $26 was
established. At December 31, 2007, the Company held no impaired, restructured, delinquent or
in-process-of-foreclosure mortgage loans and therefore had no valuation allowance.

Consumer Loans

The Company continues to see weakness in consumer credit fundamentals. Rising delinquency and loss
rates have been driven by the recessionary economy and higher unemployment rates. Delinquencies
and losses on consumer loans rose during 2008 and the Company expects this trend to continue in the
upcoming year. However, the Company expects its ABS consumer loan holdings to face limited credit
concerns, as the borrower collateral quality and structural credit enhancement of the securities
are sufficient to absorb a significantly higher level of defaults than are currently anticipated.
The following table presents the Company’s exposure to ABS consumer loans by credit quality.

Includes monoline insured securities with an amortized cost and fair value of $47 and $38, respectively, at December 31,
2008, and amortized cost and fair value of $49 at December 31, 2007. Additionally, approximately 13% of the auto consumer
loan-backed securities were issued by lenders whose primary business is to sub-prime borrowers.

[2]

As of December 31, 2008, approximately 6% of the securities were issued by lenders
that lend primarily to sub-prime borrowers.

[3]

Includes monoline insured securities with an amortized cost and fair value of $102 and $38, respectively, at December 31,
2008, and amortized cost and fair value of $102 and $93, respectively, at December 31, 2007. Additionally, approximately
half of the student loan-backed exposure is guaranteed by the Federal Family Education Loan Program, with the remainder
comprised of loans to prime-borrowers.

Monoline Insured Securities

Monoline insurers guarantee the timely payment of principal and interest of certain securities.
Municipalities will often purchase monoline insurance to “wrap” a security issuance in order to
benefit from better market execution. Rating agency downgrades of bond insurers have not had a
significant impact on the fair value of the Company’s insured portfolio; however, these downgrades
have caused a downshift in rating quality from AAA rated since December 31, 2007. As of December
31, 2008, the fair value of the Company’s total monoline insured securities was $6.6 billion, with
the fair value of the insured municipal securities totaling $6.1 billion. At December 31, 2008 and
2007, the overall credit quality of the municipal bond portfolio, including the benefits of
monoline insurance, was AA- and AA+, respectively, and excluding the benefits of monoline
insurance, the overall credit quality was AA-. In addition to the insured municipal securities, as
of December 31, 2008, the Company has other insured securities with a fair value of approximately
$500. These securities include the below prime mortgage-backed securities and other consumer loan
receivables discussed above, as well as, corporate securities. The Company also has direct
investments in monoline insurers with a fair value of approximately $48 as of December 31, 2008.

Securitized Assets

The majority of securitized assets depressed over 20%, as well as, over 50% for six consecutive
months are primarily related to CMBS and sub-prime RMBS. Based upon the Company’s cash flow
modeling in a severe negative economic outlook, which shows no loss of principal and interest, and
the Company’s assertion of its ability and intent to retain the securities until recovery, it has
been determined that these securities are temporarily impaired as of December 31, 2008.

All Other Securities

The majority of all other securities depressed over 20% for six consecutive months or greater in
the tables above primarily relate to financial services sector securities that include corporate
bonds, as well as, preferred equities issued by large high quality financial institutions that are
lower in the capital structure, and as a result have incurred greater price depressions. Based
upon the Company’s analysis of these securities and current macroeconomic conditions, the Company
expects to see significant price recovery on these securities over time and, therefore, has
determined that these securities are temporarily impaired as of December 31, 2008. For further
discussion on these securities, see the discussion below the “Consolidated Available-for-Sale
Securities by Type” table in this section above.

Future changes in the fair value of the investment portfolio are primarily dependent on the extent
of future issuer credit losses, return of liquidity and changes in general market conditions,
including interest rates and credit spread movements.

As part of the Company’s ongoing security monitoring process by a committee of investment and
accounting professionals, the Company has reviewed its investment portfolio and concluded that
there were no additional other-than-temporary impairments as of December 31, 2008 and 2007. During
this analysis, the Company asserts its intent and ability to retain until recovery those securities
judged to be temporarily impaired. Once identified, these securities are systematically restricted
from trading unless approved by the committee. The committee will only authorize the sale of these
securities based on predefined criteria that relate to events that could not have been reasonably
foreseen at the time the committee rendered its judgment on the Company’s intent and ability to
retain such securities until recovery. Examples of the criteria include, but are not limited to,
the deterioration in the issuer’s creditworthiness, a change in regulatory requirements or a major
business combination or major disposition.

The evaluation for other-than-temporary impairments is a quantitative and qualitative process,
which is subject to risks and uncertainties in the determination of whether declines in the fair
value of investments are other-than-temporary. The risks and uncertainties include changes in
general economic conditions, the issuer’s financial condition and/or future prospects, the effects
of changes in interest rates or credit spreads and the expected recovery period. In addition, for
securitized assets with contractual cash flows (e.g., ABS and CMBS), projections of expected future
cash flows may change based upon new information regarding the performance of the underlying
collateral. As of December 31, 2008 and 2007, management’s expectation of the discounted future
cash flows on these securities was in excess of the associated securities’ amortized cost. For a

Consolidated Financial Statements and Item 1A, Risk Factors.



CAPITAL MARKETS RISK MANAGEMENT

The Hartford has a disciplined approach to managing risks associated with its capital markets and
asset/liability management activities. Investment portfolio management is organized to focus
investment management expertise on the specific classes of investments, while asset/liability
management is the responsibility of a dedicated risk management unit supporting Life and Property &
Casualty operations. Derivative instruments are utilized in compliance with established Company
policy and regulatory requirements and are monitored internally and reviewed by senior management.
During 2008, the continued deterioration in the U.S. housing market, tightened lending conditions,
the market’s flight to quality securities, the U.S. recession, and the declining global economy
contributed to substantial spread widening in the Company’s fixed maturity portfolio.

Market Risk

The Hartford is exposed to market risk, primarily relating to the market price and/or cash flow
variability associated with changes in interest rates, credit spreads including issuer defaults,
equity prices or market indices, and foreign currency exchange rates. The Hartford is also exposed
to credit and counterparty repayment risk. The Company analyzes interest rate risk using various
models including parametric models that forecast cash flows of the liabilities and the supporting
investments, including derivative instruments, under various market scenarios.

Interest Rate Risk

The Company’s exposure to interest rate risk relates to the market price and/or cash flow
variability associated with the changes in market interest rates. The Company manages its exposure
to interest rate risk through asset allocation limits, asset/liability duration matching and
through the use of derivatives. The Company analyzes interest rate risk using various models
including parametric models and cash flow simulation of the liabilities and the supporting
investments, including derivative instruments under various market scenarios. Measures the Company
uses to quantify its exposure to interest rate risk inherent in its invested assets and interest
rate sensitive liabilities include duration and key rate duration. Duration is the weighted
average term-to-maturity of a security’s cash flows, and is used to approximate the percentage
change in the price of a security for a 100 basis point change in market interest rates. For
example, a duration of 5 means the price of the security will change by approximately 5% for a 1%
change in interest rates. The key rate duration analysis considers the expected future cash flows
of assets and liabilities assuming non-parallel interest rate movements.

To calculate duration, projections of asset and liability cash flows are discounted to a present
value using interest rate assumptions. These cash flows are then revalued at alternative interest
rate levels to determine the percentage change in fair value due to an incremental change in rates.
Cash flows from corporate obligations are assumed to be consistent with the contractual payment
streams on a yield to worst basis. The primary assumptions used in calculating cash flow
projections include expected asset payment streams taking into account prepayment speeds, issuer
call options and contract holder behavior. ABS, CMOs and MBS are modeled based on estimates of the
rate of future prepayments of principal over the remaining life of the securities. These estimates
are developed using prepayment speeds provided in broker consensus data. Such estimates are
derived from prepayment speeds previously experienced at the interest rate levels projected for the
underlying collateral. Actual prepayment experience may vary from these estimates.

The Company is also exposed to interest rate risk based upon the discount rate assumption
associated with the Company’s pension and other postretirement benefit obligations. The discount
rate assumption is based upon an interest rate yield curve comprised of bonds rated Aa or higher
with maturities primarily between zero and thirty years. For further discussion of interest rate
risk associated with the benefit obligations, see the Critical Accounting Estimates section of the
MD&A under “Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit Obligations” and Note 17 of Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements.

As interest rates decline, certain securities such as MBS and CMOs, as well as, other mortgage loan
backed securities are more susceptible to paydowns and prepayments. During such periods, the
Company generally will not be able to reinvest the proceeds at comparable yields, however in 2008,
in general, increases in credit spreads off-set lower interest rates. Lower interest rates will
also likely result in lower net investment income, increased hedging cost associated with variable
annuities and, if declines are sustained for a long period of time, it may subject the Company to
reinvestment risks, higher pension costs expense and possibly reduced profit margins associated
with guaranteed crediting rates on certain Life products. Conversely, the fair value of the
investment portfolio will increase when interest rates decline and the Company’s interest expense
will be lower on its variable rate debt obligations.

The Company believes that an increase in interest rates from the current levels is generally a
favorable development for the Company. Rate increases are expected to provide additional net
investment income, increase sales of fixed rate Life investment products, reduce the cost of the
variable annuity hedging program, limit the potential risk of margin erosion due to minimum
guaranteed crediting rates in certain Life products and, if sustained, could reduce the Company’s
prospective pension expense. Conversely, a rise in interest rates will reduce the fair value of
the investment portfolio, increase interest expense on the Company’s variable rate debt obligations
and, if long-term interest rates rise dramatically within a six to twelve month time period,
certain Life businesses may be exposed to disintermediation risk. Disintermediation risk refers to
the risk that policyholders will surrender their contracts in a rising interest rate environment
requiring the Company to liquidate assets in an unrealized loss position. In conjunction with the
interest rate risk measurement and management techniques, certain of Life’s fixed income product
offerings have market value adjustment provisions at contract surrender.



Credit Risk

The Company is exposed to credit risk within our investment portfolio and through counterparties.
Credit risk relates to the uncertainty of an obligor’s continued ability to make timely payments in
accordance with the contractual terms of the instrument or contract. The Company manages credit
risk through established investment credit policies which address quality of obligors and
counterparties, credit concentration limits, diversification requirements and acceptable risk
levels under expected and stressed scenarios. These policies are reviewed and approved
by senior management and by the Company’s Board of Directors.

The derivative counterparty exposure policy establishes market-based credit limits, favors
long-term financial stability and creditworthiness of the counterparty and typically requires
credit enhancement/credit risk reducing agreements. The Company minimizes the credit risk in
derivative instruments by entering into transactions with high quality counterparties rated A2/A or
better, which are monitored and evaluated by the Company’s risk management team and reviewed by
senior management. In addition, the internal compliance unit monitors counterparty credit exposure
on a monthly basis to ensure compliance with Company policies and statutory limitations.

Derivative counterparty credit risk is measured as the amount owed to the Company based upon
current market conditions and potential payment obligations between the Company and its
counterparties. Credit exposures are generally quantified daily based on the prior business day’s
market value and collateral is pledged to and held by, or on behalf of, the Company to the extent
the current value of derivative instruments exceeds the contractual thresholds. In accordance with
industry standards and the contractual agreements, collateral is typically settled on the next
business day. The Company has exposure to credit risk for amounts below the exposure thresholds
which are uncollateralized, as well as, for market fluctuations that may occur between contractual
settlement periods of collateral movements.

The Company has developed credit exposure thresholds which are based upon counterparty ratings.
The maximum uncollateralized threshold for a derivative counterparty for a single legal entity is
$10, excluding reinsurance derivatives. The Company currently transacts derivatives in five legal entities and therefore the maximum
combined threshold for a single counterparty over all legal entities that use derivatives is $50.
In addition, the Company may have exposure to multiple counterparties in a single corporate family
due to a common credit support provider. As of December 31, 2008, the maximum combined threshold
for all counterparties under a single credit support provider over all legal entities that use
derivatives is $100. Based on the contractual terms of the collateral agreements, these thresholds
may be immediately reduced due to a downgrade in a counterparty’s credit rating.

In addition to counterparty credit risk, the Company enters into credit derivative instruments,
including credit default, index and total return swaps, in which the Company assumes credit risk
from or reduces credit risk to a single entity, referenced index, or asset pool, in exchange for
periodic payments. For further information on credit derivatives, see the “Investment Credit Risk”
section.

The Company is also exposed to credit spread risk related to security market price and cash flows
associated with changes in credit spreads. Credit spread widening will reduce the fair value of
the investment portfolio and will increase net investment income on new purchases. This will also
result in losses associated with credit based non-qualifying derivatives where the Company assumes
credit exposure. If issuer credit spreads increase significantly or for an extended period of
time, it may result in higher other-than-temporary impairments. Credit spread tightening will
reduce net investment income associated with new purchases of fixed maturities and increase the
fair value of the investment portfolio. During 2008, credit spread widening resulted in a
significant increase in the Company’s unrealized losses and other-than-temporary impairments. For
further discussion of sectors most significantly impacted, see the “Investment Credit Risk”
section. Also, see “Capital Resources and Liquidity” for a discussion of the widening of credit
spread impacts on the Company’s statutory financial results as it relates to the accounting and
reporting for market value adjusted fixed annuities.

Equity Risk

The Company does not have significant equity risk exposure from invested assets. The Company’s
primary exposure to equity risk relates to the potential for lower earnings associated with certain
of the Life’s businesses such as variable annuities where fee income is earned based upon the fair
value of the assets under management. During 2008, Life’s fee income declined $302 or 6%. In
addition, Life offers certain guaranteed benefits, primarily associated with variable annuity
products, which increases the Company’s potential benefit exposure as the equity markets decline.
For a further discussion, see Life Equity Risk in this section of the MD&A.

The Company is also subject to equity risk based upon the assets that support its pension plans.
The asset allocation mix is reviewed on a periodic basis. In order to minimize risk, the pension
plans maintain a listing of permissible and prohibited investments. In addition, the pension plans
have certain concentration limits and investment quality requirements imposed on permissible
investment options. For further discussion of equity risk associated with the pension plans, see
the Critical Accounting Estimates section of the MD&A under “Pension and Other Postretirement
Benefit Obligations” and Note 17 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Foreign Currency Exchange Risk

The Company’s foreign currency exchange risk is related to non—U.S. dollar denominated
investments, which primarily consist of fixed maturity investments, the investment in and net
income of the Japanese Life and U.K. Life operations, and non-U.S. dollar denominated liability
contracts, including its GMDB, GMAB, GMWB, and GMIB benefits associated with its Japanese and U.K.
variable annuities, and a yen denominated individual fixed annuity product. A portion of the
Company’s foreign currency exposure is mitigated through the use of derivatives.



Derivative Instruments

The Company utilizes a variety of derivative instruments, including swaps, caps, floors, forwards,
futures and options through one of four Company-approved objectives: to hedge risk arising from
interest rate, equity market, credit spread including issuer default, price or currency exchange
rate risk or volatility; to manage liquidity; to control transaction costs; or to enter into
replication transactions.

Interest rate, volatility, dividend, credit default and index swaps involve the periodic exchange
of cash flows with other parties, at specified intervals, calculated using agreed upon rates or
other financial variables and notional principal amounts. Generally, no cash or principal payments
are exchanged at the inception of the contract. Typically, at the time a swap is entered into, the
cash flow streams exchanged by the counterparties are equal in value.

Interest rate cap and floor contracts entitle the purchaser to receive from the issuer at specified
dates, the amount, if any, by which a specified market rate exceeds the cap strike interest rate or
falls below the floor strike interest rate, applied to a notional principal amount. A premium
payment is made by the purchaser of the contract at its inception and no principal payments are
exchanged.

Forward contracts are customized commitments to either purchase or sell designated financial
instruments, at a future date, for a specified price and may be settled in cash or through delivery
of the underlying instrument.

Financial futures are standardized commitments to either purchase or sell designated financial
instruments, at a future date, for a specified price and may be settled in cash or through delivery
of the underlying instrument. Futures contracts trade on organized exchanges. Margin requirements
for futures are met by pledging securities or cash, and changes in the futures’ contract values are
settled daily in cash.

Option contracts grant the purchaser, for a premium payment, the right to either purchase from or
sell to the issuer a financial instrument at a specified price, within a specified period or on a
stated date.

Foreign currency swaps exchange an initial principal amount in two currencies, agreeing to
re-exchange the currencies at a future date, at an agreed upon exchange rate. There may also be a
periodic exchange of payments at specified intervals calculated using the agreed upon rates and
exchanged principal amounts.

Derivative activities are monitored and evaluated by the Company’s risk management team and
reviewed by senior management. In addition, the internal compliance unit monitors counterparty
credit exposure on a monthly basis to ensure compliance with Company policies and statutory
limitations. The notional amounts of derivative contracts represent the basis upon which pay or
receive amounts are calculated and are not reflective of credit risk. Notional amounts pertaining
to derivative instruments used in the management of market risk, excluding the credit derivatives
as discussed in the “Investment Credit Risk” section, at December 31, 2008 and 2007, were $106.6
billion and $101.0 billion, respectively. The increase in the derivative notional amount during
2008 was primarily due to the derivatives associated with the GMWB product feature. For further
information, see Note 4 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. For further discussion
on credit derivatives, see the “Investment Credit Risk” section.

The following discussions focus on the key market risk exposures within Life and Property &
Casualty portfolios.

Life

Life is responsible for maximizing economic value within acceptable risk parameters, including the
management of the interest rate sensitivity of invested assets, while generating sufficient
after-tax income to support policyholder and corporate obligations. Life’s fixed maturity
portfolios and certain investment contracts and insurance product liabilities have material market
exposure to interest rate risk. In addition, Life’s operations are significantly influenced by
changes in the equity markets. Life’s profitability depends largely on the amount of assets under
management, which is primarily driven by the level of sales, equity market appreciation and
depreciation and the persistency of the in-force block of business. Life’s foreign currency
exposure is primarily related to non-U.S. dollar denominated fixed income securities, non-U.S.
dollar denominated liability contracts, the investment in and net income of the Japanese and U.K.
Life operations and certain foreign currency based individual fixed annuity contracts, and its
GMDB, GMAB, GMWB, and GMIB benefits associated with its Japanese and U.K. variable annuities.

Interest Rate Risk

Life’s exposure to interest rate risk relates to the market price and/or cash flow variability
associated with changes in market interest rates. As stated above, changes in interest rates can
potentially impact Life’s profitability. In certain scenarios where interest rates are volatile,
Life could be exposed to disintermediation risk and a reduction in net interest rate spread or
profit margins. The investments and liabilities primarily associated with interest rate risk are
included in the following discussion. Certain product liabilities, including those containing
GMWB, GMIB, GMAB, or GMDB, expose the Company to interest rate risk but also have significant
equity risk. These liabilities are discussed as part of the Equity Risk section below.



Fixed Maturity Investments

Life’s investment portfolios primarily consist of investment grade fixed maturity securities,
including corporate bonds, ABS, CMBS, tax-exempt municipal securities and government bonds. The
fair value of Life’s fixed maturities was $45.2 billion and $52.5 billion at December 31, 2008 and
2007, respectively. The fair value of Life’s fixed maturities and other invested assets fluctuates
depending on the interest rate environment and other general economic conditions. The weighted
average duration of the fixed maturity portfolio was approximately 5.3 and 4.6 years as of December
31, 2008 and 2007, respectively.

Liabilities

Life’s investment contracts and certain insurance product liabilities, other than non-guaranteed
separate accounts, include asset accumulation vehicles such as fixed annuities, guaranteed
investment contracts, other investment and universal life-type contracts and certain insurance
products such as long-term disability.

Asset accumulation vehicles primarily require a fixed rate payment, often for a specified period of
time. Product examples include fixed rate annuities with a market value adjustment feature and
fixed rate guaranteed investment contracts. The duration of these contracts generally range from
less than one year to ten years. In addition, certain products such as universal life contracts
and the general account portion of Life’s variable annuity products, credit interest to
policyholders subject to market conditions and minimum interest rate guarantees. The duration of
these products is short-term to intermediate-term.

While interest rate risk associated with many of these products has been reduced through the use of
market value adjustment features and surrender charges, the primary risk associated with these
products is that the spread between investment return and credited rate may not be sufficient to
earn targeted returns.

The Company also manages the risk of certain insurance liabilities similar to how it
manages the risk associated with investment type
products due to the relative predictability of the aggregate cash flow payment streams. Products
in this category may contain significant actuarial (including mortality and morbidity) pricing and
cash flow risks. Product examples include structured settlement contracts, on-benefit annuities
(i.e., the annuitant is currently receiving benefits thereon) and short-term and long-term
disability contracts. The cash outflows associated with these policy liabilities are not interest
rate sensitive but do vary based on the timing and amount of benefit payments. The primary risks
associated with these products are that the benefits will exceed expected actuarial pricing and/or
that the actual timing of the cash flows will differ from those anticipated, resulting in an
investment return lower than that assumed in pricing. Average contract duration can range from
less than one year to typically up to fifteen years.

Derivatives

Life utilizes a variety of derivative instruments to mitigate interest rate risk. Interest rate
swaps are primarily used to convert interest receipts or payments to a fixed or variable rate. The
use of such swaps enables the Company to customize contract terms and conditions to customer
objectives and satisfies the operation’s asset/liability duration matching policy. Occasionally,
swaps are also used to hedge the variability in the cash flow of a forecasted purchase or sale due
to changes in interest rates.

Interest rate caps and floors, swaptions and option contracts are primarily used to hedge against
the risk of liability contract holder disintermediation in a rising interest rate environment, and
to offset the changes in fair value of corresponding derivatives embedded in certain of the
Company’s fixed maturity investments. Interest rate caps are also used to manage the duration risk
in certain portfolios.

At December 31, 2008 and 2007, notional amounts pertaining to derivatives utilized to manage
interest rate risk totaled $17.0 billion and $16.8 billion, respectively ($15.0 billion and $13.1
billion, respectively, related to investments and $1.9 billion and $3.7 billion, respectively,
related to life liabilities). The fair value of these derivatives was $435 and $45 as of December
31, 2008 and 2007, respectively.

Calculated Interest Rate Sensitivity

The after-tax change in the net economic value of investment contracts (e.g., guaranteed investment
contracts) and certain insurance product liabilities (e.g., short-term and long-term disability
contracts), for which the payment rates are fixed at contract issuance and the investment
experience is substantially absorbed by Life, are included in the following table along with the
corresponding invested assets. Also included in this analysis are the interest rate sensitive
derivatives used by Life to hedge its exposure to interest rate risk. Certain financial
instruments, such as limited partnerships, have been omitted from the analysis due to the fact that
the investments are accounted for under the equity method and generally lack sensitivity to
interest rate changes. Separate account assets and liabilities and equity securities held for
trading and the corresponding liabilities associated with the variable annuity products sold in
Japan are excluded from the analysis because gains and losses in separate accounts accrue to
policyholders. The calculation of the estimated hypothetical change in net economic value below
assumes a 100 basis point upward and downward parallel shift in the yield curve.

The fixed liabilities included above represented approximately 63% and 45% of Life’s general
account liabilities as of December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The assets supporting the
fixed liabilities are monitored and managed within rigorous duration guidelines, and are evaluated
on a monthly basis as well as annually using scenario simulation techniques in compliance with
regulatory requirements.

The after-tax change in fair value of the invested asset portfolios that support certain universal
life-type contracts and other insurance contracts are shown in the following table. The cash flows
associated with these liabilities are less predictable than fixed liabilities. The Company
identifies the most appropriate investment strategy based upon the expected policyholder behavior
and liability crediting needs. The calculation of the estimated hypothetical change in fair value
below assumes a 100 basis point upward and downward parallel shift in the yield curve.

The selection of the 100 basis point parallel shift in the yield curve was made only as an
illustration of the potential hypothetical impact of such an event and should not be construed as a
prediction of future market events. Actual results could differ materially from those illustrated
above due to the nature of the estimates and assumptions used in the above analysis. The Company’s
sensitivity analysis calculation assumes that the composition of invested assets and liabilities
remain materially consistent throughout the year and that the current relationship between
short-term and long-term interest rates will remain constant over time. As a result, these
calculations may not fully capture the impact of portfolio re-allocations, significant product
sales or non-parallel changes in interest rates.

Life’s Equity Product Risk

The Company’s Life operations are significantly influenced by changes in the U.S., Japanese, and
other global equity markets. Appreciation or depreciation in equity markets impacts certain assets
and liabilities related to the Company’s variable products and the Company’s earnings derived from
those products. The Company’s variable products include variable annuities, mutual funds, and
variable life insurance sold to retail and institutional customers. These variable products may
include product guarantees such as guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefits (GMWB), guaranteed
minimum accumulation benefits (GMAB), guaranteed minimum death benefits (GMDB), and guaranteed
minimum income benefits (GMIB).

Substantially all of the Company’s variable annuity contracts contain a GMDB and a portion of those contracts also
contain one or more living benefits. The Company’s maximum exposure disclosed below for death and living benefits are
calculated independently, however, these exposures are substantially overlapping.

Generally, declines in equity markets, such as those experienced in 2008, will and did in 2008:

•

reduce the value of assets under management and the amount of fee income generated from those assets;

•

reduce the value of equity securities, held for trading, for international variable annuities, the related
policyholder funds and benefits payable, and the amount of fee income generated from those annuities;

•

increase the liability for GMWB and GMAB benefits resulting in realized capital losses;

•

increase the value of derivative assets used to hedge product guarantees resulting in realized capital gains;

•

increase the Company’s net amount at risk for GMDB and GMIB benefits; and

•

decrease the Company’s actual gross profits, resulting in a negative true-up to current period DAC amortization.

•

increase the amount of required statutory capital necessary to maintain targeted risk based capital (RBC) ratios.

A prolonged or precipitous equity market decline may:

•

turn customer sentiment toward equity-linked products negative, causing a decline in sales;

•

cause a significant decrease in the range of reasonable estimates of future gross profits used in the Company’s
quantitative assessment of its modeled estimates of gross profits. If, in a given financial statement period,
the modeled estimates of gross profits are determined to be unreasonable, the Company will accelerate the amount
of DAC amortization in that period. Particularly in the case of variable annuities, an acceleration of DAC
amortization could potentially cause a material adverse deviation in that period’s earnings, but it would not
affect the Company’s cash flow or liquidity position. See Life Estimated Gross Profits Used in the Valuation
and Amortization of Assets and Liabilities Associated with Variable Annuity and Other Universal Life-Type
Contracts within Critical Accounting Estimates for further information on DAC and related equity market
sensitivities. During 2008, the Company recorded an unlock charge of $932.

•

increase costs under the Company’s hedging program.



Guaranteed Minimum Withdrawal Benefits and Guaranteed Minimum Accumulation Benefits

The majority of the Company’s U.S. and U.K. variable annuities are sold with a GMWB living benefit
rider or a GMAB living benefit rider, which are accounted for under SFAS 133. Declines in the
equity market may increase the Company’s exposure to benefits, under the GMWB and GMAB contracts,
leading to an increase in the Company’s existing liability for those benefits.

For example, a GMWB and/or GMAB contract is ‘in the money’ if the contract holder’s guaranteed
remaining benefit (GRB) becomes greater than the account value. As of December 31, 2008 and
December 31, 2007, 88% and 19%, respectively, of all unreinsured U.S. GMWB ‘in-force’ contracts
were ‘in the money’. For U.S. and U.K. GMWB contracts that were ‘in the money’ the Company’s
exposure to the GRB, after reinsurance, as of December 31, 2008 and December 31, 2007, was $7.7
billion and $146, respectively. For GMAB contracts that were ‘in the money’ the Company’s
exposure, as of December 31, 2008 and December 31, 2007, was $15 and $38, respectively.

However, the only ways the GMWB contract holder can monetize the excess of the GRB over the account
value of the contract is upon death or if their account value is reduced to a contractually
specified minimum level, through a combination of a series of withdrawals that do not exceed a
specific percentage of the premiums paid per year and market declines. If the account value is
reduced to the contractually specified minimum level, the contract holder will receive an annuity
equal to the remaining GRB and, for the Company’s “life-time” GMWB products, the annuity can
continue beyond the GRB. As the amount of the excess of the GRB over the account value can
fluctuate with equity market returns on a daily basis, and the ultimate life-time GMWB payments can
exceed the GRB, the ultimate amount to be paid by the Company, if any, is uncertain and could be
significantly more or less than $7.7 billion.

For GMAB benefits, the only ways the contract holder can monetize the excess of the GRB over the
account value of the contract is upon death or by waiting until the end of the contractual deferral
period of 10 years. As the amount of the excess of the GRB over the account value can fluctuate
with equity market returns on a daily basis, the ultimate amount to be paid by the Company, if any,
is uncertain and could be significantly more or less than $15.

Guaranteed Minimum Death Benefits and Guaranteed Minimum Income Benefits

In the U.S., the Company sells variable annuity contracts that offer various guaranteed death
benefits. Declines in the equity market may increase the Company’s exposure to death benefits
under these contracts. The Company accounts for these death benefit liabilities under SOP 03-1,
Accounting and Reporting by Insurance Enterprises for Certain Nontraditional Long-Duration
Contracts and for Separate Accounts, and, as such, these liabilities are not carried at fair value
under SFAS 157.

The Company’s total gross exposure (i.e., before reinsurance) to U.S. guaranteed death benefits as
of December 31, 2008 is $36.3 billion. The Company will incur these guaranteed death benefit
payments in the future only if the policyholder has an in-the-money guaranteed death benefit at
their time of death. The Company currently reinsures 51% of these death benefit guarantees. Under
certain of these reinsurance agreements, the reinsurers’ exposure is subject to an annual cap. The
Company’s net exposure (i.e. after reinsurance) is $17.8 billion, as of December 31, 2008. This
amount is often referred to as the retained net amount at risk.

In Japan, the Company offers certain variable annuity products with both a guaranteed death benefit
and a guaranteed income benefit. Declines in equity markets as well as a strengthening of the
Japanese yen in comparison to the U.S. dollar and other currencies may increase the Company’s
exposure to these guaranteed benefits. This increased exposure may be significant in extreme
market scenarios.

The Company’s total gross exposure (i.e., before reinsurance) to these guaranteed death benefits
and income benefits offered in Japan as of December 31, 2008 is $9 billion. However, the Company
will incur these guaranteed death or income benefits in the future only if the contract holder has
an in-the-money guaranteed benefit at either the time of their death or if the account value is
insufficient to fund the guaranteed living benefits. The Company currently reinsures 15% of the
death benefit guarantees. Under certain of these reinsurance agreements, the reinsurers’ exposure
is subject to an annual cap. For these products, the Company’s retained net amount at risk is $7.8
billion.

Life’s Product Guarantee Accounting Models

The accounting for living and death benefit guarantees can be significantly different and may
influence the form of risk management employed by the Company. Many benefit guarantees meet the
definition of an embedded derivative under SFAS 133 (GMWB and GMAB) and are recorded at fair value
under SFAS 157, incorporating changes in equity indices and equity index volatility, with changes
in fair value recorded in earnings. However, for other benefit guarantees, certain contract
features that define how the contract holder can access the value and substance of the guaranteed
benefit change the accounting from SFAS 133 to SOP 03-1. For contracts where the contract holder
can only obtain the value of the guaranteed benefit upon the occurrence of an insurable event such
as death (GMDB) or when the benefit received is in substance a long-term financing (GMIB), the
accounting for the benefit is prescribed by SOP 03-1.

As a result of these significant accounting differences, the liability for guarantees recorded
under SOP 03-1 may be significantly different than if it was recorded under SFAS 133 and vice
versa. In addition, the conditions in the capital markets in Japan versus those in the U.S. are
sufficiently different that if the Company’s GMWB product currently offered in the U.S. were
offered in Japan, the capital market conditions in Japan would have a significant impact on the
valuation of the GMWB, irrespective of the accounting model. The same would hold true if the Company’s GMIB product currently offered in Japan were to
be offered in the U.S. Capital market conditions in the U.S. would have a significant impact on
the valuation of the GMIB.



Life’s Equity Product Risk Management

The Company has made considerable investment in analyzing current and potential future market risk
exposures arising from a number of factors, including but not limited to, product guarantees (GMDB,
GMWB, GMAB, and GMIB), equity market and interest rate risks (in both the U.S. and Japan), and
foreign currency exchange rates. The Company evaluates these risks individually and, increasingly,
in the aggregate to determine the risk profiles of all of its products and to judge their potential
impacts on financial metrics including U.S. GAAP earnings and statutory surplus. The Company
manages the equity market, interest rate and foreign currency exchange risks embedded in these
product guarantees through product design, reinsurance, customized derivatives, and dynamic hedging
and macro hedging programs.

In consideration of current market conditions, the Company’s risk management program for the
variable annuity market will include redesigned product features which serve to lessen the
financial risk of the product guarantees and increased rider fees charged for the product
guarantees. Depending upon competitors’ reactions with respect to product suites and related rider
charges, the Company’s strategies of reducing product risk and increasing fees may cause a decline
in market share.

Reinsurance

The Company uses reinsurance to manage the risk exposure for a portion of contracts issued with
GMWB riders prior to the third quarter of 2003 and, in addition, in 2008, the Company entered into
a reinsurance agreement to reinsure GMWB risks associated with a block of business sold between the
third quarter of 2003 and the second quarter of 2006. The Company’s GMWB reinsurance is accounted
for as a freestanding derivative and is reported at fair value under SFAS 157.

The Company also uses reinsurance to manage the risk exposure for a majority of the death benefit
riders issued in the U.S. and a portion of the death benefit riders issued in Japan.

Derivative Hedging Programs

The Company maintains derivative hedging programs for its product guarantee risk to meet multiple,
and in some cases, competing risk management objectives, including providing protection against
tail scenario equity market events, providing resources to pay product guarantee claims, and
minimizing U.S. GAAP earnings volatility, statutory surplus volatility and other economic metrics.
For reinsurance and derivatives, the Company retains credit risk associated with the third parties.
Refer to preceding section “Credit Risk” for the Company’s discussion of credit risk.

The Company is continually exploring new ways and new markets to manage or layoff the capital
markets and policyholder behavior risks associated with its U.S. GMWB living benefits. During
2007 and 2008, the Company entered into customized derivative contracts to hedge certain capital
market risk components for the remaining term of specific blocks of non-reinsured U.S. GMWB riders.
These customized derivative contracts provide protection from capital markets risks based on
policyholder behavior assumptions specified by the Company at the inception of the derivative
transactions. The Company retains the risk for actual policyholder behavior that is different from
assumptions within the customized derivatives.

The Company’s dynamic hedging program uses derivative instruments to manage the U.S. GAAP earnings
volatility associated with variable annuity product guarantees including equity market declines,
equity implied volatility, declines in interest rates and foreign currency exchange risk. The
Company uses hedging instruments including interest rate futures and swaps, variance swaps, S&P
500, NASDAQ and EAFE index put options and futures contracts. The dynamic hedging program involves
a detailed monitoring of policyholder behavior and capital markets conditions on a daily basis and
rebalancing of the hedge position as needed depending upon the risk strategy employed. While the
Company actively manages this dynamic hedging program, increased U.S. GAAP earnings volatility may
result from factors including, but not limited to, policyholder behavior, capital markets
dislocation or discontinuity, divergence between the performance of the underlying funds and the
hedging indices, and the relative emphasis placed on various risk management objectives.

The Company’s macro hedge program uses derivative instruments to partially hedge the statutory tail
scenario risk associated primarily with its U.S. and Japan living and death benefit statutory
reserves, providing an additional measure of protection, under tail scenarios, on statutory surplus
and the associated RBC ratios. A consequence of the macro hedge program will be additional
cost and volatility, under non-tail scenarios, as the macro hedge is intended to partially hedge
certain equity-market sensitive liabilities calculated under statutory accounting (see Capital
Resources and Liquidity) and changes in the value of the derivatives may not be closely aligned to
changes in liabilities determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP, causing volatility in U.S. GAAP
earnings.

In the fourth quarter of 2008, the global economy experienced severe weakening resulting from the
dramatic decline in the equity markets, increasing equity index implied volatility, widening of
credit spreads, significant declines in interest rates, and volatility in foreign currency
exchanges rates. These significant and precipitous economic events increased, to varying degrees,
the Company’s exposure to death and living benefit guarantees, the statutory product guarantee
liabilities, and the level of statutory surplus required to maintain the Company’s RBC ratios.



In response to these severe economic drivers, the Company initiated a redesign of the variable
annuity product suite strategy designed to lessen the financial risk of variable annuity product
guarantees and increase the rider fees on new sales and on in-force, as contractually permitted.
The Company will continue to hedge the risk of the product guarantees with a greater relative
emphasis on protection of statutory surplus. This rebalancing of the hedging program affords an
additional measure of protection to improve the Company’s capital efficiency in managing tail risk
for statutory surplus during periods of declines in the equity markets. This shift in relative
emphasis will likely result in greater U.S. GAAP earnings volatility.

In the fourth quarter of 2008, the rebalancing of variable annuity hedging programs resulted in the
sale of certain derivative positions, a portion of which proceeds were used to
purchase other derivatives for the protection of statutory surplus and the associated target RBC
ratios. The Company entered into hedge positions on the S&P 500 index to economically hedge
statutory reserves and to provide protection of statutory surplus arising primarily from GMDB and
GMWB obligations. Refer to Note 5 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional
information on hedging derivatives.

The following table summarizes the Company‘s U.S. GMWB account value by type of risk management
strategy as of December 31, 2008:

During the fourth quarter of 2008, the Company maintained a reduced level of dynamic hedge

program.

Equity Risk Impact on Statutory Capital and Risked Based Capital

See Capital Resources and Liquidity, Ratings for information on the equity risk impact on statutory
results.

Foreign Currency Exchange Risk

Life’s exposure to foreign currency exchange risk exists with respect to non-U.S. dollar
denominated investments, Life’s investment in foreign operations, primarily in Japan and the U.K.,
and non-U.S. dollar denominated liability contracts, including the yen based individual fixed
annuity product and its GMDB, GMAB, GMWB, and GMIB benefits associated with its Japanese and U.K.
variable annuities. A significant portion of the Company’s foreign fixed maturity currency
exposure is mitigated through the use of derivatives.



Fixed Maturity Investments

The risk associated with the non-U.S. dollar denominated fixed maturities relates to potential
decreases in value and income resulting from unfavorable changes in foreign exchange rates. The
fair value of the non-U.S. dollar denominated fixed maturities, which are primarily denominated in
euro, sterling, yen and Canadian dollars, at December 31, 2008 and 2007, were approximately $3.0
billion and $1.6 billion, respectively. In order to manage its currency exposures, Life enters
into foreign currency swaps and forwards to hedge the variability in cash flows associated with
certain foreign denominated fixed maturities. These foreign currency swap and forward agreements
are structured to match the foreign currency cash flows of the hedged foreign denominated
securities. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, the derivatives used to hedge currency exchange risk
related to non-U.S. dollar denominated fixed maturities had a total notional amount of $1.3 billion
and $1.5 billion, respectively, and total fair value of $19 and $(296), respectively.

Liabilities

Life issues non-U.S. dollar denominated funding agreement liability contracts. The Company hedges
the foreign currency risk associated with these liability contracts with currency rate swaps. At
December 31, 2008 and 2007, the derivatives used to hedge foreign currency exchange risk related to
foreign denominated liability contracts had a total notional amount of $792 and $790, respectively,
and a total fair value of $(76) and $32, respectively.

The Company enters into foreign currency forward and option contracts that convert euros to yen in
order to economically hedge the foreign currency risk associated with certain Japanese variable
annuity products. As of December 31, 2008, the derivatives used to hedge foreign currency risk
associated with Japanese variable annuity products had a total notional amount of $259 and a total
fair value of $35. As of December 31, 2007, there were no derivative positions held as part of
this strategy.

The yen based fixed annuity product is written by Hartford Life Insurance K.K. (“HLIKK”), a
wholly-owned Japanese subsidiary of Hartford Life, Inc. (“HLI”), and subsequently reinsured to
Hartford Life Insurance Company, a U.S. dollar based wholly-owned indirect subsidiary of HLI. The
underlying investment involves investing in U.S. securities markets, which offer favorable credit
spreads. The yen denominated fixed annuity product (“yen fixed annuities”) is recorded in the
consolidated balance sheets with invested assets denominated in dollars while policyholder
liabilities are denominated in yen and converted to U.S. dollars based upon the December 31, yen to
U.S. dollar spot rate. The difference between U.S. dollar denominated investments and yen
denominated liabilities exposes the Company to currency risk. The Company manages this currency
risk associated with the yen fixed annuities primarily with pay variable U.S. dollar and receive
fixed yen currency swaps. As of December 31, 2008 and 2007, the notional value and fair value of
the currency swaps were $2.3 billion and $1.8 billion, respectively, and $383 and $(115),
respectively. Although economically an effective hedge, a divergence between the yen denominated
fixed annuity product liability and the currency swaps exists primarily due to the difference in
the basis of accounting between the liability and the derivative instruments (i.e. historical cost
versus fair value). The yen denominated fixed annuity product liabilities are recorded on a
historical cost basis and are only adjusted for changes in foreign spot rates and accrued income.
The currency swaps are recorded at fair value, incorporating changes in value due to changes in
forward foreign exchange rates, interest rates and accrued income. An after-tax net gain of $42
and $12 for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively, which includes the changes in
value of the currency swaps, excluding net periodic coupon settlements, and the yen fixed annuity
contract remeasurement, was recorded in net realized capital gains and losses.

Based on the fair values of Life’s non-U.S. dollar denominated investments and derivative
instruments (including its yen based individual fixed annuity product) as of December 31, 2008 and
2007, management estimates that a 10% unfavorable change in exchange rates would decrease the fair
values by an after-tax total of $111 and $1, respectively. The estimated impact was based upon a
10% change in December 31 spot rates. The selection of the 10% unfavorable change was made only
for illustration of the potential hypothetical impact of such an event and should not be construed
as a prediction of future market events. Actual results could differ materially from those
illustrated above due to the nature of the estimates and assumptions used in the above analysis.



Property & Casualty

Property & Casualty attempts to maximize economic value while generating appropriate after-tax
income and sufficient liquidity to meet policyholder and corporate obligations. Property &
Casualty’s investment portfolio has material exposure to interest rates. The Company continually
monitors these exposures and makes portfolio adjustments to manage these risks within established
limits.

Interest Rate Risk

The primary exposure to interest rate risk in Property & Casualty relates to its fixed maturity
securities, including corporate bonds, ABS, municipal bonds, CMBS and government bonds. The fair
value of these investments was $19.8 billion and $27.2 billion at December 31, 2008 and 2007,
respectively. The fair value of these and Property & Casualty’s other invested assets fluctuates
depending on the interest rate environment and other general economic conditions. A variety of
derivative instruments, primarily swaps, are used to manage interest rate risk and had a total
notional amount as of December 31, 2008 and 2007 of $2.3 billion and $1.8 billion, respectively,
and fair value of $23 and $(15), respectively.

One of the measures Property & Casualty uses to quantify its exposure to interest rate risk
inherent in its invested assets is duration. The weighted average duration of the fixed maturity
portfolio was 4.9 years as of December 31, 2008 and 2007.

Calculated Interest Rate Sensitivity

The following table provides an analysis showing the estimated after-tax change in the fair value
of Property & Casualty’s fixed maturity investments and related derivatives, assuming 100 basis
point upward and downward parallel shifts in the yield curve as of December 31, 2008 and 2007.
Certain financial instruments, such as limited partnerships, have been omitted from the analysis
due to the fact that the investments are accounted for under the equity method and generally lack
sensitivity to interest rate changes.

The selection of the 100 basis point parallel shift in the yield curve was made only as an
illustration of the potential hypothetical impact of such an event and should not be construed as a
prediction of future market events. Actual results could differ materially from those illustrated
above due to the nature of the estimates and assumptions used in the above analysis. The Company’s
sensitivity analysis calculation assumes that the composition of invested assets remains materially
consistent throughout the year and that the current relationship between short-term and long-term
interest rates will remain constant over time. As a result, these calculations may not fully
capture the impact of portfolio re-allocations or non-parallel changes in interest rates.

Foreign Currency Exchange Risk

Foreign currency exchange risk exists with respect to investments in non-U.S. dollar denominated
fixed maturities, primarily euro, sterling and Canadian dollar denominated securities. The risk
associated with these securities relates to potential decreases in value resulting from unfavorable
changes in foreign exchange rates. The fair value of these fixed maturity securities at December
31, 2008 and 2007 was $864 and $972, respectively.

In order to manage its currency exposures, Property & Casualty enters into foreign currency swaps
and forward contracts to hedge the variability in cash flow associated with certain foreign
denominated securities. These foreign currency swap and forward agreements are structured to match
the foreign currency cash flows of the hedged foreign denominated securities. At December 31, 2008
and 2007, the derivatives used to hedge currency exchange risk had a total notional value of $775
and $428, respectively, and total fair value of $13 and ($43), respectively.

Based on the fair values of Property & Casualty’s non-U.S. dollar denominated securities and
derivative instruments as of December 31, 2008 and 2007, management estimates that a 10%
unfavorable change in exchange rates would decrease the fair values by an after-tax total of
approximately $42 and $37, respectively. The estimated impact was based upon a 10% change in
December 31 spot rates. The selection of the 10% unfavorable change was made only for illustration
of the potential hypothetical impact of such an event and should not be construed as a prediction
of future market events. Actual results could differ materially from those illustrated above due
to the nature of the estimates and assumptions used in the above analysis.



CAPITAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY

Capital resources and liquidity represent the overall financial strength of The Hartford and its
ability to generate strong cash flows from each of the business segments, borrow funds at
competitive rates and raise new capital to meet operating and growth needs.

Liquidity Requirements

The liquidity requirements of The Hartford have been and will continue to be met by funds from
operations as well as the issuance of commercial paper, common stock, debt or other capital
securities and borrowings from its contingent capital facility and credit facilities. Current and
expected patterns of claim frequency and severity may change from period to period but continue to
be within historical norms and, therefore, the Company’s current liquidity position is considered
to be sufficient to meet anticipated demands over the next twelve months. However, if an
unanticipated demand were placed on the Company it is likely that the Company would either sell
certain of its investments to fund claims which could result in larger than usual realized capital
gains and losses, would enter the capital markets to raise further funds to provide the requisite
liquidity or take other actions. For a discussion and tabular presentation of the Company’s
current contractual obligations by period including those related to its Life and Property &
Casualty insurance operations refer to the Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Aggregate Contractual
Obligations section below. Also see Item 1A, Risk Factors.

Sources of Capital

The Hartford endeavors to maintain a capital structure that provides financial and operational
flexibility to its insurance subsidiaries, ratings that support its competitive position in the
financial services marketplace (see the “Ratings” section below for further discussion), and strong
shareholder returns. As a result, the Company may from time to time raise capital from the
issuance of stock, debt or other capital securities and is continuously evaluating strategic
opportunities. The issuance of common stock, debt or other capital securities could result in the
dilution of shareholder interests or reduced net income due to additional interest expense.

The principal sources of operating funds are premiums and investment income, while investing cash
flows originate from maturities and sales of invested assets. The primary uses of funds are to pay
claims, policy benefits, operating expenses and commissions and to purchase new investments. In
addition, The Hartford holds a significant short-term investment position to meet liquidity needs.
As of December 31, 2008 and 2007, HFSG held total fixed maturity investments of $1.6 billion and
$457, respectively, of which $1.5 billion and $154 were short-term investments, respectively. The
funds are intended to be used for general corporate purposes, which may include the capital and
liquidity needs of our operations. For a discussion of the Company’s investment objectives and
strategies, see the Investments and Capital Markets Risk Management sections.

As of December 31, 2008, the Company’s key sources of liquidity included $11.8 billion of cash and
short-term investments (which includes securities with maturities of one year or less at the time
of purchase), of which $3.4 billion was collateral received from, and held on behalf of, derivative
counterparties and $341 was collateral pledged to derivative counterparties. The Company also held
$6.0 billion of treasury securities, of which $402 had been pledged to derivative counterparties.

On November 14, 2008, the Company announced that it applied to participate in the U.S. Treasury
Department’s Capital Purchase Program (“CPP”). In conjunction with this application, the Company
also applied to the Office of Thrift Supervision (“OTS”) to become a savings and loan holding
company and signed a merger agreement to acquire the parent company
of Federal Trust Bank (“FTB”), a
federally chartered, FDIC-insured savings bank. Federal Trust Bank is owned by Federal Trust
Corporation, a unitary thrift holding company headquartered in Sanford, Florida. The completion of
this acquisition will satisfy a key eligibility requirement for participation in the CPP. On
January 9, 2009, the Office of Thrift Supervision approved the Company’s application to become a
savings and loan holding company and on January 26, 2009, Federal Trust Corporation’s shareholders
approved the acquisition. The Company’s purchase of Federal Trust Corporation remains contingent on
the U.S. Treasury’s approval of the Company’s participation in the CPP. The Company estimates
that, if approved for participation in the CPP, it would be eligible for a capital purchase of
between $1.1 billion and $3.4 billion under existing Treasury guidelines. The final amount of
capital requested will be determined following approval by Treasury. Because the Company’s
application to participate in the CPP is subject to approval by the U.S. Treasury, there can be no
assurance that the Company will participate in the CPP or that it will not need to pursue alternate
sources of capital. In addition, if we consummate the acquisition of FTB, we have agreed with OTS to contribute
approximately $100 to the capital of FTB and to serve as a source of strength to FTB, which could
require the contribution of additional capital to FTB in the future.



HFSG and HLI are holding companies which rely upon operating cash flow in the form of dividends
from their subsidiaries, which enable them to service debt, pay dividends, and pay certain business
expenses. Dividends to the Company from its insurance subsidiaries are restricted. The payment of
dividends by Connecticut-domiciled insurers is limited under the insurance holding company laws of
Connecticut. These laws require notice to and approval by the state insurance commissioner for the
declaration or payment of any dividend, which, together with other dividends or distributions made
within the preceding twelve months, exceeds the greater of (i) 10% of the insurer’s policyholder
surplus as of December 31 of the preceding year or (ii) net income (or net gain from operations, if
such company is a life insurance company) for the twelve-month period ending on the thirty-first
day of December last preceding, in each case determined under statutory insurance accounting
principles. In addition, if any dividend of a Connecticut-domiciled insurer exceeds the insurer’s
earned surplus, it requires the prior approval of the Connecticut Insurance Commissioner. The
insurance holding company laws of the other jurisdictions in which The Hartford’s insurance
subsidiaries are incorporated (or deemed commercially domiciled) generally contain similar
(although in certain instances somewhat more restrictive) limitations on the payment of dividends.
It is estimated that the Company’s property-casualty insurance subsidiaries will be permitted to
pay up to a maximum of approximately $1.2 billion in dividends to HFSG in 2009 without prior
approval from the applicable insurance commissioner. Through at least October 30, 2009,
substantially all dividend payments from the Company’s property-casualty insurance subsidiaries
will be subject to prior approval of the Connecticut Insurance Commissioner due to extraordinary
dividend limitations under the insurance holding company laws of Connecticut. With respect to dividends to HLI, it is estimated that the Company’s life insurance subsidiaries’
non-extraordinary dividend limitation under the insurance holding company laws of Connecticut is approximately $631
in 2009. However, because the life insurance subsidiaries’
earned surplus is only approximately $597 as of
December 31, 2008, the Company’s life insurance
subsidiaries will be permitted to pay dividends up to this amount to HLI in 2009 without prior approval from the applicable insurance commissioner. In 2008, HFSG and HLI received a combined total of $2.8 billion from their insurance subsidiaries.

In June 2008, The Hartford’s Board of Directors authorized an incremental $1 billion stock
repurchase program which was in addition to the previously announced $2 billion program. The
Company’s repurchase authorization permits purchases of common stock, which may be in the open
market or through privately negotiated transactions. The Company also may enter into derivative
transactions to facilitate future repurchases of common stock. The timing of any future
repurchases will be dependent upon several factors, including the market price of the Company’s
securities, the Company’s capital position, consideration of the effect of any repurchases on the
Company’s financial strength or credit ratings, the Company’s potential participation in the CPP,
and other corporate considerations. The repurchase program may be modified, extended or terminated
by the Board of Directors at any time. As of December 31, 2008, The Hartford has completed the $2
billion stock repurchase program and has $807 remaining for stock repurchase under the $1 billion
repurchase program. For further discussion of common stock acquired in 2008, refer to the
Stockholders’ Equity section below.

Shelf Registrations

On April 11, 2007, The Hartford filed an automatic shelf registration statement (Registration No.
333-142044) for the potential offering and sale of debt and equity securities with the Securities
and Exchange Commission. The registration statement allows for the following types of securities
to be offered: (i) debt securities, preferred stock, common stock, depositary shares, warrants,
stock purchase contracts, stock purchase units and junior subordinated deferrable interest
debentures of the Company, and (ii) preferred securities of any of one or more capital trusts
organized by The Hartford (“The Hartford Trusts”). The Company may enter into guarantees with
respect to the preferred securities of any of The Hartford Trusts. In that The Hartford is a
well-known seasoned issuer, as defined in Rule 405 under the Securities Act of 1933, the
registration statement went effective immediately upon filing and The Hartford may offer and sell
an unlimited amount of securities under the registration statement during the three-year life of
the shelf.

Contingent Capital Facility

On February 12, 2007, The Hartford entered into a put option agreement (the “Put Option Agreement”)
with Glen Meadow ABC Trust, a Delaware statutory trust (the “ABC Trust”), and LaSalle Bank National
Association, as put option calculation agent. The Put Option Agreement provides The Hartford with
the right to require the ABC Trust, at any time and from time to time, to purchase The Hartford’s
junior subordinated notes (the “Notes”) in a maximum aggregate principal amount not to exceed $500.
Under the Put Option Agreement, The Hartford will pay the ABC Trust premiums on a periodic basis,
calculated with respect to the aggregate principal amount of Notes that The Hartford had the right
to put to the ABC Trust for such period. The Hartford has agreed to reimburse the ABC Trust for
certain fees and ordinary expenses. The Company holds a variable interest in the ABC Trust where
the Company is not the primary beneficiary. As a result, the Company did not consolidate the ABC
Trust, as they did not meet the consolidation requirements under FASB Interpretation No. 46
(revised December 2003), “Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, an interpretation of ARB No.
51” (“FIN 46(R)”).

As of December 31, 2008 and 2007, the Company’s Japanese operation line of credit in yen was
¥5 billion.

The revolving credit facility provides for up to $1.9 billion of unsecured credit, which excludes a
$100 commitment from an affiliate of Lehman Brothers. Of the total availability under the revolving
credit facility, up to $100 is available to support letters of credit issued on behalf of The
Hartford or other subsidiaries of The Hartford. Under the revolving credit facility, the Company
must maintain a minimum level of consolidated net worth. In addition, the Company must not exceed
a maximum ratio of debt to capitalization. Quarterly, the Company certifies compliance with the
financial covenants for the syndicate of participating financial institutions. As of December 31,
2008, the Company was in compliance with all such covenants.

The Federal Reserve Board authorized the Commercial Paper Funding Facility (“CPFF”) on October 7,
2008 under Section 13(3) of the Federal Reserve Act to provide a liquidity backstop to U.S. issuers
of commercial paper. The CPFF is intended to improve liquidity in short-term funding markets by
increasing the availability of term commercial paper funding to issuers and by providing greater
assurance to both issuers and investors that firms will be able to roll over their maturing
commercial paper.

The Company registered with the CPFF in order to sell up to a maximum of $375 to the facility of
which it has issued the full amount as of December 31, 2008. The Company’s commercial paper must
be rated A-1/P-1/F1 by at least two ratings agencies to be eligible for the program. Moody’s, S&P
and Fitch all recently downgraded our commercial paper rating, rendering the Company ineligible to
sell additional commercial paper under the CPFF program going forward. As a result, we will be
required to pay the maturing commercial paper issued under the CPFF program from existing sources
of liquidity.

While The Hartford’s maximum borrowings available under its commercial paper program are $2.0
billion, which includes the $375 from the CPFF, the Company is dependent upon market conditions,
including recent market conditions, to finance the remaining available commercial paper with
investors.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Aggregate Contractual Obligations

The Company does not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that are reasonably likely to have a
material effect on the financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, or capital resources
of the Company, except for the contingent capital facility described above and the following:

•

The Company has unfunded commitments to purchase investments in limited partnerships,
mortgage and construction loans of about $1.1 billion as disclosed in Note 12 of Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements.

•

Warrants issued to Allianz to purchase 34,806,452 shares of the Company’s common stock,
classified at issuance in equity at a fair value of $276. See Note 21 of Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements.

The following points are significant to understanding the cash flows estimated for
obligations under property and casualty contracts:

•

Reserves for Property & Casualty unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses include case
reserves for reported claims and reserves for claims incurred but not reported (IBNR).
While payments due on claim reserves are considered contractual obligations because they
relate to insurance policies issued by the Company, the ultimate amount to be paid to
settle both case reserves and IBNR is an estimate, subject to significant uncertainty. The
actual amount to be paid is not finally determined until the Company reaches a settlement
with the claimant. Final claim settlements may vary significantly from the present
estimates, particularly since many claims will not be settled until well into the future.

•

In estimating the timing of future payments by year, the Company has assumed that its
historical payment patterns will continue. However, the actual timing of future payments
could vary materially from these estimates due to, among other things, changes in claim
reporting and payment patterns and large unanticipated settlements. In particular, there
is significant uncertainty over the claim payment patterns of asbestos and environmental
claims. Also, estimated payments in 2009 do not include payments that will be made on
claims incurred in 2009 on policies that were in force as of December 31, 2008. In
addition, the table does not include future cash flows related to the receipt of premiums
that may be used, in part, to fund loss payments.

•

Under U.S. GAAP, the Company is only permitted to discount reserves for losses and loss
adjustment expenses in cases where the payment pattern and ultimate loss costs are fixed
and determinable on an individual claim basis. For the Company, these include claim
settlements with permanently disabled claimants. As of December 31, 2008, the total
property and casualty reserves in the above table are gross of a reserve discount of $488.

[2]

Estimated life, annuity and disability obligations include death and disability claims,
policy surrenders, policyholder dividends and trail commissions offset by expected future
deposits and premiums on in-force contracts. Estimated life, annuity and disability
obligations are based on mortality, morbidity and lapse assumptions comparable with Life’s
historical experience, modified for recent observed trends. Life has also assumed market
growth and interest crediting consistent with assumptions used in amortizing deferred
acquisition costs. In contrast to this table, the majority of Life’s obligations are recorded
on the balance sheet at the current account values and do not incorporate an expectation of
future market growth, interest crediting, or future deposits. Therefore, the estimated
obligations presented in this table significantly exceed the liabilities recorded in reserve
for future policy benefits and unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses, other policyholder
funds and benefits payable and separate account liabilities. Due to the significance of the
assumptions used, the amounts presented could materially differ from actual results.

[3]

Includes future minimum lease payments on operating and capital lease agreements. See Notes
12 and 14 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion on lease
commitments.

[4]

Includes contractual principal and interest payments. All long-term debt obligations have
fixed rates of interest. See Note 14 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for
additional discussion of long-term debt obligations.

[5]

Consumer notes include principal payments and contractual interest for fixed rate notes and
interest based on current rates for floating rate notes and the market value of embedded
derivatives for equity-linked notes. See Note 14 of Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements for additional discussion of consumer notes.

[6]

Includes $1.1 billion in commitments to purchase investments including about $1.0 billion of
limited partnership and $99 of mortgage and construction loans. Outstanding commitments under
these limited partnerships and mortgage and construction loans are included in payments due in
less than 1 year since the timing of funding these commitments cannot be reliably estimated.
The remaining commitments to purchase investments primarily represent payables for securities
purchased which are reflected on the Company’s consolidated balance sheet.

Also included in purchase obligations is $695 relating to contractual commitments to purchase
various goods and services such as maintenance, human resources, information technology, and
transportation in the normal course of business. Purchase obligations exclude contracts that are
cancelable without penalty or contracts that do not specify minimum levels of goods or services
to be purchased.

[7]

Includes cash collateral of $6.3 billion which the Company has accepted in connection with
the Company’s securities lending program and derivative instruments. Since the timing of the
return of the collateral is uncertain, the return of the collateral has been included in the
payments due in less than 1 year.

Also included in other long term liabilities is $91 of net unrecognized tax benefits related to
Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation No 48, “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income
Taxes” (“FIN 48”). See Note 13 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional
discussion of FIN 48.

[8]

Does not include estimated voluntary contribution of $200 to the Company’s pension plan in
2009.



Pension Plans and Other Postretirement Benefits

While the Company has significant discretion in making voluntary contributions to the U. S.
qualified defined benefit pension plan, the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as
amended by the Pension Protection Act of 2006 and further amended by the Worker, Retiree, and
Employer Recovery Act of 2008, and Internal Revenue Code regulations mandate minimum contributions
in certain circumstances. The Company made contributions to its pension plans of $2, $158, and
$402 in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively, and contributions to its other postretirement plans of
$46 in 2007. No contributions were made to the other postretirement plans in 2008 and 2006. The
Company’s 2008 required minimum funding contribution was immaterial. The Company presently
anticipates contributing approximately $200 to its pension plans and other postretirement plans in
2009, based upon certain economic and business assumptions. These assumptions include, but are not
limited to, equity market performance, changes in interest rates and the Company’s other capital
requirements. The Company does not have a required minimum funding contribution for the U.S.
qualified defined benefit pension plan for 2009 and the funding requirements for all of the pension
plans are expected to be immaterial.

Capitalization

The capital structure of The Hartford as of December 31, 2008 and 2007 consisted of debt and
equity, summarized as follows:

Total debt of the Company excludes $1.2 billion and $809 of consumer notes as of December 31,
2008 and 2007, respectively.

The Hartford’s total capitalization as of December 31, 2008 decreased $8.2 billion, or 35%, as
compared with December 31, 2007 primarily due to the following:

AOCI, net of tax

•

Decreased $6.7 billion primarily due to increases in unrealized losses on securities of $7.1 billion.

Equity excluding
AOCI, net of tax

•

Decreased $3.3 billion primarily due to a net loss of $2.7 billion, dividends declared of $598 and
treasury stock acquired of $1.0 billion in connection with the Company’s stock purchase program. These
decreases were offset by $967 from the issuance of preferred shares and warrants to purchase preferred
shares to Allianz.

Total Debt

•

The Hartford’s debt increased $1.7 billion or 38% primarily due to the issuance of $500 in 8.125%
junior subordinated debentures in June 2008 and $1.75 billion in 10% junior subordinated debentures issued
in October 2008. The $1.75 billion in 10% junior subordinated debentures relate to Allianz’s investment in
The Hartford, and include warrants of $547, which reduced the carrying value of the debt.



Investment by Allianz SE in The Hartford

In order to strengthen its capital and liquidity position, the Company on October 17, 2008 closed
on a $2.5 billion investment by Allianz SE (“Allianz”). Allianz purchased $1.75 billion of the
Company’s 10% Fixed-to-Floating Rate Junior Subordinated Debentures due 2068, and $750 of the
Company’s Series D Non-Voting Contingent Convertible Preferred Stock (the “Convertible Preferred”)
initially convertible into 24,193,548 shares of the Company’s common stock (the “Common Stock”),
upon receipt of applicable approvals, at an issue price of $31.00 per share of Common Stock.
Allianz additionally received warrants to purchase an aggregate of $1.75 billion of the Company’s
Series B and Series C Convertible Preferred at an initial exercise price of $25.32 per share.
Conversion of the Convertible Preferred referred to above into Common Stock is subject to receipt
of certain governmental and regulatory approvals and, in the case of the Series C Convertible
Preferred, to the approval of the Company’s stockholders in accordance with the rules of the New
York Stock Exchange. For further detail about the Allianz investment in The Hartford, see Note 21
of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

The Company has also agreed that, for the one-year period following October 17, 2008, it will pay
certain amounts to Allianz if the Company effects or agrees to effect any transaction (or series of
transactions) pursuant to which any person or group (within the meaning of the U.S. federal
securities laws) is issued common stock or certain equity-related instruments constituting more
than 5% of the Company’s fully-diluted common stock outstanding at the time for an effective price
per share (determined as provided in the Investment Agreement) of less than $25.32. Amounts so
payable depend on the effective price for the applicable transaction (or the weighted average price
for a series of transactions) and range from $50 if the effective price per share is between $25.31
and $23.00, $150 if the effective price per share is between $22.99 and $20.00, $200 if the
effective price per share is between $19.99 and $15.00 and $300 if the effective price per share is
$14.99 or less.

In addition to the receipt of specified regulatory approvals, the conversion into 34,308,872 shares
of common stock of the Series C Preferred Stock underlying certain of the Warrants is subject to
the approval of the Company’s stockholders in accordance with applicable regulations of the New
York Stock Exchange. Under the Investment Agreement, the Company is obligated to pay Allianz $75 if
such stockholder approval is not obtained at the first stockholder meeting to consider such
approval, and $50 if such stockholder approval is not obtained at a second such meeting. Because
the conversion of the Series C Preferred Stock is subject to stockholder approval and the related
payment provision represents a form of net cash settlement outside the Company’s control, the
Warrants to purchase the Series C Preferred Stock and the stockholder approval payment were
recorded as a derivative liability at a relative fair value of $273 at issuance. As of December
31, 2008, the Warrants to purchase the Series C Preferred Stock had a fair value of $163. The
Company recognized a gain of $110, after-tax, for the year ended December 31, 2008, representing
the change in fair value of the Warrants to purchase the Series C Preferred Stock.

Debt

The following discussion describes the Company’s debt financing activities for 2008. For
additional information regarding debt including Allianz’s investment in The Hartford, see Notes 14
and 21 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Senior Notes

On November 16, 2008, The Hartford repaid its $330, 5.663% senior notes at maturity.

On November 1, 2008, The Hartford repaid its $200, 6.375% senior notes at maturity.

On August 16, 2008, The Hartford repaid its $425, 5.55% senior notes at maturity.

On May 12, 2008, The Hartford issued $500 of 6.0% senior notes due January 15, 2019. The issuance
was made pursuant to the Company’s shelf registration statement (Registration No. 333-142044).

On March 4, 2008, The Hartford issued $500 of 6.3% senior notes due March 15, 2018. The issuance
was made pursuant to the Company’s shelf registration statement (Registration No. 333-142044).

HFSG used the majority of the proceeds from the total $1 billion in issuances of senior notes to
repay its $425 5.55% notes at maturity on August 16, 2008, to repay its $200 6.375% notes at
maturity on November 1, 2008 and $330 5.663% notes at maturity on November 16, 2008.



Junior Subordinated Debentures

On June 6, 2008, the Company issued $500 aggregate principal amount of 8.125% fixed-to-floating
rate junior subordinated debentures (the “debentures”) due June 15, 2068 for net proceeds of
approximately $493, after deducting underwriting discounts and expenses from the offering. The
debentures bear interest at an annual fixed rate of 8.125% from the date of issuance to, but
excluding, June 15, 2018, payable semi-annually in arrears on June 15 and December 15. From and
including June 15, 2018, the debentures will bear interest at an annual rate, reset quarterly,
equal to three-month LIBOR plus 4.6025%, payable quarterly in arrears on March 15, June 15,
September 15 and December 15 of each year. The Company has the right, on one or more occasions, to
defer the payment of interest on the debentures. The Company may defer interest for up to ten
consecutive years without giving rise to an event of default. Deferred interest will accumulate
additional interest at an annual rate equal to the annual interest rate then applicable to the
debentures. If the Company defers interest for five consecutive years or, if earlier, pays current
interest during a deferral period, which may be paid from any source of funds, the Company will be
required to pay deferred interest from proceeds from the sale of certain qualifying securities.

The debentures carry a scheduled maturity date of June 15, 2038 and a final maturity date of June
15, 2068. During the 180-day period ending on a notice date not more than fifteen and not less than
ten business days prior to the scheduled maturity date, the Company is required to use commercially
reasonable efforts to sell certain qualifying replacement securities sufficient to permit repayment
of the debentures at the scheduled maturity date. If any debentures remain outstanding after the
scheduled maturity date, the unpaid amount will remain outstanding until the Company has raised
sufficient proceeds from the sale of qualifying replacement securities to permit the repayment in
full of the debentures. If there are remaining debentures at the final maturity date, the Company
is required to redeem the debentures using any source of funds.

Subject to the replacement capital covenant described below, the Company can redeem the debentures
at its option, in whole or in part, at any time on or after June 15, 2018 at a redemption price of
100% of the principal amount being redeemed plus accrued but unpaid interest. The Company can
redeem the debentures at its option prior to June 15, 2018 (a) in whole at any time or in part from
time to time or (b) in whole, but not in part, in the event of certain tax or rating agency events
relating to the debentures, at a redemption price equal to the greater of 100% of the principal
amount being redeemed and the applicable make-whole amount, in each case plus any accrued and
unpaid interest.

In connection with the offering of the debentures, the Company entered into a “replacement capital
covenant” for the benefit of holders of one or more designated series of the Company’s
indebtedness, initially the Company’s 6.1% notes due 2041. Under the terms of the replacement
capital covenant, if the Company redeems the debentures at any time prior to June 15, 2048 it can
only do so with the proceeds from the sale of certain qualifying replacement securities.

For a discussion of the 10.0% junior subordinated debentures from the investment of Allianz SE in
The Hartford, see Note 21.

Capital Lease Obligations

The Company recorded capital leases of $92 and $128 in 2008 and 2007, respectively. Capital lease
obligations are included in long-term debt, except for the current maturities, which are included
in short-term debt, in the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2008 and 2007,
respectively. See Note 12 for further information on capital lease commitments.

Consumer Notes

Institutional began issuing consumer notes through its Retail Investor Notes Program in September
2006. A consumer note is an investment product distributed through broker-dealers directly to
retail investors as medium-term, publicly traded fixed or floating rate, or a combination of fixed
and floating rate, notes. Consumer notes are part of the Company’s spread-based business and
proceeds are used to purchase investment products, primarily fixed rate bonds. Proceeds are not
used for general operating purposes. Consumer notes maturities may extend up to 30 years and have
contractual coupons based upon varying interest rates or indexes (e.g. consumer price index) and
may include a call provision that allows the Company to extinguish the notes prior to its scheduled
maturity date. Certain Consumer notes may be redeemed by the holder in the event of death.
Redemptions are subject to certain limitations, including calendar year aggregate and individual
limits. The aggregate limit is equal to the greater of $1 or 1% of the aggregate principal amount
of the notes as of the end of the prior year. The individual limit is $250 thousand per
individual. Derivative instruments are utilized to hedge the Company’s exposure to market risk in
accordance with Company policy.

As of December 31, 2008 and 2007, $1,210 and $809, respectively, of consumer notes were
outstanding. As of December 31, 2008, these consumer notes have interest rates ranging from 4.0%
to 6.3% for fixed notes and, for variable notes, based on December 31, 2008 rates, notes indexed to
the consumer price index plus 80 to 267 basis points, or indexed to the S&P 500, Dow Jones
Industrials, foreign currency, or the Nikkei 225. The aggregate maturities of consumer notes are
as follows: $11 in 2009, $30 in 2010, $131 in 2011, $291 in 2012 and $751 thereafter. For 2008 and
2007, interest credited to holders of consumer notes was $59 and $11, respectively. During 2008,
the Company made the decision to discontinue future issuances of consumer notes, this decision does
not impact consumer notes currently outstanding.



Stockholders’ Equity

Preferred stock

— On October 17, 2008, the Company issued in a private placement to Allianz SE,
6,048,387 shares of the Company’s Series D non-voting contingent convertible preferred stock.
Effective January 9, 2009, Allianz SE converted the preferred shares into 24.2 million shares of
common stock.

Treasury stock acquired

— For the year ended December 31, 2008, The Hartford repurchased $1.0
billion of its common stock (14.7 million shares), of which $500 (7.3 million shares) were
repurchased under an accelerated share repurchase transaction described below. For additional
information regarding the share repurchase program, see the Liquidity Requirements section above.

On June 4, 2008, the Company entered into a collared accelerated share repurchase agreement (“ASR”)
with a major financial institution. Under the terms of the agreement, The Hartford paid $500 and
received 7.3 million shares. The Company has accounted for this transaction in accordance with
EITF Issue No. 99-7, “Accounting for an Accelerated Share Repurchase Program.”

Dividends

— The Hartford declared $598 and paid $660 in dividends to shareholders in 2008 and
declared $643 and paid $636 in dividends to shareholders in 2007.

On February 10, 2009, The Hartford’s Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.05 per
share payable on April 1, 2009 to shareholders of record as of March 2, 2009.

AOCI

— AOCI, net of tax, decreased by $6.7 billion as of December 31, 2008 compared with December
31, 2007. The decrease in AOCI, net of tax, includes unrealized losses on securities of $7.1
billion, primarily due to widening credit spreads associated with fixed maturities, partially
offset by gains on cash-flow hedging instruments of $784, change in foreign currency translation
adjustments of $196, and pension and other postretirement plan adjustments of $(515). Because The
Hartford’s investment portfolio has a duration of approximately 5 years, a 100 basis point parallel
movement in rates would result in approximately a 5% change in fair value. Movements in short-term
interest rates without corresponding changes in long-term rates will impact the fair value of our
fixed maturities to a lesser extent than parallel interest rate movements.

For additional information on stockholders’ equity, AOCI, net of tax, pension and other
postretirement plans and Allianz’s investment in The Hartford see Notes 15, 16, 17 and 21,
respectively, of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Year ended December 31, 2008 compared to the year ended December 31, 2007

The decrease in cash from operating activities compared to prior year period was primarily the
result of a decrease in net investment income as a result of lower yields and reduced fee income as
a result of declines in equity markets. Net purchases of available-for-sale securities continue to
account for the majority of cash used for investing activities. Cash from financing activities
increased primarily due to $2.5 billion in investment in The Hartford by Allianz SE, increased
transfers from the separate account to the general account for investment and universal life-type
contracts and net issuances of long-term debt and consumer notes, offset by treasury stock acquired
and dividends paid.

Year ended December 31, 2007 compared to the year ended December 31, 2006

The increase in cash from operating activities compared to prior year period was primarily the
result of premium cash flows in excess of claim payments, partially offset by increases in taxes
paid. Net purchases of available-for-sale securities accounted for the majority of cash used for
investing activities. Cash from financing activities decreased primarily due to treasury stock
acquired and increases in dividends paid; partially offset by higher net receipts from
policyholder’s accounts related to investment and universal life contracts, proceeds from consumer
notes, and issuance of long-term debt, net of repayments.

Operating cash flows in each of the last three years have been adequate to meet liquidity
requirements.

Equity Markets

For a discussion of the potential impact of the equity markets on capital and liquidity, see
“Ratings” below.



Ratings

Ratings are an important factor in establishing the competitive position in the insurance and
financial services marketplace. There can be no assurance that the Company’s ratings will continue
for any given period of time or that they will not be changed. In the event the Company’s ratings
are downgraded, the level of revenues or the persistency of the Company’s business may be adversely
impacted.

On December 23, 2008, A.M. Best affirmed the financial strength rating of A+ of the key life and
property/casualty subsidiaries and downgraded the senior debt ratings to a- from a. The outlook
assigned to the ratings is negative.

On February 6, 2009, Moody’s downgraded the senior debt ratings to Baa1 from A3 and the insurance
financial strength ratings for the Company’s lead property and casualty and life insurance
operating companies to A1 from Aa3. The ratings outlook is negative.

On February 9, 2009, S&P lowered its debt rating on The Hartford Financial Services Group Inc. to
A- from A. At the same time, it placed all ratings, including the financial strength ratings, on
credit watch with negative implications.

On February 9, 2009, Fitch Ratings downgraded the senior debt ratings to BBB from A-. Fitch also
downgraded the insurer financial strength ratings of our primary life insurance subsidiaries to A
from AA- and property/casualty insurance subsidiaries to A+ from AA-. The ratings outlook is
negative.

These ratings are not a recommendation to buy or hold any of The Hartford’s securities and they may
be revised or revoked at any time at the sole discretion of the rating organization.

The agencies consider many factors in determining the final rating of an insurance company. One
consideration is the relative level of statutory surplus necessary to support the business written.
Statutory surplus represents the capital of the insurance company reported in accordance with
accounting practices prescribed by the applicable state insurance department.



The table below sets forth statutory surplus for the Company’s insurance companies. The statutory
surplus amounts as of December 31, 2007 in the table below are based on actual statutory filings
with the applicable regulatory authorities. The statutory surplus amounts as of December 31, 2008
are estimates, as the respective 2008 statutory filings have not yet been made.

The Company has received approval from the Connecticut Insurance Department regarding the use of
two permitted practices in the statutory financial statements of its Connecticut-domiciled life
insurance subsidiaries as of December 31, 2008. The first permitted practice relates to the
statutory accounting for deferred income taxes. Specifically, this
permitted practice modifies
the accounting for deferred income taxes prescribed by the NAIC by increasing the realization
period for deferred tax assets from one year to three years and increasing the asset recognition
limit from 10% to 15% of adjusted statutory capital and surplus. The benefits of this permitted
practice may not be considered by the Company when determining surplus available for dividends.
The second permitted practice relates to the statutory reserving requirements for variable
annuities with guaranteed living benefit riders. Actuarial guidelines prescribed by the NAIC
require a stand-alone asset adequacy analysis reflecting only benefits, expenses and charges that
are associated with the riders for variable annuities with guaranteed living benefits. The
permitted practice allows for all benefits, expenses and charges associated with the variable
annuity contract to be reflected in the stand-alone asset adequacy test. These permitted practices
resulted in an increase to Life operations estimated statutory surplus of $987 as of December 31,
2008. The effects of these permitted practices are included in the 2008 Life operations surplus
amount in the table above.

Statutory Capital

The
Company’s stockholders’ equity, as prepared using U.S. GAAP was $9.3 billion as of December 31,
2008. The Company’s estimated aggregate statutory capital and surplus, as prepared in accordance
with the National Association of Insurance Commissioners’ Accounting Practices and Procedures
Manual (“US STAT”) was $13.8 billion as of December 31, 2008. Significant differences between U.S.
GAAP stockholders’ equity and aggregate statutory capital and surplus prepared in accordance with
US STAT include the following:

•

Costs incurred by the Company to acquire insurance policies are deferred under U.S. GAAP
while those costs are expensed immediately under US STAT.

•

Temporary differences between the book and tax basis of an asset or liability which are
recorded as deferred tax assets are evaluated for recoverability under U.S. GAAP while those
amounts deferred are subject to limitations under US STAT.

•

Certain assumptions used in the determination of Life benefit reserves are prescribed under US Stat and are
intended to be conservative, while the assumptions used under U.S. GAAP are generally the Company’s best
estimates. In addition, the methodologies used for determining life reserve amounts are different between US Stat
and U.S. GAAP. Annuity reserving and cash-flow testing for death and living benefit reserves under US STAT are
generally addressed by the Commissioners’ Annuity Reserving Valuation Methodology and the related Actuarial
Guidelines. Under these Actuarial Guidelines, in general, future cash flows associated with the variable annuity
business are included in these methodologies with estimates of future fee revenues, claim payments, expenses,
reinsurance impacts and hedging impacts. At December 31, 2008, in determining the cash-flow impacts related to
future hedging, assumptions were made in the scenarios that generate reserve requirements, about the potential
future decreases in the hedge benefits and increases in hedge costs which resulted in increased reserve
requirements. Reserves for death and living benefits under U.S. GAAP are either considered embedded derivatives
and recorded at fair value or they may be considered SOP 03-1 reserves.

•

The difference between the amortized cost and fair value of fixed maturity and other
investments, net of tax, is recorded as an increase or decrease to the carrying value of the
related asset and to equity under U.S. GAAP, while US STAT only records certain securities at
fair value, such as equity securities and certain lower rated bonds required by the NAIC to be
recorded at the lower of amortized cost or fair value. In the case of the Company’s market value adjusted (MVA) fixed annuity products, invested assets
are marked to fair value (including the impact of credit spreads) and liabilities are marked to
fair value (but generally actual credit spreads are not fully reflected) for statutory purposes only.

•

US STAT for life insurance companies establishes a formula reserve for realized and
unrealized losses due to default and equity risks associated with certain invested assets (the
Asset Valuation Reserve), while U.S. GAAP does not. Also, for those realized gains and losses
caused by changes in interest rates, US STAT for life insurance companies defers and amortizes
the gains and losses, caused by changes in interest rates, into income over the original life
to maturity of the asset sold (the Interest Maintenance Reserve) while U.S. GAAP does not.

•

Goodwill arising from the acquisition of a business is tested for recoverability on an
annual basis (or more frequently, as necessary) for U.S. GAAP, while under US STAT goodwill is
amortized over a period not to exceed 10 years and the amount of goodwill is limited.

In addition, certain assets, including a portion of premiums receivable and fixed assets, are
non-admitted (recorded at zero value and charged against surplus) under US STAT. U.S. GAAP
generally evaluates assets based on their recoverability.



Risk-Based Capital

State insurance regulators and the NAIC have adopted risk-based capital requirements for life
insurance companies to evaluate the adequacy of statutory capital and surplus in relation to
investment and insurance risks. The requirements provide a means of measuring
the minimum amount of statutory surplus appropriate for an insurance company to support its overall
business operations based on its size and risk profile.

A company’s risk-based statutory surplus is calculated by applying factors and performing
calculations relating to various asset, premium, claim, expense and reserve items. Regulators can
then measure the adequacy of a company’s statutory surplus by comparing it to the risk-based
capital (“RBC”). Under RBC requirements, regulatory compliance is determined by the ratio of a
company’s total adjusted capital, as defined by the insurance regulators, to its company action
level of RBC (known as the RBC ratio), also as defined by insurance regulators. In addition, the
rating agencies view RBC ratios along with their proprietary models as key factors in making
ratings determinations.

Sensitivity

In any particular year, statutory surplus amounts and RBC ratios may increase or decrease depending
upon a variety of factors. The amount of change in the statutory surplus or RBC ratios can vary
based on individual factors and may be compounded in extreme scenarios or if multiple factors occur
at the same time. At times the impact of changes in certain market factors or a combination of
multiple factors on RBC ratios can be varied and in some instances counterintuitive. Factors
include:

•

In general, as equity market levels decline, our reserves for death and living benefit
guarantees associated with variable annuity contracts increases, sometimes at a greater than
linear rate, reducing statutory surplus levels. In addition, as equity market levels
increase, generally surplus levels will increase. RBC ratios will also tend to increase when
equity markets increase. However, as a result of a number of factors and market conditions,
including the level of hedging costs and other risk transfer activities, reserve requirements
for death and living benefit guarantees and RBC requirements could increase resulting in lower
RBC ratios.

•

As the value of certain fixed-income and equity securities in our investment portfolio
decreases, due in part to credit spread widening, statutory surplus and RBC ratios may
decrease.

•

As the value of certain derivative instruments that do not get hedge accounting decreases,
statutory surplus and RBC ratios may decrease.

•

Life’s exposure to foreign currency exchange risk exists with respect to non-U.S. dollar
denominated assets and liabilities. Assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies
are accounted for at their U.S. dollar equivalent values using exchange rates at the balance
sheet date. As foreign currency exchange rates strengthen in comparison to the U.S. dollar,
the remeasured value of those non-dollar denominated assets or liabilities will increase
causing an increase or decrease to statutory surplus, respectively.

•

Our statutory surplus is also impacted by widening credit spreads as a result of the
accounting for the assets and liabilities in our fixed market value adjusted (“MVA”)
annuities. Statutory separate account assets supporting the fixed MVA annuities are recorded
at fair value. In determining the statutory reserve for the fixed MVA annuities, we are
required to use current crediting rates in the U.S. and Japanese LIBOR in Japan. In many
capital market scenarios, current crediting rates in the U.S. are highly correlated with
market rates implicit in the fair value of statutory separate account assets. As a result,
the change in statutory reserve from period to period will likely substantially offset the
change in the fair value of the statutory separate account assets. However, in periods of
volatile credit markets, such as we are now experiencing, actual credit spreads on investment
assets may increase sharply for certain sub-sectors of the overall credit market, resulting in
statutory separate account asset market value losses. As actual credit spreads are not fully
reflected in the current crediting rates in the U.S. or Japanese LIBOR in Japan, the
calculation of statutory reserves will not substantially offset the change in fair value of
the statutory separate account assets resulting in reductions in statutory surplus and create
funding obligations to the statutory separate account.

Most of these factors are outside of the Company’s control. The Company’s financial strength and
credit ratings are significantly influenced by the statutory surplus amounts and RBC ratios of our
insurance company subsidiaries. Due to all of these factors, projecting
statutory capital and the related projected RBC ratios is complex.
In addition, rating agencies may implement changes to their
internal models that have the effect of increasing or decreasing the amount of statutory capital we
must hold in order to maintain our current ratings.

The Company has reinsured approximately 27% of its risk associated with GMWB and 44% of its risk
associated with the aggregate GMDB exposure. These reinsurance agreements serve to reduce the
Company’s exposure to changes in the statutory reserves and the related capital and RBC ratios
associated with changes in the equity markets. The Company also continues to explore other
solutions for mitigating the capital market risk effect on surplus, such as internal and external
reinsurance solutions, migrating towards a more statutory based hedging program, changes in product
design, increasing pricing and expense management.



Statutory capital at the Property & Casualty subsidiaries has historically been maintained at or
above the capital level required to meet “AA level” ratings from rating agencies. Statutory
capital generated by the Property & Casualty subsidiaries in excess of the capital level required
to meet “AA level” ratings is available for use by the enterprise or for corporate purposes,
subject to regulatory dividend limitations. The amount of statutory capital can increase or
decrease depending on a number of factors affecting Property & Casualty results including, among
other factors, the level of catastrophe claims incurred, the amount of reserve development, the
effect of changes in interest rates on investment income and the discounting of loss reserves, and
the effect of realized gains and losses on investments.

In addition, the Company can access the $500 Glen Meadow trust contingent capital facility,
maintains the ability to access $1.9 billion of capacity under its revolving credit facility and
has been approved by the U.S. Office of Thrift Supervision to acquire Federal Trust Bank which may
provide access, if granted, to funds under the U.S. Treasury’s Capital Purchase Program.

Legislative Initiatives

For a discussion of terrorism reinsurance legislation and how it affects The Hartford, see the
“Risk Management Strategy-Terrorism” under the Property & Casualty section of the MD&A.

Tax proposals, proposals related to the CPP and regulatory initiatives which have been or are being
considered by Congress and/or the United States Treasury Department could have a material effect on
the insurance business. These proposals and initiatives include, or could include, changes
pertaining to the income tax treatment of insurance companies and life insurance products and
annuities, repeal or reform of the estate tax and comprehensive federal tax reform. The nature and
timing of any Congressional or regulatory action with respect to any such efforts is unclear.

Guaranty Fund and Other Insurance-related Assessments

In all states, insurers licensed to transact certain classes of insurance are required to become
members of a guaranty fund. In most states, in the event of the insolvency of an insurer writing
any such class of insurance in the state, members of the funds are assessed to pay certain claims
of the insolvent insurer. A particular state’s fund assesses its members based on their respective
written premiums in the state for the classes of insurance in which the insolvent insurer was
engaged. Assessments are generally limited for any year to one or two percent of premiums written
per year depending on the state.

The Hartford accounts for guaranty fund and other insurance assessments in accordance with
Statement of Position No. 97-3, “Accounting by Insurance and Other Enterprises for
Insurance-Related Assessments”. Liabilities for guaranty fund and other insurance-related
assessments are accrued when an assessment is probable, when it can be reasonably estimated, and
when the event obligating the Company to pay an imposed or probable assessment has occurred.
Liabilities for guaranty funds and other insurance-related assessments are not discounted and are
included as part of other liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of December 31, 2008
and 2007, the liability balance was $128 and $147, respectively. As of December 31, 2008 and 2007,
$17 and $19, respectively, related to premium tax offsets were included in other assets.

Item 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures

The Company’s principal executive officer and its principal financial officer, based on their
evaluation of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rule
13a-15(e)), have concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures are effective for
the purposes set forth in the definition thereof in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(e) as of December 31,
2008.

Management’s annual report on internal control over financial reporting

The management of The Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc. and its subsidiaries (“The Hartford”)
is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting
for The Hartford as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable
assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial
statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes policies and
procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and
fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide
reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, and
that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations
of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding
prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the company’s
assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or
detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are
subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that
the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

The Hartford’s management assessed its internal controls over financial reporting as of December
31, 2008 in relation to criteria for effective internal control over financial reporting described
in “Internal Control – Integrated Framework” issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of
the Treadway Commission. Based on this assessment under those criteria, The Hartford’s management
concluded that its internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2008.

Attestation report of the Company’s registered public accounting firm

The Hartford’s independent registered public accounting firm, Deloitte & Touche LLP, has issued
their attestation report on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting which is set
forth below.



REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of

The Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc.

Hartford, Connecticut

We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of The Hartford Financial Services
Group, Inc. and its subsidiaries (collectively, the “Company”) as of December 31, 2008, based on
the criteria established in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. The Company’s management is responsible for
maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the
effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was
maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal
control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and
evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk,
and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe
that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the
supervision of, the company’s principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons
performing similar functions, and effected by the company’s board of directors, management, and
other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting
and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes
those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable
detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit
preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles,
and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with
authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance
regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the
possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to
error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.  Also, projections of any
evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods
are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions,
or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over
financial reporting as of December 31, 2008, based on the criteria established in

Internal
Control—Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission.

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States), the consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedules as
of and for the year ended December 31, 2008 of the Company and
our report, dated February 11, 2009,
expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements and financial statement schedules
and included an explanatory paragraph regarding the Company’s change in its method of accounting
and reporting for the fair value measurement of financial instruments in 2008, and defined benefit
pension and other postretirement plans in 2006.

likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.

Summary Description of the 2000 PLANCO Non-Employee Option Plan

The Company’s Board of Directors adopted the PLANCO Plan on July 20, 2000, and amended it on
February 20, 2003 to increase the number of shares of the Company’s common stock subject to the
plan to 450,000 shares. The stockholders of the Company have not approved the PLANCO Plan. No
awards have been issued under the PLANCO Plan since 2003.

Eligibility – Any non-employee independent contractor serving on the wholesale sales force as an
insurance agent who is an exclusive agent of the Company or who derives more than 50% of his or her
annual income from the Company is eligible.

Terms of options – Nonqualified stock options (“NQSOs”) to purchase shares of common stock are
available for grant under the PLANCO Plan. The administrator of the PLANCO Plan, the Compensation
and Personnel Committee, (i) determines the recipients of options under the PLANCO Plan, (ii)
determines the number of shares of common stock covered by such options, (iii) determines the dates
and the manner in which options become exercisable (which is typically in three equal annual
installments beginning on the first anniversary of the date of grant), (iv) sets the exercise price
of options (which may be less than, equal to or greater than the fair market value of common stock
on the date of grant) and (v) determines the other terms and conditions of each option. Payment of
the exercise price may be made in cash, other shares of the Company’s common stock or through a
same day sale program. The term of an NQSO may not exceed ten years and two days from the date of
grant.

If an optionee’s required relationship with the Company terminates for any reason, other than for
cause, any exercisable options remain exercisable for a fixed period of four months, not to exceed
the remainder of the option’s term. Any options that are not exercisable at the time of such
termination are cancelled on the date of such termination. If the optionee’s required relationship
is terminated for cause, the options are canceled immediately.

Acceleration in Connection with a Change in Control – Upon the occurrence of a change in control,
each option outstanding on the date of such change in control, and which is not then fully vested
and exercisable, shall immediately vest and become exercisable. In general, a “Change in Control”
will be deemed to have occurred upon the acquisition of 40% or more of the outstanding voting stock
of the Company, a tender or exchange offer to acquire 15% or more of the outstanding voting stock
of the Company, certain mergers or corporate transactions resulting in the shareholders of the
Company before the transactions owning less than 55% of the entity surviving the transactions,
certain transactions involving a transfer of substantially all of the Company’s assets or a change
in greater than 50% of the Board members over a two year period. See Note 18 of Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of the 2005 Stock Plan and the ESPP.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of

The Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc.

Hartford, Connecticut

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of The Hartford Financial Services
Group, Inc. and its subsidiaries (collectively, the “Company”) as of December 31, 2008 and 2007,
and the related consolidated statements of operations, changes in stockholders’ equity,
comprehensive income (loss), and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
December 31, 2008. Our audits also included the financial statement schedules listed in the Index
at Item 15. These financial statements and financial statement schedules are the responsibility of
the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
statements and financial statement schedules based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An
audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the
financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects,
the financial position of The Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc. and its subsidiaries as of
December 31, 2008 and 2007, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of
the three years in the period ended December 31, 2008, in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America. Also, in our opinion, such financial statement
schedules, when considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as a
whole, present fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein.

As discussed in Note 1 of the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed its method of
accounting and reporting for the fair value measurement of financial instruments in 2008, and
defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans in 2006.

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31,
2008, based on the criteria established in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

issued by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and

THE HARTFORD FINANCIAL SERVICES GROUP, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(Dollar amounts in millions, except for per share data, unless otherwise stated)

1. Basis of Presentation and Accounting Policies

Basis of Presentation

The Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc. is a financial holding company for a group of
subsidiaries that provide investment products and life and property and casualty insurance to both
individual and business customers in the United States and internationally (collectively, “The
Hartford” or the “Company”).

The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the basis of accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”), which differ materially from the
accounting practices prescribed by various insurance regulatory authorities.

Consolidation

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of The Hartford Financial Services
Group, Inc., companies in which the Company directly or indirectly has a controlling financial
interest and those variable interest entities in which the Company is the primary beneficiary. The
Company determines if it is the primary beneficiary using both qualitative and quantitative
analyses. Entities in which The Hartford does not have a controlling financial interest but in
which the Company has significant influence over the operating and financing decisions are reported
using the equity method. All material intercompany transactions and balances between The Hartford
and its subsidiaries and affiliates have been eliminated. For further discussions on variable
interest entities see Note 5.

Use of Estimates

The preparation of financial statements, in conformity with U.S. GAAP, requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure
of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported
amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from
those estimates.

The most significant estimates include those used in determining property and casualty reserves,
net of reinsurance; life estimated gross profits used in the valuation and amortization of assets
and liabilities associated with variable annuity and other universal life-type contracts; living
benefits required to be fair valued; valuation of investments and derivative instruments;
evaluation of other-than-temporary impairments on available-for-sale securities; pension and other
postretirement benefit obligations; contingencies relating to corporate litigation and regulatory
matters; and goodwill impairment.

Reclassifications

Certain reclassifications have been made to prior year financial information to conform to the
current year presentation

Adoption of New Accounting Standards

Amendments to the Impairment Guidance of EITF Issue No. 99-20

In January 2009, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued FASB Staff Position
(“FSP”) No. EITF 99-20-1, “Amendments to the Impairment Guidance of EITF Issue No. 99-20,” (“FSP
EITF 99-20-1”). The FSP amends the impairment guidance of Emerging Issues Task Force (“EITF”)
Issue No. 99-20, “Recognition of Interest Income and Impairment of Purchased Beneficial Interest
and Beneficial Interest that Continue to Be Held by a Transferor in Securitized Financial Assets,”
by removing the exclusive reliance upon market participant assumptions about future cash flows when
evaluating impairment of securities within its scope. FSP EITF 99-20-1 requires companies to follow
the impairment guidance in Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No. 115,
“Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities” (“SFAS 115”), which permits the
use of reasonable management judgment of the probability that the holder will be unable to collect
all amounts due. The FSP is effective prospectively for interim and annual reporting periods
ending after December 15, 2008. The Company adopted the FSP on December 31, 2008 and the adoption
did not have a material effect on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.

F-7


THE HARTFORD FINANCIAL SERVICES GROUP, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)

1. Basis of Presentation and Accounting Policies (continued)

FSP FAS 140-4 and FIN 46(R)-8, Disclosures by Public Entities (Enterprises) about Transfers of
Financial Assets and Interests in Variable Interest Entities

In December 2008, the FASB issued FSP FAS 140-4 and FIN 46(R)-8, “Disclosures by Public Entities
(Enterprises) about Transfers of Financial Assets and Interests in Variable Interest Entities.”
The purpose of this FSP is to promptly improve disclosures by public entities and enterprises until
pending amendments to SFAS No. 140, “Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and
Extinguishments of Liabilities” (“SFAS 140”), and FASB Interpretation No. 46 (R), “Consolidation of
Variable Interest Entities” (“FIN 46(R)”), are finalized and approved by the FASB. The FSP amends
SFAS 140 to require public entities to provide additional disclosures about transferors’ continuing
involvements with transferred financial assets. It also amends FIN 46(R) to require public
enterprises, to provide additional disclosures about their involvement with variable interest
entities. FSP FAS 140-4 and FIN 46(R)-8 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal
years and interim periods ending after December 15, 2008. For periods after the initial adoption
date, comparative disclosures are required. The Company adopted the FSP on December 31, 2008. See
Note 5 for the new disclosures.

Disclosures about Credit Derivatives and Certain Guarantees: An Amendment of FASB Statement No. 133
and FASB Interpretation No. 45; and Clarification of the Effective Date of FASB Statement No. 161

In September 2008, the FASB issued FSP No. FAS 133-1 and FIN 45-4 “Disclosures about Credit
Derivatives and Certain Guarantees: An Amendment of FASB Statement No. 133 and FASB Interpretation
No. 45; and Clarification of the Effective Date of FASB Statement No. 161” (“FSP FAS 133-1 and FIN
45-4”). This FSP amends SFAS 133 to require disclosures by entities that assume credit risk through
the sale of credit derivatives including credit derivatives embedded in a hybrid instrument. The
intent of these enhanced disclosures is to enable users of financial statements to assess the
potential effect on its financial position, financial performance, and cash flows from these credit
derivatives. This FSP also amends FASB Interpretation No. 45, “Guarantor’s Accounting and
Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others”,
to require an additional disclosure about the current status of the payment/performance risk of a
guarantee. FSP FAS 133-1 and FIN 45-4 are effective for financial statements issued for fiscal
years and interim periods ending after November 15, 2008. For periods after the initial adoption
date, comparative disclosures are required. The Company adopted FSP FAS 133-1 and FIN 45-4 on
December 31, 2008. See Note 5 for the new disclosures.

Fair Value Measurements

On January 1, 2008, the Company adopted SFAS No. 157, “Fair Value Measurements” (“SFAS 157”), which
was issued by the FASB in September 2006. The Company also adopted on January 1, 2008, the SFAS
157 related FASB Staff Position (“FSP”) described below. For financial statement elements
currently required to be measured at fair value, SFAS 157 redefines fair value, establishes a
framework for measuring fair value under U.S. GAAP and enhances disclosures about fair value
measurements. The new definition of fair value focuses on the price that would be received to sell
the asset or paid to transfer the liability regardless of whether an observable liquid market price
existed (an exit price). SFAS 157 establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs
to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three broad levels (“Level 1, 2, and 3”).

The Company applied the provisions of SFAS 157 prospectively to financial assets and financial
liabilities that are required to be measured at fair value under existing U.S. GAAP. The Company
also recorded in opening retained earnings the cumulative effect of applying SFAS 157 to certain
customized derivatives measured at fair value in accordance with EITF Issue No. 02-3, “Issues
Involved in Accounting for Derivative Contracts Held for Trading Purposes and Involved in Energy
Trading and Risk Management Activities” (“EITF 02-3”). See Note 4 for additional information
regarding SFAS 157. Specifically, see the SFAS 157 Transition discussion within Note 4 for
information regarding the effects of applying SFAS 157 on the Company’s consolidated financial
statements in 2008.

In February 2008, the FASB issued FSP No. FAS 157-2, “Effective Date of FASB Statement No. 157”
(“FSP FAS 157-2”) which delays the effective date of SFAS 157 to fiscal years beginning after
November 15, 2008 for certain nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities. Examples of
applicable nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities to which FSP FAS 157-2 applies include,
but are not limited to:

•

Nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities initially measured at fair value in a
business combination that are not subsequently remeasured at fair value;

•

Reporting units measured at fair value in the goodwill impairment test as described in SFAS
No. 142, “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets” (“SFAS 142”), and nonfinancial assets and
nonfinancial liabilities measured at fair value in the SFAS 142 goodwill impairment test, if
applicable; and

•

Nonfinancial long-lived assets measured at fair value for impairment assessment under SFAS
No. 144, “Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets.”

As a result of the issuance of FSP FAS 157-2, the Company did not apply the provisions of SFAS 157
to the nonfinancial assets, nonfinancial liabilities and reporting units within the scope of FSP
FAS 157-2.

THE HARTFORD FINANCIAL SERVICES GROUP, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)

1. Basis of Presentation and Accounting Policies (continued)

Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities

In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, “The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and
Financial Liabilities, Including an amendment of FASB Statement No. 115” (“SFAS 159”). The
objective of SFAS 159 is to improve financial reporting by providing entities with the opportunity
to mitigate volatility in reported net income caused by measuring related assets and liabilities
differently. This statement permits entities to choose, at specified election dates, to measure
certain eligible items at fair value (i.e., the fair value option). SFAS 159 is effective as of
the beginning of an entity’s first fiscal year that begins after November 15, 2007. On January 1,
2008, the Company did not elect to apply the provisions of SFAS 159 to financial assets and
liabilities.

Amendment of FASB Interpretation No. 39

In April 2007, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position No. FIN 39-1, “Amendment of FASB Interpretation
No. 39” (“FSP FIN 39-1”). FSP FIN 39-1 amends FIN 39, “Offsetting of Amounts Related to Certain
Contacts”, by permitting a reporting entity to offset fair value amounts recognized for the right
to reclaim cash collateral (a receivable) or the obligation to return cash collateral (a payable)
against fair value amounts recognized for derivative instruments executed with the same
counterparty under the same master netting arrangement that have been offset in the statement of
financial position in accordance with FIN 39. FSP FIN 39-1 also amends FIN 39 by modifying certain
terms. FSP FIN 39-1 is effective for reporting periods beginning after November 15, 2007, with
early application permitted. The Company early adopted FSP FIN 39-1 on December 31, 2007, by
electing to offset cash collateral against amounts recognized for derivative instruments under the
same master netting arrangements. The Company recorded the effect of adopting FSP FIN 39-1 as a
change in accounting principle through retrospective application. See Note 5 for further
discussions on the adoption of FSP FIN 39-1.

Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109

The FASB issued Interpretation No. 48, “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, an interpretation
of FASB Statement No. 109” (“FIN 48”), dated June 2006. FIN 48 requires companies to recognize the
tax benefits of uncertain tax positions only when the position is “more likely than not” to be
sustained assuming examination by tax authorities. The amount recognized represents the largest
amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized. A liability is recognized
for any benefit claimed, or expected to be claimed, in a tax return in excess of the benefit
recorded in the financial statements, along with any interest and penalty (if applicable) on the
excess.

The Company adopted the provisions of FIN 48 on January 1, 2007. As a result of the adoption, the
Company recognized a $12 decrease in the liability for unrecognized tax benefits and a
corresponding increase in the January 1, 2007 balance of retained earnings. The total amount of
unrecognized tax benefits as of January 1, 2007 was $8 including an immaterial amount for interest.
If these unrecognized tax benefits were recognized, they would have an immaterial effect on the
Company’s effective tax rate. The Company does not believe it would be subject to any penalties in
any open tax years and, therefore, has not booked any such amounts. The Company classifies
interest and penalties (if applicable) as income tax expense in the financial statements.

The Company or one of its subsidiaries files income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction,
and various state and foreign jurisdictions. The Company’s federal income tax returns are
routinely audited by the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”). During 2008, the IRS completed its
examination of the Company’s U.S. income tax returns for 2002 through 2003. The Company received
notification of the approval by the Joint Committee on Taxation of the results of the examination
subsequent to December 31, 2008. The examination will not have a material effect on the Company’s
net income or financial position. The 2004 through 2006 examination began during 2008, and is
expected to close by the end of 2010. In addition, the Company is working with the IRS on a
possible settlement of an issue related to prior periods which, if settled, may result in the
booking of tax benefits in 2009. Such benefits are not expected to be material to the Company’s
net income or financial position. Management believes that adequate provision has been made in the
financial statements for any potential assessments that may result from tax examinations and other
tax-related matters for all open tax years.

Employers’ Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans, an amendment of
FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106 and 132(R)

In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 158, “Employers’ Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension
and Other Postretirement Plans, an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106 and 132(R)” (“SFAS
158”). This statement requires an entity to: (a) recognize an asset for the funded status,
measured as the difference between the fair value of plan assets and the benefit obligation, of
defined benefit postretirement plans that are overfunded and a liability for plans that are
underfunded, measured as of the employer’s fiscal year end; and (b) recognize changes in the funded
status of defined benefit postretirement plans, other than for the net periodic benefit cost
included in net income, in accumulated other comprehensive income, net of tax (“AOCI”). For
pension plans, the funded status must be based on the projected benefit obligation which includes
an assumption for future salary increases. The provisions of FASB Statement No. 87, “Employers’
Accounting for Pensions” (“SFAS 87”) and FASB Statement No. 106, “Employers’ Accounting for
Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions” in measuring plan assets and benefit obligations and
in determining the amount of net periodic benefit cost continue to apply upon initial and
subsequent application of SFAS 158. SFAS 158 is effective for public entities with years ending
after December 15, 2006, with certain exceptions not applicable to The Hartford, through an
adjustment to the ending balance of AOCI. As of December 31, 2006, the effect of adopting SFAS 158
was a decrease of $717 in the net defined benefit postretirement plan asset and a corresponding
after-tax decrease of $466 in the accumulated other comprehensive income component of equity.
Because the Company recorded a decrease of $560, net of tax, in its additional minimum liability
adjustment related to its pension plans, the balance sheet change was an increase of $145 in the
net defined benefit postretirement plan asset and a corresponding after-tax increase of $94 in the
accumulated other comprehensive income component of equity.

Accounting by Insurance Enterprises for Deferred Acquisition Costs (“DAC”) in Connection with
Modifications or Exchanges of Insurance Contracts

In September 2005, the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (“AICPA”) issued
Statement of Position 05-1, “Accounting by Insurance Enterprises for Deferred Acquisition Costs
(“DAC”) in Connection with Modifications or Exchanges of Insurance Contracts” (“SOP 05-1”). SOP
05-1 provides guidance on accounting by insurance enterprises for DAC on internal replacements of
insurance and investment contracts. An internal replacement is a modification in product benefits,
features, rights or coverages that occurs by the exchange of a contract for a new contract, or by
amendment, endorsement, or rider to a contract, or by the election of a feature or coverage within
a contract. Modifications that result in a replacement contract that is substantially changed from
the replaced contract should be accounted for as an extinguishment of the replaced contract.
Unamortized DAC, unearned revenue liabilities and deferred sales inducements from the replaced
contract must be written-off. Modifications that result in a contract that is substantially
unchanged from the replaced contract should be accounted for as a continuation of the replaced
contract. The Company adopted SOP 05-1 on January 1, 2007 and recognized the cumulative effect of
the adoption of SOP 05-1 as a reduction in retained earnings of $53, after-tax.

Future Adoption of New Accounting Standards

Equity Method Investment Accounting Considerations

In November 2008, the FASB issued EITF 08-6, “Equity Method Investment Accounting Considerations”
(“EITF 08-6”). EITF 08-6 addresses the effects of the issuances of SFAS 141(R) and SFAS 160 on the
application of the equity method under Accounting Principles Board (“APB”) Opinion 18, “The Equity
Method of Accounting for Investments in Common Stock” EITF 08-6 requires that (a) an entity
determine the initial carrying value of an equity method investment by applying the cost
accumulation model; (b) an entity shall use the other than temporary impairment model of APB
Opinion 18; however, investors should adjust any impairments’ recorded by an investee for existing
differences between the investor’s basis and the underlying investees’ basis in such impaired
assets; (c) share issuances by an investee should be accounted for as if the equity method investor
had sold a proportionate share of its investment; and (d) when an investment is no longer within
the scope of equity method accounting and instead is within the scope of cost method accounting or
SFAS 115, “Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities” (“SFAS 115”), the
investor should prospectively apply the provisions of APB Opinion 18 or SFAS 115 and use the
current carrying amount of the investment as its initial cost. The EITF is effective on a
prospective basis in fiscal years beginning on or after December 15, 2008 and interim periods
within those fiscal years, consistent with the effective dates of SFAS No. 141(R) and SFAS No. 160.
The adoption of EITF 08-6 on January 1, 2009 did not have a material effect on the Company’s
consolidated financial statements.

Determining Whether Instruments Granted in Share-Based Payment Transactions Are Participating
Securities

In June 2008, the FASB issued FSP No. EITF 03-6-1, “Determining Whether Instruments Granted in
Share-Based Payment Transactions Are Participating Securities” (“FSP EITF 03-6-1”). The FSP
addresses whether instruments granted in share-based payment transactions are participating
securities prior to vesting and, therefore, need to be included in the earnings allocation in
computing earnings per share (“EPS”) under the two-class method described in SFAS No. 128,
“Earnings per Share” (“SFAS 128”). The FSP requires that unvested share-based payment awards that
contain nonforfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents (whether paid or unpaid) are
participating securities and shall be included in the computation of EPS pursuant to the two-class
method. FSP EITF 03-6-1 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning
after December 15, 2008, and interim periods within those years. All prior-period EPS data
presented shall be adjusted retrospectively (including interim financial statements, summaries of
earnings, and selected financial data) to conform with the provisions of this FSP. Early
application is not permitted. The adoption of FSP EITF 03-6-1 on January 1, 2009, did not have a
material effect on the Company’s earnings per share.

Determining Whether an Instrument (or Embedded Feature) Is Indexed to an Entity’s Own Stock

In June 2008, the FASB issued EITF No. 07-5, “Determining Whether an Instrument (or Embedded
Feature) Is Indexed to an Entity’s Own Stock” (“EITF 07-5”). EITF 07-5 addresses the determination
of whether an instrument (or an embedded feature) is indexed to an entity’s own stock for the
purposes of determining whether an instrument is a derivative. To the extent a derivative
instrument or embedded derivative feature is deemed indexed to an entity’s own stock, it may be
exempt from the requirements of SFAS No. 133, “Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging
Activities” (“SFAS 133”). EITF 07-5 concluded that an entity should determine whether an
equity-linked financial instrument (or embedded feature) is indexed to its own stock first by
evaluating the instrument’s contingent exercise provisions, if any, and then by evaluating the
instrument’s settlement provisions. EITF 07-5 will be effective for financial statements issued for
fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008, and interim periods within those fiscal years.
Earlier application is not permitted. EITF 07-5 shall be applied to outstanding instruments as of
the beginning of the fiscal year in which the EITF is adopted. The adoption of EITF 07-5 on
January 1, 2009, did not have a material effect on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.

Accounting for Financial Guarantee Insurance Contracts—an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 60

In May 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No. 163, “Accounting for Financial Guarantee Insurance
Contracts—an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 60” (“SFAS 163”). The scope of SFAS 163 is
limited to financial guarantee insurance (and reinsurance) contracts issued by enterprises that are
included within the scope of SFAS No. 60, “Accounting and Reporting by Insurance Enterprises”
(“SFAS 60”) and that are not accounted for as derivative instruments. SFAS 163 excludes from its
scope insurance contracts that are similar to financial guarantee insurance such as mortgage
guaranty insurance and credit insurance on trade receivables. SFAS 163 is effective for financial
statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008. The Company does not have
financial guarantee insurance products, and, accordingly the adoption of SFAS 163 did not have an
effect on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.

Determination of the Useful Life of Intangible Assets

In April 2008, the FASB issued FSP No. FAS 142-3, “Determination of the Useful Life of Intangible
Assets” (“FSP FAS 142-3”). FSP FAS 142-3 amends the factors that should be considered in
developing renewal or extension assumptions used to determine the useful life of a recognized
intangible asset under SFAS 142. FSP FAS 142-3 amends paragraph 11(d) of SFAS 142 to require an
entity to use its own assumptions about renewal or extension of an arrangement, adjusted for the
entity-specific factors in paragraph 11 of SFAS 142, even when there is likely to be substantial
cost or material modifications. FSP FAS 142-3 is effective for financial statements issued for
fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008, and interim periods within those fiscal years, with
early adoption prohibited. The provisions of FSP FAS 142-3 are to be applied prospectively to
intangible assets acquired after January 1, 2009, for the Company, although the disclosure
provisions are required for all intangible assets recognized as of or subsequent to January 1,
2009. The adoption of FSP FAS 142-3 on January 1, 2009, did not have a material effect on the
Company’s consolidated financial statements.

Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities

In March 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No. 161, “Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging
Activities, an amendment of FASB Statement No. 133” (“SFAS 161”). SFAS 161 amends and expands
disclosures about an entity’s derivative and hedging activities with the intent of providing users
of financial statements with an enhanced understanding of (a) how and why an entity uses derivative
instruments, (b) how derivative instruments and related hedged items are accounted for under SFAS
133 and its related interpretations, and (c) how derivative instruments and related hedged items
affect an entity’s financial position, financial performance, and cash flows. SFAS 161 is
effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after
November 15, 2008, with early application encouraged. SFAS 161 encourages, but does not require,
comparative disclosures. The Company adopted SFAS 161 on January 1, 2009. The adoption of this FSP
by the Company is expected to result in expanded disclosures related to derivative instruments and
hedging activities.

Business Combinations

In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141 (revised 2007), “Business Combinations” (“SFAS
141(R)”). This statement replaces SFAS No. 141, “Business Combinations” (“SFAS 141”) and
establishes the principles and requirements for how the acquirer in a business combination: (a)
measures and recognizes the identifiable assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and any
noncontrolling interests in the acquired entity, (b) measures and recognizes positive goodwill
acquired or a gain from bargain purchase (negative goodwill), and (c) determines the disclosure
information that is decision-useful to users of financial statements in evaluating the nature and
financial effects of the business combination. Some of the significant changes to the existing
accounting guidance on business combinations made by SFAS 141(R) include the following:

•

Most of the identifiable assets acquired, liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling
interest in the acquiree shall be measured at their acquisition-date fair values in accordance
with SFAS 157 fair value rather than SFAS 141’s requirement based on estimated fair values;

•

Acquisition-related costs incurred by the acquirer shall be expensed in the periods in
which the costs are incurred rather than included in the cost of the acquired entity;

•

Goodwill shall be measured as the excess of the consideration transferred, including the
fair value of any contingent consideration, plus the fair value of any noncontrolling interest
in the acquiree, over the fair values of the acquired identifiable net assets, rather than
measured as the excess of the cost of the acquired entity over the estimated fair values of
the acquired identifiable net assets;

•

Contractual pre-acquisition contingencies are to be recognized at their acquisition date
fair values and noncontractual pre-acquisition contingencies are to be recognized at their
acquisition date fair values only if it is more likely than not that the contingency gives
rise to an asset or liability, whereas SFAS 141 generally permits the deferred recognition of
pre-acquisition contingencies until the recognition criteria of SFAS No. 5, “Accounting for
Contingencies” are met; and

•

Contingent consideration shall be recognized at the acquisition date rather than when the
contingency is resolved and consideration is issued or becomes issuable.

SFAS 141(R) is effective for and shall be applied prospectively to business combinations for which
the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on
or after December 15, 2008, with earlier adoption prohibited. Assets and liabilities that arose
from business combinations with acquisition dates prior to the SFAS 141(R) effective date shall not
be adjusted upon adoption of SFAS 141(R) with certain exceptions for acquired deferred tax assets
and acquired income tax positions. The adoption of SFAS 141(R) on January 1, 2009, did not have a
material effect on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.

Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements, an amendment of ARB No. 51

In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160, “Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial
Statements” (“SFAS 160”). This statement amends Accounting Research Bulletin No. 51, “Consolidated
Financial Statements” (“ARB 51”). Noncontrolling interest refers to the minority interest portion
of the equity of a subsidiary that is not attributable directly or indirectly to a parent. SFAS
160 establishes accounting and reporting standards that require for-profit entities that prepare
consolidated financial statements to: (a) present noncontrolling interests as a component of
equity, separate from the parent’s equity, (b) separately present the amount of consolidated net
income attributable to noncontrolling interests in the income statement, (c) consistently account
for changes in a parent’s ownership interests in a subsidiary in which the parent entity has a
controlling financial interest as equity transactions, (d) require an entity to measure at fair
value its remaining interest in a subsidiary that is deconsolidated, and (e) require an entity to
provide sufficient disclosures that identify and clearly distinguish between interests of the
parent and interests of noncontrolling owners. SFAS 160 applies to all for-profit entities that
prepare consolidated financial statements, and affects those for-profit entities that have
outstanding noncontrolling interests in one or more subsidiaries or that deconsolidate a
subsidiary. SFAS 160 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years,
beginning on or after December 15, 2008 with earlier adoption prohibited. The Company’s adoption
of SFAS 160 on January 1, 2009 did not have a material effect on the Company’s consolidated
financial statements.

Investments

The Hartford’s investments in fixed maturities include bonds, redeemable preferred stock and
commercial paper. These investments, along with certain equity securities, which include common
and non-redeemable preferred stocks, are classified as “available-for-sale” and are carried at fair
value. The after-tax difference from cost or amortized cost is reflected in stockholders’ equity
as a component of AOCI, after adjustments for the effect of deducting the life and pension
policyholders’ share of the immediate participation guaranteed contracts and certain life and
annuity deferred policy acquisition costs and reserve adjustments. The equity investments
associated with the variable annuity products offered in Japan are recorded at fair value and are
classified as “trading” with changes in fair value recorded in net investment income. Policy loans
are carried at outstanding balance. Mortgage loans on real estate are recorded at the outstanding
principal balance adjusted for amortization of premiums or discounts and net of valuation
allowances, if any. Short-term investments are carried at amortized cost, which approximates fair
value. Limited partnerships and other alternative investments are reported at their carrying value
with the change in carrying value accounted for under the equity method and accordingly the
Company’s share of earnings are included in net investment income. Recognition of limited
partnerships and other alternative investment income is delayed due to the availability of the
related financial statements, as private equity and other funds are generally on a three-month
delay and hedge funds are on a one-month delay. Accordingly, income at December 31, 2008 may not
include the full impact of current year changes in valuation of the underlying assets and
liabilities. Other investments primarily consist of derivatives instruments which are carried at
fair value.

Other-Than-Temporary Impairments on Available-for-Sale Securities

One of the significant estimates related to available-for-sale securities is the evaluation of
investments for other-than-temporary impairments. If a decline in the fair value of an
available-for-sale security is judged to be other-than-temporary, a charge is recorded in net
realized capital losses equal to the difference between the fair value and cost or amortized cost
basis of the security. In addition, for securities expected to be sold, an other-than-temporary
impairment charge is recognized if the Company does not expect the fair value of a security to
recover to cost or amortized cost prior to the expected date of sale. The fair value of the
other-than-temporarily impaired investment becomes its new cost basis. For fixed maturities, the
Company accretes the new cost basis to par or to the estimated future cash flows over the expected
remaining life of the security by adjusting the security’s yield.

The evaluation of securities for impairments is a quantitative and qualitative process, which is
subject to risks and uncertainties and is intended to determine whether declines in the fair value
of investments should be recognized in current period earnings. The risks and uncertainties
include changes in general economic conditions, the issuer’s financial condition and/or future
prospects, the effects of changes in interest rates or credit spreads and the expected recovery
period. The Company has a security monitoring process overseen by a committee of investment and
accounting professionals (“the committee”) that identifies securities that, due to certain
characteristics, as described below, are subjected to an enhanced analysis on a quarterly basis.
Based on this evaluation, during 2008, the Company concluded $4.0 billion of unrealized losses were
other-than-temporarily impaired and as of December 31, 2008, the Company’s unrealized losses on
available-for-sale securities of $14.6 billion were temporarily impaired.

Securities not subject to EITF Issue No. 99-20, “Recognition of Interest Income and Impairment on
Purchased Beneficial Interests and Beneficial Interests That Continued to Be Held by a Transferor
in Securitized Financial Assets” (“non-EITF Issue No. 99-20 securities”) that are in an unrealized
loss position, are reviewed at least quarterly to determine if an other-than-temporary impairment
is present based on certain quantitative and qualitative factors. The primary factors considered
in evaluating whether a decline in value for non-EITF Issue No. 99-20 securities is
other-than-temporary include: (a) the length of time and extent to which the fair value has been
less than cost or amortized cost and the expected recovery period of the security, (b) the
financial condition, credit rating and future prospects of the issuer, (c) whether the debtor is
current on contractually obligated interest and principal payments and (d) the intent and ability
of the Company to retain the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for recovery.

Through September 30, 2008, for securitized financial assets with contractual cash flows, including
those subject to EITF Issue No. 99-20, the Company periodically updated its best estimate of cash
flows over the life of the security. The Company’s best estimate of cash flows used severe
economic recession assumptions due to market uncertainty, similar to those the Company believed
market participants would use. If the fair value of a securitized financial asset was less than
its cost or amortized cost and there has been an adverse change in timing or amount of anticipated
future cash flows since the last revised estimate, an other-than-temporary impairment charge was
recognized. The Company also considered its intent and ability to retain a temporarily depressed
security until recovery. Estimating future cash flows is a quantitative and qualitative process
that incorporates information received from third party sources along with certain internal
assumptions and judgments regarding the future performance of the underlying collateral. In
addition, projections of expected future cash flows may change based upon new information regarding
the performance of the underlying collateral. Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2008, the Company
implemented FSP No. EITF 99-20-1, “Amendments to the Impairment Guidance of EITF Issue No. 99-20”.
Upon implementation, the Company continued to utilize the impairment process described above;
however, rather than exclusively relying upon market participant assumptions management judgment
was also used in assessing the probability that an adverse change in future cash flows has
occurred.

THE HARTFORD FINANCIAL SERVICES GROUP, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)

Each quarter, during this analysis, the Company asserts its intent and ability to retain until
recovery those securities judged to be temporarily impaired. Once identified, these securities are
systematically restricted from trading unless approved by the committee. The committee will only
authorize the sale of these securities based on predefined criteria that relate to events that
could not have been reasonably foreseen at the time the committee rendered its judgment on the
Company’s intent and ability to retain such securities until recovery. Examples of the criteria
include, but are not limited to, the deterioration in the issuer’s creditworthiness, a change in
regulatory requirements or a major business combination or major disposition.

Mortgage Loan Impairments

Mortgage loans on real estate are considered to be impaired when management estimates that based
upon current information and events, it is probable that the Company will be unable to collect
amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement. For mortgage loans that are
deemed impaired, a valuation allowance is established for the difference between the carrying
amount and the Company’s share of either (a) the present value of the expected future cash flows
discounted at the loan’s original effective interest rate, (b) the loan’s observable market price
or (c) the fair value of the collateral. Changes in valuation allowances are recorded in net
realized capital gains and losses.

Net Realized Capital Gains and Losses

Net realized capital gains and losses from investment sales, after deducting the life and pension
policyholders’ share for certain products, are reported as a component of revenues and are
determined on a specific identification basis. Net realized capital gains and losses also result
from fair value changes in derivatives contracts (both free-standing and embedded) that do not
qualify, or are not designated, as a hedge for accounting purposes, and the change in value of
derivatives in certain fair-value hedge relationships. Impairments are recognized as net realized
capital losses when investment losses in value are deemed other-than-temporary. Recoveries of
principal received by the Company in excess of expected realizable value from securities previously
recorded as other-than-temporarily impaired are included in net realized capital gains. Foreign
currency transaction remeasurements are also included in net realized capital gains and losses.

Net Investment Income

Interest income from fixed maturities and mortgage loans on real estate is recognized when earned
on the constant effective yield method based on estimated timing of cash flows. The amortization
of premium and accretion of discount for fixed maturities also takes into consideration call and
maturity dates that produce the lowest yield. For securitized financial assets subject to
prepayment risk, yields are recalculated and adjusted periodically to reflect historical and/or
estimated future principal repayments using the retrospective method; however, if these investments
are impaired, any yield adjustments are made using the prospective method. Prepayment fees on
fixed maturities and mortgage loans are recorded in net investment income when earned. For limited
partnerships, the equity method of accounting is used to recognize the Company’s share of earnings.
For fixed maturities that have had an other-than-temporary impairment loss, the Company amortizes
the new cost basis to par or to the estimated future value over the expected remaining life of the
security by adjusting the security’s yield.

Net investment income on equity securities held for trading includes dividend income and the
changes in market value of the securities associated with the variable annuity products sold in
Japan and the United Kingdom. The returns on these policyholder-directed investments inure to the
benefit of the variable annuity policyholders but the underlying funds do not meet the criteria for
separate account reporting as provided in SOP 03-1. Accordingly, these assets are reflected in the
Company’s general account and the returns credited to the policyholders are reflected in interest
credited, a component of benefits, losses and loss adjustment expenses.

Derivative Instruments

Overview

The Company utilizes a variety of derivative instruments, including swaps, caps, floors, forwards,
futures and options through one of four Company-approved objectives: to hedge risk arising from
interest rate, equity market, credit spread including issuer default, price or currency exchange
rate risk or volatility; to manage liquidity; to control transaction costs; or to enter into
replication transactions. For a further discussion of derivative instruments, see the Derivative
Instruments section of Note 5.

The Company’s derivative transactions are used in strategies permitted under the derivative use
plans required by the State of Connecticut, the State of Illinois and the State of New York
insurance departments.

Accounting and Financial Statement Presentation of Derivative Instruments and Hedging
Activities

Derivative instruments are recognized on the consolidated balance sheets at fair value. As of
December 31, 2008 and 2007, approximately 94% and 89% of derivatives, respectively, based upon
notional values, were priced by valuation models, which utilize independent market data, while the
remaining 6% and 11%, respectively, were priced by broker quotations. The derivatives are valued
using mid-market level inputs that are predominantly observable in the market place. Inputs used
to value derivatives include, but are not limited to, interest swap rates, foreign currency forward
and spot rates, credit spreads, interest and equity volatility and equity index levels. The
Company performs a monthly analysis on the derivative valuation which includes both quantitative
and qualitative analysis. Examples of procedures performed include, but are not limited to, review
of pricing statistics and trends, back testing recent trades, analyzing changes in the market
environment and monitoring trading volume. This discussion on derivative pricing excludes the GMWB
rider and associated reinsurance contracts as well as the embedded derivatives associated with the
GMAB product, which are discussed in Note 4.

On the date the derivative contract is entered into, the Company designates the derivative as (1) a
hedge of the fair value of a recognized asset or liability (“fair-value” hedge), (2) a hedge of the
variability in cash flows of a forecasted transaction or of amounts to be received or paid related
to a recognized asset or liability (“cash-flow” hedge), (3) a foreign-currency fair-value or
cash-flow hedge (“foreign-currency” hedge), (4) a hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation
(“net investment” hedge) or (5) held for other investment and/or risk management purposes, which
primarily involve managing asset or liability related risks which do not qualify for hedge
accounting.

Fair-Value Hedges

Changes in the fair value of a derivative that is designated and qualifies as a fair-value hedge,
along with the changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability that is attributable to
the hedged risk, are recorded in current period earnings with any differences between the net
change in fair value of the derivative and the hedged item representing the hedge ineffectiveness.
Periodic cash flows and accruals of income/expense (“periodic derivative net coupon settlements”)
are recorded in the line item of the consolidated statements of operations in which the cash flows
of the hedged item are recorded.

Cash-Flow Hedges

Changes in the fair value of a derivative that is designated and qualifies as a cash-flow hedge are
recorded in AOCI and are reclassified into earnings when the variability of the cash flow of the
hedged item impacts earnings. Gains and losses on derivative contracts that are reclassified from
AOCI to current period earnings are included in the line item in the consolidated statements of
operations in which the cash flows of the hedged item are recorded. Any hedge ineffectiveness is
recorded immediately in current period earnings as net realized capital gains and losses. Periodic
derivative net coupon settlements are recorded in the line item of the consolidated statements of
operations in which the cash flows of the hedged item are recorded.

Foreign-Currency Hedges

Changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as foreign-currency hedges
are recorded in either current period earnings or AOCI, depending on whether the hedged transaction
is a fair-value hedge or a cash-flow hedge, respectively. Any hedge ineffectiveness is recorded
immediately in current period earnings as net realized capital gains and losses. Periodic
derivative net coupon settlements are recorded in the line item of the consolidated statements of
operations in which the cash flows of the hedged item are recorded.

Net Investment in a Foreign Operation Hedges

Changes in fair value of a derivative used as a hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation,
to the extent effective as a hedge, are recorded in the foreign currency translation adjustments
account within AOCI. Cumulative changes in fair value recorded in AOCI are reclassified into
earnings upon the sale or complete, or substantially complete, liquidation of the foreign entity.
Any hedge ineffectiveness is recorded immediately in current period earnings as net realized
capital gains and losses. Periodic derivative net coupon settlements are recorded in the line item
of the consolidated statements of operations in which the cash flows of the hedged item are
recorded.

Other Investment and/or Risk Management Activities

The Company’s other investment and/or risk management activities primarily relate to strategies
used to reduce economic risk or replicate permitted investments and do not receive hedge accounting
treatment. Changes in the fair value, including periodic derivative net coupon settlements, of
derivative instruments held for other investment and/or risk management purposes are reported in
current period earnings as net realized capital gains and losses.

Hedge Documentation and Effectiveness Testing

To qualify for hedge accounting treatment, a derivative must be highly effective in mitigating the
designated changes in fair value or cash flow of the hedged item. At hedge inception, the Company
formally documents all relationships between hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as its
risk-management objective and strategy for undertaking each hedge transaction. The documentation
process includes linking derivatives that are designated as fair-value, cash-flow, foreign-currency
or net investment hedges to specific assets or liabilities on the balance sheet or to specific
forecasted transactions and defining the effectiveness and ineffectiveness testing methods to be
used. The Company also formally assesses both at the hedge’s inception and ongoing on a quarterly
basis, whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions have been and are expected to
continue to be highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of hedged items.
Hedge effectiveness is assessed using qualitative and quantitative methods. Qualitative methods
may include comparison of critical terms of the derivative to the hedged item. Quantitative
methods include regression or other statistical analysis of changes in fair value or cash flows
associated with the hedge relationship. Hedge ineffectiveness of the hedge relationships are
measured each reporting period using the “Change in Variable Cash Flows Method”, the “Change in
Fair Value Method”, the “Hypothetical Derivative Method”, or the “Dollar Offset Method”.

Discontinuance of Hedge Accounting

The Company discontinues hedge accounting prospectively when (1) it is determined that the
derivative is no longer highly effective in offsetting changes in the fair value or cash flows of a
hedged item; (2) the derivative is dedesignated as a hedging instrument; or (3) the derivative
expires or is sold, terminated or exercised.

When hedge accounting is discontinued because it is determined that the derivative no longer
qualifies as an effective fair-value hedge, the derivative continues to be carried at fair value on
the balance sheet with changes in its fair value recognized in current period earnings.

When hedge accounting is discontinued because the Company becomes aware that it is not probable
that the forecasted transaction will occur, the derivative continues to be carried on the balance
sheet at its fair value, and gains and losses that were accumulated in AOCI are recognized
immediately in earnings.

In other situations in which hedge accounting is discontinued on a cash-flow hedge, including those
where the derivative is sold, terminated or exercised, amounts previously deferred in AOCI are
reclassified into earnings when earnings are impacted by the variability of the cash flow of the
hedged item.

Embedded Derivatives

The Company purchases and issues financial instruments and products that contain embedded
derivative instruments. When it is determined that (1) the embedded derivative possesses economic
characteristics that are not clearly and closely related to the economic characteristics of the
host contract, and (2) a separate instrument with the same terms would qualify as a derivative
instrument, the embedded derivative is bifurcated from the host for measurement purposes. The
embedded derivative, which is reported with the host instrument in the consolidated balance sheets,
is carried at fair value with changes in fair value reported in net realized capital gains and
losses.

Credit Risk

The Company’s derivative counterparty exposure policy establishes market-based credit limits,
favors long-term financial stability and creditworthiness and typically requires credit
enhancement/credit risk reducing agreements. Credit risk is measured as the amount owed to the
Company based on current market conditions and potential payment obligations between the Company
and its counterparties. For each legal entity, the Company’s credit exposures are generally
quantified daily, netted by counterparty and collateral is pledged to and held by, or on behalf of,
the Company to the extent the current value of derivatives exceeds the contractual thresholds which
do not exceed $10, except for reinsurance derivatives. The Company also minimizes the credit risk in derivative instruments by
entering into transactions with high quality counterparties rated A2/A or better, which are
monitored and evaluated by the Company’s risk management team and reviewed by senior management.
In addition, the compliance unit monitors counterparty credit exposure on a monthly basis to ensure
compliance with Company policies and statutory limitations. The Company also maintains a policy of
requiring that derivative contracts, other than exchange traded contracts, certain currency forward
contracts, and certain embedded derivatives, be governed by an International Swaps and Derivatives
Association Master Agreement which is structured by legal entity and by counterparty and permits
right of offset.

Product Derivatives

The Company offers certain variable annuity products with a guaranteed minimum withdrawal and
accumulation benefit (“GMWB” and “GMAB”) rider. The GMWB and GMAB represent embedded derivatives
in the variable annuity contracts that are required to be reported separately from the host
variable annuity contract. They are carried at fair value and reported in other policyholder
funds. See Note 4 for a complete discussion of GMWB and GMAB valuations.

In valuing the embedded derivative, the Company attributes to the derivative a portion of the fees
collected from the contract holder equal to the present value of future GMWB and GMAB claims (the
“Attributed Fees”). All changes in the fair value of the embedded derivative are recorded in net
realized capital gains and losses. The excess of fees collected from the contract holder over the
Attributed Fees are associated with the host variable annuity contract and recorded in fee income.

The Company has reinsurance arrangements in place to transfer a portion of its risk of loss due to
GMWB. These arrangements are recognized as derivatives and carried at fair value in reinsurance
recoverables. Changes in the fair value of the reinsurance agreements are recorded in net realized
capital gains and losses. See Note 4 for a complete discussion of GMWB reinsurance valuation

Separate Accounts

The Company maintains separate account assets, which are reported at fair value. Separate account
liabilities are reported at amounts consistent with separate account assets. Separate accounts
include contracts, wherein the policyholder assumes the investment risk. Separate account assets
are segregated from other investments and investment income and gains and losses accrue directly to
the policyholder.

Deferred Policy Acquisition Costs and Present Value of Future Profits

Life

— Life’s deferred policy acquisition costs asset and present value of future profits (“PVFP”)
intangible asset (hereafter, referred to collectively as “DAC”) related to investment contracts and
universal life-type contracts (including variable annuities) are amortized in the same way, over
the estimated life of the contracts acquired using the retrospective deposit method. Under the
retrospective deposit method, acquisition costs are amortized in proportion to the present value of
estimated gross profits (“EGPs”). EGPs are also used to amortize other assets and liabilities on
the Company’s balance sheet, such as sales inducement assets and unearned revenue reserves (“URR”).
Components of EGPs are used to determine reserves for guaranteed minimum death, income and
universal life secondary guarantee benefits accounted for and collectively referred to as “SOP 03-1
reserves”. The specific breakdown of the most significant EGP based balances by segment is as
follows:

For most contracts, the Company estimates gross profits over a 20 year horizon as estimated profits
emerging subsequent to that timeframe are immaterial. The Company uses other amortization bases
for amortizing DAC, such as gross costs (net of reinsurance), as a replacement for EGPs when EGPs
are expected to be negative for multiple years of the contract’s life. Actual gross profits, in a
given reporting period, that vary from management’s initial estimates result in increases or
decreases in the rate of amortization, commonly referred to as a “true-up”, which are recorded in
the current period. The true-up recorded for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007, and 2006 was
an increase (decrease) to amortization of $404 (of which $194 is attributed to accelerated DAC
amortization for the Company’s 3Win product in Japan as further discussed under the “Japan Variable
Annuities” section below), $(6), and $41, respectively.

Products sold in a particular year are aggregated into cohorts. Future gross profits for each
cohort are projected over the estimated lives of the underlying contracts, and are, to a large
extent, a function of future account value projections for variable annuity products and to a
lesser extent for variable universal life products. The projection of future account values
requires the use of certain assumptions. The assumptions considered to be important in the
projection of future account value, and hence the EGPs, include separate account fund performance,
which is impacted by separate account fund mix, less fees assessed against the contract holder’s
account balance, surrender and lapse rates, interest margin, mortality, and hedging costs. The
assumptions are developed as part of an annual process and are dependent upon the Company’s current
best estimates of future events. The Company’s current 20 year separate account return assumption
is approximately 7.2% (after fund fees, but before mortality and expense charges) for U.S. products
and 5.1% (after fund fees, but before mortality and expense charges) in aggregate for all Japanese
products, but varies from product to product. The Company estimates gross profits using the mean
of EGPs derived from a set of stochastic scenarios that have been calibrated to our estimated
separate account return.

THE HARTFORD FINANCIAL SERVICES GROUP, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)

1. Basis of Presentation and Accounting Policies (continued)

Estimating future gross profits is a complex process requiring considerable judgment and the
forecasting of events well into the future. Given the current volatility in the capital markets
and the evaluation of other factors, the Company will continually evaluate its separate account
return estimation process and may change that process from time to time.

The Company plans to complete a comprehensive assumption study and refine its estimate of future
gross profits during the third quarter of each year. Upon completion of an assumption study, the
Company revises its assumptions to reflect its current best estimate, thereby changing its estimate
of projected account values and the related EGPs in the DAC, sales inducement and unearned revenue
reserve amortization models as well as SOP 03-1 reserving models. The DAC asset, as well as the
sales inducement asset, unearned revenue reserves and SOP 03-1 reserves are adjusted with an
offsetting benefit or charge to income to reflect such changes in the period of the revision, a
process known as an “Unlock”. An Unlock that results in an after-tax benefit generally occurs as a
result of actual experience or future expectations of product profitability being favorable
compared to previous estimates. An Unlock that results in an after-tax charge generally occurs as
a result of actual experience or future expectations of product profitability being unfavorable
compared to previous estimates.

In addition to when a comprehensive assumption study is completed, revisions to best estimate
assumptions used to estimate future gross profits are necessary when the EGPs in the Company’s
models fall outside of an independently determined reasonable range of EGPs. The Company performs
a quantitative process each quarter to determine the reasonable range of EGPs. This process
involves the use of internally developed models, which run a large number of stochastically
determined scenarios of separate account fund performance. Incorporated in each scenario are
assumptions with respect to lapse rates, mortality and expenses, based on the Company’s most recent
assumption study. These scenarios are run for the Company’s individual variable annuity businesses
in the United States and Japan, the Company’s Retirement Plans businesses, and for the Company’s
individual variable universal life business and are used to calculate statistically significant
ranges of reasonable EGPs. The statistical ranges produced from the stochastic scenarios are
compared to the present value of EGPs used in the Company’s models. If EGPs used in the Company’s
models fall outside of the statistical ranges of reasonable EGPs, an “Unlock” would be necessary.
If EGPs used in the Company’s models fall inside of the statistical ranges of reasonable EGPs, the
Company will not solely rely on the results of the quantitative analysis to determine the necessity
of an Unlock. In addition, the Company considers, on a quarterly basis, other qualitative factors
such as product, regulatory and policyholder behavior trends and may also revise EGPs if those
trends are expected to be significant and were not or could not be included in the statistically
significant ranges of reasonable EGPs. As of December 31, 2008, the EGPs used in the Company’s
models fell within the statistical ranges of reasonable EGPs. As a result of this statistical test
and review of qualitative factors, the Company did not Unlock the EGPs used in the Company’s models
during the fourth quarter of 2008.

Unlock Results

As described above, as of September 30, 2008, the Company completed a comprehensive study of
assumptions underlying EGPs, resulting in an Unlock. The study covered all assumptions, including
mortality, lapses, expenses, interest rate spreads, hedging costs, and separate account returns, in
substantially all product lines. The new best estimate assumptions were applied to the current
policy related in-force or account values to project future gross profits. The after-tax impact on
the Company’s assets and liabilities as a result of the Unlock during the third quarter of 2008 was

increase of $25, pre-tax, in reinsurance recoverables.

The following were the most significant contributors to the Unlock amounts recorded during the third quarter of 2008:

•

Actual separate account returns from the period ending July 31, 2007 to September 30,
2008 were significantly below our aggregated estimated return.

•

The Company reduced its 20 year projected separate account return assumption from 7.8%
to 7.2% in the U.S.

•

In Retirement Plans, the Company reduced its estimate of future fees as plans meet
contractual size limits (“breakpoints”) causing a lower fee schedule to apply and the
Company increased its assumption for future deposits by existing plan participants.

The following were the most significant contributors to the unlock amounts recorded during the third quarter of 2007:

•

Actual separate account returns were above our aggregated estimated return.

•

During the third quarter of 2007, the Company estimated gross profits using the mean of
EGPs derived from a set of stochastic scenarios that have been calibrated to our estimated
separate account return as compared to prior year where we used a single deterministic
estimation. The impact of this change in estimation was a benefit of $13, after-tax, for
Japan variable annuities and $20, after-tax, for U.S. variable annuities.

•

As part of its continual enhancement to its assumption setting processes and in
connection with its assumption study, the Company included dynamic lapse behavior
assumptions. Dynamic lapses reflect that lapse behavior will be different depending upon
market movements. The impact of this assumption change along with other base lapse rate
changes was an approximate benefit of $40, after-tax, for U.S. variable annuities.

F-19


THE HARTFORD FINANCIAL SERVICES GROUP, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)

1. Basis of Presentation and Accounting Policies (continued)

An “Unlock” only revises EGPs to reflect current best estimate assumptions. With or without an
Unlock, and even after an Unlock occurs, the Company must also test the aggregate recoverability of
the DAC and sales inducement assets by comparing the existing DAC balance to the present value of
future EGPs. In addition, the Company routinely stress tests its DAC and sales inducement assets
for recoverability against severe declines in its separate account assets, which could occur if the
equity markets experienced a significant sell-off, as the majority of policyholders’ funds in the
separate accounts is invested in the equity market. As of December 31, 2008, the Company believed
U.S. individual and Japan individual variable annuity EGPs could fall, through a combination of
negative market returns, lapses and mortality, by at least 6% and 49%, respectively, before
portions of its DAC and sales inducement assets would be unrecoverable.

Property & Casualty

— The Property & Casualty operations also incur costs, including commissions,
premium taxes and certain underwriting and policy issuance costs, that vary with and are related
primarily to the acquisition of property and casualty insurance business. These costs are deferred
and amortized ratably over the period the related premiums are earned. Deferred acquisition costs
are reviewed to determine if they are recoverable from future income, and if not, are charged to
expense. Anticipated investment income is considered in the determination of the recoverability of
deferred policy acquisition costs. For the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, no amount
of deferred policy acquisition costs was charged to expense based on determination of
recoverability.

Reserve for Future Policy Benefits and Unpaid Losses and Loss Adjustment Expenses

Life

— Liabilities for the Company’s group life and disability contracts as well its individual
term life insurance policies include amounts for unpaid losses and future policy benefits.
Liabilities for unpaid losses include estimates of amounts to fully settle known reported claims as
well as claims related to insured events that the Company estimates have been incurred but have not
yet been reported. Liabilities for future policy benefits are calculated by the net level premium
method using interest, withdrawal and mortality assumptions appropriate at the time the policies
were issued. The methods used in determining the liability for unpaid losses and future policy
benefits are standard actuarial methods recognized by the American Academy of Actuaries. For the
tabular reserves, discount rates are based on the Company’s earned investment yield and the
morbidity/mortality tables used are standard industry tables modified to reflect the Company’s
actual experience when appropriate. In particular, for the Company’s group disability known claim
reserves, the morbidity table for the early durations of claim is based exclusively on the
Company’s experience, incorporating factors such as gender, elimination period and diagnosis.
These reserves are computed such that they are expected to meet the Company’s future policy
obligations. Future policy benefits are computed at amounts that, with additions from estimated
premiums to be received and with interest on such reserves compounded annually at certain assumed
rates, are expected to be sufficient to meet the Company’s policy obligations at their maturities
or in the event of an insured’s death. Changes in or deviations from the assumptions used for
mortality, morbidity, expected future premiums and interest can significantly affect the Company’s
reserve levels and related future operations and, as such, provisions for adverse deviation are
built into the long-tailed liability assumptions.

Certain contracts classified as universal life-type may also include additional death or other
insurance benefit features, such as guaranteed minimum death or income benefits offered with
variable annuity contracts or no lapse guarantees offered with universal life insurance contracts.
An additional liability is established for these benefits by estimating the expected present value
of the benefits in excess of the projected account value in proportion to the present value of
total expected assessments. Excess benefits are accrued as a liability as actual assessments are
recorded. Determination of the expected value of excess benefits and assessments are based on a
range of scenarios and assumptions including those related to market rates of return and
volatility, contract surrender rates and mortality experience. Revisions to assumptions are made
consistent with the Company’s process for a DAC unlock. See Life Deferred Policy Acquisition Costs
and Present value of Future Benefits in this Note.

Property & Casualty

— The Hartford establishes property and casualty reserves to provide for the
estimated costs of paying claims under insurance policies written by the Company. These reserves
include estimates for both claims that have been reported and those that have been incurred but not
reported, and include estimates of all losses and loss adjustment expenses associated with
processing and settling these claims. Estimating the ultimate cost of future losses and loss
adjustment expenses is an uncertain and complex process. This estimation process is based
significantly on the assumption that past developments are an appropriate predictor of future
events, and involves a variety of actuarial techniques that analyze experience, trends and other
relevant factors. The uncertainties involved with the reserving process have become increasingly
difficult due to a number of complex factors including social and economic trends and changes in
the concepts of legal liability and damage awards. Accordingly, final claim settlements may vary
from the present estimates, particularly when those payments may not occur until well into the
future.

F-20


THE HARTFORD FINANCIAL SERVICES GROUP, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)

1. Basis of Presentation and Accounting Policies (continued)

The Hartford regularly reviews the adequacy of its estimated losses and loss adjustment expense
reserves by line of business within the various reporting segments. Adjustments to previously
established reserves are reflected in the operating results of the period in which the adjustment
is determined to be necessary. Such adjustments could possibly be significant, reflecting any
variety of new and adverse or favorable trends.

Most of the Company’s property and casualty reserves are not discounted. However, the Company has
discounted liabilities funded through structured settlements and has discounted certain reserves
for indemnity payments due to permanently disabled claimants under workers’ compensation policies.
Structured settlements are agreements that provide fixed periodic payments to claimants and
include annuities purchased to fund unpaid losses for permanently disabled claimants and, prior to
2008, agreements that funded loss run-offs for unrelated parties. Most of the annuities have been
purchased from Life and these structured settlements are recorded at present value as annuity
obligations of Life, either within the reserve for future policy benefits if the annuity benefits
are life-contingent or within other policyholder funds and benefits payable if the annuity benefits
are not life-contingent. If not funded through an annuity, reserves for certain indemnity
payments due to permanently disabled claimants under workers’ compensation policies are recorded as
property and casualty reserves and were discounted to present value at an average interest rate of
5.4% in 2008 and 5.5% in 2007. Reserves for structured settlements that funded loss run-offs for
unrelated parties were discounted at an average interest rate of 5.5% in 2007.

As of December 31, 2008 and 2007, property and casualty reserves were discounted by a total of $488
and $568, respectively. The current accident year benefit from discounting property and casualty
reserves was $38 in 2008, $46 in 2007 and $63 in 2006. Contributing to the decrease in the current
accident year benefit from discounting over the past three years has been a reduction in the
discount rate, reflecting a lower risk-free rate of return over that period. Accretion of
discounts for prior accident years totaled $26 in 2008, $31 in 2007, and $32 in 2006. For
annuities issued by Life to fund certain P&C workers’ compensation indemnity payments where the
claimant has not released the P&C Company of its obligation, Life has recorded annuity obligations
totaling $945 as of December 31, 2008 and $962 as of December 31, 2007.

Other Policyholder Funds and Benefits Payable

The Company has classified its fixed and variable annuities, 401(k), certain governmental
annuities, private placement life insurance (“PPLI”), variable universal life insurance, universal
life insurance and interest sensitive whole life insurance as universal life-type contracts. The
liability for universal life-type contracts is equal to the balance that accrues to the benefit of
the policyholders as of the financial statement date (commonly referred to as the account value),
including credited interest, amounts that have been assessed to compensate the Company for services
to be performed over future periods, and any amounts previously assessed against policyholders that
are refundable on termination of the contract.

The Company has classified its institutional and governmental products, without life contingencies,
including funding agreements, certain structured settlements and guaranteed investment contracts,
as investment contracts. The liability for investment contracts is equal to the balance that
accrues to the benefit of the contract holder as of the financial statement date, which includes
the accumulation of deposits plus credited interest, less withdrawals and amounts assessed through
the financial statement date. Contract holder funds include funding agreements held by Variable
Interest Entities issuing medium-term notes.

Revenue Recognition

Life

— For investment and universal life-type contracts, the amounts collected from policyholders
are considered deposits and are not included in revenue. Fee income for universal life-type
contracts consists of policy charges for policy administration, cost of insurance charges and
surrender charges assessed against policyholders’ account balances and are recognized in the period
in which services are provided. For the Company’s traditional life and group disability products
premiums are recognized as revenue when due from policyholders.

Property & Casualty

— Property and casualty insurance premiums are earned on a pro rata basis over
the lives of the policies and include accruals for ultimate premium revenue anticipated under
auditable and retrospectively rated policies. Unearned premiums represent the premiums applicable
to the unexpired terms of policies in force. An estimated allowance for doubtful accounts is
recorded on the basis of periodic evaluations of balances due from insureds, management’s
experience and current economic conditions. The allowance for doubtful accounts included in
premiums receivable and agents’ balances in the consolidated balance sheets was $125 and $126 as of
December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Other revenue consists primarily of revenues associated
with the Company’s servicing businesses.

Foreign Currency Translation

Foreign currency translation gains and losses are reflected in stockholders’ equity as a component
of accumulated other comprehensive income. The Company’s foreign subsidiaries’ balance sheet
accounts are translated at the exchange rates in effect at each year end and income statement
accounts are translated at the average rates of exchange prevailing during the year. The national
currencies of the international operations are generally their functional currencies.

Dividends to Policyholders

Policyholder dividends are paid to certain life and property and casualty policies, which are
referred to as participating policies. Such dividends are accrued using an estimate of the amount
to be paid based on underlying contractual obligations under policies and applicable state laws.

Life

— Participating life insurance in force accounted for 7%, 7% and 3% as of December 31, 2008,
2007 and 2006, respectively, of total life insurance in force. Dividends to policyholders were
$14, $11 and $22 for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. There were no
additional amounts of income allocated to participating policyholders. If limitations exist on the
amount of net income from participating life insurance contracts that may be distributed to
stockholders, the policyholder’s share of net income on those contracts that cannot be distributed
is excluded from stockholders’ equity by a charge to operations and a credit to a liability.

Property & Casualty

— Net written premiums for participating property and casualty insurance
policies represented 8% of total net written premiums for each of the years ended December 31,
2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Participating dividends to policyholders were $21, $19 and $6
for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively.

Mutual Funds

The Company maintains a retail mutual fund operation, whereby the Company, through wholly-owned
subsidiaries, provides investment management and administrative services to The Hartford Mutual
Funds, Inc. and The Hartford Mutual Funds II, Inc (“The mutual funds”), families of 62 mutual funds
and 1 closed end fund. The Company charges fees to the shareholders of the mutual funds, which are
recorded as revenue by the Company. Investors can purchase “shares” in the mutual funds, all of
which are registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), in accordance with the
Investment Company Act of 1940.

The mutual funds are owned by the shareholders of those funds and not by the Company. As such, the
mutual fund assets and liabilities and related investment returns are not reflected in the
Company’s consolidated financial statements since they are not assets, liabilities and operations
of the Company.

Reinsurance

Through both facultative and treaty reinsurance agreements, the Company cedes a share of the risks
it has underwritten to other insurance companies. Assumed reinsurance refers to the Company’s
acceptance of certain insurance risks that other insurance companies have underwritten.

Reinsurance accounting is followed for ceded and assumed transactions when the risk transfer
provisions of SFAS 113, “Accounting and Reporting for Reinsurance of Short-Duration and
Long-Duration Contracts,” have been met. To meet risk transfer requirements, a reinsurance
contract must include insurance risk, consisting of both underwriting and timing risk, and a
reasonable possibility of a significant loss to the reinsurer.

Earned premiums and incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses reflect the net effects of ceded
and assumed reinsurance transactions. Included in other assets are prepaid reinsurance premiums,
which represent the portion of premiums ceded to reinsurers applicable to the unexpired terms of
the reinsurance contracts. Reinsurance recoverables include balances due from reinsurance
companies for paid and unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses and are presented net of an
allowance for uncollectible reinsurance. The allowance for uncollectible reinsurance was $379 and
$404 as of December 31, 2008, and 2007, respectively.

Income Taxes

The Company recognizes taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred taxes for the
tax consequences of differences between the financial reporting and tax basis of assets and
liabilities. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to
apply to taxable income in the years the temporary differences are expected to reverse. See Note
13 for a further discussion of the accounting for income taxes.

Property and Equipment

Property and equipment is carried at cost net, of accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is based
on the estimated useful lives of the various classes of property and equipment and is determined
principally on the straight-line method. Accumulated depreciation was $1.6 billion and $1.4
billion as of December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Depreciation expense was $228, $232 and
$193 for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively.

Goodwill

Goodwill represents the excess of costs over the fair value of net assets acquired. Goodwill is
not amortized but is reviewed for impairment at least annually or more frequently if events occur
or circumstances change that would indicate that a triggering event, as defined in SFAS 142,
“Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets” (SFAS 142), has occurred. The goodwill impairment test
follows a two step process as defined in SFAS 142. In the first step, the fair value of a
reporting unit is compared to its carrying value. If the carrying value of a reporting unit
exceeds its fair value, the second step of the impairment test is performed for purposes of
measuring the impairment. In the second step, the fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to
all of the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit to determine an implied goodwill value.
This allocation is similar to a purchase price allocation performed in purchase accounting. If the
carrying amount of the reporting unit goodwill exceeds the implied goodwill value, an impairment
loss shall be recognized in an amount equal to that excess.

Pension Plans and Postretirement Health Care and Life Insurance Benefit Plans

The Company maintains a U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plan (the “Plan”) that covers
substantially all employees, as well as unfunded excess plans to provide benefits in excess of
amounts permitted to be paid to participants of the Plan under the provisions of the Internal
Revenue Code. The Company has also entered into individual retirement agreements with certain
retired directors providing for unfunded supplemental pension benefits. In addition, the Company
provides certain health care and life insurance benefits for eligible retired employees. Pursuant
to accounting principles related to the Company’s pension and other postretirement obligations to
employees under its various benefit plans, the Company is required to make a significant number of
assumptions in order to calculate the related liabilities and expenses each period. See Note 17
for more information regarding our accounting for pension plans and postretirement health care and
life insurance benefit plans.

Contingencies

Management follows the requirements of SFAS No. 5 “Accounting for Contingencies.” This statement
requires management to evaluate each contingent matter separately. A loss is recorded if probable
and reasonably estimable. Management establishes reserves for these contingencies at its “best
estimate,” or, if no one number within the range of possible losses is more probable than any
other, the Company records an estimated reserve at the low end of the range of losses.

2. Earnings per Share

Earnings per share amounts have been computed in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 128,
“Earnings per Share” (“SFAS 128”). The following tables present a reconciliation of net income and
shares used in calculating basic earnings per share to those used in calculating diluted earnings
per share.

[1]

Due to the net loss for the year ended December 31, 2008, no allocation of the net loss was made to the preferred
shareholders under the two-class method in the calculation of basic earnings per share, as the preferred shareholders had
no contractual obligation to fund the net losses of the Company. In the absence of the net loss, any such income would be
allocated to the preferred shareholders based on the weighted average number of preferred shares outstanding as of December
31, 2008.

[2]

As a result of the net loss in the year ended December 31, 2008, SFAS 128 requires the Company to use basic weighted
average common shares outstanding in the calculation of the year ended December 31, 2008 diluted loss per share, since the
inclusion of shares for stock compensation plans of 1.3 million and the assumed conversion of the preferred shares to
common of 5.0 million would have been antidilutive to the earnings per share calculation. In the absence of the net loss,
weighted average common shares outstanding and dilutive potential common shares would have totaled 313.0 million.

[3]

Effective January 9, 2009, 6.0 million preferred shares converted to 24.2 million common shares.

Basic earnings per share is computed based on the weighted average number of common shares
outstanding during the year. Diluted earnings per share include the dilutive effect of stock
compensation plans, warrants, and the Company’s equity units, if any, using the treasury stock
method. Contingently issuable shares are included for the number of shares issuable assuming the
end of the reporting period was the end of the contingency period, if dilutive.

Under the treasury stock method for stock compensation plans, shares are assumed to be issued and
then reduced for the number of shares repurchaseable with theoretical proceeds at the average
market price for the period. Theoretical proceeds for the stock compensation plans include option
exercise price payments, unamortized stock compensation expense and tax benefits realized in excess
of the tax benefit recognized in net income. The difference between the number of shares assumed
issued and number of shares purchased represents the dilutive shares. Upon exercise of outstanding
options or vesting of other stock compensation plan awards, the additional shares issued and
outstanding are included in the calculation of the Company’s weighted average shares from the date
of exercise or vesting.

Under the treasury stock method for the warrants issued to Allianz (see Note 21) exercise shall be
assumed at the beginning of the period. The proceeds from exercise of $25.32 per share shall be
assumed to be used to purchase common shares at the average market price during the period. Since
the average market price of the common stock during the year ended December 31, 2008 exceeded the
exercise price of the warrants of $25.32, there is no dilutive effect for the warrants for the year
ended December 31, 2008.

THE HARTFORD FINANCIAL SERVICES GROUP, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)

2. Earnings per Share (continued)

Under the treasury stock method for the equity units, the number of shares of common stock used in
calculating diluted earnings per share is increased by the excess, if any, of the number of shares
issuable upon settlement of the purchase contracts, over the number of shares that could be
purchased by The Hartford in the market using the proceeds received upon settlement. The number of
issuable shares was based on the average market price for the last 20 trading days of the period.
The number of shares purchased was based on the average market price during the entire period.
Upon settlement of the purchase contracts associated with the Company’s equity units, the
associated common shares were added to the Company’s issued and outstanding shares. For further
discussion of the Company’s equity units offerings, see Note 15.

3. Segment Information

The Hartford is organized into two major operations: Life and Property & Casualty, each containing
reporting segments. Within the Life and Property & Casualty operations, The Hartford conducts
business principally in eleven reporting segments. Corporate primarily includes the Company’s debt
financing and related interest expense, as well as other capital raising activities and purchase
accounting adjustments.

Life

Life’s business is conducted by Hartford Life, Inc. (“Hartford Life” or “Life”), an indirect
subsidiary of The Hartford, headquartered in Simsbury, Connecticut, and is a financial services and
insurance organization. Life is organized into four groups which are comprised of six reporting
segments: The Retail Products Group (“Retail”) and Individual Life segments make up the Individual
Markets Groups. The Retirement Plans and Group Benefits segments make up the Employer Markets
Group. The International and Institutional Solutions Group (“Institutional”) segments each make up
their own group.

Retail offers individual variable and fixed market value adjusted (“MVA”) annuities, retail mutual
funds, 529 college savings plans, Canadian and offshore investment products.

Individual Life sells a variety of life insurance products, including variable universal life,
universal life, interest sensitive whole life and term life.

Retirement Plans provides products and services to corporations pursuant to Section 401(k) and
products and services to municipalities and not-for-profit organizations under Section 457 and
403(b) of the IRS code. Retirement Plans also offers mutual funds to institutional investors.

Group Benefits provides individual members of employer groups, associations, affinity groups and
financial institutions with group life, accident and disability coverage, along with other products
and services, including voluntary benefits, and group retiree health.

International, which has operations located in Japan, Brazil, Ireland and the United Kingdom,
provides investments, retirement savings and other insurance and savings products to individuals
and groups outside the United States and Canada.

Institutional primarily offers institutional liability products, including stable value products,
structured settlements and institutional annuities (primarily terminal funding cases), as well as
variable Private Placement Life Insurance (“PPLI”) owned by corporations and high net worth
individuals. Institutional also offers mutual funds to institutional investors. Furthermore,
Institutional offers additional individual products including structured settlements, single
premium immediate annuities and longevity assurance.

Life includes within its Other segment its leveraged PPLI product line of business; corporate items
not directly allocated to any of its reportable operating segments; intersegment eliminations and
the mark-to-mark adjustment for the International variable annuity assets that are classified as
equity securities held for trading reported in net investment income and the related change in
interest credited reported as a component of benefits, losses and loss adjustment expenses.

Life charges direct operating expenses to the appropriate segment and allocates the majority of
indirect expenses to the segments based on an intercompany expense arrangement. Inter-segment
revenues primarily occur between Life’s Other category and the reporting segments. These amounts
primarily include interest income on allocated surplus and interest charges on excess separate
account surplus.

The accounting policies of the reporting segments are the same as those described in the summary of
significant accounting policies in Note 1. Life evaluates performance of its segments based on
revenues, net income and the segment’s return on allocated capital. Each reporting segment is
allocated corporate surplus as needed to support its business.

3. Segment Information (continued)

Property & Casualty

Property & Casualty is organized into five reporting segments: the underwriting segments of
Personal Lines, Small Commercial, Middle Market and Specialty Commercial (collectively “Ongoing
Operations”); and the Other Operations segment.

Personal Lines sells automobile, homeowners and home-based business coverages directly to the
consumer and through a network of independent agents. Most of the Company’s personal lines
business sold directly to the consumer is to the members of AARP through a direct marketing
operation. Up until the sale of the business on November 30, 2006, the Company also sold
non-standard auto insurance through the Company’s Omni Insurance Group, Inc. (“Omni”) subsidiary
(refer to Note 20 for further discussion). Personal Lines also operates a member contact center
for health insurance products offered through the AARP Health program. AARP accounts for earned
premiums of $2.8 billion, $2.7 billion, and $2.5 billion in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively,
which represented 27%, 26% and 24% of total Property & Casualty earned premiums for 2008, 2007 and
2006, respectively.

Small Commercial provides standard commercial insurance coverage to small commercial businesses
primarily throughout the United States. Small commercial businesses generally represent companies
with up to $5 in annual payroll, $15 in annual revenues or $15 in total property values. This
segment offers workers’ compensation, property, automobile, liability and umbrella coverages.

Middle Market provides standard commercial insurance coverage to middle market commercial
businesses primarily throughout the United States. This segment offers workers’ compensation,
property, automobile, liability, umbrella, marine and livestock coverages, primarily to companies
with greater than $5 in annual payroll, $15 in annual revenues or $15 in total property values.

The Specialty Commercial segment offers a variety of customized insurance products and risk
management services. Specialty Commercial provides standard commercial insurance products
including workers’ compensation, automobile and liability coverages to large-sized companies.
Specialty Commercial also provides professional liability, fidelity, surety, specialty casualty
coverages, core property and excess and surplus lines coverages not normally written by standard
lines insurers, and insurance products and services to captive insurance companies, pools and
self-insurance groups. In addition, Specialty Commercial provides third party administrator
services for claims administration, integrated benefits and loss control through Specialty Risk
Services, a subsidiary of the Company.

The Other Operations segment consists of certain property and casualty insurance operations of The
Hartford which have discontinued writing new business and includes substantially all of the
Company’s asbestos and environmental exposures.

Through inter-segment arrangements, Specialty Commercial reimburses Personal Lines, Small
Commercial and Middle Market for certain losses, including, among other coverages, losses incurred
from uncollectible reinsurance and losses incurred under certain liability claims. In addition,
the Company retains a portion of the risks ceded under the Company’s principal catastrophe
reinsurance program and other reinsurance programs and, prior to 2007, the financial results of the
Company’s retention were recorded in the Specialty Commercial segment. The amount of premiums
ceded to third party reinsurers under the principal catastrophe reinsurance program and other
reinsurance programs is allocated to the operating segments based on the risks written by each
operating segment that are subject to the programs.

Earned premiums assumed (ceded) under the inter-segment arrangements and retention were as follows:

Financial Measures and Other Segment Information

One of the measures of profit or loss used by The Hartford’s management in evaluating the
performance of its Life segments is net income. Net income is a measure of profit or loss used in
evaluating the performance of Ongoing Operations and the Other Operations segment. Within Ongoing
Operations, the underwriting segments of Personal Lines, Small Commercial, Middle Market and
Specialty Commercial are evaluated by The Hartford’s management primarily based upon underwriting
results. Underwriting results represent premiums earned less incurred losses, loss adjustment
expenses and underwriting expenses. The sum of underwriting results, net investment income, net
realized capital gains and losses, other expenses, and related income taxes is net income (loss).

3. Segment Information (continued)

Certain transactions between segments occur during the year that primarily relate to tax
settlements, insurance coverage, expense reimbursements, services provided, security transfers and
capital contributions. In addition, certain reinsurance stop loss arrangements exist between the
segments which specify that one segment will reimburse another for losses incurred in excess of a
predetermined limit. Also, one segment may purchase group annuity contracts from another to fund
pension costs and annuities to settle casualty claims. In addition, certain inter-segment
transactions occur in Life. These transactions include interest income on allocated surplus.
Consolidated Life net investment income is unaffected by such transactions.

The following tables present revenues and net income (loss). Underwriting results are presented
for the Personal Lines, Small Commercial, Middle Market and Specialty Commercial segments, while
net income is presented for each of Life’s reporting segments, total Property & Casualty Ongoing
Operations, Property & Casualty Other Operations and Corporate.

4. Fair Value Measurements

The following financial instruments are carried at fair value in the Company’s consolidated
financial statements: fixed maturities, equity securities, short-term investments, freestanding and
embedded derivatives, and separate account assets. These fair value disclosures include
information regarding the valuation of the Company’s guaranteed benefits products and the impact of
the adoption of SFAS 157, followed by the fair value measurement and disclosure requirements of
SFAS 157 and SFAS No. 107, “Disclosures about Fair Value of Financial Instruments”.

Accounting for Guaranteed Benefits Offered With Variable Annuities

Many of the variable annuity contracts issued by the Company offer various guaranteed minimum
death, withdrawal, income and accumulation benefits. Those benefits are accounted for under SFAS
133 or AICPA Statement of Position No. 03-1 “Accounting and Reporting by Insurance Enterprises for
Certain Nontraditional Long-Duration Contracts and for Separate Accounts” (“SOP 03-1”). Guaranteed
minimum benefits often meet the definition of an embedded derivative under SFAS 133 as they have
notional amounts (the guaranteed balance) and underlyings (the investment fund options), they
require no initial net investment and they have terms that require or permit net settlement.
However, certain guaranteed minimum benefits settle only upon a single insurable event, such as
death (guaranteed minimum death benefits or “GMDB”) or living (life contingent portion of
guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefits or “GMWB”), and as such are outside of the scope of SFAS 133
under the “insurance contract exception”. Other guaranteed minimum benefits require settlement in
the form of a long-term financing transaction, such as is typical with guaranteed minimum income
benefits (“GMIB”), and as such do not meet the net settlement requirement in SFAS 133. Guaranteed
minimum benefits that are outside of the scope of SFAS 133 or do not meet the net settlement
requirements of SFAS 133 are accounted for as insurance benefits under SOP 03-1.

Guaranteed Benefits Accounted for at Fair Value Prior to SFAS 157

The non-life-contingent portion of the Company’s GMWBs and guaranteed minimum accumulation benefits
(“GMAB”) meet the definition of an embedded derivative under SFAS 133, and as such are recorded at
fair value with changes in fair value recorded in net realized capital gains (losses) in net
income. In bifurcating the embedded derivative, the Company attributes to the derivative a portion
of total fees, in basis points, to be collected from the contract holder (the “Attributed Fees”).
Attributed Fees are set equal to the present value of future claims, in basis points, (excluding
margins for risk) expected to be paid for the guaranteed living benefit embedded derivative at the
inception of the contract. The excess of total fees collected from the contract holder over the
Attributed Fees are associated with the host variable annuity contract and are recorded in fee
income. In subsequent valuations, both the present value of future claims expected to be paid and
the present value of Attributed Fees expected to be collected are revalued based on current market
conditions and policyholder behavior assumptions. The difference between each of the two
components represents the fair value of the embedded derivative.

GMWBs provide the policyholder with a guaranteed remaining balance (“GRB”) if the account value is
reduced to a contractually specified minimum level, through a combination of market declines and
withdrawals. The GRB is generally equal to premiums less withdrawals. If the GRB exceeds the
account value for any policy, the contract is “in-the-money” by the difference between the GRB and
the account value.

During the first quarter of 2007, the Company launched its “3Win” product with both GMAB and GMIB
riders attached to certain Japanese variable annuity contracts. The GMAB provides the policyholder
with the GRB if the account value is less than premiums after an accumulation period, generally 10
years, and if the account value has not dropped below 80% of the initial deposit, at which point a
GMIB must either be exercised or the policyholder can elect to surrender 80% of the initial deposit
without a surrender charge. The GRB is generally equal to premiums less surrenders. During the
fourth quarter of 2008, nearly all contract holder account values had dropped below 80% of the
initial deposit, at which point the GMIB was exercised

A GMWB and/or GMAB contract is ‘in the money’ if the contract holder’s guaranteed remaining benefit
becomes greater than the account value. As of December 31, 2008 and December 31, 2007, 88% and 19%,
respectively, of all unreinsured U.S. GMWB ‘in-force’ contracts were ‘in the money’. For U.S. and
International GMWB contracts that were ‘in the money’ the Company’s exposure to the guaranteed
remaining benefit, after reinsurance, as of December 31, 2008 and December 31, 2007, was $7.7
billion and $146, respectively. For GMAB contracts that were ‘in the money’ the Company’s exposure
to the guaranteed remaining benefit, as of December 31, 2008 and December 31, 2007, was $15 and
$38, respectively.

However, the only ways the GMWB contract holder can monetize the excess of the GRB over the account
value of the contract is upon death or if their account value is reduced to a contractually
specified minimum level, through a combination of a series of withdrawals that do not exceed a
specific percentage of the premiums paid per year and market declines. If the account value is
reduced to the contractually specified minimum level, the contract holder will receive an annuity
equal to the remaining GRB and for the Company’s “lifetime” GMWB products, payments can continue
beyond the GRB. As the amount of the excess of the GRB over the account value can fluctuate with
equity market returns on a daily basis and the ultimate lifetime GMWB payments can exceed the GRB,
the ultimate amount to be paid by the Company, if any, is uncertain and could be significantly more
or less than $7.7 billion.

For GMAB contracts, the only ways the contract holder can monetize the excess of the GRB over the
account value of the contract is upon death or by waiting until the end of the contractual deferral
period of 10 years. As the amount of the excess of the GRB over the account value can fluctuate
with equity market returns on a daily basis, the ultimate amount to be paid by the Company, if any,
is uncertain and could be significantly more or less than $15.

Derivatives That Hedge Capital Markets Risk for Guaranteed Minimum Benefits Accounted for as
Derivatives

Changes in capital markets or policyholder behavior may increase or decrease the Company’s exposure
to benefits under the guarantees. The Company uses derivative transactions, including GMWB
reinsurance (described below) which meets the definition of a derivative under SFAS 133 and
customized derivative transactions, to mitigate some of that exposure. Derivatives are recorded at
fair value with changes in fair value recorded in net realized capital gains (losses) in net
income.

GMWB Reinsurance

The Company has entered into reinsurance arrangements to offset a portion of its exposure to the
GMWB for the remaining lives of covered contracts. Reinsurance contracts covering GMWB are
considered freestanding derivatives that are recorded at fair value, with changes in fair value
recorded in net realized gains/losses in net income.

Customized Derivatives

The Company has entered into customized swap contracts to hedge certain risk components for the
remaining term of certain blocks of non-reinsured U.S. GMWB riders. These customized derivative
contracts provide protection from capital markets risks based on policyholder behavior assumptions
specified by the Company at the inception of the derivative transactions. Due to the significance
of the non-observable inputs associated with pricing swap contracts entered into in 2007, the
initial difference between the transaction price and modeled value of $51 was deferred in
accordance with EITF 02-3 and included in other assets in the consolidated balance sheets. The
swap contract entered into in 2008 resulted in a loss at inception of approximately $20 before the
effects of DAC amortization and income taxes, as market values on similar instruments were lower
than the transaction price.

Other Derivative Instruments

The Company uses other hedging instruments to partially hedge its unreinsured GMWB exposure. These
instruments include interest rate futures and swaps, variance swaps, S&P 500 and NASDAQ index put
options and futures contracts. The Company also uses EAFE Index swaps to hedge GMWB exposure to
international equity markets. The Company also utilizes option contracts as well as futures
contracts to partially economically hedge the statutory reserve impact of equity risk arising
primarily from GMDB and GMWB obligations against a decline in the equity markets.

Adoption of SFAS 157 for Guaranteed Benefits Offered With Variable Annuities That are Required to
be Fair Valued

Fair values for GMWB and GMAB contracts and the related reinsurance and customized derivatives that
hedge certain equity markets exposure for GMWB contracts are calculated based upon internally
developed models because active, observable markets do not exist for those items. Below is a
description of the Company’s fair value methodologies for guaranteed benefit liabilities, the
related reinsurance and customized derivatives, all accounted for under SFAS 133, prior to the
adoption of SFAS 157 and subsequent to adoption of SFAS 157.

Pre-SFAS 157 Fair Value

Prior to January 1, 2008, the Company used the guidance prescribed in SFAS 133 and other related
accounting literature on fair value which represented the amount for which a financial instrument
could be exchanged in a current transaction between knowledgeable, unrelated willing parties.
However, under that accounting literature, when an estimate of fair value was made for liabilities
where no market observable transactions existed for that liability or similar liabilities, market
risk margins were only included in the valuation if the margin was identifiable, measurable and
significant. If a reliable estimate of market risk margins was not obtainable, the present value
of expected future cash flows under a risk neutral framework, discounted at the risk free rate of
interest, was the best available estimate of fair value in the circumstances (“Pre-SFAS 157 Fair
Value”).

F-32


THE HARTFORD FINANCIAL SERVICES GROUP, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)

4. Fair Value Measurements (continued)

The Pre-SFAS 157 Fair Value was calculated based on actuarial and capital market assumptions
related to projected cash flows, including benefits and related contract charges, over the lives of
the contracts, incorporating expectations concerning policyholder behavior such as lapses, fund
selection, resets and withdrawal utilization (for the customized derivatives, policyholder behavior
is prescribed in the derivative contract). Because of the dynamic and complex nature of these cash
flows, best estimate assumptions and a Monte Carlo stochastic process involving the generation of
thousands of scenarios that assume risk neutral returns consistent with swap rates and a blend of
observable implied index volatility levels were used. Estimating these cash flows involved
numerous estimates and subjective judgments including those regarding expected markets rates of
return, market volatility, correlations of market index returns to funds, fund performance,
discount rates and policyholder behavior. At each valuation date, the Company assumed expected
returns based on:

•

risk-free rates as represented by the current LIBOR forward curve rates;

•

forward market volatility assumptions for each underlying index based primarily on a blend
of observed market “implied volatility” data;

•

correlations of market returns across underlying indices based on actual observed market
returns and relationships over the ten years preceding the valuation date;

•

three years of history for fund regression; and

•

current risk-free spot rates as represented by the current LIBOR spot curve to determine
the present value of expected future cash flows produced in the stochastic projection process.

As many guaranteed benefit obligations are relatively new in the marketplace, actual policyholder
behavior experience is limited. As a result, estimates of future policyholder behavior are
subjective and based on analogous internal and external data. As markets change, mature and evolve
and actual policyholder behavior emerges, management continually evaluates the appropriateness of
its assumptions for this component of the fair value model.

Fair Value Under SFAS 157

The Company’s SFAS 157 fair value is calculated as an aggregation of the following components:
Pre-SFAS 157 Fair Value; Actively-Managed Volatility Adjustment; Credit Standing Adjustment; Market
Illiquidity Premium; and Behavior Risk Margin. The resulting aggregation is reconciled or
calibrated, if necessary, to market information that is, or may be, available to the Company, but
may not be observable by other market participants, including reinsurance discussions and
transactions. The Company believes the aggregation of each of these components, as necessary and
as reconciled or calibrated to the market information available to the Company, results in an
amount that the Company would be required to transfer, for a liability or receive for an asset, to
market participants in an active liquid market, if one existed, for those market participants to
assume the risks associated with the guaranteed minimum benefits and the related reinsurance and
customized derivatives required to be fair valued. The SFAS 157 fair value is likely to materially
diverge from the ultimate settlement of the liability as the Company believes settlement will be
based on our best estimate assumptions rather than those best estimate assumptions plus risk
margins. In the absence of any transfer of the guaranteed benefit liability to a third party, the
release of risk margins is likely to be reflected as realized gains in future periods’ net income.
Each of the components described below are unobservable in the marketplace and require subjectivity
by the Company in determining their value.

•

Actively-Managed Volatility Adjustment.

This component incorporates the basis differential
between the observable index implied volatilities used to calculate the Pre-SFAS 157 component
and the actively-managed funds underlying the variable annuity product. The Actively-Managed
Volatility Adjustment is calculated using historical fund and weighted index volatilities.

•

Credit Standing Adjustment.

This component makes an adjustment that market participants
would make to reflect the risk that guaranteed benefit obligations or the GMWB reinsurance
recoverables will not be fulfilled (“nonperformance risk”). SFAS 157 explicitly requires
nonperformance risk to be reflected in fair value. The Company calculates the Credit Standing
Adjustment by using default rates provided by rating agencies, adjusted for market
recoverability, reflecting the long-term nature of living benefit obligations and the priority
of payment on these obligations versus long-term debt.

•

Market Illiquidity Premium.

This component makes an adjustment that market participants
would require to reflect that guaranteed benefit obligations are illiquid and have no market
observable exit prices in the capital markets.

•

Behavior Risk Margin.

This component adds a margin that market participants would require
for the risk that the Company’s assumptions about policyholder behavior used in the Pre-SFAS
157 model could differ from actual experience. The Behavior Risk Margin is calculated by
taking the difference between adverse policyholder behavior assumptions and the best estimate
assumptions used in the Pre-SFAS 157 model using interest rate and volatility assumptions that
the Company believes market participants would use in developing risk margins.

SFAS 157 Transition

The Company applied the provisions of SFAS 157 prospectively to financial instruments that are
recorded at fair value including guaranteed living benefits that are required to be fair valued.
The Company also applied the provisions of SFAS 157 using limited retrospective application (i.e.,
cumulative effect adjustment through opening retained earnings) to certain customized derivatives
historically measured at fair value in accordance with EITF 02-3.

The impact on January 1, 2008 of adopting SFAS 157 for guaranteed benefits accounted for under SFAS
133 and the related reinsurance was a reduction to net income of $220, after the effects of DAC
amortization and income taxes.

Moreover, the adoption of SFAS 157 has resulted in lower variable annuity fee income for new
business issued in 2008 as Attributed Fees have increased consistent with incorporating additional
risk margins and other indicia of “exit value” in the valuation of the embedded derivative. The
level of Attributed Fees for new business each quarter also depends on the level of equity index
volatility, as well as other factors, including interest rates. As equity index volatility has
risen, interest rates have declined, and the Company adopted SFAS 157, the fees ascribed to the new
business cohorts issued in 2008 have risen to levels above the rider fee for most products. The
extent of any excess of Attributed Fee over rider fee will vary by product.

The Company also recognized a decrease in opening retained earnings of $51 in relation to the loss
deferred in accordance with EITF 02-3 on customized derivatives purchased in 2007, and used to
hedge a portion of the U.S. GMWB risk. In addition, the change in value of the customized
derivatives due to the initial adoption of SFAS 157 of $41 was recorded as an increase in opening
retained earnings with subsequent changes in fair value recorded in net realized capital gains
(losses) in net income. After amortization of DAC and the effect of income taxes, the impact on
opening retained earnings is a decrease of $3.

The Company’s adoption of SFAS 157 did not materially impact the fair values of other financial
instruments, including, but not limited to, other derivative instruments used to hedge guaranteed
minimum benefits.

Fair Value Disclosures

The following section applies the SFAS 157 fair value hierarchy and disclosure requirements to the
Company’s financial instruments that are carried at fair value. SFAS 157 establishes a fair value
hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs in the valuation techniques used to measure fair value into
three broad Levels (Level 1, 2 or 3).

Level 1

Observable inputs that reflect quoted prices for identical assets
or liabilities in active markets that the Company has the ability
to access at the measurement date. Level 1 securities include
highly liquid U.S. Treasury securities, money market funds,
certain mortgage backed securities, and exchange traded equity and
derivative securities.

Level 2

Observable inputs, other than quoted prices included in Level 1,
for the asset or liability or prices for similar assets and
liabilities. Most debt securities and some preferred stocks are
model priced by vendors using observable inputs and are classified
within Level 2. Also included in the Level 2 category are
derivative instruments that are priced using models with
observable market inputs, including interest rate, foreign
currency and certain credit swap contracts.

Level 3

Valuations that are derived from techniques in which one or more
of the significant inputs are unobservable (including assumptions
about risk). Level 3 securities include less liquid securities
such as highly structured and/or lower quality asset-backed
securities (“ABS”) and commercial mortgage-backed securities
(“CMBS”), including ABS backed by sub-prime loans, and private
placement debt and equity securities. Embedded derivatives and
complex derivatives securities, including equity derivatives,
longer dated interest rate swaps and certain complex credit
derivatives are also included in Level 3. Because Level 3 fair
values, by their nature, contain unobservable market inputs as
there is no observable market for these assets and liabilities,
considerable judgment is used to determine the SFAS 157 Level 3
fair values. Level 3 fair values represent the Company’s best
estimate of an amount that could be realized in a current market
exchange absent actual market exchanges.

In many situations, inputs used to measure the fair value of an asset or liability position may
fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy. In these situations, the Company will
determine the level in which the fair value falls based upon the lowest level input that is
significant to the determination of the fair value. In most cases, both observable (e.g., changes
in interest rates) and unobservable (e.g., changes in risk assumptions) inputs are used in the
determination of fair values that the Company has classified within Level 3. Consequently, these
values and the related gains and losses are based upon both observable and unobservable inputs.

Determination of fair values

The valuation methodologies used to determine the fair values of assets and liabilities under the
“exit price” notion of SFAS 157 reflect market-participant objectives and are based on the
application of the fair value hierarchy that prioritizes observable market inputs over unobservable
inputs. The Company determines the fair values of certain financial assets and financial
liabilities based on quoted market prices, where available. The Company also determines fair value
based on future cash flows discounted at the appropriate current market rate. Fair values reflect
adjustments for counterparty credit quality, the Company’s credit standing, liquidity and, where
appropriate, risk margins on unobservable parameters. The following is a discussion of the
methodologies used to determine fair values for the financial instruments listed in the above
table.

Fixed Maturity, Short-Term, and Equity Securities, Available- for-Sale

The fair value of fixed maturity, short-term, and equity securities, available for sale, is
determined by management after considering one of three primary sources of information: third party
pricing services, independent broker quotations, or pricing matrices. Security pricing is applied
using a “waterfall” approach whereby publicly available prices are first sought from third party
pricing services, the remaining unpriced securities are submitted to independent brokers for
prices, or lastly, securities are priced using a pricing matrix. Typical inputs used by these
three pricing methods include, but are not limited to, reported trades, benchmark yields, issuer
spreads, bids, offers, and/or estimated cash flows and prepayments speeds. Based on the typical
trading volumes and the lack of quoted market prices for fixed maturities, third party pricing
services normally derive the security prices through recent reported trades for identical or
similar securities making adjustments through the reporting date based upon available market
observable information outlined above. If there are no recent reported trades, the third party
pricing services and brokers may use matrix or model processes to develop a security price where
future cash flow expectations are developed based upon collateral performance and discounted at an
estimated market rate. Included in the pricing of ABS, collateralized mortgage obligations
(“CMOs”), and mortgage-backed securities (“MBS”) are estimates of the rate of future prepayments of
principal over the remaining life of the securities. Such estimates are derived based on the
characteristics of the underlying structure and prepayment speeds previously experienced at the
interest rate levels projected for the underlying collateral. Actual prepayment experience may
vary from these estimates.

Prices from third party pricing services are often unavailable for securities that are rarely
traded or traded only in privately negotiated transactions. As a result, certain securities are
priced via independent broker quotations which utilize inputs that may be difficult to corroborate
with observable market based data. Additionally, the majority of these independent broker
quotations are non-binding. A pricing matrix is used to price securities for which the Company is
unable to obtain either a price from a third party pricing service or an independent broker
quotation. The pricing matrix used by the Company begins with current spread levels to determine
the market price for the security. The credit spreads, as assigned by a knowledgeable private
placement broker, incorporate the issuer’s credit rating and a risk premium, if warranted, due to
the issuer’s industry and the security’s time to maturity. The issuer-specific yield adjustments,
which can be positive or negative, are updated twice per year, as of June 30 and December 31, by
the private placement broker and are intended to adjust security prices for issuer-specific
factors. The Company assigns a credit rating to these securities based upon an internal analysis
of the issuer’s financial strength.

The Company performs a monthly analysis on the prices and credit spreads received from third
parties to ensure that the prices represent a reasonable estimate of the fair value. This process
involves quantitative and qualitative analysis and is overseen by investment and accounting
professionals. Examples of procedures performed include, but are not limited to, initial and
on-going review of third party pricing services methodologies, review of pricing statistics and
trends, back testing recent trades and monitoring of trading volumes. In addition, the Company
ensures whether prices received from independent brokers represent a reasonable estimate of fair
value through the use of internal and external cash flow models developed based on spreads and,
when available, market indices. As a result of this analysis, if the Company determines there is a
more appropriate fair value based upon the available market data, the price received from the third
party is adjusted accordingly. At December 31, 2008, the Company made fair value determinations
which lowered prices received from third party pricing services and brokers by a total of $139. The
securities adjusted had an amortized cost and fair value after adjustment, of $623 and $232,
respectively, and were primarily CMBS securities.

In accordance with SFAS 157, the Company has analyzed the third party pricing services’ valuation
methodologies and related inputs, and has also evaluated the various types of securities in its
investment portfolio to determine an appropriate SFAS 157 fair value hierarchy level based upon
trading activity and the observability of market inputs. Based on this evaluation and investment
class analysis, each price was classified into Level 1, 2 or 3. Most prices provided by third
party pricing services are classified into Level 2 because the inputs used in pricing the
securities are market observable.

Due to a general lack of transparency in the process that the brokers use to develop prices, most
valuations that are based on brokers’ prices are classified as Level 3. Some valuations may be
classified as Level 2 if the price can be corroborated. Internal matrix-priced securities,
primarily consisting of certain private placement debt, are also classified as Level 3. The matrix
pricing of certain private placement debt includes significant non-observable inputs, the
internally determined credit rating of the security and an externally provided credit spread.

Derivative Instruments, including embedded derivatives within investments

Derivative instruments are reported on the consolidated balance sheets at fair value and are
reported in Other Investments and Other Liabilities. Embedded derivatives are reported with the
host instruments on the consolidated balance sheet. Derivative instruments are fair valued using
pricing valuation models, which utilize market data inputs or independent broker quotations.
Excluding embedded derivatives, as of December 31, 2008, 94% of derivatives based upon notional
values were priced by valuation models, which utilize independent market data. The remaining
derivatives were priced by broker quotations. The derivatives are valued using mid-market inputs
that are predominantly observable in the market. Inputs used to value derivatives include, but are
not limited to, interest swap rates, foreign currency forward and spot rates, credit spreads and
correlations, interest and equity volatility and equity index levels. The Company performs a
monthly analysis on derivative valuations which includes both quantitative and qualitative
analysis. Examples of procedures performed include, but are not limited to, review of pricing
statistics and trends, back testing recent trades, analyzing the impacts of changes in the market
environment, and review of changes in market value for each derivative including those derivatives
priced by brokers.

Derivative instruments classified as Level 1 include futures and certain option contracts which are
traded on active exchange markets.

Derivative instruments classified as Level 2 primarily include interest rate, currency and certain
credit default swaps. The derivative valuations are determined using pricing models with inputs
that are observable in the market or can be derived principally from or corroborated by observable
market data.

Derivative instruments classified as Level 3 include complex derivatives, such as equity options
and swaps, interest rate derivatives which have interest rate optionality, certain credit default
swaps, and long-dated interest rate swaps. Also included in Level 3 classification for derivatives
are customized equity swaps that partially hedge the U.S. GMWB liabilities. Additional information
on the customized transactions is provided under the “Accounting for Guaranteed Benefits Offered
With Variable Annuities” section of this Note 4. These derivative instruments are valued using
pricing models which utilize both observable and unobservable inputs and, to a lesser extent,
broker quotations. A derivative instrument containing Level 1 or Level 2 inputs will be classified
as a Level 3 financial instrument in its entirety if it has as least one significant Level 3 input.

4. Fair Value Measurements (continued)

The Company utilizes derivative instruments to manage the risk associated with certain assets and
liabilities. However, the derivative instrument may not be classified with the same fair value
hierarchy level as the associated assets and liabilities. Therefore the realized and unrealized
gains and losses on derivatives reported in Level 3 may not reflect the offsetting impact of the
realized and unrealized gains and losses of the associated assets and liabilities.

U.S. GMWB Reinsurance Derivative

The fair value of the U.S. GMWB reinsurance derivative is calculated as an aggregation of the
components described in the SFAS 157 Transition section of this Note. The fair value of the U.S.
GMWB reinsurance derivative is modeled using significant unobservable policyholder behavior inputs,
identical to those used in calculating the underlying liability, such as lapses, fund selection,
resets and withdrawal utilization, and risk margins. As a result, the U.S. GMWB reinsurance
derivative is categorized as Level 3.

Separate Account Assets

Separate account assets are primarily invested in mutual funds but also have investments in fixed
maturity and equity securities. The separate account investments are valued in the same manner,
and using the same pricing sources and inputs, as the fixed maturity, equity security, and
short-term investments of the Company. Open-ended mutual funds are included in Level 1. Most debt
securities and short-term investments are included in Level 2. Level 3 assets include less liquid
securities, such as highly structured and/or lower quality ABS and CMBS, ABS backed by sub-prime
loans, and any investment priced solely by broker quotes.

GMWB and GMAB Embedded Derivatives (in Other Policyholder Funds and Benefits Payable)

The fair value of GMWB and GMAB embedded derivatives, reported in Other Policyholder Funds and
Benefits Payable on the Company’s consolidated balance sheet, are calculated as an aggregation of
the components described in the SFAS 157 Transition section of this Note. The fair value of GMWB
and GMAB embedded derivatives are modeled using significant unobservable policyholder behavior
inputs, such as lapses, fund selection, resets and withdrawal utilization, and risk margins. As a
result, the GMWB and GMAB embedded derivatives are categorized as Level 3.

Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis Using Significant Unobservable
Inputs (Level 3)

The table below provides a fair value roll forward for the twelve months ending December 31, 2008
for the financial instruments for which significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) are used in the
fair value measurement on a recurring basis. The Company classifies the fair values of financial
instruments within Level 3 if there are no observable markets for the instruments or, in the
absence of active markets, the majority of the inputs used to determine fair value are based on the
Company’s own assumptions about market participant assumptions. However, the Company prioritizes
the use of market-based inputs over entity-based assumptions in determining Level 3 fair values in
accordance with SFAS 157. Therefore, the gains and losses in the tables below include changes in
fair value due partly to observable and unobservable factors.

The January 1, 2008 fair value of $238 includes the pre-SFAS 157 fair value of $128 and transitional adjustment of $110.

[2]

The Company classifies all the gains and losses on GMWB reinsurance derivatives and GMWB embedded derivatives as unrealized
gains/losses for purposes of disclosure in this table because it is impracticable to track on a contract-by-contract basis
the realized gains/losses for these derivatives and embedded derivatives.

[3]

All amounts in these columns are reported in net realized capital gains/losses except for $6 for the twelve months ending
December 31, 2008, which is reported in benefits, losses and loss adjustment expenses. All amounts are before income taxes
and amortization of DAC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)

4. Fair Value Measurements (continued)

[4]

The freestanding derivatives, excluding reinsurance derivatives instruments, are reported in this table on a net basis for
asset/(liability) positions and reported on the consolidated balance sheet in other investments and other liabilities.

[5]

AOCI refers to “Accumulated other comprehensive income” in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income (loss). All
amounts are before income taxes and amortization of DAC.

[6]

The realized/unrealized gains (losses) included in net income for separate account assets are offset by an equal amount
for separate account liabilities, which results in a net zero impact on net income for the Company.

[7]

Transfers in and/or (out) of Level 3 during the twelve months ended December 31, 2008 are attributable to a change in the
availability of market observable information for individual securities within the respective categories.

[8]

These amounts represent certain Allianz warrants. See Note 21 for further discussion.

[9]

The net loss on US GMWB since January 1, 2008 was primarily related to liability model assumption updates for mortality in
the first quarter and market-based hedge ineffectiveness in the third and fourth quarters due to extremely volatile
capital markets, partially offset by gains in the fourth quarter related to liability model assumption updates for lapse
rates.

[10]

During July 2008, the Company reinsured, with a third party, U.S. GMWB risks associated with approximately $7.8 billion of
account value sold between 2003 and 2006. The reinsurance agreement is an 80% quota-share agreement. The third party’s
financial strength is rated A+ by A.M. Best, AA- by Standard and Poor’s and Aa2 by Moody’s. The reinsurance agreement is
accounted for as a free-standing derivative.

[11]

The ‘Purchases, issuances, and settlements’ primarily relates to the receipt of cash on
futures and option contracts classified as Level 1 and interest rate, currency and credit
default swaps classified as Level 2.

For comparative and informational purposes only, the following table rolls-forward the customized
and freestanding derivatives used to hedge US GMWB, the reinsurance recoverable for US GMWB and the
embedded derivatives reported in other policyholder funds and benefits payable for the twelve month
period ended December 31, 2007. The fair value amounts in the following table are the Pre-SFAS 157

[1]

The increase in notional amount of the reinsurance recoverables for U.S. GMWB was primarily due to the execution of a
reinsurance transaction in July 2008.

[2]

The decrease in notional amount of customized derivatives used to hedge U.S. GMWB was primarily due to current market conditions
causing policyholder account values to decrease. The notional on these customized derivatives is the policyholder account
value.

[3]

The increase in notional amount of embedded derivatives associated with GMWB riders is primarily due to additional product sales.

[4]

The decrease in notional amount of the Japan GMAB embedded derivative is primarily due to a significant decline in the equity
markets triggering policyholders to elect the GMIB feature or lump sum payout in Japan’s 3Win product.

[5]

The increase in notional
amount of the macro hedge program is primarily due to the rebalancing of the Company’s risk management program
to place a greater relative emphasis on protection of statutory surplus.

The decrease in the net fair value of the derivative instruments in the table above was primarily
due to the adoption of SFAS 157 and the net effects of capital market movements during the third
and fourth quarters of 2008.

incremental lending rates for similar type loans. Current incremental lending rates reflect changes in credit spreads
and the remaining terms of the loans.

•

Other policyholder funds and benefits payable, not carried at fair value and not included in above FAS 157 fair value
information, is determined by estimating future cash flows, discounted at the current market rate.

•

Carrying amounts approximate fair value for commercial paper.

•

Fair value for long-term debt is based on market quotations from independent third party pricing services.

Concentration of Credit Risk

The Company aims to maintain a diversified investment portfolio including issuer, sector and
geographic stratification, where applicable, and has established certain exposure limits,
diversification standards and review procedures to mitigate credit risk.

Other than U.S. government and certain U.S. government agencies backed by the full faith and credit
of the U.S. government, the Company’s only exposure to any credit concentration risk of a single
issuer greater than 10% of the Company’s stockholders’ equity is the Government of Japan, which
represents $2.3 billion, or 25%, of stockholders’ equity, and less than 2.0% of total invested
assets. The Company’s second and third largest exposures by issuer as of December 31, 2008 were
the Government of Canada and JP Morgan Chase & Company, which each comprise less than 0.5%, of
total invested assets. Other than U.S. government and certain U.S. government agencies, the
Company’s largest three exposures by issuer as of December 31, 2007 were the State of California,
General Electric Company and the State of Massachusetts, which each comprise less than 0.5%, of
total invested assets.

The Company’s largest three exposures by sector, as of December 31, 2008 were commercial mortgage
and real estate, basic industry, and state municipalities and political subdivisions which
comprised approximately 13%, 9%, and 9%, respectively, of total invested assets. The Company’s
largest three exposures by sector, as of December 31, 2007 were commercial mortgage and real
estate, state municipalities and political subdivisions, and financial services which comprised
approximately 18%, 10%, and 10%, respectively, of total invested assets.

The Company’s investments in states, municipalities and political subdivisions are geographically
dispersed throughout the United States. The largest concentrations, as of December 31, 2008 and
2007, were in California, New York and Illinois which each comprise less than 1.5% and 2%,
respectively, of total invested assets.

Security Unrealized Loss Aging

As part of the Company’s ongoing security monitoring process by a committee of investment and
accounting professionals, the Company identifies securities in an unrealized loss position that
could potentially be other-than-temporarily impaired. For further discussion regarding the
Company’s other-than-temporary impairment policy, see the Other-Than-Temporary Impairments on
Available-for-Sale Securities section of Note 1. Due to the issuers’ continued satisfaction of the
securities’ obligations in accordance with their contractual terms and the expectation that they
will continue to do so, management’s intent and ability to hold these securities for a period of
time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in fair value, as well as the evaluation of
the fundamentals of the issuers’ financial condition and other objective evidence, the Company
believes that the prices of the securities in the sectors identified in the tables below were
temporarily depressed as of December 31, 2008 and 2007.

As of December 31, 2008, available-for-sale securities in an unrealized loss position, comprised of
approximately 6,612 securities, were primarily concentrated in securitized assets, specifically
CMBS and financial services sector securities. The increase in unrealized losses was largely the
result of credit spread widening primarily due to continued deterioration in the U.S. housing
market, tightened lending conditions and the market’s flight to quality securities, as well as, a
U.S. recession and a declining global economy.

As of December 31, 2008, 65% of securities in an unrealized loss position were depressed less than
20% of amortized cost. Based upon the Company’s current evaluation of these securities in
accordance with its impairment policy and the Company’s intent to retain these investments for a
period of time sufficient to allow for recovery in value, the Company has determined that these
securities are temporarily impaired.

The majority of securitized assets depressed over 20% for six consecutive months are primarily
related to CMBS and sub-prime RMBS. Based upon the Company’s cash flow modeling in a severe
negative economic outlook, which shows no loss of principal and interest, and the Company’s
assertion of its ability and intent to retain the securities until recovery, it has been determined
that these securities are temporarily impaired as of December 31, 2008.

The majority of all other securities depressed over 20% for six consecutive months or greater in
the tables above primarily relate to financial services sector securities that include corporate
bonds, as well as, preferred equity issued by large high quality financial institutions that are
lower in the capital structure and, as a result have incurred greater price depressions. Based
upon the Company’s analysis of these securities and current macroeconomic conditions, the Company
expects to see significant price recovery on these securities within a reasonable period of time
and, therefore, has determined that these securities are temporarily impaired as of December 31,
2008.

Mortgage Loans

The carrying value of mortgage loans on real estate was $6.5 billion and $5.4 billion as of
December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The Company’s mortgage loans are collateralized by a
variety of commercial and agricultural properties. The mortgage loans are diversified both
geographically throughout the United States and by property type.

At December 31, 2008, the Company held delinquent mortgage loans on three properties with a
carrying value of $91 which were deemed impaired and accordingly, a valuation allowance of $26 was
established. At December 31, 2007, the Company held no impaired, restructured, delinquent or
in-process-of-foreclosure mortgage loans and therefore had no valuation allowance.

Variable Interest Entities (“VIE”)

The Company is involved with variable interest entities primarily as a collateral manager and as an
investor through normal investment activities. The Company’s involvement includes providing
investment management and administrative services for a fee and holding ownership or other
interests as an investor. The Company also has involvement with VIEs as a means of accessing
capital.

VIEs may or may not be consolidated on the Company’s consolidated financial statements. When the
Company is the primary beneficiary of the VIE, all of the assets and liabilities of the VIE are
consolidated into the Company’s financial statements. The Company also reports a liability for the
portion of the VIE that represents the minority interest of other investors in the VIE. When the
Company concludes that it is not the primary beneficiary of the VIE, only the fair value of the
Company’s interest in the VIE is recorded in the Company’s financial statements.

As of December 31, 2007, Hartford Investment Management Company (“HIMCO”) was the collateral
manager of four VIEs with provisions that allowed for termination if the fair value of the
aggregate referenced bank loan portfolio declined below a stated level. These VIEs were market
value CLOs that invested in senior secured bank loans through total return swaps. Two of these
market value CLOs were consolidated, and two were not consolidated. During the first quarter of
2008, the fair value of the aggregate referenced bank loan portfolio declined below the stated
level in all four market value CLOs and the total return swap counterparties terminated the
transactions. Three of these CLOs were restructured from market value CLOs to cash flow CLOs
without market value triggers and the remaining CLO terminated in January 2009. The Company
realized a capital loss of $90, before-tax, from the termination of these CLOs. In connection with
the restructurings, the Company purchased interests in two of the resulting VIEs, one of which the
Company is the primary beneficiary. These purchases resulted in an increase in the Company’s
maximum exposure to loss for both consolidated and non-consolidated VIEs.

At December 31, 2008 and 2007, the Company had relationships with five and seven VIEs,
respectively, where the Company was the primary beneficiary. The following table sets forth the
carrying value of assets and liabilities, and the Company’s maximum exposure to loss on these
consolidated VIEs.

Creditors have no recourse against the Company in the event of default by the VIE.

[2]

The Company’s maximum exposure to loss represents the maximum loss amount that the Company could recognize as a reduction
in net investment income or as a realized capital loss and is the consolidated assets net of liabilities at cost. The
Company has no implied or unfunded commitments to these VIEs.

CLOs represent one fund at December 31, 2008, which is a cash flow CLO financed by issuing debt in
tranches of varying seniority and is a VIE due to the lack of voting equity in the capital
structure. The Company provides collateral management services to the CLO and earns a fee for
those services and also has investments in debt issued by the CLO. Taking those interests into
consideration, the Company has performed a quantitative analysis and determined that it will absorb
a majority of the expected losses or residual returns in the fund and as a result is the primary
beneficiary. Consolidated assets are classified in cash and fixed maturities and consolidated
liabilities are classified in other liabilities. At December 31, 2007, CLOs represent two market
value CLOs, one of which converted to the cash flow CLO described above and the second which
terminated during the fourth quarter of 2008.

At December 31, 2008 and 2007, limited partnerships represent investments in two hedge funds that
are financed by issuing equity shares to investors, and are VIEs based on the lack of decision
making ability held by the equity investors. The primary source of variability generated by these
VIEs is the fund’s investment portfolio and that variability is passed to equity holders. The
Company holds a majority interest in the equity of the funds and as a result will absorb the
majority of the funds’ expected losses or residual returns and therefore is the primary
beneficiary. Consolidated assets and liabilities are classified in other investments and other
liabilities, respectively.

Other investments at December 31, 2008 consist of two investment trusts that are financed by
issuing beneficial interests that do not have voting rights to investors. The Company holds a
majority of the beneficial interests issued by these trusts and as the majority holder, will absorb
a majority of expected losses or residual returns and therefore is the primary beneficiary. The
Company was not the primary beneficiary of one of those trusts at December 31, 2007. Consolidated
assets and liabilities are classified in fixed maturities and other liabilities, respectively. At
December 31, 2007, other investments included three investment trusts, two of which have liquidated
and the third remains at December 31, 2008.

5. Investments and Derivative Instruments (continued)

As of December 31, 2008 and 2007, the Company also held significant variable interests in four and
five VIEs, respectively, where the Company is not the primary beneficiary. That determination has
been made based on a quantitative analysis of whether the Company will absorb a majority of the
expected losses or residual returns of the VIE, considering its variable interests as well as those
of other variable interest holders. These investments have been held by the Company for two years.

The following table sets forth the carrying value of assets and liabilities that relate to the
Company’s variable interests in unconsolidated VIEs, and the Company’s maximum exposure to loss
resulting from involvement with those VIEs.

The Company has no implied or unfunded commitments to these VIEs.

At December 31, 2008, CLOs include one fund that is financed by issuing debt securities in tranches
of varying seniority. That fund is a cash flow CLO and a VIE due to the lack of voting equity in
its capital structure. The Company holds variable interests through fees earned as the collateral
manager and investments in debt and preferred equity issued by the fund with a carrying amount at
December 31, 2008 of $306 and $2, respectively. At December 31, 2007, CLOs represent two market
value CLOs, one of which converted to the cash flow CLO described above and the second for which
the Company is no longer involved with following its conversion from a market value to a cash flow
CLO.

At December 31, 2008 and 2007, CDOs consist of two VIEs that are financed by issuing debt having no
voting rights to investors. The Company has variable interests in each CDO by virtue of its
investment in that debt and fees received as the collateral manager. The carrying amount of the
investment in debt issued by the CDOs is $3 at December 31, 2008 and is classified in fixed
maturities.

Other, at December 31, 2008 and 2007, represents the Company’s variable interest in the Glen Meadow
ABC Trust, which is a put option agreement that requires the trust, at any time, to purchase the
Company’s junior subordinated notes in a maximum principal amount not to exceed $500. There is no
equity investment and thus the trust is a VIE based on that lack of voting equity. The put option
agreement held by the Company is a variable interest in the trust. The carrying amount of that
option at December 31, 2008 classified in other assets is $42 and the carrying value of the
liability for premiums due under the option contract at December 31, 2008 classified in other
liabilities is $40.

Derivative Instruments

The Company utilizes a variety of derivative instruments, including swaps, caps, floors, forwards,
futures and options through one of four Company-approved objectives: to hedge risk arising from
interest rate, equity market, credit spread including issuer default, price or currency exchange
rate risk or volatility; to manage liquidity; to control transaction costs; or to enter into
replication transactions.

On the date the derivative contract is entered into, the Company designates the derivative as a
fair-value hedge, a cash-flow hedge, a foreign-currency hedge, a net investment hedge, or held for
other investment and/or risk management purposes.

The Company’s derivative transactions are used in strategies permitted under the derivative use
plans required by the State of Connecticut, the State of Illinois, and the State of New York
insurance departments.

Derivative instruments are recorded in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value and are
presented as assets or liabilities as determined by calculating the net position, taking into
account income accruals and cash collateral held, for each derivative counterparty by legal entity.
The fair value of derivative instruments, excluding income accruals and cash collateral held, are

The following table summarizes the derivative instruments used by the Company and the primary
hedging strategies to which they relate. Derivatives in the Company’s separate accounts are not
included because the associated gains and losses accrue directly to policyholders. The notional
amount of derivative contracts represents the basis upon which pay or receive amounts are
calculated and are not reflective of credit risk. The fair value amounts of derivative assets and
liabilities are presented on a net basis as of December 31, 2008 and 2007. The total
ineffectiveness of all cash-flow, fair-value and net investment hedges and total change in value of
other derivative-based strategies which do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment, including
periodic derivative net coupon settlements, (“non-qualifying strategies”) are presented below on a
before-tax basis for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007.

Cash-Flow Hedges

Interest rate swaps

Interest rate swaps are primarily
used to convert interest receipts
on floating-rate fixed maturity
securities to fixed rates. These
derivatives are predominantly used
to better match cash receipts from
assets with cash disbursements
required to fund liabilities.

The Company also enters into
forward starting swap agreements to
hedge the interest rate exposure
related to the purchase of
fixed-rate securities or the
anticipated future cash flows of
floating-rate fixed maturity
securities due to changes in the
benchmark interest rate,
London-Interbank Offered Rate
(“LIBOR”). These derivatives are
primarily structured to hedge
interest rate risk inherent in the
assumptions used to price certain
liabilities.

Interest rate swaps are also used
to hedge a portion of the Company’s
floating-rate guaranteed investment
contracts. These derivatives
convert the floating-rate
guaranteed investment contract
payments to a fixed rate to better
match the cash receipts earned from
the supporting investment
portfolio.

Foreign currency swaps

Foreign currency swaps are used to
convert foreign denominated cash
flows associated with certain
foreign denominated fixed maturity
investments to U.S. dollars. The
foreign fixed maturities are
primarily denominated in euros and
are swapped to minimize cash flow
fluctuations due to changes in
currency rates. In addition,
foreign currency swaps are also
used to convert foreign denominated
cash flows associated with certain
liability payments to U.S. dollars
in order to minimize cash flow
fluctuations due to changes in
currency rates.

Non-qualifying Strategies

Interest rate swaps, caps, floors, and forwards

The Company uses interest rate swaps, caps and
floors to manage duration risk between assets and
liabilities in certain portfolios. In addition,
the Company enters into interest rate swaps to
terminate existing swaps, thereby offsetting the
changes in value of the original swap. As of
December 31, 2008 and 2007, the notional amount of
interest rate swaps in offsetting relationships
was $6.8 billion and $2.6 billion, respectively.

The Company may also use interest rate forwards to

securities to manage duration risk and liquidity.

Credit default swaps that sell credit protection

The Company enters into credit default swap
agreements in which the Company assumes credit
risk of an individual entity, referenced index or
asset pool. These contracts entitle the Company
to receive a periodic fee in exchange for an
obligation to compensate the derivative
counterparty should a credit event occur on the
part of the referenced security issuers. Also
included are embedded derivatives associated with
credit linked notes with a notional amount of $117
and $142 as of December 31, 2008 and 2007,
respectively. The maximum potential future
exposure to the Company is the notional amount of
the swap contracts, which is $1,199 and $2,857,

for the credit index swaps is the notional value
and for the total return swaps is the cash
collateral associated with the transaction, which
has termination triggers that limit investment
losses. The Company had no exposure to such
contracts at December 31, 2008. As of December
31, 2007, the maximum potential future exposure to
the Company from such contracts was $1,558,
before-tax.

Guaranteed Minimum Accumulation Benefit (“GMAB”) product derivatives

The Company offers certain variable annuity products in Japan that
may have a GMAB rider. The GMAB is a bifurcated embedded
derivative that provides the policyholder with their initial
deposit in a lump sum after a specified waiting period. The
notional value of the embedded derivative is the Yen denominated
GRB balance converted to U.S. dollars at the current December 31,
2008 and 2007, foreign spot exchange rate, respectively.

GMWB product derivatives

The Company offers certain variable annuity products with a GMWB
rider, primarily in the U.S. and, to a lesser extent, the U.K. and
Japan. The GMWB is a bifurcated embedded derivative that provides
the policyholder with a GRB if the account value is reduced to
zero through a combination of market declines and withdrawals.
The GRB is generally equal to premiums less withdrawals. The
policyholder also has the option, after a specified time period,
to reset the GRB to the then-current account value, if greater.
The notional value of the embedded derivative is the GRB balance.

Derivative change in value includes hedge ineffectiveness for cash-flow and fair-value hedges
and total change in value, including periodic derivative net coupon settlements, for
derivatives in non-qualifying strategies.

Change in Notional Amount

The notional amount of derivatives in cash-flow hedge relationships increased $3.6 billion since
December 31, 2007, primarily due to an increase in interest rate swaps used to convert interest
receipts on floating-rate securities to fixed rates. The Company increased the notional amount
related to this strategy due to the significant decline in variable interest rates during 2008.

The notional amount of derivatives in fair-value hedge relationships decreased $2.1 billion since
December 31, 2007, primarily due to a decline in interest rate swaps used to convert interest
receipts of fixed-rate securities to floating-rates. The Company decreased the notional amount
related to this strategy due to the significant decline in variable interest rates during 2008.

The notional amount of derivatives used in non-qualifying strategies increased $2.4 billion since
December 31, 2007, primarily due to the following:

•

For a discussion on the increase in notional amount of derivatives associated with GMWB
riders refer to Note 4.

•

The Company increased the
notional amount of derivatives associated with the macro hedge program.
During the three months ended December 31, 2008, the Company rebalanced its risk management
program to place a greater relative emphasis on the protection of statutory surplus. As a
result, the Company added the equivalent of $1.9 billion notional of equity futures as part of
the macro hedge program to partially economically hedge the statutory reserve impact of equity risk
arising primarily from GMDB and GMWB obligations against a decline in the equity markets.

•

For a discussion on the decline in notional amount related to the embedded derivative
associated with GMAB riders refer to Note 4.

•

The notional amount related to credit derivatives declined primarily due to terminations
and maturities of credit derivatives, which reduced the overall net credit exposure assumed by
the Company through credit derivatives.

Change in Fair Value

The decrease of $1.2 billion in the total fair value of derivative instruments since December 31,
2007, was primarily related to the following:

•

For a discussion on the decrease in fair value of GMWB related derivatives refer to Note 4.

•

The fair value of the Japanese fixed annuity hedging instruments increased primarily due to
the Japanese Yen strengthening against the U.S. dollar.

•

The fair value of interest rate derivatives increased primarily due to a decline in
interest rates as well as an increase in notional amount.

•

The fair value of foreign currency swaps hedging foreign fixed rate bonds increased
primarily due to the U.S. dollar strengthening against the euro.

Net Realized Capital Gains (Losses)

The total change in value for non-qualifying strategies, including periodic derivative net coupon
settlements, are reported in net realized capital gains (losses). For the year ended December 31,
2008, the net realized capital loss of $916 related to non-qualifying strategies was primarily due
to the following:

•

For a discussion on the net loss associated with GMWB related hedging derivatives refer to
Note 4.

•

The net loss on credit default swaps was primarily due to losses on credit derivatives that
sell credit protection, partially offset by gains on credit derivatives that purchase credit
protection, both resulting from credit spreads widening significantly during the year.

•

The gain on the Japanese fixed annuity hedging instruments was primarily a result of the
Japanese Yen strengthening against the U.S. dollar.

•

The gain on warrants associated with the Allianz transaction was primarily due to a
decrease in the Company’s stock price since the issue date.

•

The net gain on the macro
hedge program was primarily driven by a decline in the equity markets,
partially offset by losses due to swap spreads tightening.

For the year ended December 31, 2007, the net realized capital loss of $488 related to
non-qualifying strategies was primarily related to the following:

•

For a discussion on the net loss associated with GMWB related derivatives refer to Note 4.

•

The net loss on credit default swaps was a result of credit spreads widening.

•

The gain on the Japanese fixed annuity hedging instruments was primarily a result of the
Japanese Yen strengthening against the U.S. dollar.

For the year ended December 31, 2008, the Company incurred losses of $46 on derivative instruments
due to counterparty default related to the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. These
losses were a result of the contractual collateral threshold amounts and open collateral calls in
excess of such amounts immediately prior to the bankruptcy filing, as well as interest rate and
credit spread movements from the date of the last collateral call to the date of the bankruptcy
filing.

For the year ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, the before tax deferred net gains on derivative
instruments recorded in AOCI that are expected to be reclassified to earnings during the next
twelve months are $10 and ($16), respectively. This expectation is based on the anticipated
interest payments on hedged investments in fixed maturity securities that will occur over the next
twelve months, at which time the Company will recognize the deferred net gains (losses) as an
adjustment to interest income over the term of the investment cash flows. The maximum term over
which the Company is hedging its exposure to the variability of future cash flows (for all
forecasted transactions, excluding interest payments on existing variable-rate financial
instruments) is five years. For the year ended December 31, 2008, the Company had $198,
before-tax, of net reclassifications from AOCI to earnings resulting from the discontinuance of
cash-flow hedges due to forecasted transactions that were no longer probable of occurring. Of this
amount, $202 resulted from the termination of an interest rate swap due to the sale of the related
hedged structured security. The interest rate swap was used to convert the LIBOR based floating
rate structured security to a fixed rate structured security. For the years ended December 31,
2007 and 2006, the Company had no net reclassifications from AOCI to earnings resulting from the
discontinuance of cash-flow hedges due to forecasted transactions that were no longer probable of
occurring.

Credit Risk Assumed through Credit Derivatives

The Company enters into credit default swaps that assume credit risk from a single entity,
referenced index, or asset pool in order to synthetically replicate investment transactions. The
Company will receive periodic payments based on an agreed upon rate and notional amount and will
only make a payment if there is a credit event. A credit event payment will typically be equal to
the notional value of the swap contract less the value of the referenced security issuer’s debt
obligation. A credit event is generally defined as default on contractually obligated interest or
principal payments or bankruptcy of the referenced entity. The credit default swaps in which the
Company assumes credit risk primarily reference investment grade single corporate issuers, baskets
of up to five corporate issuers, and diversified portfolios of corporate issuers. The diversified
portfolios of corporate issuers are established within sector concentration limits and are
typically divided into tranches that possess different credit ratings.

The following table presents the notional amount, fair value, weighted average years to maturity,
underlying referenced credit obligation type and average credit ratings, and offsetting notional
amounts and fair value for credit derivatives in which the Company is assuming credit risk as of

Securities Lending and Collateral Arrangements

The Company participates in securities lending programs to generate additional income, whereby
certain domestic fixed income securities are loaned for a specified period of time from the
Company’s portfolio to qualifying third parties, via two lending agents. Borrowers of these
securities provide collateral of 102% of the market value of the loaned securities and can return
the securities to the Company for cash at varying maturity dates. Acceptable collateral may be in
the form of cash or U.S. government securities. The market value of the loaned securities is
monitored and additional collateral is obtained if the market value of the collateral falls below
100% of the market value of the loaned securities. Under the terms of securities lending programs,
the lending agent indemnifies the Company against borrower defaults. As of December 31, 2008 and
2007, the fair value of the loaned securities was approximately $2.9 billion and $4.3 billion,
respectively, and was included in fixed maturities and short-term investments in the consolidated
balance sheets. As of December 31, 2008, the Company had received collateral against the loaned
securities in the amount of $3.0 billion. The Company earns income from the cash collateral or
receives a fee from the borrower. The Company recorded before-tax income from securities lending
transactions, net of lending fees, of $28 and $9 for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007,
respectively, which was included in net investment income.

The Company enters into various collateral arrangements in connection with its derivative
instruments, which require both the pledging and accepting of collateral. As of December 31, 2008
and 2007, collateral pledged having a fair value of $1.0 billion and $508, respectively, was
included in fixed maturities in the consolidated balance sheets.

From time to time, the Company enters into secured borrowing arrangements as a means to increase
net investment income. The Company received cash collateral of $89 and $121 as of December 31,
2008 and 2007, respectively.

The classification and carrying amount of the loaned securities and the derivative instrument
collateral pledged at December 31, 2008 and 2007 were as follows:

As of December 31, 2008 and 2007, the Company had accepted collateral relating to securities
lending programs and derivative instruments consisting of cash, U.S. government and U.S. government
agency securities with a fair value of $6.9 billion and $5.0 billion, respectively. At December
31, 2008 and 2007, cash collateral of $6.3 billion and $4.8 billion, respectively, was invested and
recorded in the consolidated balance sheets in fixed maturities and short-term investments with a
corresponding amount predominately recorded in other liabilities. Included in this cash collateral
was $3.4 billion and $290 for derivative cash collateral as of December 31, 2008 and 2007,
respectively. In accordance with FSP FIN 39-1, a portion of the liability associated with the
derivative cash collateral was reclassed out of other liabilities and into a receivable in other
assets of $574 and $175 as of December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. For further discussion on
the adoption of FSP FIN 39-1, see Note 1. The Company is only permitted by contract to sell or
repledge the noncash collateral in the event of a default by the counterparty. The Company
incurred counterparty default losses related to the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. for
the year ended December 31, 2008, and no counterparty default losses for the year ended December
31, 2007. As of December 31, 2008 and 2007, noncash collateral accepted was held in separate
custodial accounts.

Securities on Deposit with States

The Company is required by law to deposit securities with government agencies in states where it
conducts business. As of December 31, 2008 and 2007, the fair value of securities on deposit was
approximately $1.3 billion.

6. Reinsurance

The Hartford cedes insurance to other insurers in order to limit its maximum losses and to
diversify its exposures and provide surplus relief. Such transfers do not relieve The Hartford of
its primary liability under policies it wrote and, as such, failure of reinsurers to honor their
obligations could result in losses to The Hartford. The Hartford also is a member of and
participates in several reinsurance pools and associations. The Hartford evaluates the financial
condition of its reinsurers and monitors concentrations of credit risk. The Hartford’s property
and casualty reinsurance is placed with reinsurers that meet strict financial criteria established
by a credit committee. As of December 31, 2008 and 2007, The Hartford had no reinsurance-related
concentrations of credit risk greater than 10% of the Company’s stockholders’ equity.

Life

In accordance with normal industry practice, Life is involved in both the cession and assumption of
insurance with other insurance and reinsurance companies. As of December 31, 2008 and 2007, the
Company’s policy for the largest amount of life insurance retained on any one life by any company
comprising the life operations was $10.

Life insurance fees, earned premiums and other were comprised of the following:

Life reinsures certain of its risks to other reinsurers under yearly renewable term, coinsurance,
and modified coinsurance arrangements. Yearly renewable term and coinsurance arrangements result in
passing all or a portion of the risk to the reinsurer. Generally, the reinsurer receives a
proportionate amount of the premiums less an allowance for commissions and expenses and is liable
for a corresponding proportionate amount of all benefit payments. Modified coinsurance is similar
to coinsurance except that the cash and investments that support the liabilities for contract
benefits are not transferred to the assuming company, and settlements are made on a net basis
between the companies. Coinsurance with funds withheld is a form of coinsurance except that the
investment assets that support the liabilities are withheld by the ceding company.

The cost of reinsurance related to long-duration contracts is accounted for over the life of the
underlying reinsured policies using assumptions consistent with those used to account for the
underlying policies. Life insurance recoveries on ceded reinsurance contracts, which reduce death
and other benefits, were $331, $89 and $59 for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006,
respectively. Life also assumes reinsurance from other insurers.

In
addition, the Company reinsures a portion of U.S minimum death benefit guarantees, Japan’s guaranteed minimum
death benefits, as well as guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefits, offered in connection with its
variable annuity contracts.

Property and Casualty

In managing risk, The Hartford utilizes reinsurance to transfer risk to well-established and
financially secure reinsurers. Reinsurance is used to manage aggregations of risk as well as
specific risks based on accumulated property and casualty liabilities in certain geographic zones.
All treaty purchases related to the Company’s property and casualty operations are administered by
a centralized function to support a consistent strategy and ensure that the reinsurance activities
are fully integrated into the organization’s risk management processes.

A variety of traditional reinsurance products are used as part of the Company’s risk management
strategy, including excess of loss occurrence-based products that protect aggregate property and
workers’ compensation exposures, and individual risk or quota share arrangements, that protect
specific classes or lines of business. There are no significant finite risk contracts in place and
the statutory surplus benefit from all such prior year contracts is immaterial. Facultative
reinsurance is also used to manage policy-specific risk exposures based on established underwriting
guidelines. The Hartford also participates in governmentally administered reinsurance facilities
such as the Florida Hurricane Catastrophe Fund (“FHCF”), the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program
established under The Terrorism Risk Insurance Extension Act of 2005 and other reinsurance programs
relating to particular risks or specific lines of business.

Ceded losses, which reduce losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred, were $384, $187, and $370
for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007, and 2006 respectively. Ceded incurred losses
increased from $187 in 2007 to $384 in 2008 and decreased from $370 in 2006 to $187 in 2007,
primarily because of a decrease in ceded incurred losses within Other Operations in 2007.

Reinsurance recoverables include balances due from reinsurance companies for paid and unpaid losses
and loss adjustment expenses and are presented net of an allowance for uncollectible reinsurance.
The reinsurance recoverables balance includes an estimate of the amount of gross losses and loss
adjustment expense reserves that may be ceded under the terms of the reinsurance agreements,
including incurred but not reported unpaid losses. The Company’s estimate of losses and loss
adjustment expense reserves ceded to reinsurers is based on assumptions that are consistent with
those used in establishing the gross reserves for business ceded to the reinsurance contracts. The
Company calculates its ceded reinsurance projection based on the terms of any applicable
facultative and treaty reinsurance, including an estimate of how incurred but not reported losses
will ultimately be ceded by reinsurance agreement. Accordingly, the Company’s estimate of
reinsurance recoverables is subject to similar risks and uncertainties as the estimate of the gross
reserve for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses.

The allowance for uncollectible reinsurance was $379 and $404 as of December 31, 2008 and 2007,
respectively. The allowance for uncollectible reinsurance reflects management’s best estimate of
reinsurance cessions that may be uncollectible in the future due to reinsurers’ unwillingness or
inability to pay. The Company analyzes recent developments in commutation activity between
reinsurers and cedants, recent trends in arbitration and litigation outcomes in disputes between
reinsurers and cedants and the overall credit quality of the Company’s reinsurers. Where its
contracts permit, the Company secures future claim obligations with various forms of collateral,
including irrevocable letters of credit, secured trusts, funds held accounts and group-wide
offsets.

Due to the inherent uncertainties as to collection and the length of time before reinsurance
recoverables become due, it is possible that future adjustments to the Company’s reinsurance
recoverables, net of the allowance, could be required, which could have a material adverse effect
on the Company’s consolidated results of operations or cash flows in a particular quarter or annual
period.

In 2008, the Company completed three acquisitions that resulted in additional goodwill of $79 in
the Retirement Plans reporting unit.

The Company’s interim goodwill impairment test performed in accordance with SFAS No. 142 “Goodwill
and Other Intangible Assets”, and in connection with the preparation of our year end 2008 financial
statements, resulted in a pre-tax impairment charge of $422 in the Individual Annuity reporting
unit within Retail and $323 within the Individual Annuity and International reporting units of
Corporate. Goodwill within Corporate is primarily attributed to the Company’s “buy-back” of Life
in 2000 and is allocated to the various Life reporting units. The impairment charges taken in 2008
were primarily due to the Company’s estimate of the International and Individual Annuity reporting
units’ fair values falling significantly below the related book values. The fair values of these
reporting units declined as the statutory capital and surplus risks associated with the death and
living benefit guarantees sold with products offered by these reporting units increased. These
concerns had a comparable impact on the Company’s share price. The determination of fair values
for the Individual Annuity and International reporting units incorporated multiple inputs including
discounted cash flow calculations, market participant assumptions and the Company’s share price.
No goodwill impairment charges were recorded in 2007.

The following table shows the Company’s acquired intangible assets that continue to be subject to
amortization and aggregate amortization expense, net of interest accretion, if any. Acquired
intangible assets are included in other assets in the consolidated balance sheet. Except for
goodwill, the Company has no intangible assets with indefinite useful lives.

9. Separate Accounts, Death Benefits and Other Insurance Benefit Features

The Company records the variable portion of individual variable annuities, 401(k), institutional,
403(b)/457, private placement life and variable life insurance products within separate account
assets and liabilities. Separate account assets are reported at fair value. Separate account
liabilities are set equal to separate account assets. Separate account assets are segregated from
other investments. Investment income and gains and losses from those separate account assets, which
accrue directly to, and whereby investment risk is borne by the policyholder, are offset by the
related liability changes within the same line item in the consolidated statements of operations.
The fees earned for administrative and contract holder maintenance services performed for these
separate accounts are included in fee income. During 2008, 2007 and 2006, there were no gains or
losses on transfers of assets from the general account to the separate account.

Many of the variable annuity and universal life (“UL”) contracts issued by the Company offer
various guaranteed minimum death, withdrawal, income, accumulation, and UL secondary guarantee
benefits. UL secondary guarantee benefits ensure that the policy will not terminate, and will
continue to provide a death benefit, even if there is insufficient policy value to cover the
monthly deductions and charges. Guaranteed minimum death and income benefits are offered in
various forms as described in further detail throughout this Note 9. The Company currently
reinsures a portion of the death benefit guarantees associated with its in-force block of business.
Changes in the gross U.S. guaranteed minimum death benefit (“GMDB”), Japan GMDB/guaranteed minimum
income benefits (“GMIB”), and UL secondary guarantee benefits sold with annuity and/or UL products
accounted for and collectively known as “SOP 03-1 reserve liabilities” are as follows:

The net SOP 03-1 reserve liabilities are established by estimating the expected value of net
reinsurance costs and death and income benefits in excess of the projected account balance. The
excess death and income benefits and net reinsurance costs are recognized ratably over the
accumulation period based on total expected assessments. The SOP 03-1 reserve liabilities are
recorded in reserve for future policy benefits in the Company’s consolidated balance sheets.
Changes in the SOP 03-1 reserve liabilities are recorded in benefits, losses and loss adjustment
expenses in the Company’s consolidated statements of operations. In a manner consistent with the
Company’s accounting policy for deferred acquisition costs, the Company regularly evaluates
estimates used and adjusts the additional liability balances, with a related charge or credit to
benefit expense if actual experience or other evidence suggests that earlier assumptions should be
revised. As described within the Unlock and Sensitivity Analysis in Note 1, the Company Unlocked
its assumptions related to its SOP 03-1 reserves during the third quarter of 2008 and 2007.

9. Separate Accounts, Death Benefits and Other Insurance Benefit Features (continued)

The determination of the GMDB and GMIB liabilities and related GMDB reinsurance recoverable is
based on models that involve a range of scenarios and assumptions, including those regarding
expected market rates of return and volatility, contract surrender rates and mortality experience.
The following assumptions were used to determine the GMDB, GMIB and UL Secondary Guarantee
liabilities as of December 31, 2008:

U.S. GMDB:

•

1000 stochastically generated investment performance scenarios for all issue years.

•

For all issue years, the weighted average return is 8.3%; it varies by asset class with a
low of 3% for cash and a high of 9% for aggressive equities.

•

Discount rate of 7.5% for issue year 2002 & prior; discount rate of 7% for issue year 2003
& 2004 and discount rate of 5.6% for issue year 2005 — 2008.

•

Volatilities also vary by asset class with a low of 1% for cash, a high of 15% for
aggressive equities, and a weighted average of 11%.

•

100% of the Hartford experience mortality table was used for the mortality assumptions.

•

Lapse rates by calendar year vary from a low of 8% to a high of 11%, with an average of
10%.

Japan GMDB and GMIB:

•

1000 stochastically generated investment performance scenarios.

•

Separate account returns, representing the Company’s long-term assumptions, varied by asset class with a low of 3%
for Japan bonds, a high of 9% for foreign equities and a weighted average of 6%.

•

Volatilities also varied by asset class with a low of 0% for Japan bonds, a high of 5% for foreign equities and a
weighted average of 2%.

•

85% of the 1996 Japan Standard Mortality Table was used for mortality assumptions.

•

Lapse rates by age vary from a low of 1% to a high of 25%, with an average of 3%.

•

Average discount rate of 5.1%.

UL Secondary Guarantees:

•

Discount rate of 4.75% for issue year 2004, discount rate of 4.50% for issue year 2005 & 2006, discount rate of
4.25% for issue year 2007, and discount rate of 3.5% for issue year 2008.

•

100% of the Hartford pricing mortality table for mortality assumptions.

•

Lapse rates for single life policies average 4% in policy years 1-10, declining to 0% by age 95. Lapse rate for
last survivor policies declining to 0.5% by age 91.

MAV: the death benefit is the greatest of current account value, net premiums paid and the highest account value on any
anniversary before age 80 (adjusted for withdrawals).

[2]

Rollup: the death benefit is the greatest of the MAV, current account value, net premium paid and premiums (adjusted for
withdrawals) accumulated at generally 5% simple interest up to the earlier of age 80 or100% of adjusted premiums.

[3]

EPB: the death benefit is the greatest of the MAV, current account value, or contract value plus a percentage of the
contract’s growth. The contract’s growth is account value less premiums net of withdrawals, subject to a cap of 200% of
premiums net of withdrawals.

APB: the death benefit is the greater of current account value or MAV, not to exceed current account value plus 25% times
the greater of net premiums and MAV (each adjusted for premiums in the past 12 months).

Return of premium: the death benefit is the greater of current account value and net premiums paid.

[8]

Death benefits include a Return of Premium and MAV (before age 80) paid in a single lump sum. The income benefit is a
guarantee to return initial investment, adjusted for earnings liquidity, paid through a fixed annuity, after a minimum
deferral period of 10, 15 or 20 years. The guaranteed remaining balance related to the Japan GMIB was $30.6 billion and
$26.8 billion as of December31, 2008 and 2007, respectively.

Net amount at risk and retained net amount at risk are highly sensitive to equity markets movements. For example, as
equity markets decline, net amount at risk and retained net amount at risk will generally increase

See Note 1 for a description of the Company’s guaranteed living benefits that are accounted for at
fair value.

10. Sales Inducements

The Company currently offers enhanced crediting rates or bonus payments to contract holders on
certain of its individual and group annuity products. The expense associated with offering a bonus
is deferred and amortized over the life of the related contract in a pattern consistent with the
amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs. Amortization expense associated with expenses
previously deferred is recorded over the remaining life of the contract. Consistent with the
Company’s Unlock, the Company Unlocked the amortization of the sales inducement asset. See Note 1,

11. Reserves for Future Policy Benefits and Unpaid Losses and Loss Adjustment Expenses

As described in Note 1, The Hartford establishes reserves for unpaid losses and loss adjustment
expenses on reported and unreported claims. These reserve estimates are based on known facts and
interpretations of circumstances, and consideration of various internal factors including The
Hartford’s experience with similar cases, historical trends involving claim payment patterns, loss
payments, pending levels of unpaid claims, loss control programs and product mix. In addition, the
reserve estimates are influenced by
consideration of various external factors including court decisions, economic conditions and public
attitudes. The effects of inflation are implicitly considered in the reserving process.

The establishment of appropriate reserves, including reserves for catastrophes and asbestos and
environmental claims, is inherently uncertain. The Hartford regularly updates its reserve
estimates as new information becomes available and events unfold that may have an impact on
unsettled claims. Changes in prior year reserve estimates, which may be material, are reflected in
the results of operations in the period such changes are determined to be necessary. For further
discussion of asbestos and environmental claims, see Note 12.

In the opinion of management, based upon the known facts and current law, the reserves recorded for
The Hartford’s property and casualty businesses at December 31, 2008 represent the Company’s best
estimate of its ultimate liability for losses and loss adjustment expenses related to losses
covered by policies written by the Company. Based on information or trends that are not presently
known, future reserve re-estimates may result in adjustments to these reserves. Such adjustments
could possibly be significant, reflecting any variety of new and adverse or favorable trends.
Because of the significant uncertainties surrounding environmental and particularly asbestos
exposures, it is possible that management’s estimate of the ultimate liabilities for these claims
may change and that the required adjustment to recorded reserves could exceed the currently
recorded reserves by an amount that could be material to The Hartford’s results of operations,
financial condition and liquidity. For a further discussion, see Note 12.

Examples of current trends affecting frequency and severity include increases in medical cost
inflation rates, the changing use of medical care procedures, the introduction of new products and
changes in internal claim practices. Other trends include changes in the legislative and
regulatory environment over workers’ compensation claims and evolving exposures to claims relating
to molestation or abuse and other mass torts. In the case of the reserves for asbestos exposures,
factors contributing to the high degree of uncertainty include inadequate loss development
patterns, plaintiffs’ expanding theories of liability, the risks inherent in major litigation, and
inconsistent emerging legal doctrines. In the case of the reserves for environmental exposures,
factors contributing to the high degree of uncertainty include expanding theories of liabilities
and damages; the risks inherent in major litigation; inconsistent decisions concerning the
existence and scope of coverage for environmental claims; and uncertainty as to the monetary amount
being sought by the claimant from the insured.

11. Reserves for Future Policy Benefits and Unpaid Losses and Loss Adjustment Expenses (continued)

Net favorable reserve development of $226 in 2008 included, among other reserve changes, a $156
release of workers’ compensation reserves primarily for accident years 2000 to 2007, a $105 release
of general liability claims, primarily related to accident years 2001 to 2007, and a $75 release of
reserves for directors and officers claims and errors and omissions claims for accident years 2003
to 2006, partially offset by a $103 strengthening of asbestos and environmental reserves. Among
other reserve changes, prior accident year development of $48 in 2007 included a $151 release of
workers’ compensation reserves for accident years 2002 to 2006, a $79 strengthening of workers’
compensation and general liability reserves for accident years more than 20 years old and a charge
of $99 principally as a result of an adverse arbitration decision involving claims owed to an
insurer of the Company’s former parent. The prior year provision of $296 in 2006 includes, among
other reserve changes, $243 of prior accident year development resulting from an agreement with
Equitas and the Company’s evaluation of the reinsurance recoverables and allowance for
uncollectible reinsurance associated with older, long-term casualty liabilities reported in the
Other Operations. In addition, the prior year provision in 2006 includes strengthening of
Specialty Commercial construction defect claim reserves for accident years 1997 and prior and
adverse development in environmental reserves. The 2006 reserve strengthening was partially offset
by a reduction in catastrophe reserves related to the 2005 and 2004 hurricanes and a release of
allocated loss adjustment expense reserves for workers’ compensation and package business related
to accident years 2003 to 2005.

12. Commitments and Contingencies

Litigation

The Hartford is involved in claims litigation arising in the ordinary course of business, both as a
liability insurer defending or providing indemnity for third-party claims brought against insureds
and as an insurer defending coverage claims brought against it. The Hartford accounts for such
activity through the establishment of unpaid loss and loss adjustment expense reserves. Subject to
the uncertainties discussed below under the caption “Asbestos and Environmental Claims,” management
expects that the ultimate liability, if any, with respect to such ordinary-course claims
litigation, after consideration of provisions made for potential losses and costs of defense, will
not be material to the consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash flows of The
Hartford.

The Hartford is also involved in other kinds of legal actions, some of which assert claims for
substantial amounts. These actions include, among others, putative state and federal class actions
seeking certification of a state or national class. Such putative class actions have alleged, for
example, underpayment of claims or improper underwriting practices in connection with various kinds
of insurance policies, such as personal and commercial automobile, property, life and inland
marine; improper sales practices in connection with the sale of life insurance and other investment
products; and improper fee arrangements in connection with mutual funds and structured settlements.
The Hartford also is involved in individual actions in which punitive damages are sought, such as
claims alleging bad faith in the handling of insurance claims. Like many other insurers, The
Hartford also has been joined in actions by asbestos plaintiffs asserting, among other things, that
insurers had a duty to protect the public from the dangers of asbestos and that insurers committed
unfair trade practices by asserting defenses on behalf of their policyholders in the underlying
asbestos cases. Management expects that the ultimate liability, if any, with respect to such
lawsuits, after consideration of provisions made for estimated losses, will not be material to the
consolidated financial condition of The Hartford. Nonetheless, given the large or indeterminate
amounts sought in certain of these actions, and the inherent unpredictability of litigation, an
adverse outcome in certain matters could, from time to time, have a material adverse effect on the
Company’s consolidated results of operations or cash flows in particular quarterly or annual
periods.

Broker Compensation Litigation –

Following the New York Attorney General’s filing of a civil
complaint against Marsh & McLennan Companies, Inc., and Marsh, Inc. (collectively, “Marsh”) in
October 2004 alleging that certain insurance companies, including The Hartford, participated with
Marsh in arrangements to submit inflated bids for business insurance and paid contingent
commissions to ensure that Marsh would direct business to them, private plaintiffs brought several
lawsuits against the Company predicated on the allegations in the Marsh complaint, to which the
Company was not party. Among these is a multidistrict litigation in the United States District
Court for the District of New Jersey. There are two consolidated amended complaints filed in the
multidistrict litigation, one related to conduct in connection with the sale of property-casualty
insurance and the other related to alleged conduct in connection with the sale of group benefits
products. The Company and various of its subsidiaries are named in both complaints. The
complaints assert, on behalf of a putative class of persons who purchased insurance through broker
defendants, claims under the Sherman Act, the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act
(“RICO”), state law, and in the case of the group-benefits products complaint, claims under ERISA.
The claims are predicated upon allegedly undisclosed or otherwise improper payments of contingent
commissions to the broker defendants to steer business to the insurance company defendants. The
district court has dismissed the Sherman Act and RICO claims in both complaints for failure to
state a claim and has granted the defendants’ motions for summary judgment on the ERISA claims in
the group-benefits products complaint. The district court further has declined to exercise
supplemental jurisdiction over the state law claims, has dismissed those state law claims without
prejudice, and has closed both cases. The plaintiffs have appealed the dismissal of the claims in
both consolidated amended complaints, except the ERISA claims.

consolidated securities actions assert claims on behalf of a putative class of shareholders
alleging that the Company and certain of its executive officers violated Section 10(b) of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 by failing to disclose to the investing public that
The Hartford’s business and growth was predicated on the
unlawful activity alleged in the New York Attorney General’s complaint against Marsh. The
consolidated derivative actions, brought by shareholders on behalf of the Company against its
directors and an additional executive officer, allege that the defendants knew adverse non-public
information about the activities alleged in the Marsh complaint and concealed and misappropriated
that information to make profitable stock trades in violation of their duties to the Company.
Defendants filed a motion to dismiss the consolidated derivative actions in May 2005. Those
proceedings are stayed by agreement of the parties. In July 2006, the district court granted
defendants’ motion to dismiss the consolidated securities actions, and the plaintiffs appealed. In
November 2008, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit vacated the decision and
remanded the case to the district court. The Company will renew its motion to dismiss with respect
to issues that the district court did not address in the prior ruling.

In September 2007, the Ohio Attorney General filed a civil action in Ohio state court alleging that
certain insurance companies, including The Hartford, conspired with Marsh in violation of Ohio’s
antitrust statute. The trial court denied defendants’ motion to dismiss the complaint in July
2008. The Company disputes the allegations and intends to defend this action vigorously.

Investment And Savings Plan ERISA Class Action Litigation

– In November and December 2008,
following a decline in the share price of the Company’s common stock, seven putative class action
lawsuits were filed in the United States District Court for the District of Connecticut on behalf
of certain participants in the Company’s Investment and Savings Plan (“the Plan”), which offers the
Company’s common stock as one of many investment options. These lawsuits allege that the Company
and certain of its officers and employees violated ERISA by allowing the Plan’s participants to
invest in the Company’s common stock and by failing to disclose to the Plan’s participants
information about the Company’s financial condition. These lawsuits seek restitution or damages
for losses arising from the investment of the Plan’s assets in the Company’s common stock during
the alleged class periods. The cases have been consolidated. The Company disputes the allegations
and intends to defend the actions vigorously.

Fair Credit Reporting Act Class Action

– In February 2007, the United States District Court for the
District of Oregon gave final approval of the Company’s settlement of a lawsuit brought on behalf
of a class of homeowners and automobile policy holders alleging that the Company willfully violated
the Fair Credit Reporting Act by failing to send appropriate notices to new customers whose initial
rates were higher than they would have been had the customer had a more favorable credit report.
The settlement was made on a claim-in, nationwide-class basis and required eligible class members
to return valid claim forms postmarked no later than June 28, 2007. The Company has paid $84.3 to
eligible claimants in connection with the settlement. The Company has sought reimbursement from
the Company’s Excess Professional Liability Insurance Program for the portion of the settlement in
excess of the Company’s $10 self-insured retention. Certain insurance carriers participating in
that program have disputed coverage for the settlement, and one of the excess insurers has
commenced an arbitration to resolve the dispute. Management believes it is probable that the
Company’s coverage position ultimately will be sustained.

Call-Center Patent Litigation

– In June 2007, the holder of twenty-one patents related to automated
call flow processes, Ronald A. Katz Technology Licensing, LP (“Katz”), brought an action against
the Company and various of its subsidiaries in the United States District Court for the Southern
District of New York. The action alleges that the Company’s call centers use automated processes
that willfully infringe the Katz patents. Katz previously has brought similar patent-infringement
actions against a wide range of other companies, none of which has reached a final adjudication of
the merits of the plaintiff’s claims, but many of which have resulted in settlements under which
the defendants agreed to pay licensing fees. The case was transferred to a multidistrict
litigation in the United States District Court for the Central District of California, which is
currently presiding over other Katz patent cases. In August 2008, the Company reached a settlement
under which the Company purchased a license under the patent portfolio held by Katz in exchange for
a payment of an immaterial amount.

Asbestos and Environmental Claims

The Company continues to receive asbestos and environmental claims. Asbestos claims relate
primarily to bodily injuries asserted by people who came in contact with asbestos or products
containing asbestos. Environmental claims relate primarily to pollution and related clean-up costs.

The Company wrote several different categories of insurance contracts that may cover asbestos and
environmental claims. First, the Company wrote primary policies providing the first layer of
coverage in an insured’s liability program. Second, the Company wrote excess policies providing
higher layers of coverage for losses that exhaust the limits of underlying coverage. Third, the
Company acted as a reinsurer assuming a portion of those risks assumed by other insurers writing
primary, excess and reinsurance coverages. Fourth, subsidiaries of the Company participated in the
London Market, writing both direct insurance and assumed reinsurance business.

With regard to both environmental and particularly asbestos claims, significant uncertainty limits
the ability of insurers and reinsurers to estimate the ultimate reserves necessary for unpaid
losses and related expenses. Traditional actuarial reserving techniques cannot reasonably estimate
the ultimate cost of these claims, particularly during periods where theories of law are in flux.
The degree of variability of reserve estimates for these exposures is significantly greater than
for other more traditional exposures. In particular, the Company believes there is a high degree
of uncertainty inherent in the estimation of asbestos loss reserves.

In the case of the reserves for asbestos exposures, factors contributing to the high degree of
uncertainty include inadequate loss development patterns, plaintiffs’ expanding theories of
liability, the risks inherent in major litigation, and inconsistent emerging legal doctrines.
Furthermore, over time, insurers, including the Company, have experienced significant changes in
the rate at which asbestos claims are brought, the claims experience of particular insureds, and
the value of claims, making predictions of future exposure from past experience uncertain.
Plaintiffs and insureds also have sought to use bankruptcy proceedings, including “pre-packaged”
bankruptcies, to accelerate and increase loss payments by insurers. In addition, some
policyholders have asserted new classes of claims for coverages to which an aggregate limit of
liability may not apply. Further uncertainties include insolvencies of other carriers and
unanticipated developments pertaining to the Company’s ability to recover reinsurance for asbestos
and environmental claims. Management believes these issues are not likely to be resolved in the
near future.

In the case of the reserves for environmental exposures, factors contributing to the high degree of
uncertainty include expanding theories of liability and damages, the risks inherent in major
litigation, inconsistent decisions concerning the existence and scope of coverage for environmental
claims, and uncertainty as to the monetary amount being sought by the claimant from the insured.

It is also not possible to predict changes in the legal and legislative environment and their
effect on the future development of asbestos and environmental claims. Although potential Federal
asbestos-related legislation was considered by the Senate in 2006, it is uncertain whether such
legislation will be reconsidered or enacted in the future and, if enacted, what its effect would be
on the Company’s aggregate asbestos liabilities.

The reporting pattern for assumed reinsurance claims, including those related to asbestos and
environmental claims, is much longer than for direct claims. In many instances, it takes months or
years to determine that the policyholder’s own obligations have been met and how the reinsurance in
question may apply to such claims. The delay in reporting reinsurance claims and exposures adds to
the uncertainty of estimating the related reserves.

Given the factors described above, the Company believes the actuarial tools and other techniques it
employs to estimate the ultimate cost of claims for more traditional kinds of insurance exposure
are less precise in estimating reserves for its asbestos and environmental exposures. For this
reason, the Company relies on exposure-based analysis to estimate the ultimate costs of these
claims and regularly evaluates new information in assessing its potential asbestos and
environmental exposures.

As of December 31, 2008 and December 31, 2007, the Company reported $1.9 billion and $2.0 billion
of net asbestos reserves and $275 and $257 of net environmental reserves, respectively. The
Company believes that its current asbestos and environmental reserves are appropriate. However,
analyses of future developments could cause The Hartford to change its estimates and ranges of its
asbestos and environmental reserves, and the effect of these changes could be material to the
Company’s consolidated operating results, financial condition, and liquidity.

Regulatory Developments

On July 23, 2007, the Company entered into an agreement (the “Agreement”) with the New York
Attorney General’s Office, the Connecticut Attorney General’s Office, and the Illinois Attorney
General’s Office to resolve (i) the previously disclosed investigations by these Attorneys General
regarding the Company’s compensation agreements with brokers, alleged participation in arrangements
to submit inflated bids, compensation arrangements in connection with the administration of workers
compensation plans and reporting of workers compensation premium, participation in finite
reinsurance transactions, sale of fixed and individual annuities used to fund structured
settlements, and marketing and sale of individual and group variable annuity products and (ii) the
previously disclosed investigation by the New York Attorney General’s Office of aspects of the
Company’s variable annuity and mutual fund operations related to market timing. In light of the
Agreement, the Staff of the Securities and Exchange Commission has informed the Company that it has
determined to conclude its previously disclosed investigation into market timing without
recommending any enforcement action.

Under the terms of the Agreement, the Company paid $115, of which $84 represents restitution for
market timing, $5 represents restitution for issues relating to the compensation of brokers, and
$26 is a civil penalty. After taking into account previously established reserves, the Company
incurred a charge of $30, after-tax, in the second quarter of 2007 for the costs associated with
the settlement. Also pursuant to the terms of the Agreement, the Company agreed to certain conduct
remedies, including, among other things, a ban on paying contingent compensation with respect to
any line of property and casualty insurance in which insurers that do not pay contingent
compensation, together with those that have entered into similar settlement agreements,
collectively represent at least 65% of the market.

Lease Commitments

The total rental expense on operating leases was $172, $179 and $201 in 2008, 2007 and 2006,
respectively. Future minimum lease commitments are as follows:

The Company’s lease commitments consist primarily of lease agreements on office space, data
processing, furniture and fixtures, office equipment, and transportation equipment that expire at
various dates. The leases are predominantly operating leases except for a building lease agreement
that was classified as capital leases in 2007.

In November 2007, the Company entered into a firm commitment to purchase certain furniture and
fixtures which were subject to a sale leaseback agreement and recorded a capital lease of $14. This
purchase was completed in June 2008. In May 2007, the Company entered into a firm commitment to
purchase office buildings and recorded a capital lease of $114. Capital lease assets are included
in property and equipment. See note 14 for further information on capital lease obligations.

Unfunded Commitments

At December 31, 2008, The Hartford has outstanding commitments totaling approximately $1.1 billion,
of which approximately $1.0 billion is committed to fund limited partnership investments. These
capital commitments can be called by the partnership during the commitment period (on average two
to five years) to fund the purchase of new investments and partnership expenses. Once the
commitment period expires, the Company is under no obligation to fund the remaining unfunded
commitment but may elect to do so. The remaining outstanding commitments are primarily related to
various funding obligations associated with investments in mortgage and construction loans. These
have a commitment period of one month to three years.

Guaranty Fund and Other Insurance-related Assessments

In all states, insurers licensed to transact certain classes of insurance are required to become
members of a guaranty fund. In most states, in the event of the insolvency of an insurer writing
any such class of insurance in the state, members of the funds are assessed to pay certain claims
of the insolvent insurer. A particular state’s fund assesses its members based on their respective
written premiums in the state for the classes of insurance in which the insolvent insurer was
engaged. Assessments are generally limited for any year to one or two percent of premiums written
per year depending on the state.

The Hartford accounts for guaranty fund and other insurance assessments in accordance with
Statement of Position No. 97-3, “Accounting by Insurance and Other Enterprises for
Insurance-Related Assessments”. Liabilities for guaranty fund and other insurance-related
assessments are accrued when an assessment is probable, when it can be reasonably estimated, and
when the event obligating the Company to pay an imposed or probable assessment has occurred.
Liabilities for guaranty funds and other insurance-related assessments are not discounted and are
included as part of other liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of December 31, 2008
and 2007, the liability balance was $128 and $147, respectively. As of December 31, 2008 and 2007,
$17 and $19, respectively, related to premium tax offsets were included in other assets.

Tax Matters

The Company’s federal income tax returns are routinely audited by the Internal Revenue Service
(“IRS”). During 2008, the IRS completed its examination of the Company’s U.S. income tax returns
for 2002 through 2003. The Company received notification of the approval by the Joint Committee on
Taxation of the results of the examination subsequent to December 31, 2008. The examination will
not have a material effect on the Company’s net income or financial position. The 2004 through
2006 examination began during 2008, and is expected to close by the end of 2010. In addition, the
Company is working with the IRS on a possible settlement of an issue related to prior periods
which, if settled, may result in the booking of tax benefits in 2009. Such benefits are not
expected to be material to the Company’s net income or financial position. Management believes
that adequate provision has been made in the financial statements for any potential assessments
that may result from tax examinations and other tax-related matters for all open tax years.

The separate account dividends-received deduction (“DRD”) is estimated for the current year using
information from the prior year-end, adjusted for current year equity market performance and other
appropriate factors, including estimated levels of corporate dividend payments. The estimated DRD
was updated in the third quarter for the provision-to-filed-return adjustments, and in the fourth
quarter based on current year ultimate mutual fund distributions and fee income from the Company’s
variable insurance products. The actual current year DRD varied from earlier estimates based on,
but not limited to, changes in eligible dividends received by the mutual funds, amounts of
distributions from these mutual funds, amounts of short-term capital gains and asset values at the
mutual fund level and the Company’s taxable income before the DRD. Given recent financial markets’
volatility, the Company intends to review its DRD computations on a quarterly basis, beginning in
2009. The Company recorded benefits of $176, $155 and $174 related to the separate account DRD in
the years ended December 31, 2008, December 31, 2007 and December 31, 2006, respectively. The 2008
benefit included a benefit of $9 related to a true-up of the prior year tax return, the 2007
benefit included a charge of $1 related to a true-up of the prior year tax return, and the 2006
benefit included a benefit of $6 related to true-ups of prior years’ tax returns.

In Revenue Ruling 2007-61, issued on September 25, 2007, the IRS announced its intention to issue
regulations with respect to certain computational aspects of the DRD on separate account assets
held in connection with variable annuity contracts. Revenue Ruling 2007-61 suspended Revenue
Ruling 2007-54, issued in August 2007 that purported to change accepted industry and IRS
interpretations of the statutes governing these computational questions. Any regulations that the
IRS may ultimately propose for issuance in this area will be subject to public notice and comment,
at which time insurance companies and other members of the public will have the opportunity to
raise legal and practical questions about the content, scope and application of such regulations.
As a result, the ultimate timing and substance of any such regulations are unknown, but they could
result in the elimination of some or all of the separate account DRD tax benefit that the Company
receives. Management believes that it is highly likely that any such regulations would apply
prospectively only.

The Company receives a foreign tax credit (“FTC”) against its U.S. tax liability for foreign taxes
paid by the Company including payments from its separate account assets. The separate account FTC
is estimated for the current year using information from the most recent filed return, adjusted for
the change in the allocation of separate account investments to the international equity markets
during the current year. The actual current year FTC can vary from the estimates due to actual
FTCs passed through by the mutual funds. The
Company recorded benefits of $16, $11 and $17 related to separate account FTC in the years ended
December 31, 2008, December 31, 2007 and December 31, 2006, respectively. These amounts included
benefits related to true-ups of prior years’ tax returns of $4, $0 and $7 in 2008, 2007 and 2006
respectively.

The Company’s unrecognized tax benefits increased by $15 during 2008 as a result of tax positions
taken on the Company’s 2007 tax return and expected to be taken on its 2008 tax return, bringing
the total unrecognized tax benefits to $91 as of December 31, 2008. This entire amount, if it were
recognized, would affect the effective tax rate.

The Company had a current income tax receivable of $539 and $28 as of December 31, 2008 and 2007,
respectively.

In management’s judgment, the net deferred tax asset will more likely than not be realized.
Included in the deferred tax asset is the expected tax benefit attributable to net operating losses
of $2,468, consisting of U.S. losses of $2,192, which expire from 2012-2026, and foreign losses of
$276. The foreign losses consist of $97, which expire from 2012-2013, and $179, which have no
expiration. A valuation allowance of $75 has been recorded which consists of $26 related primarily
to U.S and $49 related to foreign operations. No valuation allowance has been recognized for
realized or unrealized loss amounts, as the Company either has available tax-planning strategies
that are prudent and feasible, or has the ability and intent to hold securities until their
recovery.

The Company or one of its subsidiaries files income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction,
and various states and foreign jurisdictions. With few exceptions, the Company is no longer
subject to U.S. federal, state and local, or non-U.S. income tax examinations by tax authorities
for years before 2004. During 2008, the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) completed its examination
of the Company’s U.S. income tax returns for 2002 through 2003. The Company received notification
of the approval by the Joint Committee on Taxation of the results of the examination subsequent to
December 31, 2008. The examination will not have a material effect on the Company’s net income or
financial position. The 2004 through 2006 examination began during 2008, and is expected to
close by the end of 2010. In addition, the Company is working with the IRS on a possible
settlement of an issue related to prior periods which if settled, may result in the booking of tax
benefits in 2009. Such benefits are not expected to be material to the Company’s net income or
financial position. The Company does not anticipate that any of these items will result in a
significant change in the balance of unrecognized tax benefits within 12 months.

The Company adopted the provisions of FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in
Income Taxes, on January 1, 2007. As a result of the adoption, the Company recognized a $12
decrease in the liability for unrecognized tax benefits and a corresponding increase in the January
1, 2007 balance of retained earnings. A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of
unrecognized tax benefits is as follows:

recognized approximately $0, $1, and ($6) in interest expense (income). The Company had
approximately $1 and $1 of interest accrued at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The
Company does not believe it would be subject to any penalties in any open tax years and, therefore,
has not booked any accrual for penalties.

On March 9, 2007, The Hartford issued $500 of 5.375% senior notes due March 15, 2017.

Junior Subordinated Debentures

On June 6, 2008, the Company issued $500 aggregate principal amount of 8.125% fixed-to-floating
rate junior subordinated debentures (the “debentures”) due June 15, 2068 for net proceeds of
approximately $493, after deducting underwriting discounts and expenses from the offering. The
debentures bear interest at an annual fixed rate of 8.125% from the date of issuance to, but
excluding, June 15, 2018, payable semi-annually in arrears on June 15 and December 15. From and
including June 15, 2018, the debentures will bear interest at an annual rate, reset quarterly,
equal to three-month LIBOR plus 4.6025%, payable quarterly in arrears on March 15, June 15,
September 15 and December 15 of each year. The Company has the right, on one or more occasions, to
defer the payment of interest on the debentures. The Company may defer interest for up to ten
consecutive years without giving rise to an event of default. Deferred interest will accumulate
additional interest at an annual rate equal to the annual interest rate then applicable to the
debentures. If the Company defers interest for five consecutive years or, if earlier, pays current
interest during a deferral period, which may be paid from any source of funds, the Company will be
required to pay deferred interest from proceeds from the sale of certain qualifying securities.

The debentures carry a scheduled maturity date of June 15, 2038 and a final maturity date of June
15, 2068. During the 180-day period ending on a notice date not more than fifteen and not less than
ten business days prior to the scheduled maturity date, the Company is required to use commercially
reasonable efforts to sell certain qualifying replacement securities sufficient to permit repayment
of the debentures at the scheduled maturity date. If any debentures remain outstanding after the
scheduled maturity date, the unpaid amount will remain outstanding until the Company has raised
sufficient proceeds from the sale of qualifying replacement securities to permit the repayment in
full of the debentures. If there are remaining debentures at the final maturity date, the Company
is required to redeem the debentures using any source of funds.

Subject to the replacement capital covenant described below, the Company can redeem the debentures
at its option, in whole or in part, at any time on or after June 15, 2018 at a redemption price of
100% of the principal amount being redeemed plus accrued but unpaid interest. The Company can
redeem the debentures at its option prior to June 15, 2018 (a) in whole at any time or in part from
time to time or (b) in whole, but not in part, in the event of certain tax or rating agency events
relating to the debentures, at a redemption price equal to the greater of 100% of the principal
amount being redeemed and the applicable make-whole amount, in each case plus any accrued and
unpaid interest.

In connection with the offering of the debentures, the Company entered into a “replacement capital
covenant” for the benefit of holders of one or more designated series of the Company’s
indebtedness, initially the Company’s 6.1% notes due 2041. Under the terms of the replacement
capital covenant, if the Company redeems the debentures at any time prior to June 15, 2048 it can
only do so with the proceeds from the sale of certain qualifying replacement securities.

For a discussion of the 10.0% junior subordinated debentures due 2068, see Note 21.

Capital Lease Obligations

The Company recorded capital leases of $92 and $128 in 2008 and 2007, respectively. Capital lease
obligations are included in long-term debt, except for the current maturities, which are included
in short-term debt, in the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2008 and 2007,
respectively. See Note 12 for further information on capital lease commitments.

Shelf Registrations

On April 11, 2007, The Hartford filed an automatic shelf registration statement (Registration No.
333-142044) for the potential offering and sale of debt and equity securities with the Securities
and Exchange Commission. The registration statement allows for the following types of securities
to be offered: (i) debt securities, preferred stock, common stock, depositary shares, warrants,
stock purchase contracts, stock purchase units and junior subordinated deferrable interest
debentures of the Company, and (ii) preferred securities of any of one or more capital trusts
organized by The Hartford (“The Hartford Trusts”). The Company may enter into guarantees with
respect to the preferred securities of any of The Hartford Trusts. In that The Hartford is a
well-known seasoned issuer, as defined in Rule 405 under the Securities Act of 1933, the
registration statement went effective immediately upon filing and The Hartford may offer and sell
an unlimited amount of securities under the registration statement during the three-year life of
the shelf.

Contingent Capital Facility

On February 12, 2007, The Hartford entered into a put option agreement (the “Put Option Agreement”)
with Glen Meadow ABC Trust, a Delaware statutory trust (the “ABC Trust”), and LaSalle Bank National
Association, as put option calculation agent. The Put Option Agreement provides The Hartford with
the right to require the ABC Trust, at any time and from time to time, to purchase The Hartford’s
junior subordinated notes (the “Notes”) in a maximum aggregate principal amount not to exceed $500.
Under the Put Option Agreement, The Hartford will pay the ABC Trust premiums on a periodic basis,
calculated with respect to the aggregate principal amount of Notes that The Hartford had the right
to put to the ABC Trust for such period. The Hartford has agreed to reimburse the ABC Trust for
certain fees and ordinary expenses. The Company holds a variable interest in the ABC Trust where
the Company is not the primary beneficiary. As a result, the Company did not consolidate the ABC
Trust, as they did not meet the consolidation requirements under FASB Interpretation No. 46
(revised December 2003), “Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, an interpretation of ARB No.
51” (“FIN 46(R)”).

14. Debt (continued)

The Federal Reserve Board authorized the Commercial Paper Funding Facility (“CPFF”) on October 7,
2008 under Section 13(3) of the Federal Reserve Act to provide a liquidity backstop to U.S. issuers
of commercial paper. The CPFF is intended to improve liquidity in short-term funding markets by
increasing the availability of term commercial paper funding to issuers and by providing greater
assurance to both issuers and investors that firms will be able to roll over their maturing
commercial paper.

The Company registered with the CPFF in order to sell up to a maximum of $375 to the facility of
which it has issued the full amount as of December 31, 2008. The Company’s commercial paper must
be rated A-1/P-1/F1 by at least two ratings agencies to be eligible for the program. In the first
quarter of 2009, Moody’s, S&P and Fitch downgraded the Company’s commercial paper rating, rendering
the Company ineligible to sell additional commercial paper under the CPFF program going forward.
As a result, the Company will be required to pay the commercial paper issued under the CPFF program
upon maturity.

While The Hartford’s maximum borrowings available under its commercial paper program are $2.0
billion, which includes the $375 from the CPFF, the Company is dependent upon market conditions,
including recent market conditions, to finance the remaining available commercial paper with
investors.

Consumer Notes

Institutional began issuing consumer notes through its Retail Investor Notes Program in September
2006. A consumer note is an investment product distributed through broker-dealers directly to
retail investors as medium-term, publicly traded fixed or floating rate, or a combination of fixed
and floating rate, notes. Consumer notes are part of the Company’s spread-based business and
proceeds are used to purchase investment products, primarily fixed rate bonds. Proceeds are not
used for general operating purposes. Consumer notes maturities may extend up to 30 years and have
contractual coupons based upon varying interest rates or indexes (e.g. consumer price index) and
may include a call provision that allows the Company to extinguish the notes prior to its scheduled
maturity date. Certain Consumer notes may be redeemed by the holder in the event of death.
Redemptions are subject to certain limitations, including calendar year aggregate and individual
limits. The aggregate limit is equal to the greater of $1 or 1% of the aggregate principal amount
of the notes as of the end of the prior year. The individual limit is $250 thousand per
individual. Derivative instruments are utilized to hedge the Company’s exposure to market risk in
accordance with Company policy.

As of December 31, 2008 and 2007, $1,210 and $809, respectively, of consumer notes were
outstanding. As of December 31, 2008, these consumer notes have interest rates ranging from 4.0%
to 6.3% for fixed notes and, for variable notes, based on December 31, 2008 rates, notes indexed to
the consumer price index plus 80 to 267 basis points, or indexed to the S&P 500, Dow Jones
Industrials, foreign currency, or the Nikkei 225. The aggregate maturities of consumer notes are
as follows: $11 in 2009, $30 in 2010, $131 in 2011, $291 in 2012 and $751 thereafter. For 2008 and
2007, interest credited to holders of consumer notes was $59 and $11, respectively. During 2008,
the Company made the decision to discontinue future issuances of consumer notes, this decision does
not impact consumer notes currently outstanding.

15. Stockholders’ Equity

Common Stock

In June 2008, The Hartford’s Board of Directors authorized an incremental $1 billion stock
repurchase program which was in addition to the previously announced $2 billion program. The
Company’s repurchase authorization permits purchases of common stock, which may be in the open
market or through privately negotiated transactions. The Company also may enter into derivative
transactions to facilitate future repurchases of common stock. The timing of any future
repurchases will be dependent upon several factors, including the market price of the Company’s
securities, the Company’s capital position, consideration of the effect of any repurchases on the
Company’s financial strength or credit ratings, the Company’s potential participation in the CPP,
and other corporate considerations. The repurchase program may be modified, extended or terminated
by the Board of Directors at any time. As of December 31, 2008, The Hartford has completed the $2
billion stock repurchase program and has $807 remaining for stock repurchase under the $1 billion
repurchase program.

In 2006, the Company issued approximately 12.1 million and 5.7 million shares of common stock in
connection with the settlement of purchase contracts originally issued in 2003 and 2002,
respectively, as components of our equity units, see below.

Preferred Stock

The Company has 50,000,000 shares of preferred stock authorized, see Note 21 for a discussion of
Allianz SE’s investment in The Hartford.

Equity Units Offerings

In May 2003, The Hartford issued 13.8 million 7% equity units at a price of fifty dollars per unit
and received net proceeds of approximately $669. Each equity unit initially consisted of one
purchase contract for a certain number of shares of the Company’s stock on August 16, 2006 and a 5%
ownership interest in one thousand dollars principal amount of senior notes due August 16, 2008.
The senior notes had an aggregate principal amount of $690. In May 2006, the senior notes were
successfully remarketed on behalf of the holders of the equity units and the interest rate was
reset from 2.56% to 5.55%, effective May 16, 2006. The Company did not receive any proceeds from
the remarketing. Rather, the remarketing proceeds were utilized to purchase a portfolio of U.S.
Treasury securities, which was pledged to the Company as collateral to satisfy the purchase
contractholders’ obligations to purchase the Company’s stock. In connection with the remarketing,
The Hartford purchased and retired $265 of the senior notes for approximately $265 in cash and
recognized an immaterial gain on the early extinguishment. In August 2006, under the forward
purchase contracts, the Company issued approximately 12.1 million shares of common stock and
received proceeds of approximately $690.

In September 2002, The Hartford issued 6.6 million 6% equity units at a price of fifty dollars per
unit and received net proceeds of $319. Each equity unit initially consisted of one purchase
contract for a certain number of shares of the Company’s stock on November 16, 2006 and fifty
dollars principal amount of senior notes due November 16, 2008. The senior notes had an aggregate
principal amount of $330. In August 2006, the senior notes were successfully remarketed on behalf
of the holders of the equity units and the interest rate was reset from 4.10% to 5.663%, effective
August 16, 2006. The Company did not receive any proceeds from the remarketing. Rather, the
remarketing proceeds were utilized to purchase a portfolio of U.S. Treasury securities, which was
pledged to the Company as collateral to satisfy the purchase contractholders’ obligations to
purchase the Company’s stock. In November 2006, under the forward purchase contracts, the Company
issued approximately 5.7 million shares of common stock and received proceeds of approximately
$330.

Statutory Results

The domestic insurance subsidiaries of HFSG prepare their statutory financial statements in
conformity with statutory accounting practices prescribed or permitted by the applicable state
insurance department which vary materially from U.S. GAAP. Prescribed statutory accounting
practices include publications of the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (“NAIC”), as
well as state laws, regulations and general administrative rules. The differences between
statutory financial statements and financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP vary
between domestic and foreign jurisdictions. The principal differences are that statutory financial
statements do not reflect deferred policy acquisition costs and limit deferred income taxes, life
benefit reserves predominately use interest rate and mortality assumptions prescribed by the NAIC,
bonds are generally carried at amortized cost and reinsurance assets and liabilities are presented
net of reinsurance.

The statutory net income amounts for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, and the statutory
surplus amounts as of December 31, 2007 and 2006 in the table below are based on actual statutory
filings with the applicable regulatory authorities. The statutory net income (loss) amounts for
the year ended December 31, 2008 and the statutory surplus amounts as of December 31, 2008 are
estimates, as the respective 2008 statutory filings have not yet been made.

The Company has received approval from the Connecticut Insurance Department regarding the use of
two permitted practices in the statutory financial statements of its Connecticut-domiciled life
insurance subsidiaries as of December 31, 2008. The first permitted practice relates to the
statutory accounting for deferred income taxes. Specifically, this
permitted practice modifies the accounting for deferred income taxes prescribed by the NAIC by increasing the realization
period for deferred tax assets from one year to three years and increasing the asset recognition
limit from 10% to 15% of adjusted statutory capital and surplus. The benefits of this permitted
practice may not be considered by the Company when determining surplus available for dividends.
The second permitted practice relates to the statutory reserving requirements for variable
annuities with guaranteed living benefit riders. Actuarial guidelines prescribed by the NAIC
require a stand-alone asset adequacy analysis reflecting only benefits, expenses and charges that
are associated with the riders for variable annuities with guaranteed living benefits. The
permitted practice allows for all benefits, expenses and charges associated with the variable
annuity contract to be reflected in the stand-alone asset adequacy test. These permitted practices
resulted in an increase to Life operations estimated statutory surplus of $987 as of December 31,
2008. The effects of these permitted practices are included in the 2008 Life operations surplus
amount in the table above.

HFSG and HLI are holding companies which rely upon operating cash flow in the form of dividends
from their subsidiaries, which enable them to service debt, pay dividends, and pay certain business
expenses. Dividends to the Company from its insurance subsidiaries are restricted. The payment of
dividends by Connecticut-domiciled insurers is limited under the insurance holding company laws of
Connecticut. These laws require notice to and approval by the state insurance commissioner for the
declaration or payment of any dividend, which, together with other dividends or distributions made
within the preceding twelve months, exceeds the greater of (i) 10% of the insurer’s policyholder
surplus as of December 31 of the preceding year or (ii) net income (or net gain from operations, if
such company is a life insurance company) for the twelve-month period ending on the thirty-first
day of December last preceding, in each case determined under statutory insurance accounting
principles. In addition, if any dividend of a Connecticut-domiciled insurer exceeds the insurer’s
earned surplus, it requires the prior approval of the Connecticut Insurance Commissioner. The
insurance holding company laws of the other jurisdictions in which The Hartford’s insurance
subsidiaries are incorporated (or deemed commercially domiciled) generally contain similar
(although in certain instances somewhat more restrictive) limitations on the payment of dividends.
It is estimated that the Company’s property-casualty insurance subsidiaries will be permitted to
pay up to a maximum of approximately $1.2 billion in dividends to HFSG in 2009 without prior
approval from the applicable insurance commissioner. Through at least October 30, 2009,
substantially all dividend payments from the Company’s property-casualty insurance subsidiaries
will be subject to prior approval of the Connecticut Insurance Commissioner due to extraordinary
dividend limitations under the insurance holding company laws of Connecticut. With respect to dividends to HLI, it is estimated that the Company’s life insurance subsidiaries’
non-extraordinary dividend limitation under the insurance holding company laws of Connecticut is approximately $631
in 2009. However, because the life insurance subsidiaries’
earned surplus is only approximately $597 as of
December 31, 2008, the Company’s life insurance
subsidiaries will be permitted to pay dividends up to this amount to HLI in 2009 without prior approval from the applicable insurance commissioner. In 2008, HFSG and HLI received a combined total of $2.8 billion from their insurance subsidiaries.

17. Pension Plans and Postretirement Health Care and Life Insurance Benefit Plans

The Company maintains a qualified defined benefit pension plan (the “Plan”) that covers
substantially all employees. Effective for all employees who joined the Company on or after
January 1, 2001, a new component or formula was applied under the Plan referred to as the “cash
balance formula”. As of January 1, 2009, the cash balance formula will be used to calculate future
pension benefits for services rendered on or after January 1, 2009 for all employees hired before
January 1, 2001. These amounts are in addition to amounts earned by those employees through
December 31, 2008 under the traditional final average pay formula.

The Company also maintains non-qualified pension plans to accrue retirement benefits in excess of
Internal Revenue Code limitations.

The Company provides certain health care and life insurance benefits for eligible retired
employees. The Company’s contribution for health care benefits will depend upon the retiree’s date
of retirement and years of service. In addition, the plan has a defined dollar cap for certain
retirees which limits average Company contributions. The Hartford has prefunded a portion of the
health care obligations through a trust fund where such prefunding can be accomplished on a tax
effective basis. Effective January 1, 2002, Company-subsidized retiree medical, retiree dental and
retiree life insurance benefits were eliminated for employees with original hire dates with the
Company on or after January 1, 2002.

Assumptions

Pursuant to accounting principles related to the Company’s pension and other postretirement
obligations to employees under its various benefit plans, the Company is required to make a
significant number of assumptions in order to calculate the related liabilities and expenses each
period. The two economic assumptions that have the most impact on pension and other postretirement
expense are the discount rate and the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. In
determining the discount rate assumption, the Company utilizes a discounted cash flow analysis of
the Company’s pension and other postretirement obligations and currently available market and
industry data. The yield curve utilized in the cash flow analysis is comprised of bonds rated Aa
or higher with maturities primarily between zero and thirty years. Based on all available
information, it was determined that 6.25% was the appropriate discount rate as of December 31, 2008
to calculate the Company’s pension and other postretirement obligations. Accordingly, the 6.25%
discount rate will also be used to determine the Company’s 2009 pension and other postretirement
expense.

The Company determines the expected long-term rate of return assumption based on an analysis of the
Plan portfolio’s historical compound rates of return since 1979 (the earliest date for which
comparable portfolio data is available) and over 5 year and 10 year periods. The Company selected
these periods, as well as shorter durations, to assess the portfolio’s volatility, duration and
total returns as they relate to pension obligation characteristics, which are influenced by the
Company’s workforce demographics. In addition, the Company also applies long-term market return
assumptions utilized in Life’s DAC analysis to an investment mix that generally anticipates 60%
fixed income securities, 20% equity securities and 20% alternative assets to derive an expected
long-term rate of return. Based upon these analyses, management maintained the long-term rate of
return assumption at 7.30% as of December 31, 2008. This assumption will be used to determine the
Company’s 2009 expense.

Weighted average assumptions used in calculating the benefit obligations and the net amount
recognized for the plans per year were as follows:

In order to better measure its other postretirement liability and the related assumptions
consistent with industry trends and practice, the company bifurcated its health care cost trend
rate assumptions to assess the pre-65 and post-65 populations separately effective for the year
ended December 31, 2007.

Assumed health care cost trends have an effect on the amounts reported for the postretirement
health care and life insurance benefit plans. Increasing/decreasing the health care trend rates by
one percent each year would have the effect of decreasing/increasing the benefit obligation as of
December 31, 2008 by $5 and the annual net periodic expense for the year then ended by $1.

17. Pension Plans and Postretirement Health Care and Life Insurance Benefit Plans (continued)

The fair value of assets for pension benefits, and hence the funded status, presented in the table
above exclude assets of $126 and $138 held in rabbi trusts and designated for the non-qualified
pension plans as of December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The assets do not qualify as plan
assets and, therefore, have been excluded from the table above. The assets consist of equity and
fixed income investments and are available to pay benefits for certain retired, terminated and
active participants. Such assets are available to the Company’s general creditors in the event of
insolvency. To the extent the fair value of these trusts were included in the table above, pension
plan assets would have been $3,452 and $4,095 as of December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively, and
the funded status of pension benefits would have been $(486) and $382 as of December 31, 2008 and
2007, respectively.

The accumulated benefit obligation for all defined benefit pension plans was $3,914 and $3,655 as
of December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively.

The following table provides information for The Hartford’s defined benefit pension plans with an
accumulated benefit obligation in excess of plan assets as of December 31, 2008 and 2007.

benefit plans that will be amortized from accumulated other comprehensive loss into net periodic
benefit cost during 2009 is $(1). The estimated net loss for the other postretirement plans that
will be amortized from accumulated other comprehensive loss into net periodic benefit cost during
2009 is $0, as the level of actuarial net losses does not exceed the allowable amortization
corridor as defined under SFAS No. 106.

There was no Company common stock included in the other postretirement benefit plan assets as of
December 31, 2008 and 2007.

The overall goal of the Plan is to maximize total investment returns to provide sufficient funding
for present and anticipated future benefit obligations within the constraints of a prudent level of
portfolio risk and diversification. Investment decisions are approved by the Company’s Pension
Fund Trust and Investment Committee. The Company believes that the asset allocation decision will
be the single most important factor determining the long-term performance of the Plan.

Divergent market performance among different asset classes may, from time to time, cause the asset
allocation to deviate from the desired asset allocation ranges. The asset allocation mix is
reviewed on a periodic basis. If it is determined that an asset allocation mix rebalancing is
required, future portfolio additions and withdrawals will be used, as necessary, to bring the
allocation within tactical ranges.

In order to minimize risk, the Plan maintains a listing of permissible and prohibited investments.
In addition, the Plan has certain concentration limits and investment quality requirements imposed
on permissible investment options. The Company employs a duration overlay program to adjust the
duration of the fixed income component in the Plan assets to better match the duration of the
benefit obligation. The portfolio will invest primarily in U.S. Treasury notes and bond futures
contracts to maintain the duration within +/- 0.75 year of target duration.

Cash Flows

The Company presently anticipates contributing approximately $200 to its pension plans and other
postretirement plans in 2009 based upon certain economic and business assumptions. These
assumptions include, but are not limited to, equity market performance, changes in interest rates
and the Company’s other capital requirements. For 2009, the Company does not have a required
minimum funding contribution for the Plan and the funding requirements for all of the pension plans
are immaterial.

Employer contributions in 2008 and 2007 were made in cash and did not include contributions of the
Company’s common stock.

18. Stock Compensation Plans

The Company has two primary stock-based compensation plans which are described below. Shares
issued in satisfaction of stock-based compensation may be made available from authorized but
unissued shares, shares held by the Company in treasury or from shares purchased in the open
market. In 2008, the Company issued shares from treasury in satisfaction of stock-based
compensation. In 2007 and 2006, the Company issued new shares in satisfaction of stock-based
compensation. The compensation expense recognized for the stock-based compensation plans was $62,
$72 and $61 for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007, and 2006, respectively. The income tax
benefit recognized for stock-based compensation plans was $19, $23 and $20 for the years ended
December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The Company did not capitalize any cost of
stock-based compensation. As of December 31, 2008, the total compensation cost related to
non-vested awards not yet recognized was $68, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted
average period of 1.9 years.

Stock Plan

In 2005, the shareholders of The Hartford approved The Hartford 2005 Incentive Stock Plan (the
“2005 Stock Plan”), which superseded and replaced The Hartford Incentive Stock Plan and The
Hartford Restricted Stock Plan for Non-employee Directors. The terms of the 2005 Stock Plan are
substantially similar to the terms of the superseded plans.

The 2005 Stock Plan provides for awards to be granted in the form of non-qualified or incentive
stock options qualifying under Section 422 of the Internal Revenue Code, stock appreciation rights,
performance shares, restricted stock, restricted stock units, or any combination of the foregoing.
The aggregate number of shares of stock, which may be awarded, is subject to a maximum limit of
seven million shares applicable to all awards for the ten-year period ending May 18, 2015. To the
extent that any awards under the 2005 Stock Plan, The Hartford Incentive Stock Plan or The Hartford
Restricted Stock Plan for Non-employee Directors are forfeited, terminated, expire unexercised or
are settled for cash in lieu of stock, the shares subject to such awards (or the relevant portion
thereof) shall be available for awards under the 2005 Stock Plan and shall be added to the total
number of shares available under the 2005 Stock Plan. As of December 31, 2008, there were
4,913,890 shares available for future issuance.

The fair values of awards granted under the 2005 Stock Plan are measured as of the grant date and
expensed ratably over the awards’ vesting periods, generally three years. For stock option awards
granted or modified in 2006 and later, the Company began expensing awards to retirement-eligible
employees hired before January 1, 2002 immediately or over a period shorter than the stated vesting
period because the employees receive accelerated vesting upon retirement and therefore the vesting
period is considered non-substantive. All awards provide for accelerated vesting upon a change in
control of the Company as defined in the 2005 Stock Plan.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)

18. Stock Compensation Plans (continued)

Stock Option Awards

Under the 2005 Stock Plan, all options granted have an exercise price equal to the market price of
the Company’s common stock on the date of grant, and an option’s maximum term is ten years.
Certain options become exercisable over a three year period commencing one year from the date of
grant, while certain other options become exercisable at the later of three years from the date of
grant or upon specified market appreciation of the Company’s common shares. For any year, no
individual employee may receive an award of options for more than 1,000,000 shares.

The Company uses a hybrid lattice/Monte-Carlo based option valuation model (the “valuation model”)
that incorporates the possibility of early exercise of options into the valuation. The valuation
model also incorporates the Company’s historical termination and exercise experience to determine
the option value. For these reasons, the Company believes the valuation model provides a fair
value that is more representative of actual experience than the value calculated under the
Black-Scholes model.

The valuation model incorporates ranges of assumptions for inputs, and therefore, those ranges are
disclosed below. The term structure of volatility is constructed utilizing implied volatilities
from exchange-traded options on the Company’s stock, historical volatility of the Company’s stock
and other factors. The Company uses historical data to estimate option exercise and employee
termination within the valuation model, and accommodates variations in employee preference and
risk-tolerance by segregating the grantee pool into a series of behavioral cohorts and conducting a
fair valuation for each cohort individually. The expected term of options granted is derived from
the output of the option valuation model and represents, in a mathematical sense, the period of
time that options are expected to be outstanding. The risk-free rate for periods within the
contractual life of the option is based on the U.S. Constant Maturity Treasury yield curve in
effect at the time of grant.

Share Awards

Share awards are valued equal to the market price of the Company’s common stock on the date of
grant, less a discount for those awards that do not provide for dividends during the vesting
period. Share awards granted under the 2005 Stock Plan and outstanding include restricted stock
units, restricted stock and performance shares. Generally, restricted stock units vest after three
years and restricted stock vests in three to five years. Performance shares become payable within
a range of 0% to 200% of the number of shares initially granted based upon the attainment of
specific performance goals achieved over a specified period, generally three years. The maximum
award of restricted stock units, restricted stock or performance shares for any individual employee
in any year is 200,000 shares or units.

2007. The Company, at its discretion, made cash payments in settlement of stock compensation of
$36 during the year ended December 31, 2006.

Employee Stock Purchase Plan

In 1996, the Company established The Hartford Employee Stock Purchase Plan (“ESPP”). Under this
plan, eligible employees of The Hartford may purchase common stock of the Company at a 15% discount
from the lower of the closing market price at the beginning or end of each offering period.
Employees purchase a variable number of shares of stock through payroll deductions elected as of
the beginning of the offering period. The Company may sell up to 5,400,000 shares of stock to
eligible employees under the ESPP. As of December 31, 2008, there were 538,125 shares available
for future issuance. During the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, 964,365, 372,993 and
341,330 shares were sold, respectively. The weighted average per share fair value of the discount
under the ESPP was $14.12, $18.98 and $16.05 during the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and
2006, respectively. The fair value is estimated based on the 15% discount off of the beginning
stock price plus the value of three-month European call and put options on shares of stock at the
beginning stock price calculated using the Black-Scholes model and the following weighted average
valuation assumptions:

Implied volatility was derived from exchange-traded options on the Company’s stock. The risk-free

The total intrinsic value of the discounts at purchase was $5, $6 and $5 for the years ended
December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Additionally, The Hartford has established
employee stock purchase plans for certain employees of the Company’s international subsidiaries.
Under these plans, participants may purchase common stock of The Hartford at a fixed price. The
activity under these programs is not material.

19. Investment and Savings Plan

Substantially all U.S. employees are eligible to participate in The Hartford’s Investment and
Savings Plan under which designated contributions may be invested in common stock of The Hartford
or certain other investments. These contributions are matched, up to a contribution of 3% of base
salary, by the Company. In 2008, employees who had earnings of less than $100,000 in the preceding
year received a contribution of 1.5% of base salary and employees who had earnings of $100,000 or
more in the preceding year received a contribution of 0.5% of base salary. The cost to The Hartford
for this plan was approximately $64, $62, and $59 for 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively.

20. Sale of Subsidiary

On November 30, 2006, the Company sold its non-standard auto insurance business, Omni Insurance
Group, Inc. (“Omni”). Under the terms the agreement, the Company continues to be obligated for
certain extra contractual liability claims and for claims and expenses arising from all business
written by Omni in the states of California and New York. The Company has since taken action to
cease writing new non-standard business in both California and New York. The Company believes that
exiting the traditional non-standard auto insurance business will streamline its operations and
help the Company align its resources towards achieving core business objectives.

The total consideration for the sale of approximately $104 included a cash dividend prior to the
sale of $38 and a purchase price of $65, of which $60 was received in cash at closing and $5 was
received in 2007. In 2006, the Company recorded an after-tax gain from the sale of $25, which
included an income tax benefit of $49 and a pre-tax loss of $24. The pre-tax loss is recorded
within realized gains and losses in the 2006 consolidated statement of operations. The $49 income
tax benefit arose because the tax basis of the Company’s investment in Omni exceeded the financial
statement carrying value. The assets that were sold at the closing date included $172 of cash, $8
of invested assets, $31 of premiums receivable, $3 of Personal Lines segment goodwill allocated to
the Omni business and $23 of other assets. The liabilities sold at the closing date included $111
of loss and loss adjustment expense reserves, $37 of unearned premium and $14 of other liabilities.

21. Investment by Allianz SE in The Hartford

On October 17, 2008, the Company entered into an Investment Agreement (the “Investment Agreement”),
with Allianz SE (“Allianz”) under which, among other things, the Company agreed to issue and sell
in a private placement to Allianz for aggregate cash consideration of $2.5 billion: (i) $1.75
billion of the Company’s 10% Fixed-to-Floating Rate Junior Subordinated Debentures due 2068 (the
“Debentures”); (ii) 6,048,387 shares of the Company’s Series D Non-Voting Contingent Convertible
Preferred Stock (the “Series D Preferred Stock”), initially convertible (as discussed below) into
24,193,548 shares of the Company’s common stock at an issue price of $31.00 per share, resulting in
proceeds of $750; and (iii) warrants (the “Warrants”) to purchase the Company’s Series B Non-Voting
Contingent Convertible Preferred Stock (the “Series B Preferred Stock”) and Series C Non-Voting
Contingent Convertible Preferred Stock (the “Series C Preferred Stock” and, together with the
Series B Preferred Stock and the Series D Preferred Stock, the “Preferred Stock”) structured to
entitle Allianz, upon receipt of necessary approvals, to purchase 69,115,324 shares of common stock
at an initial exercise price of $25.32 per share.

The Company has also agreed that, for the one-year period following October 17, 2008, it will pay
certain amounts to Allianz if the Company effects or agrees to effect any transaction (or series of
transactions) pursuant to which any person or group (within the meaning of the U.S. federal
securities laws) is issued common stock or certain equity-related instruments constituting more
than 5% of the Company’s fully-diluted common stock outstanding at the time for an effective price
per share (determined as provided in the Investment Agreement) of less than $25.32. Amounts so
payable depend on the effective price for the applicable transaction (or the weighted average price
for a series of transactions) and range from $50 if the effective price per share is between $25.31
and $23.00, $150 if the effective price per share is between $22.99 and $20.00, $200 if the
effective price per share is between $19.99 and $15.00 and $300 if the effective price per share is
$14.99 or less.

Debentures

The 10% Fixed-to-Floating Rate Junior Subordinated Debentures due 2068 bear interest at an annual
fixed rate of 10% from the date of issuance to, but excluding, October 15, 2018, payable
semi-annually in arrears on April 15 and October 15. From and including October 15, 2018, the
Debentures will bear interest at an annual rate, reset quarterly, equal to three-month LIBOR plus
6.824%, payable quarterly in arrears. The Company has the right, on one or more occasions, to defer
the payment of interest on the Debentures. The Company may defer interest for up to ten consecutive
years without giving rise to an event of default. Deferred interest will accumulate additional
interest at an annual rate equal to the annual interest rate then applicable to the Debentures. If
the Company defers interest for five consecutive years or, if earlier, pays current interest during
a deferral period, which may be paid from any source of funds, the Company will be required to pay
deferred interest from proceeds from the sale of certain qualifying securities.

In connection with the offering of the debentures, the Company entered into a “Replacement Capital
Covenant” for the benefit of holders of one or more designated series of the Company’s
indebtedness, initially the Company’s 6.1% notes due 2041. Under the terms of the Replacement
Capital Covenant, if the Company redeems the Debentures at any time prior to October 15, 2048 it
can only do so with the proceeds from the sale of certain qualifying replacement securities.
Subject to the Replacement Capital Covenant, the Company can redeem the Debentures at its option,
in whole or in part, at any time on or after October 15, 2018 at a redemption price of 100% of the
principal amount being redeemed plus accrued but unpaid interest.

The Debentures were issued with the detachable Warrants. The allocation of the $1.75 billion
proceeds between the Debentures and Warrants was based on the relative fair values of these
financial instruments at the time of issuance. As such, the Debentures were recorded at a fair
value of $1,201 and are classified as long term debt.

Preferred Stock

Each share of Preferred Stock is initially convertible into four shares of common stock, subject
to receipt of specified governmental, regulatory and other approvals (including receipt of
stockholder approval as described above in the case of the Series C Preferred Stock), which vary by
Series. If the Company declares dividends on Common Shares, the Company will simultaneously declare
the same dividend on the assumed conversion of the Series D Preferred shares. Dividends on the
Series D Preferred Stock are non-cumulative. The conversion ratio under the Preferred Stock is
subject to adjustment in certain circumstances. The Preferred Stock is classified as equity and the
proceeds of $750 were recorded net of issuance costs of $23.

On January 9, 2009, Allianz converted its 6,048,387 shares of Series D Preferred Stock into
24,193,548 shares of common stock.

Warrants

The Warrants, which have a term of seven years, are exercisable to purchase 69,115,324 shares of
common stock at an initial exercise price of $25.32 per share. The exercise price under the
Warrants is subject to adjustment in certain circumstances. Pending the receipt of specified
regulatory approvals, the Warrants are immediately exercisable for the Series B Preferred Stock,
which are initially convertible, in the aggregate, into 34,806,452 shares of common stock. The
Warrants to purchase the Series B Preferred Stock are reported as equity and were allocated a
relative fair value of $276 at issuance.

In addition to the receipt of specified regulatory approvals, the conversion into 34,308,872 shares
of common stock of the Series C Preferred Stock underlying certain of the Warrants is subject to
the approval of the Company’s stockholders in accordance with applicable regulations of the New
York Stock Exchange. Under the Investment Agreement, the Company is obligated to pay Allianz $75 if
such stockholder approval is not obtained at the first stockholder meeting to consider such
approval, and $50 if such stockholder approval is not obtained at a second such meeting. Because
the conversion of the Series C Preferred Stock is subject to stockholder approval and the related
payment provision represents a form of net cash settlement outside the Company’s control, the
Warrants to purchase the Series C Preferred Stock and the stockholder approval payment were
recorded as a derivative liability at a relative fair value of $273 at issuance. As of December
31, 2008, the Warrants to purchase the Series C Preferred Stock had a fair value of $163. The
Company recognized a gain of $110, after-tax, for the year ended December 31, 2008, representing
the change in fair value of the Warrants to purchase the Series C Preferred Stock.

Included in the three months ended September 30, 2008 and December 31,
2008 are net investment losses of $3.4 billion and $4.5 billion,
respectively, related to the mark-to-market effects of equity
securities held for trading supporting the International variable
annuity business and net realized capital losses of $3.4 billion and
$816, respectively

[2]

Included in the three months ended September 30, 2008 are net realized
capital losses of $2.2 billion and a DAC unlock charge of $932.
Included in the three months ended December 31, 2008 is an after-tax
charge of $597 related to goodwill impairments and net realized
capital losses of $610.

[3]

Due to the net loss for the three months ended December 31, 2008, no
allocation of the net loss was made to the preferred shareholders
under the two-class method in the calculation of basic earnings per
share, as the preferred shareholders had no contractual obligation to
fund the net losses of the Company. In the absence of the net loss,
any such income would be allocated to the preferred shareholders based
on the weighted average number of preferred shares outstanding as of
December 31, 2008.

[4]

As a result of the net loss in the three months ended September 30,
2008 and December 31, 2008, SFAS 128 requires the Company to use basic
weighted average common shares outstanding in the calculation of the
year ended December 31, 2008 diluted loss per share, since the
inclusion of shares for stock compensation plans of 1.0 million and
0.6 million, respectively, and the assumed conversion of the preferred
shares to common of 0 and 20.1 million, respectively, would have been
antidilutive to the earnings per share calculation. In the absence of
the net loss, weighted average common shares outstanding and dilutive
potential common shares would have totaled 302.1 million and 320.9
million, respectively.
