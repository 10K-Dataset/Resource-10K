PART I

ITEM 1.  BUSINESS OF THE HARTFORD
(DOLLAR AMOUNTS IN MILLIONS, EXCEPT FOR PER SHARE DATA, UNLESS OTHERWISE STATED)

GENERAL

The Hartford  Financial  Services Group,  Inc.  (together with its subsidiaries,
"The  Hartford" or the  "Company")  is a  diversified  insurance  and  financial
services  company.  The Hartford,  headquartered  in  Connecticut,  is among the
largest providers of investment products,  individual life, group life and group
disability  insurance products,  and property and casualty insurance products in
the United  States.  Hartford Fire  Insurance  Company,  founded in 1810, is the
oldest  of The  Hartford's  subsidiaries.  The  Hartford  writes  insurance  and
reinsurance  in the United  States and  internationally.  At December  31, 2002,
total assets and total stockholders'  equity of The Hartford were $182.0 billion
and $10.7 billion, respectively.

ORGANIZATION

The Hartford  strives to maintain  and enhance its  position as a market  leader
within the financial  services industry and to maximize  shareholder  value. The
Company  pursues a strategy of  developing  and selling  diverse and  innovative
products through multiple  distribution  channels,  continuously  developing and
expanding  those  distribution  channels,  achieving cost  efficiencies  through
economies  of  scale  and  improved  technology,   maintaining   effective  risk
management and prudent  underwriting  techniques and  capitalizing  on its brand
name  and  customer  recognition  of The  Hartford  Stag  Logo,  one of the most
recognized symbols in the financial services industry.

As a holding  company that is separate and distinct from its  subsidiaries,  The
Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc. has no significant  business  operations
of its own. Therefore, it relies on the dividends from its insurance company and
other subsidiaries as the principal source of cash flow to meet its obligations.
Additional  information  regarding  the  cash  flow and  liquidity  needs of The
Hartford  Financial  Services Group,  Inc. may be found in the Capital Resources
and  Liquidity  section of  Management's  Discussion  and  Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations ("MD&A").

The Company  maintains  a retail  mutual fund  operation,  whereby the  Company,
through   wholly-owned   subsidiaries,   provides   investment   management  and
administrative  services to The  Hartford  Mutual  Funds,  Inc.,  a family of 33
mutual funds.  Investors can purchase "shares" in the mutual funds, all of which
are registered  with the Securities and Exchange  Commission in accordance  with
the  Investment  Company  Act  of  1940.  The  mutual  funds  are  owned  by the
shareholders of those funds and not by the Company.

Pursuant to its initial public  offering of Class A common stock on May 22, 1997
(the "Offering"), Hartford Life, Inc. ("HLI"), the holding company parent of The
Hartford's  significant  life  insurance  subsidiaries,  sold to the  public  26
million  shares at  $28.25  per share and  received  proceeds,  net of  offering
expenses,  of $687.  The 26  million  shares  sold in the  Offering  represented
approximately 19% of the equity ownership in HLI. On June 27, 2000, The Hartford
acquired all of the outstanding  shares of HLI that it did not already own ("The
HLI Repurchase"). As a result, HLI again became a wholly-owned subsidiary of The
Hartford.  Additional  information  on The HLI  Repurchase  may be  found in the
Capital  Resources and Liquidity  section of the MD&A and Note 18(a) of Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements.

On April 2, 2001,  The  Hartford  acquired  the United  States  individual  life
insurance,  annuity and mutual fund  businesses  of Fortis,  Inc.  (operating as
"Fortis  Financial  Group",  or "Fortis") for $1.12 billion in cash. The Company
effected  the   acquisition   through   several   reinsurance   agreements  with
subsidiaries of Fortis and the purchase of 100% of the stock of Fortis Advisors,
Inc. and Fortis  Investors,  Inc.,  wholly-owned  subsidiaries  of Fortis.  (For
additional  information,  see the Capital Resources and Liquidity section of the
MD&A and Note 18(a) of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.)

The Company has exited its  international  property and casualty  businesses  by
means of a number of dispositions.  In September 2001, The Hartford entered into
an agreement to sell Hartford  Insurance  Company  (Singapore),  Ltd.  (formerly
People's  Insurance  Company,  Ltd.  ("Singapore  Insurance")).   The  sale  was
completed in January 2002. On February 8, 2001, The Hartford  completed the sale
of its  Spain-based  subsidiary,  Hartford  Seguros.  On December 22, 2000,  The
Hartford  completed the sale of its  Netherlands-based  Zwolsche  Algemeene N.V.
("Zwolsche")  subsidiary.  On November 16, 1998, The Hartford completed the sale
of its United  Kingdom-based London & Edinburgh Insurance Group, Ltd. ("London &
Edinburgh") subsidiary.

REPORTING SEGMENTS

The  Hartford  is  organized  into two major  operations:  Life and  Property  &
Casualty. Within these operations, The Hartford conducts business principally in
nine  operating  segments.   Additionally,  the  capital  raising  and  purchase
accounting adjustment  activities related to The HLI Repurchase,  capital raised
in 2002 that was not contributed to the Company's  insurance  subsidiaries,  and
the  minority  interest  in HLI for  pre-acquisition  periods  are  included  in
Corporate.

Life, headquartered in Simsbury,  Connecticut, is organized into four reportable
operating  segments:  Investment  Products,  Individual Life, Group Benefits and
Corporate Owned Life Insurance ("COLI"). Life also includes in an Other category
its  international  operations,  which are primarily  located in Japan and Latin
America;  realized  capital  gains and losses;  as well as  corporate  items not
directly  allocated to any of its  reportable  operating  segments,  principally
interest expense; and intersegment eliminations.

In January 2002,  Property & Casualty integrated its Affinity Personal Lines and
Personal  Insurance  segments,  now  reported  as Personal  Lines.  As a result,
Property & Casualty is now organized into five  reportable  operating  segments:
the North American  underwriting  segments of the Business  Insurance,  Personal
Lines,  Specialty Commercial and Reinsurance;  and the Other Operations segment,
which includes  substantially  all of the Company's  asbestos and  environmental
exposures.  "North  American"  includes  the  combined  underwriting  results of
Business  Insurance,   Personal  Lines,  Specialty  Commercial  and  Reinsurance
underwriting segments along with income and expense items not directly allocated
to these segments, such as

                                     - 2 -


net investment  income,  net realized  capital gains and losses,  other expenses
including interest, and income taxes.

The following is a description  of Life and Property & Casualty  along with each
of their segments,  including a discussion of principal products,  marketing and
distribution  and  competitive  environments.   Additional  information  on  The
Hartford's  reporting  segments may be found in the MD&A and Note 17 of Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements.

LIFE

Life's business is conducted by HLI, a leading financial  services and insurance
organization.  Through  Life,  The Hartford  provides (i)  investment  products,
including  variable  annuities,  fixed market value adjusted ("MVA")  annuities,
mutual funds and retirement  plan services for the savings and retirement  needs
of over 1.5  million  customers,  (ii) life  insurance  for  wealth  protection,
accumulation and transfer needs for approximately 740,000 customers, (iii) group
benefits  products  such as group life and group  disability  insurance  for the
benefit of millions of  individuals  and (iv)  corporate  owned life  insurance,
which  includes life insurance  policies  purchased by a company on the lives of
its employees.  The Company is one of the largest sellers of individual variable
annuities,  variable life insurance and group disability insurance in the United
States. In addition, in 2001 The Hartford Mutual Funds, Inc. reached $12 billion
in assets faster than any other  retail-oriented  mutual fund family in history,
according to Strategic  Insight.  As of December  31, 2002,  retail  mutual fund
assets were $14.2  billion.  The Company's  strong  position in each of its core
businesses  provides  an  opportunity  to  increase  the sale of The  Hartford's
products and services as individuals  increasingly save and plan for retirement,
protect  themselves and their families against disability or death and engage in
estate planning.  In an effort to advance the Company's  strategy of growing its
life and asset  accumulation  businesses,  The Hartford  acquired the individual
life  insurance,  annuity and mutual fund businesses of Fortis on April 2, 2001.
(For additional information,  see the Capital Resources and Liquidity section of
the MD&A and Note  18(a) of  Notes to  Consolidated  Financial  Statements.)  In
addition,  The Hartford's  Japanese  operation achieved $1.4 billion in variable
annuity  sales for the year ended  December 31, 2002,  bringing  account  values
related to Japan to more than $1.7 billion as of December 31, 2002.

HLI is among the largest consolidated life insurance groups in the United States
based on  statutory  assets as of December 31,  2001.  In the past year,  Life's
total assets under management, which include $15.3 billion of third-party assets
invested in the Company's mutual funds and 529 College Savings Plans,  decreased
2% to $165.1  billion at December  31, 2002 from $168.4  billion at December 31,
2001. Life generated revenues of $6.4 billion,  $6.5 billion and $6.0 billion in
2002, 2001 and 2000,  respectively.  Additionally,  Life generated net income of
$557, $685 and $575 in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively.

CUSTOMER SERVICE, TECHNOLOGY AND ECONOMIES OF SCALE

Life maintains advantageous economies of scale and operating efficiencies due to
its  growth,  attention  to expense  and claims  management  and  commitment  to
customer  service  and  technology.   These  advantages  allow  the  Company  to
competitively price its products for its distribution network and policyholders.
The  Company  continues  to achieve  operating  efficiencies  in its  Investment
Products segment.  Operating expenses  associated with the Company's  individual
annuity products as a percentage of total individual annuity account values have
been reduced  since 1992,  declining  from 43 basis points to 25 basis points in
2002.  In  addition,   the  Company  utilizes  computer  technology  to  enhance
communications  within the Company and  throughout its  distribution  network in
order to improve the Company's  efficiency  in marketing,  selling and servicing
its  products  and, as a result,  provides  high-quality  customer  service.  In
recognition  of  excellence  in customer  service for  variable  annuities,  The
Hartford was awarded the 2002 Annuity Service Award by DALBAR Inc., a recognized
independent   financial   services  research   organization,   for  the  seventh
consecutive  year. The Hartford is the only company to receive this  prestigious
award in every year of the award's  existence.  Also, in both 2002 and 2001, The
Hartford Mutual Funds,  Inc. was named the leading mid-sized fund complex in the
industry  for top service  providers,  according  to a survey of  broker-dealers
conducted by DALBAR Inc.  Additionally,  the Company's  Individual Life Division
won its second consecutive DALBAR award for service of life insurance  customers
and its first DALBAR Intermediary Service Award in 2002.

RISK MANAGEMENT

Life's  product  designs,  prudent  underwriting  standards and risk  management
techniques  are  structured  to protect it  against  disintermediation  risk and
greater than expected  mortality and  morbidity  experience.  As of December 31,
2002,   the  Company  had  limited   exposure  to   disintermediation   risk  on
approximately 96% of its domestic life insurance and annuity liabilities through
the  use of  non-guaranteed  separate  accounts,  MVA  features,  policy  loans,
surrender charges and non-surrenderability  provisions.  The Company effectively
utilizes prudent  underwriting to select and price insurance risks and regularly
monitors mortality and morbidity  assumptions to determine if experience remains
consistent with these assumptions and to ensure that its product pricing remains
appropriate.  The Company also enforces disciplined claims management to protect
itself against greater than expected morbidity experience.

INVESTMENT PRODUCTS

The Investment Products segment focuses, through the sale of individual variable
and fixed annuities, mutual funds, retirement plan services and other investment
products,  on the  savings  and  retirement  needs  of  the  growing  number  of
individuals who are preparing for retirement or who have already  retired.  From
December 31, 1997 to December 31, 2002, this segment's  assets under  management
grew to $110.2 billion from $71.3 billion,  a five year compounded annual growth
rate of 9.4%.  Investment  Products  generated  revenues of $2.6  billion,  $2.5
billion  and  $2.4  billion  in  2002,  2001 and  2000,  respectively,  of which
individual  annuities  accounted  for $1.5 billion in 2002,  2001 and 2000.  Net
income in the Investment  Products segment was $432, $463 and $424 in 2002, 2001
and 2000, respectively.

The Hartford sells both variable and fixed individual annuity products through a
wide distribution network of national and regional broker-dealer  organizations,
banks and other financial  institutions and independent financial advisors.  The
Hartford is a market leader in the annuity industry with sales of $11.6 billion,
$10.0  billion  and $10.7  billion  in 2002,  2001 and 2000,  respectively.  The
Hartford was the largest seller of individual

                                     - 3 -


retail  variable  annuities in the United  States with sales of $10.3 billion in
2002 and $9.0 billion in 2001 and 2000. In addition, the Company continues to be
the largest seller of individual retail variable  annuities through banks in the
United States.

The Company's  total account  value related to individual  annuity  products was
$74.9  billion as of December  31,  2002.  Of this total  account  value,  $64.3
billion,  or 86%,  related to  individual  variable  annuity  products and $10.6
billion,  or 14%, related primarily to fixed MVA annuity products.  In 2001, the
Company's total account value related to individual  annuity  products was $84.2
billion.  Of this  total  account  value,  $74.6  billion,  or 89%,  related  to
individual variable annuity products and $9.6 billion, or 11%, related primarily
to fixed MVA annuity products.

In addition  to its  leading  position in  individual  annuities,  The  Hartford
continues to emerge as a significant participant in the mutual fund business and
is among the top providers of retirement products and services,  including asset
management and plan  administration  sold to small and medium size  corporations
pursuant  to  Section  401 of the  Internal  Revenue  Code of 1986,  as  amended
(referred  to as  "401(k)")  and to  municipalities  pursuant to Section 457 and
403(b) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (referred to as "Section
457"  and  "403(b)",   respectively).   The  Company  also  provides  structured
settlement  contracts,  terminal funding products and other investment  products
such as guaranteed  investment  contracts ("GICs").  In 2002, The Hartford began
selling a 529 college savings product.

As previously mentioned, The Hartford acquired the individual annuity and mutual
fund businesses of Fortis, Inc. in 2001. This acquisition increased assets under
management in the  Company's  fast growing  mutual fund business by 20%,  helped
solidify the Company's  strong position in variable  annuities and  strengthened
the Company's 401(k) sales.

Principal Products
- ------------------

Individual   Variable   Annuities   --  The  Hartford   earns  fees,   based  on
policyholders'   account  values,  for  managing  variable  annuity  assets  and
maintaining  policyholder  accounts.  The Company uses specified portions of the
periodic  deposits  paid by a customer to  purchase  units in one or more mutual
funds as directed by the customer,  who then assumes the investment  performance
risks and rewards.  As a result,  variable  annuities  permit  policyholders  to
choose  aggressive  or  conservative   investment   strategies,   as  they  deem
appropriate,  without  affecting  the  composition  and quality of assets in the
Company's  general  account.  These products offer the policyholder a variety of
equity and fixed  income  options,  as well as the ability to earn a  guaranteed
rate of interest in the general  account of the Company.  The Company  offers an
enhanced  guaranteed rate of interest for a specified  period of time (no longer
than twelve months) if the policyholder elects to dollar-cost average funds from
the Company's general account into one or more non-guaranteed separate accounts.
Due to this enhanced rate and the  volatility  experienced in the overall equity
markets,  this option continues to be popular with policyholders.  Additionally,
the  Investment  Products  segment sells variable  annuity  contracts that offer
various guaranteed death benefits.  For certain  guaranteed death benefits,  The
Hartford pays the greater of (1) the account value at death;  (2) the sum of all
premium payments less prior withdrawals; or (3) the maximum anniversary value of
the contract,  plus any premium payments since the contract  anniversary,  minus
any withdrawals following the contract anniversary.

Policyholders  may make  deposits  of varying  amounts  at regular or  irregular
intervals  and the  value of these  assets  fluctuates  in  accordance  with the
investment  performance of the funds selected by the policyholder.  To encourage
persistency,  many of the Company's individual variable annuities are subject to
withdrawal restrictions and surrender charges.  Surrender charges range up to 8%
of the  contract's  initial  deposit less  withdrawals,  and reduce to zero on a
sliding scale, usually within seven policy years.  Volatility experienced by the
equity  markets over the past few years did not cause a significant  increase in
variable annuity  surrenders,  demonstrating  that  policyholders  are generally
aware of the long-term  nature of these products.  Individual  variable  annuity
account   values  of  $64.3  billion  as  of  December  31,  2002,   have  grown
significantly from $13.1 billion as of December 31, 1994, due to strong net cash
flow,  resulting from high levels of sales,  low levels of surrenders and equity
market  appreciation.  Approximately  88%  and  94% of the  individual  variable
annuity  account  values  were held in  non-guaranteed  separate  accounts as of
December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively.

The  assets  underlying  the  Company's  variable  annuities  are  managed  both
internally and by outside money managers,  while the Company provides all policy
administration  services. The Company utilizes a select group of money managers,
such as Wellington  Management Company, LLP ("Wellington");  Hartford Investment
Management Company ("HIMCO"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of The Hartford;  Putnam
Financial Services,  Inc. ("Putnam");  American Funds; MFS Investment Management
("MFS");  Franklin  Templeton  Group; and AIM Investments  ("AIM").  All have an
interest in the continued growth in sales of the Company's  products and greatly
enhance the  marketability  of the  Company's  annuities and the strength of its
product  offerings.  The Director variable annuity,  which is managed in part by
Wellington,  continues to be the industry  leader in terms of retail  sales.  In
addition,  Hartford  Leaders,  which is a  multi-manager  variable  annuity that
combines the product manufacturing,  wholesaling and service capabilities of The
Hartford with the investment  management  expertise of four of the nation's most
successful  investment  management   organizations:   American  Funds,  Franklin
Templeton  Group,  AIM and MFS, has quickly  emerged as a strong selling product
for the Company and ranks in the top 5 in the industry.

Fixed MVA  Annuities -- Fixed MVA  annuities  are fixed rate  annuity  contracts
which  guarantee a specific  sum of money to be paid in the future,  either as a
lump sum or as monthly  income.  In the event that a  policyholder  surrenders a
policy prior to the end of the guarantee  period,  the MVA feature  increases or
decreases  the cash  surrender  value of the annuity in respect of any  interest
rate decreases or increases,  respectively,  thereby protecting the Company from
losses  due to higher  interest  rates at the time of  surrender.  The amount of
payment will not  fluctuate due to adverse  changes in the Company's  investment
return,  mortality  experience  or expenses.  The  Company's  primary  fixed MVA
annuities  have terms  varying  from one to ten years  with an  average  term of
approximately  eight years.  Account  values of fixed MVA  annuities  were $10.6
billion and $9.6 billion as of December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively.

                                     - 4 -


Mutual Funds -- In  September  1996,  The  Hartford  launched a family of retail
mutual  funds  for  which  the  Company  provides   investment   management  and
administrative services. The fund family has grown significantly from 8 funds at
inception to the current  offering of 33 funds,  including  the addition of five
new fixed income funds  introduced in 2002.  The Company's  funds are managed by
Wellington  and HIMCO.  The Company has entered  into  agreements  with over 960
financial services firms to distribute these mutual funds.

The Company  charges fees to the  shareholders  of the mutual  funds,  which are
recorded as revenue by the Company.  Investors can purchase shares in the mutual
funds,  all of which are registered with the Securities and Exchange  Commission
in  accordance  with the  Investment  Company Act of 1940.  The mutual funds are
owned by the  shareholders  of those funds and not by the Company.  As such, the
mutual fund assets and liabilities,  as well as related investment returns,  are
not reflected in the Company's consolidated  financial statements.  Total retail
mutual fund assets under  management  were $14.2 billion and $15.9 billion as of
December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively.

Governmental  -- The Company  sells  retirement  plan  products  and services to
municipalities under Section 457 plans. The Company offers a number of different
investment  products,  including  variable  annuities and a fixed bucket, to the
employees  in Section 457 plans.  Generally,  with the  variable  products,  the
Company  manages the fixed income funds and certain other outside money managers
act as advisors to the equity funds offered in Section 457 plans administered by
the Company. As of December 31, 2002, the Company  administered over 3,000 plans
under Sections 457 and 403(b).  Total governmental  assets under management were
$7.9 billion and $8.6 billion as of December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively.

Corporate  -- The  Company  sells  retirement  plan  products  and  services  to
corporations  under  Section  401 plans  targeting  the small  and  medium  case
markets.  The Company believes these markets are  under-penetrated in comparison
to the large case market. As of December 31, 2002, the Company administered over
4,100 Section 401(k) plans.  Total corporate  assets under  management were $3.4
billion and $2.6 billion as of December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively.

Institutional  Investment  Products -- The Company sells  structured  settlement
contracts  which provide for periodic  payments to an injured person or survivor
for a generally determinable number of years, typically in settlement of a claim
under a  liability  policy  in  lieu of a lump  sum  settlement.  The  Company's
structured  settlements  are sold  through  The  Hartford's  Property & Casualty
insurance  operations  as well as  specialty  brokers.  The Company also markets
other annuity  contracts for special  purposes such as the funding of terminated
defined  benefit  pension  plans.  In  addition,  the  Company  offers  GICs and
short-term funding agreements.  Total  institutional  investment products assets
under  management were $9.7 billion and $9.1 billion as of December 31, 2002 and
2001, respectively.

Section 529 Plans - The Hartford  introduced a tax  advantaged  college  savings
product  ("529  plan")  in  March  2002  called  SMART  529.   SMART  529  is  a
state-sponsored  education  savings  program  established  by the  State of West
Virginia  which  offers  an easy way for both  residents  of West  Virginia  and
out-of-state  participants to plan for a college  education.  In 1996,  Congress
created a  tax-advantaged  college savings program as part of Section 529 of the
Internal Revenue Code (the "Code").  The 529 Plan is an investment plan operated
by a state and  designed to help  families  save for future  college  costs.  On
January 1, 2002, 529 Plans became federal tax-exempt for qualified withdrawals.

SMART 529 is designed to be flexible by allowing investors to choose from a wide
variety  of  investment  portfolios  to  match  their  risk  preference  to help
investors  accumulate  savings for college.  An individual  can open a SMART 529
account for anyone, at any age. The SMART 529 product complements HLI's existing
offering of investment products (mutual funds,  variable annuities,  401(k), 457
and 403(b) plans). It also leverages the Company's capabilities in distribution,
service and fund performance. Total 529 Plan assets under management were $87 as
of December 31, 2002.

Marketing and Distribution
- --------------------------

The Investment Products  distribution network is based on management's  strategy
of  utilizing  multiple  and  competing  distribution  channels  to achieve  the
broadest  distribution to reach target  customers.  The success of the Company's
marketing  and  distribution  system  depends  on its  product  offerings,  fund
performance,  successful  utilization of wholesaling  organizations,  quality of
customer  service,  and relationships  with national and regional  broker-dealer
firms,  banks  and  other  financial  institutions,  and  independent  financial
advisors (through which the sale of the Company's retail investment  products to
customers is consummated).

The  Hartford   maintains  a  distribution   network  of   approximately   1,500
broker-dealers  and  approximately  500 banks.  As of September  30,  2002,  the
Company was selling  products  through 24 of the 25 largest  retail banks in the
United States,  including  proprietary  relationships with 12 of the top 25. The
Company periodically  negotiates  provisions and terms of its relationships with
unaffiliated  parties, and there can be no assurance that such terms will remain
acceptable  to  the  Company  or  such  third  parties.  The  Company's  primary
wholesaler  of its  individual  annuities  and mutual funds is its  wholly-owned
subsidiary,   PLANCO  Financial  Services,  Inc.  and  its  affiliate,   PLANCO,
Incorporated  (collectively  "PLANCO").  PLANCO is one of the  nation's  largest
wholesalers  of individual  annuities  and has played a significant  role in The
Hartford's growth over the past decade. As a wholesaler,  PLANCO distributes The
Hartford's  fixed and variable  annuities,  mutual  funds,  401(k) plans and 529
Plans by  providing  sales  support  to  registered  representatives,  financial
planners  and  broker-dealers  at  brokerage  firms and banks  across the United
States. Owning PLANCO secures an important  distribution channel for the Company
and gives the Company a wholesale  distribution  platform which it can expand in
terms of both  the  number  of  individuals  wholesaling  its  products  and the
portfolio  of products  which they  wholesale.  In  addition,  the Company  uses
internal personnel with extensive  experience in the Section 457 market, as well
as access to the Section 401(k) market, to sell its products and services in the
retirement plan and institutional markets.

Competition
- -----------

The Investment Products segment competes with numerous other insurance companies
as well as certain banks,  securities  brokerage  firms,  independent  financial
advisors and other financial  intermediaries  marketing annuities,  mutual funds
and  other   retirement-oriented   products.   Product  sales  are  affected  by
competitive  factors such as investment  performance  ratings,  product  design,
visibility  in  the  marketplace,   financial  strength  ratings,   distribution
capabilities,  levels of charges and  credited  rates,  reputation  and customer
service.

INDIVIDUAL LIFE
- ---------------

The Individual Life segment provides life insurance solutions to a wide array of
partners to solve the wealth  protection,  accumulation  and  transfer  needs of
their affluent, emerging affluent and business insurance clients. The individual
life  business  acquired  from  Fortis in 2001  added  significant  scale to the
Company's  Individual Life segment,  contributing to the significant increase in
life  insurance  in-force.  As of December 31,  2002,  life  insurance  in-force
increased  5% to $126.7  billion,  from $120.3  billion as of December 31, 2001.
Account  values  decreased  4% to $7.6 billion as of December 31, 2002 from $7.9
billion as of December 31, 2001. Revenues were $958, $890 and $640 in 2002, 2001
and 2000, respectively. Net income in the Individual Life segment was $133, $121
and $79 in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively.

Principal Products
- ------------------

The Hartford  holds a  significant  market  share in the  variable  life product
market.  In 2002, the Company's new sales of individual  life insurance were 82%
variable life, 13% universal life and other, and 5% term life insurance.

Variable  Life --  Variable  life  insurance  provides  a  return  linked  to an
underlying   investment  portfolio  and  the  Company  allows  policyholders  to
determine their desired asset mix among a variety of underlying mutual funds. As
the return on the  investment  portfolio  increases or decreases,  the surrender
value of the variable life policy will increase or decrease,  and, under certain
policyholder  options or market conditions,  the death benefit may also increase
or decrease. The Company's single premium variable life product provides a death
benefit  to the  policy  beneficiary  based on a  single  premium  deposit.  The
Company's  second-to-die  products are distinguished from other products in that
two lives are insured rather than one, and the policy proceeds are paid upon the
death of both insureds.  Second-to-die  policies are  frequently  used in estate
planning for a married  couple.  Variable life account  values were $3.6 billion
and $4.0 billion as of December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively.

Universal Life and Interest  Sensitive Whole Life -- Universal life and interest
sensitive whole life insurance  coverages provide life insurance with adjustable
rates of return  based on  current  interest  rates.  The  Company  offers  both
flexible and fixed premium policies and provides  policyholders with flexibility
in the  available  coverage,  the timing and amount of premium  payments and the
amount of the death benefit, provided there are sufficient policy funds to cover
all policy charges for the coming period.  The Company also sells universal life
insurance policies with a second-to-die  feature similar to that of the variable
life insurance product offered. Universal life and interest sensitive whole life
account values were $3.1 billion as of December 31, 2002 and 2001.

Marketing and Distribution
- --------------------------

Consistent with the Company's strategy to access multiple  distribution outlets,
the Individual Life distribution  organization has been developed to penetrate a
multitude of retail sales  channels.  These include  independent  life insurance
sales  professionals;   agents  of  other  companies;   national,  regional  and
independent   broker-dealers;   banks;  financial  planners;   certified  public
accountants  and  property  and casualty  insurance  organizations.  The primary
organization  used to wholesale  The  Hartford's  products to these outlets is a
group of highly qualified life insurance professionals with specialized training
in sophisticated life insurance sales. These individuals are generally employees
of The Hartford who are managed through a regional sales office system.

Competition
- -----------

The Individual  Life segment  competes with  approximately  1,800 life insurance
companies  in the  United  States,  as well as  other  financial  intermediaries
marketing  insurance  products.  Competitive factors related to this segment are
primarily the breadth and quality of life insurance  products offered,  pricing,
relationships  with  third-party  distributors,   effectiveness  of  wholesaling
support,   pricing  and   availability  of  reinsurance,   and  the  quality  of
underwriting and customer service.

GROUP BENEFITS

The Group Benefits segment sells group life and group disability  insurance,  as
well as other products, including stop loss, accidental death and dismemberment,
travel  accident and other special risk coverage to employers and  associations.
The  Company  also  offers  disability  underwriting,   administration,   claims
processing  services and reinsurance to other insurers and self-funded  employer
plans. Generally,  policies sold in this segment are term insurance.  Typically,
policies are sold with one, two or three year rate  guarantees  depending on the
product. This allows the Company to adjust the rates or terms of its policies in
order to  minimize  the  adverse  effect of  various  market  trends,  including
declining  interest  rates and other  factors.  In the  disability  market,  the
Company  focuses  on  strong  underwriting  and  claims  management  to derive a
competitive  advantage.  The Group Benefits segment  generated  revenues of $2.6
billion, $2.5 billion and $2.2 billion in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively,  of
which group disability  insurance  accounted for $1.2 billion,  $1.1 billion and
$964 and  group  life  insurance  accounted  for $1.0  billion,  $902 and  $810,
respectively.  The Company  held group  disability  reserves of $2.5 billion and
$2.4 billion and group life  reserves of $765 and $706,  as of December 31, 2002
and 2001,  respectively.  The Company's net income in the Group Benefits segment
was $128, $106 and $90 in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively.

Principal Products
- ------------------

Group  Disability  -- The  Hartford  is one of the largest  participants  in the
"large case" market of the group disability  insurance business.  The large case
market,  as defined  by the  Company,  generally  consists  of group  disability
policies  covering  over 500 employees in a particular  company.  The Company is
continuing  its focus on the  growing  "small  case"

                                     - 6 -


and "medium case" group markets,  emphasizing name recognition and reputation as
well as the Company's managed disability  approach to claims and administration.
The  Company's   efforts  in  the  group   disability   market  focus  on  early
intervention,  return-to-work programs and successful  rehabilitation.  Over the
last  several  years,  the focus of new  disability  products  introduced  is to
provide  incentives  for employees to return to  independence.  The Company also
works with  disability  claimants to improve the receipt rate of Social Security
offsets  (i.e.,  reducing  payment of benefits by the amount of Social  Security
payments received).

The Company's  short-term  disability  benefit  plans  provide a weekly  benefit
amount  (typically 60% to 70% of the employee's  earned income up to a specified
maximum  benefit)  to insured  employees  when they are unable to work due to an
accident or illness.  Long-term  disability insurance provides a monthly benefit
for those  extended  periods  of time not  covered  by a  short-term  disability
benefit  plan when  insured  employees  are  unable  to work due to  disability.
Employees  may  receive  total or  partial  disability  benefits.  Most of these
policies begin providing  benefits  following a 90 or 180 day waiting period and
generally  continue  providing  benefits  until  the  employee  reaches  age 65.
Long-term  disability  benefits  are paid  monthly and are limited to a portion,
generally  50-70%,  of the  employee's  earned income up to a specified  maximum
benefit.

Group Life -- Group term life insurance  provides term coverage to employees and
their  dependents for a specified period and has no accumulation of cash values.
The  Company  offers  options  for its  basic  group  life  insurance  coverage,
including  portability  of  coverage  and  a  living  benefit  option,   whereby
terminally ill  policyholders  can receive death benefits prior to their deaths.
In  addition,  the  Company  offers  premium  waiver  and  accidental  death and
dismemberment coverages to employee groups.

Other -- The Hartford  provides  excess of loss medical  coverage (known as stop
loss  insurance) to employers  who self-fund  their medical plans and pay claims
using the services of a  third-party  administrator.  The Company also  provides
travel accident,  hospital  indemnity and other coverages  (including group life
and disability) primarily to individual members of various associations, as well
as employee groups. A significant  Medicare  supplement  customer of the company
had been the  members  of the  Retired  Officers  Association,  an  organization
consisting of retired military officers. Congress passed legislation,  effective
in the fourth  quarter of 2001,  whereby  retired  military  officers age 65 and
older will  receive full medical  insurance,  eliminating  the need for Medicare
supplement insurance.  This legislation reduced the Company's premium revenue by
$131 in 2002, compared to 2001.

Marketing and Distribution
- --------------------------

The Hartford uses an experienced group of Company  employees,  managed through a
regional sales office system,  to distribute  its group  insurance  products and
services  through  a  variety  of  distribution   outlets,   including  brokers,
consultants,  third-party  administrators  and trade  associations.  The Company
intends to  continue  to expand the system  over the coming  years in areas that
offer the highest growth potential.

Competition
- -----------

The Group Benefits  business  remains highly  competitive.  Competitive  factors
primarily  affecting  Group Benefits are the variety and quality of products and
services  offered,  the price quoted for coverage and  services,  the  Company's
relationships  with its  third-party  distributors,  and the quality of customer
service.  Group Benefits  competes with numerous other  insurance  companies and
other financial  intermediaries  marketing insurance products.  However, many of
these businesses have relatively high barriers to entry and there have been very
few new entrants over the past few years.

CORPORATE OWNED LIFE INSURANCE ("COLI")

The  Hartford is a leader in the COLI  market,  which  includes  life  insurance
policies purchased by a company on the lives of its employees,  with the company
or a trust sponsored by the company named as the  beneficiary  under the policy.
Until passage of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996
("HIPAA"),  the Company sold two principal types of COLI, leveraged and variable
products.  Leveraged  COLI is a fixed premium life  insurance  policy owned by a
company or a trust sponsored by a company. HIPAA phased out the deductibility of
interest on policy  loans  under  leveraged  COLI at the end of 1998,  virtually
eliminating all future sales of leveraged COLI.  Variable COLI continues to be a
product used by employers to fund non-qualified benefits or other postemployment
benefit liabilities.

Variable COLI account values were $19.7 billion and $18.0 billion as of December
31, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Leveraged COLI account values decreased to $3.3
billion as of December  31,  2002 from $4.3  billion as of  December  31,  2001,
primarily due to the continuing  effects of HIPAA.  COLI  generated  revenues of
$592, $719 and $767 in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively, and net income of $32,
$37 and $34 in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively.

PROPERTY & CASUALTY

Property & Casualty provides (1) workers'  compensation,  property,  automobile,
liability, umbrella, specialty casualty, marine, agricultural and bond coverages
to commercial accounts primarily  throughout the United States; (2) professional
liability  coverage and directors and officers  liability  coverage,  as well as
excess and surplus lines  business not normally  written by standard  commercial
lines insurers;  (3) automobile,  homeowners and home-based business coverage to
individuals  throughout the United States;  (4) assumed  reinsurance,  primarily
through  professional  reinsurance brokers covering various property,  casualty,
catastrophe,  alternative risk transfer and marine classes of business;  and (5)
insurance related services.

The Hartford is the fourteenth largest property and casualty insurance operation
in the United States based on written  premiums for the year ended  December 31,
2001 according to A.M. Best Company,  Inc.  ("A.M.  Best").  Property & Casualty
generated revenues of $9.5 billion, $8.6 billion and $8.7 billion, in 2002, 2001
and 2000,  respectively.  Written  premiums  for  2002,  2001 and 2000 were $8.6
billion, $7.6 billion and $7.3 billion,  respectively.  Additionally, net income
(loss) was $469, $(115) and $494 for 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. Total


                                     - 7 -


assets for  Property  & Casualty  were  $31.2  billion  and $29.2  billion as of
December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively.

BUSINESS INSURANCE

Business Insurance provides standard commercial  insurance coverage to small and
middle market commercial businesses primarily throughout the United States. This
segment also provides  commercial risk management  products and services as well
as marine  coverage.  The  segment had written  premiums of $3.4  billion,  $2.9
billion and $2.4 billion in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively,  and underwriting
income (loss) of $44,  $(242)  (includes  $245 of  underwriting  loss related to
September 11) and $(50) in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively.

Principal Products
- ------------------

The  Business   Insurance  segment  offers  workers'   compensation,   property,
automobile, liability, umbrella and marine coverages. Commercial risk management
products and services are also provided.

Marketing and Distribution
- --------------------------

Business  Insurance  provides  insurance  products and services through its home
office located in Hartford,  Connecticut,  and multiple domestic regional office
locations and insurance  centers.  The segment  markets its products  nationwide
utilizing  independent  agents and  involving  trade  associations  and employee
groups.  Independent  agents,  who often  represent other companies as well, are
compensated on a commission basis and are not employees of The Hartford.

Competition
- -----------

The commercial insurance industry is a highly competitive  environment regarding
product,  price, service and technology.  The Hartford competes with other stock
companies,   mutual  companies,   alternative  risk  sharing  groups  and  other
underwriting  organizations.  These companies sell through various  distribution
channels and business models,  across a broad array of product lines, and with a
high  level  of  variation   regarding   geographic,   marketing   and  customer
segmentation.  The Hartford is the fourteenth  largest commercial lines' insurer
in the United States based on 2001 written premiums  according to A.M. Best. The
relatively  large  size  and  underwriting  capacity  of  The  Hartford  provide
opportunities not available to smaller companies.  In addition,  the marketplace
is  affected by  available  capacity  of the  insurance  industry as measured by
policyholders'  surplus.  Surplus expands and contracts primarily in conjunction
with profit levels generated by the industry.  The low interest rate environment
is  impacting  returns and making  underwriting  decisions  even more  critical.
Overall, in 2002, market conditions in the commercial industry have continued to
improve as a result of increased  underwriting  discipline  and a firmer pricing
environment, but are still under stress from years of soft market conditions.

PERSONAL LINES

Personal  Lines  provides   automobile,   homeowners'  and  home-based  business
coverages  to the  members  of AARP  through a direct  marketing  operation;  to
individuals who prefer local agent involvement  through a network of independent
agents in the standard personal lines market; and in the non-standard automobile
market through the Company's Omni Insurance  Group,  Inc.  ("Omni")  subsidiary.
Personal  Lines also  operates  a member  contact  center  for health  insurance
products  offered through AARP's Health Care Options.  The Hartford's  exclusive
licensing  arrangement with AARP, which was renewed during the fourth quarter of
2001,  continues  through  January  1,  2010  for  automobile,   homeowners  and
home-based  business.  The Health Care Options agreement continues through 2007.
These agreements provide Personal Lines with an important competitive advantage.
Personal  Lines had written  premiums  of $3.1  billion,  $2.9  billion and $2.6
billion in 2002,  2001 and 2000,  respectively.  Underwriting  income (loss) for
2002, 2001 and 2000 was $(46),  $(87) (includes $9 of underwriting  loss related
to September 11) and $2, respectively.

Principal Products
- ------------------

Personal Lines provides  standard and  non-standard  automobile,  homeowners and
home-based business coverages to individuals across the United States, including
a special program designed exclusively for members of AARP.

Marketing and Distribution
- --------------------------

Personal Lines reaches diverse markets through  multiple  distribution  channels
including  independent  agents,  direct mail,  the Internet and  advertising  in
publications.   This  segment  provides  customized  products  and  services  to
customers through a network of independent agents in the standard personal lines
market,  and in the  non-standard  automobile  market through Omni.  Independent
agents,  who often  represent  other  companies as well,  are  compensated  on a
commission  basis and are not employees of The Hartford.  Personal  Lines has an
important  relationship  with AARP and  markets  directly to its over 35 million
members.

Competition
- -----------

The personal  lines  automobile  and  homeowners  businesses  continue to remain
highly  competitive.  Personal lines insurance is written by insurance companies
of varying  sizes that sell  products  through  various  distribution  channels,
including independent agents,  captive agents and directly to the consumer.  The
personal  lines  market  competes  on the  basis  of  price;  product;  service,
including claims handling;  stability of the insurer and name  recognition.  For
2001, the industry net written premiums were $163 billion.  The Hartford's share
of this market was  approximately  2% and ranked  twelfth in size.  The personal
lines  marketplace  reported a combined ratio of 104.9 for the first nine months
of 2002.  Industry  data and The  Hartford's  market  share and  ranking  in the
industry  were  derived  directly  from  data  reported  by A.M.  Best.  A major
competitive  advantage of The Hartford is the  exclusive  licensing  arrangement
with AARP to provide  personal  automobile,  homeowners and home-based  business
insurance  products to its  members.  This  arrangement  was renewed  during the
fourth quarter of 2001 through  January 1, 2010.  Management  expects  favorable
"baby boom"  demographics  to increase AARP  membership  during this period.  In
addition,  The  Hartford  provides  customer  service  for all health  insurance
products  offered  through  AARP's Health Care Options,  with an agreement  that

SPECIALTY COMMERCIAL

Specialty  Commercial provides a wide variety of property and casualty insurance
products and services  through  retailers and  wholesalers  to large  commercial
clients and insureds  requiring a variety of specialized  coverages.  Excess and
surplus lines coverages not normally  written by standard line insurers are also
provided,  primarily through wholesale brokers. Specialty Commercial had written
premiums of $1.4 billion,  $989 (includes $7 of reinsurance  cessions related to
September  11) and $1.1  billion  in  2002,  2001 and  2000,  respectively,  and
underwriting  losses of $23, $262 (includes $167 of underwriting loss related to
September 11) and $103 in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively.

Principal Products
- ------------------

Specialty  Commercial offers a variety of customized insurance products and risk
management services. Specialty Commercial provides standard commercial insurance
products including workers' compensation,  automobile and liability coverages to
large-sized  companies.  Specialty  Commercial also provides bond,  professional
liability,  specialty  casualty  and  agricultural  coverages,  as  well as core
property and excess and surplus lines coverages not normally written by standard
lines insurers.  Alternative  markets,  within  Specialty  Commercial,  provides
insurance products and services primarily to captive insurance companies,  pools
and  self-insurance   groups.  In  addition,   Specialty   Commercial   provides
third-party   administrator  services  for  claims  administration,   integrated
benefits,  loss  control and  performance  measurement  through  Specialty  Risk
Services.

Marketing and Distribution
- --------------------------

Specialty  Commercial  provides insurance products and services through its home
office located in Hartford,  Connecticut and multiple domestic office locations.
The segment markets its products nationwide  utilizing a variety of distribution
networks  including  independent  agents  and  brokers  as well as  wholesalers.
Independent agents, who often represent other companies as well, are compensated
on a commission basis and are not employees of The Hartford.

Competition
- -----------

The commercial insurance industry is a highly competitive  environment regarding
product,  price, service and technology.  Specialty Commercial is comprised of a
diverse group of businesses  that are unique to commercial  lines.  Each line of
business operates  independently  with its own set of business  objectives,  and
focuses  on  the  operational   dynamics  of  their  specific  industry.   These
businesses,  while somewhat interrelated,  each have a unique business model and
operating  cycle.  Specialty  Commercial is considered a transactional  business
and,  therefore,  competes  with other  companies  for business  primarily on an
account  by  account  basis  due to the  complex  nature  of  each  transaction.
Specialty  Commercial  competes with other stock  companies,  mutual  companies,
alternative  risk  sharing  groups  and other  underwriting  organizations.  The
relatively  large  size  and  underwriting  capacity  of  The  Hartford  provide
opportunities not available to smaller companies. September 11 has significantly
affected the Specialty  Commercial  business by demonstrating  the importance of
risk  aggregation,  by driving  property  pricing  increases and by  influencing
capital  decisions.  Overall,  in  2002,  market  conditions  in the  commercial
industry  have  continued  to  improve  as a result  of  increased  underwriting
discipline  and a firmer  pricing  environment,  but are still under stress from
years of soft market conditions.

REINSURANCE

The  Reinsurance  segment  assumes  reinsurance  in North  America and primarily
writes treaty  reinsurance  through  professional  reinsurance  brokers covering
various property,  casualty and specialty  classes of business.  The Reinsurance
segment also writes  catastrophe,  marine and alternative risk transfer business
outside of North America.  The Reinsurance segment had written premiums of $703,
$849 (includes $69 of reinsurance  cessions related to September 11) and $826 in
2002,  2001  and  2000,  respectively,  and  underwriting  losses  of $59,  $375
(includes  $226 of  underwriting  loss related to September 11) and $73 in 2002,
2001 and 2000, respectively.

Principal Products
- ------------------

The  Reinsurance   segment  offers  a  full  range  of  treaty  and  facultative
reinsurance  products  including  property,  casualty,  catastrophe,  marine and
alternative risk transfer which includes  non-traditional  reinsurance  products
such as multi-year property  catastrophe  treaties,  aggregate of excess of loss
agreements and quota share treaties with event or aggregate loss ratio caps.

Marketing and Distribution
- --------------------------

The Reinsurance segment assumes insurance from other insurers, primarily through
reinsurance brokers, but also through direct channels and pools in the worldwide
reinsurance market.

Competition
- -----------

The  property  and  casualty  worldwide  reinsurance  market  remains  extremely
competitive,  although  the pricing  environment  continued  to improve in 2002.
There are domestic and foreign  reinsurers,  which compete in this market,  with
varying levels of financial resources and scope. Reinsurers compete on the basis
of financial  strength and  stability,  price,  service,  capacity and terms and
conditions. The Hartford was the eleventh largest reinsurer in the United States
based on 2001 net written  premiums,  according to data published by Reinsurance
Associate of America.  In the aftermath of the terrorist attack on September 11,
the reinsurance  landscape has become very dynamic.  Several new reinsurers were
formed in Bermuda,  and existing  reinsurers  raised additional  capital,  while
several others have either exited the market,  announced  plans to do so, or are
considering other strategic options. In addition, poor underwriting results over
the past few years  and the  decline  in equity  markets  have put  pressure  on
capital.

OTHER OPERATIONS

Property & Casualty's Other Operations currently consist of certain property and
casualty  insurance  operations  of The Hartford  which have ceased  writing new
business.  These  operations  primarily  include First State Insurance  Company,
located  in  Boston,   Massachusetts;   Heritage  Reinsurance   Company,   Ltd.,
headquartered in Bermuda;  and Excess Insurance Company Limited,  located in the
United  Kingdom.  Also  included in Other  Operations  are Property & Casualty's
international  businesses  up until  their  dates of sales,  and for

                                     - 9 -


2002,  the activity in the exited  international  lines of HartRe  following its
restructuring in the fourth quarter of 2001.

Property &  Casualty's  international  businesses  have  historically  consisted
primarily of Western European companies offering a variety of insurance products
designed to meet the needs of local customers.  The Company's strategic shift to
emphasize growth opportunities in asset accumulation  businesses has resulted in
the sale of all of its international property and casualty businesses.  London &
Edinburgh,  located in the United Kingdom,  was sold in November 1998. Zwolsche,
located in the Netherlands,  Belgium and Luxembourg,  was sold in December 2000.
Hartford  Seguros,  located in Spain,  was sold in February  2001.  The Hartford
Insurance Company (Singapore),  Ltd. (formerly People's Insurance Company,  Ltd.
("Singapore Insurance")), located in Singapore, was sold in January 2002.

The Hartford was a global  reinsurer  through its Hartford  Reinsurance  Company
("HartRe") operations in the United Kingdom, France, Italy, Germany, Spain, Hong
Kong and Taiwan,  writing treaty and facultative assumed  reinsurance  including
property,  casualty,  fidelity, and specialty coverages. In October 2001, HartRe
announced that it was exiting most international lines and in January 2002 these
lines were moved to Other Operations.

The primary objectives of Other Operations are the proper disposition of claims,
the resolution of disputes, and the collection of reinsurance proceeds primarily
related  to  policies  written  and  reinsured  prior  to 1985.  As such,  Other
Operations has no new product sales, distribution systems or competitive issues.

The Other Operations  segment generated revenues of $189, $168 and $602 in 2002,
2001 and 2000,  respectively.  Net  income  (loss)  for 2002,  2001 and 2000 was
$(13), $10 and $28, respectively.

LIFE RESERVES

In accordance with applicable  insurance  regulations under which Life operates,
life insurance  subsidiaries of The Hartford  establish and carry as liabilities
actuarially  determined  reserves  which are  calculated to meet The  Hartford's
future  obligations.  Reserves for life insurance and  disability  contracts are
based on actuarially recognized methods using prescribed morbidity and mortality
tables in general use in the United  States,  which are  modified to reflect The
Hartford's actual  experience when  appropriate.  These reserves are computed at
amounts that,  with additions  from  estimated  premiums to be received and with
interest on such reserves  compounded  annually at certain  assumed  rates,  are
expected to be sufficient to meet The  Hartford's  policy  obligations  at their
maturities or in the event of an insured's  disability  or death.  Reserves also
include unearned  premiums,  premium deposits,  claims incurred but not reported
and claims  reported  but not yet paid.  Reserves  for assumed  reinsurance  are
computed  in  a  manner  that  is  comparable  to  direct  insurance   reserves.
(Additional information on Life reserves may be found in the Critical Accounting
Estimates section of the MD&A under "Reserves".)


PROPERTY & CASUALTY RESERVES

The  Hartford  establishes  property  and  casualty  reserves to provide for the
estimated  costs of  paying  claims  under  insurance  policies  written  by The
Hartford.  These  reserves  include  estimates  for both  claims  that have been
reported and those that have been  incurred but not reported to The Hartford and
include estimates of all expenses  associated with processing and settling these
claims. This estimation process is primarily based on historical  experience and
involves  a variety  of  actuarial  techniques  which  analyze  trends and other
relevant factors.

As a result of September  11, the Company  established  estimated  gross and net
reserves  of $1.1  billion  and $556,  respectively,  related  to  property  and
casualty operations.  This loss estimate includes coverages related to property,
business  interruption,  workers'  compensation  and other liability  exposures,
including those underwritten by the Company's assumed reinsurance operation. The
Company  based the loss  estimate  upon a review of  insured  exposures  using a
variety of assumptions and actuarial techniques, including estimated amounts for
incurred but not  reported  policyholder  losses and costs  incurred in settling
claims.  The Company  continues to carry the original incurred amount related to
September 11, less any paid losses.  Reported  losses to date have fallen within
the original reserved amounts.  However, there is significant uncertainty around
September 11,  particularly with regard to inhalation claims,  stress claims and
other bodily  injury,  as well as the three year statute of  limitations  in New
York State.  Included  in net  reserves  was an estimate of amounts  recoverable
under the Company's ceded reinsurance programs.  Although management anticipates
certain claims for recovery to be challenged,  the impact of these challenges is
not  expected  to be  material.  Risk  of  non-collection  due to the  financial
condition of The  Hartford's  reinsurers  has been  mitigated as a result of the
Company's  process of selecting  its  reinsurers.  The  Hartford's  property and
casualty  reinsurance  is placed  with  reinsurers  that meet  strict  financial
criteria  established  by the  Company's  credit  committee.  As a result of the
uncertainties  involved in the estimation  process,  final claim settlements may
vary from present estimates.

The Hartford continues to receive  claims that assert damages from asbestos- and
environmental-related  exposures.  Asbestos  claims  relate  primarily to bodily
injuries  asserted  by those  who came in  contact  with  asbestos  or  products
containing asbestos.  Environmental claims relate primarily to pollution related
clean-up costs.  Due to deviations from past experience and a variety of social,
economic and legal issues,  the Company's  ability to estimate the unpaid claims
and claim adjustment expenses is significantly impacted.  Further discussion may
be found in the Critical  Accounting  Estimates and Other Operations sections of
the MD&A.

Most of the  Company's  reserves  do not  include  discounts.  However,  certain
liabilities  for unpaid claims where the amount and timing of payments are fixed
and reliably determinable,  principally for permanently disabled claimants,  and
certain  structured  settlement  contracts that fund loss run-offs for unrelated
parties,  have been discounted to present value.  The amount of the discount was
approximately $424 and $429 as of December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively,  and
amortization  of

                                     - 10 -


the discount had no material effect on net income during 2002, 2001 and 2000.

As of December  31, 2002,  property  and casualty  reserves for claims and claim
adjustment  expenses reported on a statutory basis exceeded those reported under
Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ("GAAP") by $27. The primary difference
resulted from the discounting of GAAP-basis  workers'  compensation  reserves at
risk free interest  rates,  which  exceeded the statutory  discount rates set by
regulators,  partially offset by the required  exclusion from statutory reserves
of assumed retoactive reinsurance.

There were no significant changes in the mix of the Company's business that have
impacted property and casualty claims and claim adjustment expense reserves; nor
has the Company completed any significant loss portfolio  transfers,  structured
settlements or other transactions which would change claim payment patterns.

Further discussion on The Hartford's property and casualty  reserves, including
asbestos and environmental claims reserves, may be found in the Reserves section
of the MD&A- Critical Accounting Estimates.

A reconciliation of liabilities for unpaid claims and claim adjustment  expenses
is herein referenced from Note 7 of Notes to Consolidated  Financial Statements.
A table  depicting the  historical  development  of the  liabilities  for unpaid
claims and claim adjustment expenses, net of reinsurance, follows.





The table above shows the cumulative  deficiency  (redundancy)  of the Company's
reserves,  net of  reinsurance,  as now estimated with the benefit of additional
information. Those amounts are comprised of changes in estimates of gross losses
and changes in estimates of related reinsurance recoveries. The table below, for
the periods  presented,  reconciles the net reserves to the gross  reserves,  as
initially estimated and recorded,  and as currently estimated and recorded,  and
computes the cumulative deficiency (redundancy) of the Company's reserves before
reinsurance.

represent the cumulative reserve  re-estimates  during the ten year period ended
December 31, 2002 for the indicated accident year(s).




CEDED REINSURANCE

Consistent  with  industry  practice,  The  Hartford  cedes  insurance  risk  to
reinsurance  companies.  For Property & Casualty  operations,  these reinsurance
arrangements  are intended to provide  greater  diversification  of business and
limit The Hartford's maximum net loss arising from large risks or catastrophes.

A major portion of The Hartford's property and casualty  reinsurance is effected
under general reinsurance contracts known as treaties, or, in some instances, is
negotiated on an individual risk basis,  known as facultative  reinsurance.  The
Hartford also has in-force excess of loss contracts with reinsurers that protect
it against a specified part or all of certain losses over stipulated amounts.

Reinsurance does not relieve The Hartford of its primary liability and, as such,
failure of reinsurers to honor their  obligations  could result in losses to The
Hartford.  The Hartford evaluates the financial  condition of its reinsurers and
monitors  concentrations  of credit risk.  The Company's  monitoring  procedures
include careful initial selection of its reinsurers,  structuring  agreements to
provide collateral funds where possible,  and regularly monitoring the financial
condition and ratings of its reinsurers.

In  accordance  with  normal  industry  practice,  Life is  involved in both the
cession  and  assumption  of  insurance  with other  insurance  and  reinsurance
companies.  As of  December  31,  2002,  the  largest  amount of life  insurance
retained  on any one life by any one of the life  operations  was  approximately
$2.5.  In addition,  the Company  reinsures  the  majority of the minimum  death
benefit guarantee and the guaranteed  withdrawal  benefits offered in connection
with its variable annuity contracts.

INVESTMENT OPERATIONS

An  important  element of the  financial  results of The  Hartford  is return on
invested  assets.  The Hartford's  investment  activities are primarily  divided
between  Life and Property & Casualty  and are managed  based on the  underlying
characteristics and nature of their respective liabilities.

The primary  investment  objective  of Life's  general  account  and  guaranteed
separate accounts is to maximize  after-tax  returns  consistent with acceptable
risk  parameters,  including the management of the interest rate  sensitivity of
invested assets and the generation of sufficient liquidity,  relative to that of
corporate and policyholder obligations.

The investment  objective for the majority of Property & Casualty is to maximize
economic value while  generating  after-tax  income and sufficient  liquidity to
meet corporate

                                     - 12 -


and  policyholder  obligations.  For  Property  &  Casualty's  Other  Operations
segment,  the  investment  objective is to ensure the full and timely payment of
all liabilities.  Property & Casualty investment  strategies are developed based
on a variety of factors including  business needs,  regulatory  requirements and
tax considerations.

For a further discussion of The Hartford's approach to managing risks, including
derivative  utilization,  see the Capital Markets Risk Management section of the
MD&A, as well as Note 3 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

REGULATION AND PREMIUM RATES

Although  there has been some  deregulation  with  respect  to large  commercial
insureds in recent  years,  insurance  companies,  for the most part,  are still
subject to comprehensive and detailed regulation and supervision  throughout the
United  States.  The extent of such  regulation  varies,  but  generally has its
source in statutes which delegate  regulatory,  supervisory  and  administrative
powers to state  insurance  departments.  Such  powers  relate to,  among  other
things, the standards of solvency that must be met and maintained; the licensing
of insurers and their  agents;  the nature of and  limitations  on  investments;
establishing premium rates; claim handling and trade practices;  restrictions on
the size of risks  which  may be  insured  under a single  policy;  deposits  of
securities for the benefit of policyholders;  approval of policy forms; periodic
examinations of the affairs of companies;  annual and other reports  required to
be filed on the financial  condition of companies or for other purposes;  fixing
maximum  interest  rates on life  insurance  policy loans and minimum  rates for
accumulation  of  surrender  values;  and the  adequacy  of  reserves  and other
necessary  provisions for unearned premiums,  unpaid claims and claim adjustment
expenses and other liabilities, both reported and unreported.

Most states have enacted  legislation that regulates  insurance  holding company
systems such as The Hartford.  This  legislation  provides  that each  insurance
company in the system is required to register with the  insurance  department of
its state of domicile  and furnish  information  concerning  the  operations  of
companies  within the holding  company  system which may  materially  affect the
operations, management or financial condition of the insurers within the system.
All transactions within a holding company system affecting insurers must be fair
and  equitable.  Notice to the insurance  departments  is required  prior to the
consummation  of  transactions  affecting the ownership or control of an insurer
and of certain  material  transactions  between an insurer and any entity in its
holding  company system.  In addition,  certain of such  transactions  cannot be
consummated without the applicable insurance department's prior approval.

The extent of insurance  regulation on business outside the United States varies
significantly among the countries in which The Hartford operates. Some countries
have  minimal   regulatory   requirements,   while  others   regulate   insurers
extensively.   Foreign  insurers  in  many  countries  are  faced  with  greater
restrictions   than   domestic   competitors   domiciled   in  that   particular
jurisdiction.  The Hartford's international operations are comprised of insurers
licensed  in their  respective  countries  and,  therefore,  are  subject to the
generally less restrictive domestic insurance regulations.


EMPLOYEES

The Hartford had approximately 29,000 employees as of December 31, 2002.

AVAILABLE INFORMATION

The Hartford files annual,  quarterly and current reports,  proxy statements and
other  documents with the Securities and Exchange  Commission  (the "SEC") under
the Securities  Exchange Act of 1934 (the "Exchange  Act").  The public may read
and copy any materials  that The Hartford files with the SEC at the SEC's Public
Reference Room at 450 Fifth Street,  NW,  Washington,  DC 20549.  The public may
obtain  information on the operation of the Public Reference Room by calling the
SEC at 1-800-SEC-0330. Also, the SEC maintains an Internet website that contains
reports,  proxy and  information  statements,  and other  information  regarding
issuers,  including The  Hartford,  that file  electronically  with the SEC. The
public  can  obtain  any  documents  that  The  Hartford  files  with the SEC at
http://www.sec.gov.

The  Hartford  also makes  available  free of charge on or through its  Internet
website  (http://thehartford.com)  The  Hartford's  Annual  Report on Form 10-K,
Quarterly  Reports on Form 10-Q,  Current Reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to
those  reports  filed or  furnished  pursuant  to Section  13(a) or 15(d) of the
Exchange Act as soon as reasonably practicable after The Hartford electronically
files such material with, or furnishes it to, the SEC.

ITEM 2.  PROPERTIES

The Hartford owns the land and buildings  comprising  its Hartford  location and
other  properties  within the  greater  Hartford,  Connecticut  area which total
approximately  1.8  million  square  feet.  In  addition,  The  Hartford  leases
approximately  6.5  million  square  feet  throughout  the United  States and 37
thousand square feet in other  countries.  All of the properties owned or leased
are  used  by one or more  of all  nine  operating  segments,  depending  on the
location.  (For  more  information  on  operating  segments  see Part 1, Item 1,
Business  of The  Hartford -  Reporting  Segments.)  The  Company  believes  its
properties and facilities are suitable and adequate for current operations.

ITEM 3.  LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

The Hartford is involved in claims litigation  arising in the ordinary course of
business,  both as a liability  insurer  defending  third-party  claims  brought
against insureds and as an insurer defending coverage claims brought against it.
The Hartford  accounts for such  activity  through the  establishment  of unpaid
claim and claim adjustment  expense  reserves.  Subject to the discussion of the
litigation  involving Mac Arthur Company and its subsidiary,  Western  MacArthur
Company, both former regional distributors of asbestos products (collectively or
individually,  "MacArthur"), below and the uncertainties discussed in Note 16(b)
of Notes to Consolidated  Financial  Statements under the caption  "Asbestos and
Environmental  Claims," management expects that the ultimate liability,  if any,
with respect to such ordinary-course  claims litigation,  after consideration of
provisions made for potential losses and costs of defense,  will not be material
to the consolidated financial condition,  results of operations or cash flows of
The Hartford.

                                     - 13 -


The  Hartford is also  involved in other kinds of legal  actions,  some of which
assert claims for  substantial  amounts.  These actions  include,  among others,
putative  state and federal class actions  seeking  certification  of a state or
national  class.  Such  putative  class  actions  have  alleged,   for  example,
underpayment  of claims or improper  underwriting  practices in connection  with
various kinds of insurance policies, such as personal and commercial automobile,
premises  liability,  and  inland  marine.  The  Hartford  also is  involved  in
individual actions in which punitive damages are sought, such as claims alleging
bad faith in the  handling of  insurance  claims.  Management  expects  that the
ultimate liability,  if any, with respect to such lawsuits,  after consideration
of  provisions  made for  potential  losses  and costs of  defense,  will not be
material to the consolidated  financial condition of The Hartford.  Nonetheless,
given the large or indeterminate amounts sought in certain of these actions, and
the inherent  unpredictability  of  litigation,  it is possible  that an adverse
outcome in certain  matters could,  from time to time,  have a material  adverse
effect on the  Company's  consolidated  results of  operations  or cash flows in
particular quarterly or annual periods.

As further  discussed  in the MD&A under the  caption  "Other  Operations,"  The
Hartford  continues to receive  environmental  and asbestos  claims that involve
significant  uncertainty  regarding  policy  coverage  issues.  Regarding  these
claims,   The  Hartford   continually   reviews  its  overall   reserve  levels,
methodologies and reinsurance coverages.

Hartford  Accident and Indemnity  Company  ("Hartford A&I"), a subsidiary of the
Company,  issued  primary  general  liability  policies to MacArthur  during the
period 1967 to 1976. MacArthur sought coverage for asbestos-related  claims from
Hartford A&I under these policies  beginning in 1978.  During the period between
1978 and 1987,  Hartford A&I paid its full aggregate limits under these policies
plus defense costs. In 1987,  Hartford A&I notified MacArthur that its available
limits under these policies had been exhausted,  and MacArthur ceased submitting
claims to Hartford A&I under these policies.

On October 3, 2000,  thirteen years after it had accepted  Hartford A&I's notice
of  exhaustion,  MacArthur  filed an action  against  Hartford  A&I and  another
insurer in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York, seeking
for the first time  additional  coverage for asbestos bodily injury claims under
The Hartford A&I primary  policies.  MacArthur seeks additional  coverage on the
theory that  Hartford A&I has  exhausted  only its products  aggregate  limit of
liability,   not  separate  limits   MacArthur   alleges  to  be  available  for
non-products  liability.  The  complaint  seeks a  declaration  of coverage  and
unquantified  damages.  Hartford A&I has moved for summary  judgment  dismissing
MacArthur's  claims with  prejudice.  MacArthur  has moved to dismiss the action
without prejudice. Both motions are pending.

On June  3,  2002,  The St.  Paul  Companies,  Inc.  ("St.  Paul")  announced  a
settlement  of a coverage  action  brought by MacArthur  against  United  States
Fidelity and Guaranty  Company  ("USF&G"),  a subsidiary of St. Paul.  Under the
settlement,  St.  Paul  agreed to pay a total of $975 to  resolve  its  asbestos
liability to MacArthur in conjunction  with a proposed  bankruptcy  petition and
pre-packaged plan of reorganization to be filed by MacArthur.  USF&G provided at
least 12 years of primary general liability  coverage to MacArthur,  but, unlike
Hartford  A&I,  had  denied  coverage  and had  refused  to pay for  defense  or
indemnity.

On October 7, 2002,  MacArthur  filed an action in the Superior Court in Alameda
County,  California,  against Hartford A&I and two other insurers. As in the New
York action,  MacArthur seeks a declaration of coverage and damages for asbestos
bodily  injury  claims.  Five asbestos  claimants  who  allegedly  have obtained
default judgments against MacArthur also are joined as plaintiffs;  they seek to
recover the amount of their default  judgments and additional  damages  directly
from the defendant insurers and assert a right to an accelerated trial.

In its October 7, 2002 complaint,  MacArthur  alleges that it has  approximately
$1.8 billion of unpaid  asbestos  liability  judgments  against it to date.  The
ultimate  amount  of  MacArthur's  alleged   non-products   asbestos  liability,
including  any  unresolved  current  claims and  future  demands,  is  currently
unknown.  On Hartford  A&I's motion,  the court stayed the action until March 3,
2003,  to allow the New York  federal  court time to rule  first on the  motions
pending there.

On November 22, 2002, MacArthur filed a bankruptcy petition and proposed plan of
reorganization,  which seeks to implement the terms of its  settlement  with St.
Paul. MacArthur's bankruptcy filings indicate that it will seek to have the full
amount of its current and future  asbestos  liability  estimated in  conjunction
with plan confirmation.  If such an estimation is made, MacArthur intends to ask
the Alameda County court to enter  judgment  against the insurers for the amount
of its total  estimated  liability,  including  unliquidated  claims  and future
demands,  less the amount ultimately paid by St. Paul. Hartford A&I has filed an
adversary complaint in the MacArthur  bankruptcy seeking a declaratory  judgment
that any estimation made in the bankruptcy proceedings is not an adjudication of
MacArthur's asbestos liability for purposes of insurance coverage.

Hartford A&I intends to defend the MacArthur  actions  vigorously.  Based on the
information  currently  available,   management  believes  that  Hartford  A&I's
liability, if any, to MacArthur will not be finally resolved for at least a year
and most  probably  not for several  years.  In the opinion of  management,  the
ultimate outcome is highly uncertain for many reasons.  It is not yet known, for
example,  in which venue Hartford A&I's  liability,  if any, will be determined;
whether  Hartford A&I's  defenses  based on MacArthur's  long delay in asserting
claims for further coverage will be successful;  how other significant  coverage
defenses  will be  decided;  or the  extent  to which  the  claims  and  default
judgments against MacArthur involve injury outside of the products and completed
operations hazard definitions of the policies. In the opinion of management,  an
adverse outcome could have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of
operations, financial condition and liquidity.

In addition,  on May 14, 2002, The Hartford announced its  participation,  along
with several dozen other insurance  carriers,  in a settlement in principle with
its insured,  PPG  Industries  ("PPG"),  of  litigation  arising  from  asbestos
exposures involving Pittsburgh Corning  Corporation,  which is 50% owned by PPG.

On March 15, 2002, a jury in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of
Missouri issued a verdict in Bancorp Services,  LLC ("Bancorp") v. Hartford Life
Insurance Company  ("HLIC"),  et al., in favor of Bancorp in the amount of $118.
The case  involved  claims of  patent  infringement,  misappropriation  of trade
secrets,  and breach of contract  against HLIC and its  affiliate  International
Corporate  Marketing  Group,  LLC  ("ICMG").  The  judge  dismissed  the  patent
infringement  claim on summary judgment.  The jury's award was based on the last
two claims.  On August 28, 2002,  the Court  entered an order  awarding  Bancorp
prejudgment interest on the breach of contract claim in the amount of $16.

HLIC and ICMG have  appealed  the  judgment  on the trade  secret  and breach of
contract claims. Bancorp has cross-appealed the pretrial dismissal of its patent
infringement claim. The Company's  management,  based on the advice of its legal
counsel,  believes that there is a substantial likelihood that the judgment will
not  survive  at its  current  amount.  Based on the  advice  of  legal  counsel
regarding the potential outcomes of this litigation, the Company recorded an $11
after-tax  charge  for this  matter in the  first  quarter  of 2002 to  increase
litigation reserves. Should HLIC and ICMG not succeed in eliminating or reducing
the judgment,  a significant  additional expense would be recorded in the future
related to this matter.

The  Company is  involved  in  arbitration  with one of its  primary  reinsurers
relating to policies  with death benefit  guarantees  written from 1994 to 1999.
The  arbitration  involves  alleged  breaches  under the  reinsurance  treaties.
Although the Company  believes that its position in this pending  arbitration is
strong, an adverse outcome could result in a decrease to the Company's statutory
surplus and capital and potentially increase the death benefit costs incurred by
the Company in the future.  The  arbitration  hearing was held during the fourth
quarter of 2002, but no decision has been rendered.

(DOLLAR AMOUNTS IN MILLIONS, EXCEPT FOR PER SHARE DATA, UNLESS OTHERWISE STATED)


Management's  Discussion  and  Analysis of  Financial  Condition  and Results of
Operations  ("MD&A") addresses the financial condition of The Hartford Financial
Services Group, Inc. and its subsidiaries  (collectively,  "The Hartford" or the
"Company") as of December 31, 2002,  compared  with  December 31, 2001,  and its
results of operations  for each of the three years in the period ended  December
31, 2002. This discussion  should be read in conjunction  with the  Consolidated
Financial Statements and related Notes beginning on page F-1.

Certain of the statements  contained herein (other than statements of historical
fact) are forward-looking statements.  These forward-looking statements are made
pursuant to the safe harbor  provisions  of the  Private  Securities  Litigation
Reform Act of 1995 and include  estimates and  assumptions  related to economic,
competitive and legislative developments.  These forward-looking  statements are
subject  to change and  uncertainty  which are,  in many  instances,  beyond the
Company's  control and have been made based upon  management's  expectations and
beliefs  concerning  future  developments  and their  potential  effect upon the
Company.  There  can  be  no  assurance  that  future  developments  will  be in
accordance  with  management's   expectations  or  that  the  effect  of  future
developments  on The Hartford will be those  anticipated by  management.  Actual
results could differ materially from those expected by the Company, depending on
the  outcome of various  factors.  These  factors  include:  the  difficulty  in
predicting  the  Company's  potential  exposure for  asbestos and  environmental
claims and related  litigation,  in  particular,  significant  uncertainty  with
regard to the outcome of the Company's  current  dispute with Mac Arthur Company
and its subsidiary,  Western  MacArthur  Company  (collectively or individually,
"MacArthur");  the uncertain  nature of damage theories and loss amounts and the
development  of additional  facts  related to the September 11 terrorist  attack
("September   11");   the   uncertain   impact  on  the   Company  of  the  Bush
Administration's  budget  proposals  relating to the  distribution of nontaxable
dividends to shareholders and the creation of new tax-favored individual savings
accounts; the response of reinsurance companies under reinsurance contracts, the
impact of increasing  reinsurance  rates,  and the  availability and adequacy of
reinsurance  to protect the Company  against  losses;  the  possibility  of more
unfavorable  loss  experience  than  anticipated;  the  possibility  of  general
economic and business  conditions that are less favorable than anticipated;  the
incidence and severity of catastrophes, both natural and man-made; the effect of
changes  in  interest  rates,  the stock  markets  or other  financial  markets;
stronger  than  anticipated  competitive  activity;   unfavorable   legislative,
regulatory or judicial  developments;  the Company's  ability to distribute  its
products through distribution  channels,  both current and future; the uncertain
effects of emerging claim and coverage  issues;  the effect of  assessments  and
other surcharges for guaranty funds and second-injury  funds and other mandatory
pooling  arrangements;  a downgrade in the  Company's  claims-paying,  financial
strength or credit  ratings;  the ability of the Company's  subsidiaries  to pay
dividends to the Company;  and other factors  described in such  forward-looking
statements.

Certain  reclassifications have been made to prior year financial information to

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The  preparation  of  financial   statements,   in  conformity  with  accounting
principles  generally  accepted  in  the  United  States  of  America,  requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of
assets and  liabilities  and disclosure of contingent  assets and liabilities at
the date of the financial  statements  and the reported  amounts of revenues and
expenses  during the reporting  period.  Actual  results could differ from those
estimates.

The Company has  identified  the  following  estimates  as critical in that they
involve a higher degree of judgment and are subject to a  significant  degree of
variability:  reserves;  valuation of investments  and  derivative  instruments;
deferred policy acquisition costs;  pension and other  postretirement  benefits;
and contingencies. In developing these estimates management makes subjective and
complex  judgments that are inherently  uncertain and subject to material change
as facts and circumstances  develop.  Although  variability is inherent in these
estimates,  management  believes the amounts provided are appropriate based upon
the facts available upon compilation of the financial statements.

                                     - 17 -


RESERVES

LIFE

Life insurance  subsidiaries of The Hartford  establish and carry as liabilities
actuarially  determined  reserves,  which are  calculated to meet The Hartford's
future  obligations.  Reserves for life insurance and  disability  contracts are
based on actuarially recognized methods using prescribed morbidity and mortality
tables in general use in the United  States,  which are  modified to reflect The
Hartford's actual  experience when  appropriate.  These reserves are computed at
amounts that,  with additions  from  estimated  premiums to be received and with
interest on such reserves  compounded  annually at certain  assumed  rates,  are
expected to be sufficient to meet The  Hartford's  policy  obligations  at their
maturities or in the event of an insured's death.  Changes in or deviations from
the  assumptions  used for mortality,  morbidity,  expected  future premiums and
interest can  significantly  affect the Life reserve  levels and related  future
operations.  Reserves also include unearned premiums,  premium deposits,  claims
incurred  but not  reported  ("IBNR")  and  claims  reported  but not yet  paid.
Reserves for assumed  reinsurance are computed in a manner that is comparable to
direct insurance reserves.

The  liability  for  policy  benefits  for  universal  life-type  contracts  and
interest-sensitive  whole life  policies is equal to the balance that accrues to
the benefit of policyholders,  including  credited  interest,  amounts that have
been assessed to compensate the Company for services to be performed over future
periods and any  amounts  previously  assessed  against  policyholders  that are
refundable on termination of the contract.

For investment contracts,  policyholder liabilities are equal to the accumulated
policy account values, which consist of an accumulation of deposit payments plus
credited interest,  less withdrawals and amounts assessed through the end of the
period.  Certain  investment  contracts include  provisions whereby a guaranteed
minimum death benefit is provided in the event that the contractholder's account
value at death is below the guaranteed value. Although the Company reinsures the
majority of the death benefit  guarantees  associated with its in-force block of
business,  declines in the equity market may increase the Company's net exposure
to death benefits under these contracts.  In addition,  these contracts  contain
various  provisions for determining  the amount of the death benefit  guaranteed
following the withdrawal of a portion of the account value by the  policyholder.
Partial  withdrawals  under  certain  of these  contracts  may not  result  in a
reduction in the  guaranteed  minimum death benefit in proportion to the portion
surrendered.  The Company  records the death benefit costs,  net of reinsurance,
when deaths occur.

For the Company's group disability policies, the level of reserves is based on a
variety of factors including particular diagnoses, termination rates and benefit
levels.

PROPERTY & CASUALTY

The  Hartford  establishes  property  and  casualty  reserves to provide for the
estimated  costs of paying  claims made under  policies  written by the Company.
These  reserves  include  estimates  for both claims that have been reported and
those that have been  incurred but not  reported,  and include  estimates of all
expenses  associated with  processing and settling these claims.  Estimating the
ultimate cost of future claims and claim adjustment expenses is an uncertain and
complex process. This estimation process is based largely on the assumption that
past  developments are an appropriate  predictor of future events and involves a
variety  of  actuarial  techniques  that  analyze  experience,  trends and other
relevant  factors.  Reserve estimates can change over time because of unexpected
changes in the external  environment.  Potential  external  factors  include (1)
changes in the inflation rate for goods and services  related to covered damages
such as medical care,  hospital  care,  auto parts,  wages and home repair,  (2)
changes in the  general  economic  environment  that could  cause  unanticipated
changes in the claim  frequency per unit  insured,  (3) changes in the litigious
environment as evidenced by changes in claimant  attorney  representation in the
claims  negotiation  and  settlement  process,   (4)  changes  in  the  judicial
environment  regarding the  interpretation of policy provisions  relating to the
determination of coverage and/or the amount of damages awarded for certain types
of damages, (5) changes in the social environment regarding the general attitude
of juries in the  determination  of liability  and  damages,  (6) changes in the
regulatory  environment  regarding  rates,  rating plans and policy  forms,  (7)
changes in the legislative  environment  regarding the definition of damages and
(8) new types of  injuries  caused  by new types of  exposure  to  injury:  past
examples include breast implants,  tobacco  products,  lead paint,  construction
defect and blood product  contamination.  Reserve estimates can also change over
time  because of changes in  internal  company  operations.  Potential  internal
factors include (1) periodic changes in claims handling  procedures,  (2) growth
in new lines of business  where exposure and loss  development  patterns are not
well  established  or (3)  changes  in the  quality  of  risk  selection  in the
underwriting process. In the case of reinsurance,  all of the above risks apply.
In addition,  changes in ceding  company case  reserving and reporting  patterns
create additional factors that need to be considered in estimating the reserves.
Due to the inherent  complexity of the assumptions used, final claim settlements
may vary  significantly  from the  present  estimates,  particularly  when those
settlements may not occur until well into the future.

The  Hartford,  like  other  insurance  companies,  categorizes  and  tracks its
insurance reserves by "line of business", such as general liability,  commercial
multi-peril,  workers' compensation,  auto bodily injury, homeowners and assumed
reinsurance.  Furthermore, The Hartford regularly reviews the appropriateness of
reserve  levels at the line of business  level,  taking into  consideration  the
variety of trends that impact the ultimate  settlement of claims for the subsets
of  claims  in each  particular  line of  business.  Adjustments  to  previously
established  reserves,  if any, are  reflected in the  operating  results of the
period in which the adjustment is determined to be necessary. In the judgment of
management,  all information currently available has been properly considered in
the reserves established for claims and claim adjustment expenses.

In the opinion of  management,  based upon the known facts and current  law, the
reserves  recorded  for The  Hartford's  property  and  casualty  businesses  at
December  31,  2002  represent  the  Company's  best  estimate  of its  ultimate
liability for claims and claim adjustment  expenses related to losses covered by
policies   written  by  the  Company.   However,   because  of  the  significant
uncertainties  surrounding environmental and particularly asbestos exposures, it
is possible that  management's  estimate of

                                     - 18 -


the  ultimate  liabilities  for these  claims may  change and that the  required
adjustment to recorded reserves could exceed the currently  recorded reserves by
an amount  that could be  material  to The  Hartford's  results  of  operations,
financial condition and liquidity.

ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS

The Hartford  continues to receive claims that assert damages from asbestos- and
environmental-related  exposures.  Asbestos  claims  relate  primarily to bodily
injuries  asserted  by those  who came in  contact  with  asbestos  or  products
containing  asbestos.  Environmental  claims  relate  primarily to pollution and
related clean-up costs.

The Hartford wrote several different  categories of insurance  coverage to which
asbestos and  environmental  claims may apply.  First, The Hartford wrote direct
policies as a primary liability  insurance  carrier.  Second, The Hartford wrote
direct excess insurance policies providing additional coverage for insureds that
exhaust their primary liability insurance coverage. Third, The Hartford acted as
a reinsurer  assuming a portion of risks  previously  assumed by other  insurers
writing  primary,  excess  and  reinsurance  coverages.   Fourth,  The  Hartford
participated  as a London  Market  company that wrote both direct  insurance and
assumed reinsurance business.

In establishing asbestos reserves, The Hartford evaluates the exposure presented
by each  insured  and the  anticipated  cost of  resolution,  if any,  for  each
insured.  In the course of this evaluation,  The Hartford  considers:  available
insurance  coverage,  including the role of any umbrella or excess insurance The
Hartford has issued to the insured; limits and deductibles;  an analysis of each
insured's potential liability;  the jurisdictions involved; past and anticipated
future claim activity; past settlement values of similar claims; allocated claim
adjustment  expense;  potential  role of other  insurance;  the role, if any, of
non-asbestos claims or potential  non-asbestos claims in any resolution process;
and applicable  coverage defenses or  determinations,  if any, including whether
some or all of the  asbestos  claims for which the insured  seeks  coverage  are
products or completed operations claims subject to the aggregate limit.

In  establishing  environmental  reserves,  The Hartford  evaluates the exposure
presented by each insured and the  anticipated  cost of resolution,  if any, for
each  insured.  In the  course of this  analysis,  The  Hartford  considers  the
probable liability,  available coverage,  relevant judicial  interpretations and
historical  value of similar  exposures.  In addition,  The  Hartford  considers
numerous facts that are unique to each insured, to the extent known, such as the
nature of the alleged activities of the insured at each site; the allegations of
environmental  harm at each  site;  the  number  of sites;  the total  number of
potentially  responsible  parties at each site; the nature of environmental harm
and the corresponding remedy at each site; the nature of government  enforcement
activities at each site; the ownership and general use of each site; the overall
nature of the  insurance  relationship  between The  Hartford  and the  insured,
including  the role of any umbrella or excess  insurance The Hartford has issued
to the insured;  the  involvement  of other  insurers;  the  potential for other
available coverage, including the number of years of coverage; the role, if any,
of  non-environmental  claims  or  potential  non-environmental  claims  in  any
resolution process; and the applicable law in each jurisdiction.

For both  asbestos and  environmental  reserves,  The Hartford also compares its
historical  direct net loss and expense  paid and incurred  experience,  and net
loss and  expense  paid and  incurred  experience  year by year,  to assess  any
emerging trends, fluctuations or characteristics suggested by the aggregate paid
and incurred activity.

Once the gross ultimate  exposure for indemnity and allocated  claim  adjustment
expense  is  determined  for each  insured by each  policy  year,  The  Hartford
calculates its ceded reinsurance  projection based on any applicable facultative
and  treaty   reinsurance  and  the  Company's   experience   with   reinsurance
collections.

Uncertainties Regarding Adequacy of Asbestos and Environmental Reserves

With regard to both environmental and particularly asbestos claims,  significant
uncertainty  limits the  ability of insurers  and  reinsurers  to  estimate  the
ultimate reserves necessary for unpaid losses and related  settlement  expenses.
Conventional  reserving  techniques cannot reasonably estimate the ultimate cost
of these claims,  particularly during periods where theories of law are in flux.
As a result of the factors discussed in the following paragraphs,  the degree of
variability of reserve  estimates for these exposures is  significantly  greater
than for other more traditional exposures. In particular,  The Hartford believes
there is a high degree of  uncertainty  inherent in the  estimation  of asbestos
loss reserves.

In the case of the reserves for asbestos exposures,  factors contributing to the
high degree of uncertainty include inadequate development patterns,  plaintiffs'
expanding  theories of liability,  the risks  inherent in major  litigation  and
inconsistent   emerging  legal  doctrines.   Courts  have  reached  inconsistent
conclusions  as to when losses are deemed to have  occurred  and which  policies
provide coverage; what types of losses are covered;  whether there is an insurer
obligation  to defend;  how policy  limits are  determined;  whether  particular
claims are product/completed  operation claims subject to an aggregate limit and
how policy  exclusions and conditions are applied and interpreted.  Furthermore,
insurers in general,  including  The  Hartford,  have  recently  experienced  an
increase in the number of  asbestos-related  claims due to, among other  things,
more intensive  advertising by lawyers seeking asbestos  claimants,  plaintiffs'
increased focus on new and previously  peripheral  defendants and an increase in
the  number  of  insureds   seeking   bankruptcy   protection  as  a  result  of
asbestos-related  liabilities.  Plaintiffs  and  insureds  have  sought  to  use
bankruptcy  proceedings to accelerate and increase loss payments by insurers. In
addition,  some  policyholders have begun to assert new classes of claims for so
called "non-product"  coverages to which an aggregate limit of liability may not
apply. Recently, many insurers, including, in a limited number of instances, The
Hartford,  also have been sued  directly by asbestos  claimants  asserting  that
insurers  had a duty to  protect  the  public  from  the  dangers  of  asbestos.
Management  believes  these  issues  are not likely to be  resolved  in the near
future.

In the case of the reserves for environmental exposures, factors contributing to
the high degree of uncertainty include court

                                     - 19 -


decisions  that have  interpreted  the  insurance  coverage  to be broader  than
originally intended; inconsistent decisions, especially across jurisdictions and
uncertainty  as to the monetary  amount  being  sought by the claimant  from the
insured.

Further  uncertainties include the effect of the recent acceleration in the rate
of  bankruptcy  filings  by  asbestos  defendants  on the rate and amount of The
Hartford's asbestos claims payments;  a further increase or decrease in asbestos
and  environmental  claims  which  cannot  now  be  anticipated;   whether  some
policyholders'  liabilities  will reach the  umbrella  or excess  layer of their
coverage;  the  resolution or  adjudication  of some disputes  pertaining to the
amount of available  coverage for asbestos claims in a manner  inconsistent with
The Hartford's  previous  assessment of these claims;  the number and outcome of
direct actions against The Hartford; and unanticipated  developments  pertaining
to The Hartford's ability to recover  reinsurance for environmental and asbestos
claims.  It is also not possible to predict changes in the legal and legislative
environment  and  their  impact  on  the  future  development  of  asbestos  and
environmental claims.  Additionally,  the reporting pattern for excess insurance
and reinsurance claims is much longer than direct claims. In many instances,  it
takes months or years to determine that the customer's own obligations have been
met and how the  reinsurance in question may apply to such claims.  The delay in
reporting reinsurance claims and exposures adds to the uncertainty of estimating
the related reserves.

Given the factors and emerging trends described above, The Hartford believes the
actuarial tools and other techniques it employs to estimate the ultimate cost of
claims for more  traditional  kinds of  insurance  exposure  are less precise in
estimating  reserves  for  its  asbestos  exposures.  The  Hartford  continually
evaluates  new  information  and new  methodologies  in assessing  its potential
asbestos  exposures.  At any time, The Hartford may be conducting an analysis of
newly identified information and completion of exposure analyses could cause The
Hartford to change its  estimates  of its  asbestos  reserves  and the effect of
these changes could be material to the Company's consolidated operating results,
financial condition and liquidity.

VALUATION OF INVESTMENTS AND DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS

The  Hartford's  investments  in both fixed  maturities,  which  include  bonds,
redeemable  preferred stock and commercial paper, and equity  securities,  which
include common and non-redeemable preferred stocks, are classified as "available
for sale" as defined in Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No.
115,  "Accounting  for  Certain  Investments  in Debt  and  Equity  Securities".
Accordingly,  these  securities  are  carried at fair  value with the  after-tax
difference from amortized cost, as adjusted for the effect of deducting the life
and  pension  policyholders'  share of the  immediate  participation  guaranteed
contracts and the change in amortization of deferred policy  acquisition  costs,
reflected  in  stockholders'   equity  as  a  component  of  accumulated   other
comprehensive income ("AOCI").  Policy loans are carried at outstanding balance,
which  approximates  fair value.  Other  invested  assets  consist  primarily of
limited partnership investments that are accounted for by the equity method. The
Company's net income from  partnerships  is included in net  investment  income.
Other  investments also include mortgage loans at amortized cost and derivatives
at fair value.

The fair  value of  securities  is based  upon  quoted  market  prices or broker
quotations  when  available.  Where market prices or broker  quotations  are not
available,  management  typically estimates the fair value based upon discounted
cash flow,  applying  current interest rates for similar  financial  instruments
with  comparable  terms  and  credit  quality.  The  estimated  fair  value of a
financial  instrument  may differ  significantly  from the amount  that could be
realized if the  security  were sold  immediately.  Derivative  instruments  are
reported at fair value based upon  internally  established  valuations  that are
consistent with external  valuation models,  quotations  furnished by dealers in
such instrument or market quotations.

One of the significant  estimations  inherent in the valuation of investments is
the  evaluation of other than  temporary  impairments.  The evaluation for other
than temporary  impairments is a quantitative  and qualitative  process which is
subject to risks and  uncertainties in the  determination of whether declines in
the  fair  value  of  investments  are  other  than  temporary.  The  risks  and
uncertainties  include  changes in general  economic  conditions,  the  issuer's
financial  condition or near term recovery  prospects and the effects of changes
in interest rates.  The Company's  accounting  policy requires that a decline in
the value of a security  below its amortized cost basis be assessed to determine
if the  decline is other than  temporary.  If so, the  security  is deemed to be
impaired and, a charge is recorded in net realized  capital  losses equal to the
difference between the fair value and amortized cost basis of the security.  The
fair value of the impaired  investment  becomes its new cost basis.  The Company
has a security  monitoring  process  overseen by a committee of  investment  and
accounting  professionals  that  identifies  securities  that,  due  to  certain
characteristics,  are  subjected to an enhanced  analysis on a quarterly  basis.
Such  characteristics  include,  but are not limited to: a deterioration  of the
financial  condition of the issuer,  the  magnitude  and duration of  unrealized
losses, credit rating and industry category.

The primary  factors  considered  in  evaluating  whether a decline in value for
corporate issued securities is other than temporary  include:  (a) the length of
time and the  extent to which the fair  value has been less than  cost,  (b) the
financial  condition  and  near-term  prospects  of the issuer,  (c) whether the
debtor is current on contractually obligated interest and principal payments and
(d) the intent and ability of the Company to retain the  investment for a period
of time  sufficient to allow for any  anticipated  recovery.  Additionally,  for
certain  securitized  financial  assets with  contractual  cash flows (including
asset-backed  securities),  Emerging Issues Task Force ("EITF") Issue No. 99-20,
"Recognition  of  Interest  Income and  Impairment  on  Purchased  and  Retained
Beneficial Interests in Securitized  Financial Assets",  requires the Company to
periodically  update  its  best  estimate  of cash  flows  over  the life of the
security.  If  management  estimates  that  the fair  value  of its  securitized
financial  asset is less than its carrying  amount and there has been a decrease
in the  present  value of the  estimated  cash  flows  since  the  last  revised
estimate,  considering  both  timing and  amount,  then an other than  temporary
impairment  charge

                                     - 20 -


is recognized.  Projections of expected  future cash flows may change based upon
new  information  regarding  the  performance  of  the  underlying   collateral.
Furthermore,  for  securities  expected  to be  sold,  an other  than  temporary
impairment charge is recognized if the Company does not expect the fair value of
a security to recover to amortized cost prior to the expected date of sale. Once
an impairment charge has been recorded, the Company then continues to review the
other than  temporarily  impaired  securities  for  appropriate  valuation on an
ongoing basis.

DEFERRED POLICY ACQUISITION COSTS

LIFE

Policy acquisition  costs, which include  commissions and certain other expenses
that  vary  with and are  primarily  associated  with  acquiring  business,  are
deferred and amortized  over the estimated  lives of the  contracts,  usually 20
years.  The  deferred  costs are  recorded as an asset  commonly  referred to as
deferred policy  acquisition  costs ("DAC").  At December 31, 2002 and 2001, the
carrying value of the Company's Life  operations'  DAC was $5.2 billion and $5.0
billion, respectively.

DAC related to traditional policies are amortized over the premium-paying period
in  proportion  to  the  present  value  of  annual  expected   premium  income.
Adjustments  are made each year to recognize  actual  experience  as compared to
assumed experience for the current period.

DAC related to  investment  contracts  and  universal  life-type  contracts  are
deferred  and  amortized  using  the  retrospective  deposit  method.  Under the
retrospective  deposit method,  acquisition costs are amortized in proportion to
the present value of estimated gross profits ("EGPs") from projected investment,
mortality  and  expense  margins  and  surrender  charges.  A portion of the DAC
amortization is allocated to realized gains and losses.  The DAC balance is also
adjusted by an amount that  represents  the change in  amortization  of deferred
policy  acquisition costs that would have been required as a charge or credit to
operations had unrealized  amounts been realized.  Actual gross profits can vary
from management's estimates,  resulting in increases or decreases in the rate of
amortization.

The Company  regularly  evaluates  its  estimated  gross profits to determine if
actual  experience or other evidence  suggests that earlier  estimates should be
revised.  Several assumptions considered to be significant in the development of
EGPs include  separate  account  fund  performance,  surrender  and lapse rates,
estimated  interest spread and estimated  mortality.  The separate  account fund
performance assumption is critical to the development of the EGPs related to the
Company's  variable annuity and variable and  interest-sensitive  life insurance
businesses.  The  average  long-term  rate  of  assumed  separate  account  fund
performance  used in  estimating  gross  profits  for the  variable  annuity and
variable  life  business  was 9% at December  31,  2002 and 2001.  For all other
products including fixed annuities and other universal  life-type  contracts the
average  assumed  investment  yield  ranged  from 5% to 8.5% for the years ended
December 31, 2002 and 2001.

Due to the increased  volatility and precipitous decline experienced by the U.S.
equity markets in 2002, the Company  enhanced its DAC evaluation  process during
the  course  of  the  year.  The  Company   developed   sophisticated   modeling
capabilities, which allowed it to run 250 stochastically determined scenarios of
separate  account  fund  performance.  These  scenarios  were then  utilized  to
calculate a reasonable  range of estimates for the present value of future gross
profits.  This  range is then  compared  to the  present  value of future  gross
profits  currently  utilized in the DAC  amortization  model. As of December 31,
2002, the current estimate falls within the reasonable range, and therefore, the
Company does not believe  there is evidence to suggest a revision to the EGPs is
necessary.

Additionally,  the Company  has  performed  various  sensitivity  analyses  with
respect to separate  account fund performance to provide an indication of future
separate  account  fund  performance  levels,  which could result in the need to
revise future EGPs. The Company has estimated that a revision to the future EGPs
is  unlikely in 2003 in the event that the  separate  account  fund  performance
meets or exceeds the Company's long-term assumption of 9% and that a revision is
likely if the overall  separate  account  fund  performance  is negative for the
year. In the event that separate account fund  performance  falls between 0% and
9% during  2003,  the Company  will need to evaluate  the actual  gross  profits
versus the mean EGPs  generated by the  stochastic  DAC  analysis and  determine
whether  or not to  make a  revision  to the  future  EGPs.  Factors  that  will
influence  this  determination  include  the degree of  volatility  in  separate
account fund performance,  when during the year performance becomes negative and
shifts in asset allocation  within the separate  account made by  policyholders.
The overall  return  generated by the  separate  account is dependent on several
factors,  including the relative mix of the underlying  sub-accounts  among bond
funds  and  equity  funds as well as equity  sector  weightings.  The  Company's
overall separate account fund performance has been reasonably  correlated to the
overall performance of the S&P 500 Index,  although no assurance can be provided
that this correlation will continue in the future.

Should the Company  change its  assumptions  utilized to develop EGPs  (commonly
referred to as  "unlocking")  the Company  would  record a charge (or credit) to
bring its DAC  balance to the level it would have been had EGPs been  calculated
using the new assumptions  from the date of each policy.  The Company  evaluates
all critical  assumptions  utilized to develop EGPs (e.g. lapse,  mortality) and
will make a revision  to future EGPs to the extent  that  actual  experience  is
significantly different than expected.

The  overall  recoverability  of the  DAC  asset  is  dependent  on  the  future
profitability of the business. The Company tests the aggregate recoverability of
the DAC asset by comparing the amounts deferred to total EGPs. In addition,  the
Company routinely stress tests its DAC asset for  recoverability  against severe
declines in its separate account assets, which could occur if the equity markets
experienced  another  significant  sell-off,  as the majority of  policyholders'
money held in the separate  accounts are  invested in the equity  market.  As of
December  31,  2002,  separate  account  assets  could fall 25% and the  Company
believes its DAC asset would still be recoverable.

PROPERTY & CASUALTY

The  Property & Casualty  operations  also incur costs,  including  commissions,
premium taxes and certain underwriting and policy issuance costs, that vary with
and are related  primarily to the  acquisition  of property  casualty  insurance
business  and are  deferred  and  amortized  ratably over the period the related
premiums  are earned.  Deferred  acquisition  costs are reviewed to determine if
they are  recoverable  from future  income,  and if

                                     - 21 -


not, are charged to expense.  Anticipated investment income is considered in the
determination of the recoverability of deferred acquisition costs. For the years
ended  December  31,  2002,  2001 and 2000,  no  material  amounts  of  deferred
acquisition  costs  were  charged  to  expense  based  on the  determination  of
recoverability.

PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS

Pursuant to accounting  principles  related to the  Company's  pension and other
postretirement benefit obligations to employees under its various benefit plans,
the Company is required to make a significant  number of assumptions in order to
estimate  the related  liabilities  and expense  each  period.  The two economic
assumptions  that have the most impact on pension  expense are the discount rate
and the expected  long-term  rate of return.  In  determining  the discount rate
assumption,  the Company utilizes information provided by its plan actuaries. In
particular,  the  Company  uses an  interest  rate  yield  curve  developed  and
published  by its plan  actuaries.  The yield curve is comprised of AAA/AA bonds
with maturities between zero and thirty years. Discounting the cash flows of the
Company's  pension plan using this yield curve,  it was determined that 6.50% is
the appropriate discount rate as of December 31, 2002 to calculate the Company's
accrued benefit cost liability.  Accordingly,  the 6.50% discount rate will also
be used to determine the Company's 2003 pension expense.

The Company  determines the long-term rate of return  assumption for the pension
plan's asset portfolio based on analysis of the portfolio's  historical rates of
return  balanced  with  future  long-term  return  expectations.  Based  on  its
long-term outlook with respect to the markets,  which has been influenced by the
poor equity market  performance in recent years as well as the recent decline in
fixed income security  yields,  the Company lowered its long-term rate of return
assumption from 9.75% to 9.00% as of December 31, 2002.

To illustrate the impact of these assumptions on annual pension expense for 2003
and  going  forward,  a  25  basis  point  change  in  the  discount  rate  will
increase/decrease  pension  expense by  approximately  $12, and a 25 basis point
change in the long-term asset return assumption will  increase/decrease  pension
expense by approximately $5.

CONTINGENCIES

Management   follows   the   requirements   of  SFAS  No.  5   "Accounting   for
Contingencies".  This statement requires  management to evaluate each contingent
matter separately. The evaluation is a two-step process, including:  determining
a likelihood of loss,  and, if a loss is probable,  developing a potential range
of loss.  Management  establishes  reserves for these contingencies at its "best
estimate",  or, if no one  number  within the range of  possible  losses is more
probable than any other, the Company records an estimated reserve at the low end
of the range of losses. The majority of contingencies  currently being evaluated
by the  Company  relate to  litigation  and tax  matters,  which are  inherently
difficult to evaluate and subject to significant changes.

                                     - 22 -





The  Hartford  defines  "operating  income"  as  after-tax  operational  results
excluding, as applicable,  net realized capital gains and losses,  restructuring
charges,  losses  from early  retirement  of debt and the  cumulative  effect of
accounting  changes.  Operating  income  is a  performance  measure  used by the
Company in the  management  of its  operations.  Management  believes  that this
performance  measure  delineates  the  results of  operations  of the  Company's
ongoing  businesses  in a manner that allows for a better  understanding  of the
underlying trends in the Company's current business.  However,  operating income
should only be analyzed in conjunction  with, and not in lieu of, net income and
may not be  comparable  to  other  performance  measures  used by the  Company's
competitors.

OPERATING RESULTS

2002 COMPARED TO 2001 - Revenues increased $760, or 5%. This increase was driven
by strong earned premium growth within  Business  Insurance,  Personal Lines and
Specialty   Commercial  whose  premiums   increased  by  $496,  $237  and  $200,
respectively.  Also  contributing to the growth was a $61 increase in fee income
for  the  Individual  Life  segment.  Additionally,  2001  revenues  included  a
reduction  of $91  in  Property  &  Casualty  earned  premiums,  resulting  from
additional  reinsurance  cessions related to September 11. Partially  offsetting
the increases  described above were higher net realized  capital  losses,  which
were $400 in 2002 compared  with $236 in 2001.  The increase in the net realized
capital  losses  was due  primarily  to  other  than  temporary  write-downs  of
corporate and asset-backed  securities including those in the telecommunication,
utility and airline industries.

Operating  income increased $526, or 73%. The increase was partially due to $440
in losses, after-tax and net of reinsurance, included in 2001 results related to
September 11 and the  Company's  adoption of SFAS No. 142,  "Goodwill  and Other
Intangible  Assets",  which precluded the amortization of goodwill  beginning on
January 1,  2002.  The  Company's  goodwill  totaled  $52,  after-tax,  in 2001.
Improved  underwriting  results in  Property &  Casualty,  as well as  increased
operating  income  in  the  Group  Benefits  segment,  also  contributed  to the
increase.  Partially  offsetting the increase was lower operating  income in the
Investment Products segment.

                                     - 23 -


Net income  increased $493, or 97%. The increase was due primarily to the growth
in operating income described in the paragraph above, partially offset by higher
after-tax net realized capital losses in 2002 compared to 2001.

2001 COMPARED TO 2000 -- Revenues increased $444, or 3%. Included in revenues in
2001 was a $91 reduction in Property & Casualty earned premiums,  resulting from
additional  reinsurance  cessions  related  to  September  11. The  increase  in
revenues was related to  continued  new  business  growth in the Group  Benefits
segment,  increased fee income in Individual Life,  primarily as a result of the
April 2001 acquisition of the United States  individual life insurance,  annuity
and mutual fund  businesses  of Fortis,  Inc.  (operating as "Fortis" or "Fortis
Financial  Group") and earned  premium growth in most of the Property & Casualty
segments.  (For further discussion of the Fortis acquisition,  see Note 18(a) of
Notes to Consolidated  Financial  Statements.) Also contributing to the increase
was  higher  net  investment  income,  primarily  due to income  earned on fixed
maturities.  These increases were partially  offset by a decrease in revenues in
the Other  Operations  segment,  reflecting  the sales of Property &  Casualty's
international subsidiaries.

Operating  income decreased $238, or 25%. This decrease was primarily the result
of $440 of losses,  after-tax and net of  reinsurance,  related to September 11.
Also  contributing  to the decline were  decreased  underwriting  results in the
Personal Lines and Reinsurance segments.  Partially offsetting the decrease were
a $130 tax benefit at Hartford Life, Inc.  ("HLI"),  primarily the result of the
favorable   treatment  of  certain  tax  matters  related  to  separate  account
investment  activity  during the  1996-2000  tax years and  increased  operating
income in Life's four operating segments.

Net income decreased $467, or 48%. The decrease was due primarily to the decline
in operating income  described  above. In addition,  net realized capital losses
were $236 in 2001, compared with net realized capital gains of $145 in 2000. The
change in net  realized  capital  losses  resulted  from  other  than  temporary
impairments on fixed maturities in 2001.

NET REALIZED CAPITAL GAINS AND LOSSES

See "Investment Results" in the Investments section.

INCOME TAXES

The  effective  tax  rate  for  2002,  2001  and  2000  was 6%,  (59)%  and 28%,
respectively. Excluding the impacts of September 11, net realized capital losses
and the HLI federal tax  benefits of $76,  $130 and $24 in 2002,  2001 and 2000,
respectively, the effective tax rate for 2002 was 20% compared with 19% and 22%,
respectively,  for 2001 and 2000.  Tax-exempt interest earned on invested assets
and the separate account dividends  received deduction were the principal causes
of effective rates being lower than the 35% United States  statutory rate in all
years.  Income taxes paid (received) in 2002,  2001 and 2000 were $(102),  $(52)
and $95,  respectively.  (For  additional  information,  see Note 15 of Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements.)

MINORITY INTEREST IN CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARY

Prior to the June 27, 2000  acquisition of all of the outstanding  shares of HLI
that The  Hartford  did not already  own ("The HLI  Repurchase"),  the  minority
interest  in  the  consolidated   subsidiary's   operating  results  represented
approximately 19%.

ADOPTION OF FAIR-VALUE RECOGNITION PROVISIONS FOR STOCK COMPENSATION


In December 2002, the Financial  Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued SFAS
No. 148,  "Accounting for  Stock-Based  Compensation - Transition and Disclosure
and Amendment to SFAS No. 123", which provides three optional transition methods
for  entities  that  decide  to  voluntarily  adopt the fair  value  recognition
principles  of SFAS No. 123,  "Accounting  for Stock Issued to  Employees",  and
modifies the disclosure  requirements of that  Statement.  Under the prospective
method,  stock-based compensation expense is recognized for awards granted after
the  beginning  of the  fiscal  year in which the change is made.  The  modified
prospective method recognizes  stock-based  compensation  expense related to new
and  unvested  awards in the year of change  equal to that which would have been
recognized had SFAS No. 123 been adopted as of its effective date,  fiscal years
beginning  after  December  15,  1994.  The  retrospective   restatement  method
recognizes  stock  compensation  costs  for the  year  of  change  and  restates
financial  statements  for all prior periods  presented as though the fair value
recognition  provisions  of SFAS No. 123 had been  adopted  as of its  effective
date.

Beginning  in January  2003,  the  Company  adopted the  fair-value  recognition
provisions of accounting for employee stock compensation under SFAS No. 123. The
Company believes the use of the fair-value method to record employee stock-based
compensation  expense is consistent with the Company's  accounting for all other
forms of compensation.

The  Company  had  applied the  intrinsic  value-based  provisions  set forth in
Accounting Principles Board ("APB") Opinion No. 25, "Accounting for Stock Issued
to  Employees".  Under the  intrinsic  value  method,  compensation  expense  is
determined  on the  measurement  date,  that is the first date on which both the
number of shares the employee is entitled to receive and the exercise  price are
known.  Compensation expense, if any, is measured based on the award's intrinsic
value,  which is the excess of the market  price of the stock over the  exercise
price on the  measurement  date. For the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and
2000,  compensation  expense related to the Company's  stock-based  compensation
plans,  including non-option plans, was $6, $8 and $23 after-tax,  respectively.
The  expense  related  to  stock-based  employee  compensation  included  in the
determination  of net income  for 2002 is less than that  which  would have been
recognized if the fair value method had been

                                     - 24 -


applied to all awards  since the  effective  date of
SFAS No. 123. (For further discussion of the Company's stock compensation plans,
see Notes 1(f) and 11 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.)

SFAS No. 123 permits companies either to use the fair-value method and recognize
compensation  expense  upon the  issuance  of stock  options,  thereby  lowering
earnings, or, alternatively, to disclose the pro-forma impact of the issuance.

The following table  illustrates the effect on net income and earnings per share
as if the fair value  method had been  applied to all  outstanding  and unvested
awards in each period.




The fair value of each option  grant is estimated on the date of the grant using
the  Black-Scholes  options-pricing  model with the following  weighted  average
assumptions  used for grants in 2002, 2001 and 2000:  dividend yield of 1.6% for
2002, 1.6% for 2001 and 1.5% for 2000;  expected price  variability of 40.8% for
2002, 29.1% for 2001 and 35.7% for 2000;  risk-free  interest rates of 4.27% for
2002 grants, 4.98% for 2001 grants and 6.41% for 2000 grants; and expected lives
of six years for 2002, six years for 2001 and four years for 2000.

The use of the fair value  recognition  method results in  compensation  expense
being  recognized  in the  financial  statements  in  different  amounts  and in
different  periods  than  the  related  income  tax  deduction.  Generally,  the
compensation expense recognized under SFAS No. 123 will result in a deferred tax
asset since the stock  compensation  expense is not deductible for tax until the
option is  exercised.  Deferred  tax assets  arising  under SFAS No. 123 will be
evaluated as to future  realizability to determine whether a valuation allowance
is necessary.

SEGMENT RESULTS

The  Hartford  is  organized  into two major  operations:  Life and  Property  &
Casualty. Within these operations, The Hartford conducts business principally in
nine  operating  segments.   Additionally,  the  capital  raising  and  purchase
accounting adjustment  activities related to The HLI Repurchase,  capital raised
in 2002 that was not contributed to the Company's insurance subsidiaries and the
minority interest in HLI for pre-acquisition periods are included in Corporate.

Life is organized into four reportable operating segments:  Investment Products,
Individual  Life,  Group Benefits and Corporate  Owned Life Insurance  ("COLI").
Life also includes in an Other category its international operations,  which are
primarily located in Japan and Latin America; realized capital gains and losses;
as well as  corporate  items not  directly  allocated  to any of its  reportable
operating segments, principally interest expense; and intersegment eliminations.

In January 2002,  Property & Casualty integrated its Affinity Personal Lines and
Personal  Insurance  segments,  now  reported  as Personal  Lines.  As a result,
Property & Casualty is now organized into five  reportable  operating  segments:
the North American underwriting segments of Business Insurance,  Personal Lines,
Specialty  Commercial and Reinsurance;  and the Other Operations segment,  which
includes   substantially  all  of  the  Company's   asbestos  and  environmental
exposures.  "North  American"  includes  the  combined  underwriting  results of
Business  Insurance,   Personal  Lines,  Specialty  Commercial  and  Reinsurance
underwriting segments along with income and expense items not directly allocated
to these segments, such as net investment income, net realized capital gains and
losses, other expenses including interest, and income taxes.

The measure of profit or loss used by The  Hartford's  management  in evaluating
performance  is operating  income,  except for its North  American  underwriting
segments,  which are evaluated by The Hartford's management primarily based upon
underwriting  results.  While not considered segments,  the Company also reports
and evaluates  operating income results for Life,  Property & Casualty and North
American.  Property & Casualty includes  operating income for North American and
the Other Operations segment.

Certain  transactions  between  segments  occur  during the year that  primarily
relate to tax settlements, insurance coverage, expense reimbursements,  services
provided and capital  contributions.  Certain  reinsurance  stop loss agreements
exist between the segments which specify that one segment will reimburse another
for losses  incurred in excess of a predetermined  limit.  Also, one segment may
purchase  group annuity  contracts  from another to fund pension costs and claim
annuities  to  settle  casualty  claims.  In  addition,   certain   intersegment
transactions  occur in Life.  These  transactions  include  interest  income  on
allocated  surplus and the allocation of certain net realized  capital gains and
losses  through net investment  income,  utilizing the duration of the segment's
investment portfolios.

                                     - 25 -

The  following is a summary of net income and  operating  income for each of the

LIFE
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Life  provides  investment  and  retirement  products such as variable and fixed
annuities;  mutual funds and retirement plan services;  individual and corporate
owned life insurance;  and group benefit products,  such as group life and group
disability insurance.

Life derives its revenues  principally  from:  (a) fee income,  including  asset
management  fees on separate  account and mutual fund assets and  mortality  and
expense fees, as well as cost of insurance charges;  (b) fully insured premiums;
(c) certain other fees; and (d) net investment income on general account assets.
Asset  management  fees and mortality  and expense fees are primarily  generated
from separate  account assets,  which are deposited with the Company through the
sale of variable  annuity,  variable  life  products and mutual  funds.  Cost of
insurance charges are assessed on the net amount at risk for investment-oriented
life insurance products. Premium revenues are derived primarily from the sale of
group life and group disability insurance products.

Life's expenses  essentially  consist of interest  credited to  policyholders on
general  account   liabilities,   insurance  benefits  provided,   dividends  to
policyholders,  costs of selling and servicing the various  products  offered by
the Company and other general business expenses.

Life's  profitability  depends largely on the amount of assets under management,
the level of fully  insured  premiums,  the  adequacy  of  product  pricing  and
underwriting  discipline,  claims management and operating  efficiencies and its
ability  to earn  target  spreads  between  earned  investment  rates on general
account  assets  and  credited  rates to  customers.  The level of assets  under
management is generally  impacted by equity market  performance,  persistency of
the  in-force  block of  business,  sales  and  other  deposits,  as well as any
acquired blocks of business.




As  discussed  above,  Life  consists  of  the  following  reportable  operating
segments:  Investment  Products,  Individual  Life,  Group Benefits and COLI. In
addition, Life includes in an Other category its international operations, which
are  primarily  located  in Japan and Latin  America,  and  corporate  items not
directly allocated to any of its reportable operating segments.

On April 2, 2001,  The  Hartford  acquired  the United  States  individual  life
insurance,   annuity  and  mutual  fund  businesses  of  Fortis.   (For  further
discussion,  see  "Acquisitions"  in the Capital Resources and Liquidity section
and Note 18(a) of Notes to Consolidated  Financial Statements.) This transaction
was  accounted  for as a  purchase  and,  as such,  the  revenues  and

                                     - 27 -


expenses  generated by this  business from April 2, 2001 forward are included in
Life's consolidated results of operations.

On June 27, 2000,  The Hartford  acquired all of the  outstanding  shares of HLI
that it did not already  own.  (For  additional  information,  see Note 18(a) of
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.)

2002 COMPARED TO 2001 -- Revenues in the Life operation  decreased  $124, or 2%,
primarily  driven by realized capital losses of $317 in 2002 as compared to $133
in 2001.  (See the  Investments  section for further  discussion  of  investment
results and related realized capital losses.)  Additionally,  COLI experienced a
decline in revenues of $127,  or 18%, as a result of the  decrease in  leveraged
COLI  account  values as compared  to a year ago.  However,  the Life  operation
experienced revenue growth across its other operating segments. Revenues related
to the  Investment  Products  segment  increased  $91,  or 4%,  as a  result  of
continued growth related to its institutional investment product business, which
more than offset the decline of $40,  or 3%, in revenues  within the  individual
annuity  operation.  Lower  assets  under  management  due to the decline in the
equity markets are the principal driver of declining revenues for the individual
annuity  operation.  The Group  Benefits  segment  experienced  an  increase  in
revenues of $75, or 3%, as a result of strong sales to new  customers  and solid
persistency within the in-force block of business. Additionally, Individual Life
revenues  increased  by $68,  or 8%, as a result of the Fortis  acquisition  and
increased life insurance in force.

Expenses  increased  $30,  or 1%,  due to a lower  benefit  recorded  related to
favorable  resolution of dividends  received deduction ("DRD") related tax items
(see  also  the  discussion  of DRD  tax  matter  at  Note  16(d)  of  Notes  to
Consolidated Financial  Statements),  an increase in benefits and claims of $37,
or 1%, due  primarily to growth in the Group  Benefits  segment and higher death
benefits in the  Investment  Products  segment,  as a result of the lower equity
markets  and  additional  expenses  related  to the  Fortis  acquisition.  These
increases  were offset by a decrease in income tax expense due to lower  pre-tax
income  as  compared  to a year  ago.  Expenses  increased  $122,  or 6%, in the
Investment   Products  segment,   principally  related  to  the  growth  in  the
institutional  investment  product business and a $31 increase in death benefits
related  to  the  individual  annuity  operation,   as  a  result  of  depressed
contractowner  account values driven by the lower equity  markets.  In addition,
2002 expenses include $11,  after-tax,  of accrued expenses  recorded within the
COLI segment related to the Bancorp litigation. (For a discussion of the Bancorp
litigation,  see Note 16(a) of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.) Also
included in expenses was an after-tax  benefit of $8,  recorded  within "Other",
associated with favorable  development  related to Life's estimated September 11
exposure.

Net  income  and  operating  income  decreased  $128,  or 19%,  and $47,  or 6%,
respectively,  due to the decline in revenues and increase in expenses described
above.  In 2002,  Life  recognized  an $8  after-tax  benefit  due to  favorable
development related to September 11. In 2001, Life recorded a $20 after-tax loss
related  to  September  11.  Excluding  the impact of  September  11, net income
decreased  $156, or 22%, and operating  income  decreased $75, or 9%. Net income
for the Investment  Products segment was down $31, or 7%, as growth in the other
investment products businesses,  particularly institutional investment products,
was more than  offset by the  decline  in  revenues  in the  individual  annuity
operation,  which was negatively impacted by the lower equity markets.  COLI net
income  decreased  $5, or 14%.  Excluding the impact of September 11, COLI's net
income decreased $7, or 18%,  primarily the result of the charge associated with
the  Bancorp  litigation.  The  declines in net income for those  segments  were
partially  offset  by  increases  in net  income  for  the  Group  Benefits  and
Individual  Life  segments.  Group  Benefits  earnings  increased  $22,  or 21%.
Excluding the impact of September 11, Group  Benefits net income  increased $20,
or 19%. The increases  were  principally  driven by ongoing  premium  growth and
stable loss and expense  ratios and improving loss ratios.  Individual  Life net
income increased $12, or 10%.  Excluding the impact of September 11,  Individual
Life's net income increased $9, or 7%, as the result of the Fortis  acquisition.
Net income for Other decreased $126 and operating  income decreased $45, or 62%.
In 2002,  Life recognized an $8 after-tax  benefit due to favorable  development
related to September 11 in Other.  In 2001,  Life recorded a $13 after-tax  loss
related to September 11 in Other.  Excluding  the impact of September  11, Other
net income  decreased  $147 and  operating  income  decreased  $66, or 77%.  The
decline in net income of the Other segment is principally due to higher realized
capitalized  losses and a lower tax benefit recorded in 2002 compared to 2001 as
discussed above.

2001 COMPARED TO 2000 -- Revenues  increased $559, or 9%,  primarily  related to
the growth across each of Life's primary  operating  segments,  particularly the
Individual Life and Group Benefits  segments,  where revenues increased $250, or
39%, and $300, or 14%,  respectively.  The revenue growth in the Individual Life
segment was primarily due to higher earned fee income and net investment  income
resulting from the business  acquired from Fortis.  The Group  Benefits  segment
experienced  higher  earned  premiums due to strong sales and  persistency.  The
Investment Products segment also contributed to the revenue increase as a result
of higher  fee  income  in the  retail  mutual  fund  business  and  higher  net
investment  income  in  the  institutional  business.  Revenues  related  to the
Company's  Individual  Annuity  business were down $46, or 3%,  primarily due to
lower fee income as a result of the lower equity markets in 2001.  Additionally,
COLI revenues were below prior year due to a decrease in variable COLI sales and
the declining block of leveraged COLI business.

Benefits claims and expenses increased $582, or 11%,  primarily  associated with
the growth in Life revenues discussed above.

Net income  increased $110, or 19%, and operating income increased $168, or 27%,
led by the  Individual  Life and  Group  Benefits  segments,  where  net  income
increased  $42, or 53%, and $16, or 18%,  respectively.  In  addition,  the 2001
results include a $130 federal income tax benefit  primarily related to separate
account  investment  activity  and a $20  loss  associated  with the  impact  of
September 11.  Additionally,  2000 results include a benefit of $32 also related
to favorable  tax items.  Excluding  these tax items and the impact of September
11, net income increased $32, or 6%, and operating income increased $90, or 15%,
for the  year  ended  December  31,  2001,  as each of the  Company's  operating
segments experienced growth from the prior year.

                                     - 28 -


- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
INVESTMENT PRODUCTS
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------




The Investment  Products  segment focuses on the savings and retirement needs of
the growing  number of  individuals  who are  preparing  for  retirement or have
already  retired  through the sale of individual  variable and fixed  annuities,
mutual  funds,  retirement  plan  services and other  investment  products.  The
Company is both a leading  writer of  individual  variable  annuities  and a top
seller of individual  variable  annuities through banks in the United States. In
addition,  in 2001 The Hartford Mutual Funds, Inc. reached $12 billion in assets
faster than any other retail-oriented  mutual fund family in history,  according
to Strategic Insight.

2002 COMPARED TO 2001 -- Revenues in the Investment  Products segment  increased
$91, or 4%. These  increases in revenues are  primarily  driven by growth in the
institutional investment product business, where related assets under management
increased  $669,  or 7%, to $9.7 billion as of December  31, 2002.  This revenue
increase  was  partially  offset by lower fee income  related to the  individual
annuity  operation as average  account  values  decreased  from $85.7 billion to
$79.5 billion compared to prior year, primarily due to the lower equity markets.

Expenses  increased $122, or 6%, driven by increases of $84, or 11%, in interest
credited on general account  assets,  $61, or 6%, in commissions and wholesaling
expenses,  and $31 in  individual  annuity  death benefit costs due to the lower
equity markets,  and an increase of $37, or 23%, in operating  expenses incurred
by other  investment  products,  primarily  driven by the mutual fund  business.
Partially  offsetting these increases was a $34, or 8%, decrease in amortization
of deferred policy acquisition costs related to the individual annuity business,
which declined as a result of lower gross profits, driven by the decrease in fee
income and the increase in death benefit costs.

Net income  decreased  $31, or 7%, driven by the continued  lower equity markets
resulting in the decline in revenues in the  individual  annuity  operation  and
increases  in  the  death  benefit  costs  incurred  by the  individual  annuity
operation.  The decrease in individual annuity revenues was significantly offset
by growth in revenues  related to other  investment  products,  particularly the
institutional  investment  product  business.  (For  discussion of the potential
future financial  statement impact of continued declines in the equity market on
the Investment Products segment, see the Capital Markets Risk Management section
under "Market Risk".)

2001 COMPARED TO 2000 -- Revenues in the Investment  Products segment  increased
$126,  or 5%, driven  primarily by other  investment  products.  Fee income from
other investment  products  increased $59, or 21%,  principally due to growth in
Life's mutual fund assets under  management.  Mutual fund assets  increased $5.4
billion,  or 47%, to $16.8 billion as of December 31, 2001,  due to strong sales
and the inclusion of the mutual fund assets acquired from Fortis. Net investment
income from other  investment  products  increased  $113,  or 20%, due mostly to
growth in the institutional business,  where account values were $9.1 billion at
December 31, 2001,  an increase of $1.4  billion,  or 18%,  from a year ago. The
increase in revenues  from other  investment  products was  partially  offset by
individual  annuity  revenues,  which  decreased  $46, or 3%. Fee income and net
investment  income from the  individual  annuity  business  acquired from Fortis
helped to partially  offset lower revenues in the individual  annuity  operation
which was primarily  associated with decreased account values resulting from the
lower equity markets as compared to the prior year.  Individual  annuity account
values at December 31, 2001 were $84.2 billion,  a decrease of $3.1 billion,  or
4%, from December 31, 2000.

Benefits,  claims and expenses  increased $121, or 7%, driven by higher interest
credited and insurance  operating expenses related to other investment  products
consistent with the revenue growth described above. Interest credited related to
other  investment  products  increased  $83, or 18%, while  insurance  operating
expenses  increased $44, or 17%. Also,  individual  annuity  benefits and claims
expenses  increased $35, or 14%,  principally due to the business  acquired from
Fortis and higher death  benefits  resulting  from the lower  equity  markets in
2001.  Individual  annuity's insurance operating costs increased $13, or 4%, due
to the business  acquired from Fortis.  Excluding Fortis,  individual  annuity's
operating expenses decreased $39, or 4%, from prior year, driven by management's
continued focus on maintaining  operating expense levels.  Partially  offsetting
the

                                     - 29 -


increase in benefits,  claims and  insurance  operating  costs was a decrease in
amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs resulting from the lower gross
profits associated with the individual annuity business. In addition, income tax
expense for the twelve months ended  December 31, 2001, was $118, a $45, or 28%,
decrease due to lower pretax operating income and the ongoing tax impact related
to separate account investment activity.

Net income  increased  $39, or 9%. These  increases were driven by the growth in
revenues in other investment  products  described above, the favorable impact of
Fortis  and the lower  effective  tax rate  related  to the  individual  annuity
business.

OUTLOOK

Management  believes the market for retirement  products  continues to expand as
individuals  increasingly  save  and  plan for  retirement.  Demographic  trends
suggest that as the "baby boom" generation matures, a significant portion of the
United States population will allocate a greater  percentage of their disposable
incomes to saving for their retirement years due to uncertainty  surrounding the
Social Security system and increases in average life expectancy.  As this market
grows,  particularly for variable  annuities and mutual funds, new companies are
continually entering the market,  aggressively seeking distribution channels and
pursuing  market share.  One factor which could impact the  Investment  Products
segment is the  President's  2004 budget  proposal.  See Capital  Resources  and
Liquidity section under "Legislative Initiatives" for further discussion of this
proposed legislation.

The  individual  annuity  segment  continues  to be impacted by the lower equity
markets  in  terms  of lower  assets  under  management.  However,  the  Company
experienced  strong  sales of  annuities  which  were  $11.6  billion in 2002 as
compared to $10.0 billion in 2001. Partially contributing to the growth in sales
is The  Hartford's  introduction  of Principal  First,  a guaranteed  withdrawal
benefit rider, which was developed in response to the customers' needs. Based on
VARDS,  the Company had 9.4% market share as of December 31, 2002 as compared to
8.7% at December 31, 2001.  (For  discussion of the potential  future  financial
statement  impact of continued  declines in the equity market on the  Investment
Products segment,  see the Capital Markets Risk Management section under "Equity
Risk".)

Management believes that it has developed and implemented strategies to maintain
and enhance its position as a market leader in the financial  services industry.
For example,  The Hartford  introduced a tax advantaged  college savings product
("529  plan") in early 2002  called  SMART 529.  SMART 529 is a  state-sponsored
education savings program established by the State of West Virginia which offers
an  easy  way  for  both  the  residents  of  West  Virginia  and   out-of-state
participants  to  invest  for  a  college  education.   The  SMART  529  product
complements  HLI's  existing  offering of  investment  products  (mutual  funds,
variable  annuities,  401(k),  457 and  403(b)  plans).  It also  leverages  the
Company's  capabilities in distribution,  service and fund  performance.  In its
first year the SMART 529 product has been well received by many Americans saving
for college.

INDIVIDUAL LIFE
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------




The Individual Life segment provides life insurance solutions to a wide array of
partners to solve the wealth  protection,  accumulation  and  transfer  needs of
their affluent, emerging affluent and business insurance clients.  Additionally,
the Fortis  transaction,  through the addition of a retail broker dealer,  which
has been renamed Woodbury  Financial  Services,  has allowed the Individual Life
segment to increase its reach in the emerging affluent market.

2002 COMPARED TO 2001 -- Revenues in the Individual Life segment  increased $68,
or 8%, primarily  driven by business growth,  including the impact of the Fortis
transaction. However, the Company sold $173 of new business in 2002, as compared
to $228 in 2001.

Expenses  increased $56, or 7%, principally driven by the growth in the business
resulting  from  the  Fortis  acquisition.  In  addition,  mortality  experience
(expressed  as death  claims  as a  percentage  of net  amount at risk) for 2002
increased  as  compared  to the prior  year,  but was in line with  management's
expectations.

Net income  increased $12, or 10%.  Individual Life incurred an after-tax charge
of $3 related to  September  11 in the third  quarter  of 2001.  Excluding  this
charge,  Individual  Life's  earnings  increased  $9, or 7%,  for the year ended
December  31,

                                     - 30 -


2002, due to the contribution to earnings from the Fortis transaction.

2001 COMPARED TO 2000 -- Revenues in the Individual Life segment increased $250,
or  39%,  primarily  due to the  business  acquired  from  Fortis.  Fee  income,
including cost of insurance charges,  increased $180, or 40%, driven principally
by growth in the variable life  business,  where account  values  increased $1.0
billion,  or 35%, and life insurance in-force  increased $28.2 billion,  or 84%,
from 2000.  In  addition,  net  investment  income on general  account  business
(universal life,  interest sensitive whole life and term life) increased $66, or
34%, consistent with the growth in related account values.

Benefits,  claims and expenses  increased  $190, or 36%, due  principally to the
growth in revenues described above.  Although death benefits were higher in 2001
than the prior  year as a result of the  increase  in life  insurance  in-force,
year-to-date  mortality experience (expressed as death claims as a percentage of
net  amount  at risk)  for 2001  was  within  pricing  assumptions.  Net  income
increased  $42, or 53%,  primarily due to the revenue  growth  described  above.
Individual  Life  incurred  an  after-tax  loss of $3 related to  September  11.
Excluding  this loss,  net income  increased  $45, or 57%,  primarily due to the
growth factors described above.

OUTLOOK

Individual  Life sales  continue  to be impacted  by the lower  equity  markets,
uncertainty  surrounding estate tax legislation and aggressive  competition from
universal life  providers.  However,  The  Hartford's  acquisition of the United
States  individual  life  insurance  business of Fortis has  increased its scale
while broadening its distribution capabilities as described above. Additionally,
The  Hartford  continues  to  introduce  new and  enhanced  products,  which are
expected to increase universal life sales.


- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
GROUP BENEFITS
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------



The Hartford is a leading provider of group benefits,  and through this segment,
sells  group  life and group  disability  insurance  as well as other  products,
including  stop  loss and  supplementary  medical  coverages  to  employers  and
employer sponsored plans,  accidental death and  dismemberment,  travel accident
and other special risk coverages to employers and associations. The Company also
offers disability underwriting,  administration,  claims processing services and
reinsurance to other insurers and self-funded employer plans.

2002 COMPARED TO 2001 -- Revenues in the Group Benefits  segment  increased $75,
or 3%, and excluding buyouts,  increased $159, or 7%, driven primarily by growth
in premiums,  which  increased  $66, or 3%. The growth in premiums was due to an
increase of $281,  or 14%, in fully  insured  ongoing  premiums,  as a result of
steady  persistency  and pricing  actions on the in-force  block of business and
strong  sales to new  customers.  Offsetting  this  increase  was a decrease  in
military Medicare supplement premiums of $131 resulting from federal legislation
effective  in the fourth  quarter of 2001.  This  legislation  provides  retired
military  officers age 65 and older with full medical  insurance paid for by the
government,   eliminating   the  need   for   Medicare   supplement   insurance.
Additionally,  premium revenues for 2002 were offset by an $84 decrease in total
buyouts.  Buyouts  involve the  acquisition  of claim  liabilities  from another
carrier  for a  purchase  price  calculated  to  cover  the  run  off  of  those
liabilities plus  administration  expenses and profit.  Due to the nature of the
buyout market place, the  predictability of buyout premiums is uncertain.  Fully
insured ongoing sales were $597, an increase of $66, or 12%.

Expenses increased $53, or 2%, and excluding buyouts, increased $137, or 6%. The
increase  in  expenses  is  consistent  with the growth in  revenues  previously
described.  Benefits and claims expenses,  excluding buyouts,  increased $88, or
5%. The segment's loss ratio (defined as benefits,  claims and claim  adjustment
expenses  as a  percentage  of  premiums  and  other  considerations,  excluding
buyouts) was 81% down slightly from 82% in 2001.  Insurance  operating costs and
other expenses  increased $43, or 9%, due to the fully insured  ongoing  premium
growth previously described and continued investments in technology and service.
The segment's  expense ratio of insurance  operating costs and other expenses to
premiums and other  considerations was approximately 23%,  consistent with prior
year.

Net income increased $22, or 21%. Group Benefits incurred an after-tax charge of
$2 related to September 11 in the third quarter of 2001.  Excluding this charge,
earnings increased $20, or 19%, for the year ended December 31, 2002 compared to
a year ago. The increase in earnings is due to the increase in premium  revenues
and  favorable  loss costs,  which was partially  offset by increased  insurance
operating costs and other expenses as previously described.

2001 COMPARED TO 2000 -- Revenues in the Group Benefits segment  increased $300,
or 14%,  driven  primarily by growth in

                                     - 31 -


premiums,  which increased $278, or 14%, due to solid  persistency and increased
premium rates related to the in-force block of business, and strong sales to new
customers. Fully insured ongoing sales for the year ended December 31, 2001 were
$531, an increase of $85, or 19%, compared to 2000. Additionally, net investment
income  increased  $22,  or  10%,  due to the  overall  growth  in the  in-force
business.

Total benefits,  claims and expenses increased $279, or 13%, driven primarily by
higher  benefits and claims,  which  increased $231, or 14%. These increases are
consistent with the growth in the business described above as the loss ratio has
remained  relatively  consistent  compared to the 2000 loss ratio.  In addition,
expenses  other than  benefits  and claims  increased  $48, or 11%, for the year
ended December 31, 2001, also consistent with the overall growth in the segment.

Net  income  increased  $16,  or 18%,  driven  by  overall  revenue  growth  and
consistent loss and expense ratios as compared to the prior year. Group Benefits
incurred an after-tax  loss of $2 related to September 11;  excluding this loss,
net income increased $18, or 20%.

OUTLOOK

Employees  continue to look to the  workplace  for a broader and ever  expanding
array of insurance  products.  As employers design benefit strategies to attract
and retain employees while attempting to control their benefit costs, management
believes that the need the Group  Benefits  segment's  products will continue to
expand. This, combined with the significant number of employees who currently do
not have coverage or adequate levels of coverage,  creates unique  opportunities
for  the  Group  Benefits  segment's  products  and  services.   Current  market
conditions,  including  low  interest  rates,  rising  medical  costs  and  cost
containment pressure on employers,  create a challenging  business  environment.
However,  the  Company's  strength  in claim and risk  management,  service  and
distribution will enable the Group Benefits segment to continue to capitalize on
market opportunities despite the challenging business environment.


- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CORPORATE OWNED LIFE INSURANCE (COLI)
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------



The  Hartford is a leader in the COLI  market,  which  includes  life  insurance
policies purchased by a company on the lives of its employees,  with the company
or a trust sponsored by the company named as beneficiary under the policy. Until
passage of the  Health  Insurance  Portability  and  Accountability  Act of 1996
("HIPAA"), the Company sold two principal types of COLI business:  leveraged and
variable products. Leveraged COLI is a fixed premium life insurance policy owned
by a  company  or  a  trust  sponsored  by  a  company.  HIPAA  phased  out  the
deductibility  of interest on policy loans under  leveraged COLI through the end
of 1998, virtually  eliminating all future sales of this product.  Variable COLI
continues to be a product used by  employers to fund  non-qualified  benefits or
other postemployment benefit liabilities.

2002 COMPARED TO 2001 -- COLI revenues decreased $127, or 18%, primarily related
to lower net investment  and fee income due to the declining  block of leveraged
COLI,  where related  account  values  declined by $994, or 23%. Net  investment
income decreased $76, or 22%, while fee income decreased $50, or 14%.

Expenses  decreased  $122,  or 18%,  which  is  relatively  consistent  with the
decrease in revenues described above. However, the decrease was partially offset
by $11,  after-tax,  in  accrued  litigation  expenses  related  to the  Bancorp
dispute. (For a discussion of the Bancorp litigation, see Note 16(a) of Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements.)

Net income  decreased  $5, or 14%,  compared  to prior  year.  COLI  incurred an
after-tax  charge of $2 related to  September  11 in the third  quarter of 2001.
Excluding the impact of September  11,  COLI's net income  decreased $7, or 18%,
principally  due to the $11 after-tax  expense  accrued in  connection  with the
Bancorp litigation.

2001 COMPARED TO 2000 -- COLI revenues decreased $48, or 6%, mostly due to lower
fee income and net investment income. Fee income and other decreased $34, or 8%,
due to a decline in variable  COLI sales and deposits  which were  approximately
$1.5  billion in 2001 as  compared to $2.9  billion in 2000.  In  addition,  net
investment  income  decreased  $14, or 4%, due primarily to lower interest rates
and the decline in leveraged COLI account values.

Benefits,  claims and expenses  decreased  $50, or 7%,  directly  related to the
decrease in revenue discussed above.

                                     - 32 -


Net income  increased $3, or 9%, primarily due to the overall growth in variable
COLI  business  and  earnings   associated  with  the  leveraged  COLI  business
recaptured in 1998. COLI incurred an after-tax charge of $2 related to September
11; excluding this charge, net income increased $5, or 15%.

OUTLOOK

The focus of this  segment is variable  COLI,  which  continues  to be a product
generally   used  by   employers  to  fund   non-qualified   benefits  or  other
postemployment  benefit  liabilities.  The  leveraged  COLI  product has been an
important  contributor to The Hartford's  profitability in recent years and will
continue  to  contribute  to the  profitability  of The  Hartford in the future,
although  the level of profit has  declined in 2002,  as compared to 2001.  COLI
continues to be subject to a changing  legislative  and  regulatory  environment
that could have a material adverse effect on its business.

PROPERTY & CASUALTY
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------



2002 COMPARED TO 2001 -- Net income  increased  $584  primarily due to after-tax
losses related to September 11 of $420 in 2001, an increase in operating  income
as discussed below and a decrease in net realized capital losses.

2001 COMPARED TO 2000 -- Net income  decreased  $609  primarily due to after-tax
losses  related to  September 11 of $420,  an increase in net  realized  capital
losses, and a decrease in operating income as discussed below.

In January 2002,  Property & Casualty integrated its Affinity Personal Lines and
Personal  Insurance  segments,  now  reported  as Personal  Lines.  As a result,
Property & Casualty is now organized into five  reportable  operating  segments:
the North

                                     - 33 -


American underwriting segments of Business Insurance,  Personal Lines, Specialty
Commercial and  Reinsurance;  and the Other Operations  segment,  which includes
substantially all of the Company's  asbestos and environmental  exposures.  Also
reported  within  Property & Casualty  is North  American,  which  includes  the
combined  underwriting results of the North American underwriting segments along
with income and expense items not directly allocated to these segments,  such as
net investment  income,  net realized  capital gains and losses,  other expenses
including interest and income taxes.

RATIOS

The previous  table and the following  segment  discussions  for the years ended
December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000 include various  operating  ratios.  Management
believes that these ratios are useful in understanding  the underlying trends in
The Hartford's current business.  However, these measures should only be used in
conjunction  with,  and  not in  lieu  of,  underwriting  income  and may not be
comparable to other performance measures used by the Company's competitors.  The
"loss  ratio" is the  ratio of claims  expense  (exclusive  of claim  adjustment
expenses) to earned premiums. The "loss adjustment expense ratio" represents the
ratio of claim adjustment  expenses to earned  premiums.  The "expense ratio" is
the ratio of statutory underwriting expenses  (commissions;  taxes, licenses and
fees;  as  well  as  other  underwriting  expenses)  to  written  premiums.  The
"policyholder  dividend ratio" is the ratio of policyholder  dividends to earned
premiums. The "combined ratio" is the sum of the loss ratio, the loss adjustment
expense ratio,  the expense ratio and the  policyholder  dividend  ratio.  These
ratios are relative  measurements  that  describe for every $100 of net premiums
earned or written, the cost of losses and statutory expenses,  respectively. The
combined  ratio  presents  the  total  cost per $100 of  premium  production.  A
combined  ratio below 100  demonstrates  underwriting  profit;  a combined ratio
above 100  demonstrates  underwriting  losses.  GAAP combined ratios differ from
statutory  combined  ratios  primarily due to the deferral and  amortization  of
certain  expenses for GAAP  reporting  purposes and the use of earned premium in
the expense ratio rather than written premium.

The following is a summary of Property & Casualty  operating income,  after-tax.
Operating  income  represents   after-tax   operating  results   excluding,   as
applicable,  net realized capital gains or losses,  losses from early retirement
of debt, the cumulative effect of accounting changes and restructuring  charges.
Operating income is a performance measure used by The Hartford in the management
of its operations.  Management believes that this performance measure delineates
the results of The Hartford's  ongoing  businesses in a manner that allows for a
better understanding of the underlying trends in the Company's current business.




Underwriting  results are discussed in each of the Business Insurance,  Personal
Lines,  Specialty  Commercial and Reinsurance  segment sections.  Net investment
income  and  net  realized  capital  gains  and  losses  are  discussed  in  the
Investments  section.  (For a further  discussion of September 11, see Note 2 of
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.)

2002 COMPARED TO 2001 -- Operating  income,  excluding the after-tax $420 impact
of September 11, increased $117, or 29%, primarily due to improved  underwriting
results across each of the North American underwriting segments, particularly in
Specialty  Commercial and Reinsurance.  Partially offsetting the improvement was
an increase in other expenses primarily as a result of an increase in e-business
research and development  expenses and certain employee  benefits costs, as well
as  expenses  incurred  related  to the  transfer  of the  Company's  New Jersey
personal   lines  agency  auto  business  to  Palisades   Safety  and  Insurance
Association and Palisades Insurance Co.

2001 COMPARED TO 2000 -- Operating  income,  excluding the after-tax $420 impact
of  September  11,  decreased  $23,  or 5%.  Earned  premium  growth in Business
Insurance  due to price  increases,  strong new  business  growth  and  improved
premium renewal retention,  as well as an increase in North American  investment
income,  was offset by  increased  losses in the  personal  automobile  lines of
business  and in  Reinsurance.  A  decrease  in  underwriting  results  of  $16,
after-tax,  related to Enron  Corporation  and lower income  resulting  from the
sales of international subsidiaries also contributed to the decrease.

RESERVES

As  discussed  in Notes  1(l),  7 and 16(b) of Notes to  Consolidated  Financial
Statements  and in the Critical  Accounting  Estimates  section,  reserving  for
property and casualty losses is an estimation process. As additional  experience
and other  relevant  claim data become  available,  reserve  levels are adjusted
accordingly.  Such  adjustments of reserves  related to claims incurred in prior
years are a natural occurrence in the loss reserving process and are referred to
as "reserve development".  Reserve development that increases previous estimates
of ultimate cost is called "reserve  strengthening".  Reserve

                                     - 34 -


development  that  decreases  previous  estimates  of  ultimate  cost is  called
"reserve releases".  Reserve development can influence the comparability of year
over year  underwriting  results and are set forth in the  paragraphs and tables
that follow.

Reserve  strengthening  in the  Business  Insurance  segment  for the year ended
December 31, 2002 was not  significant.  In Personal Lines,  prior accident year
loss and loss adjustment expenses for non-standard auto were strengthened due to
heavier than expected frequency, severity and litigation rates on prior accident
years. In addition, the prior accident year provision was increased modestly for
mold losses.  Virtually all of the strengthening in Specialty  Commercial is due
to deductible  workers'  compensation  losses on a few large  accounts.  Reserve
strengthening  in the Reinsurance  segment  occurred  across  multiple  accident
years,  primarily 1997 through 2000, and across several lines of business.  High
reported  losses from ceding  companies have persisted  throughout 2002 and loss
ratios have been revised upward.  Virtually all of the reserve  strengthening in
the Other  Operations  segment  related to  asbestos.  There was little  reserve
strengthening  or  weakening  by  segment  in 2001 with the  exception  of Other
Operations,  where the strengthening was related almost entirely to non-asbestos
and environmental exposures. (For further discussion of reserve activity related
to asbestos and environmental, see the Other Operations section of the MD&A.)

A rollforward of liabilities for unpaid claims and claim adjustment  expenses by
segment for Property & Casualty follows:






                                     - 35 -



- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
BUSINESS INSURANCE
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------



Business Insurance provides standard commercial  insurance coverage to small and
middle market commercial businesses primarily throughout the United States. This
segment offers workers' compensation,  property, automobile, liability, umbrella
and marine coverages.  The Business  Insurance segment also provides  commercial
risk management products and services.

2002 COMPARED TO 2001 -- Business  Insurance  achieved written premium growth of
$541  (including $15 of reinsurance  cessions  related to September 11), or 19%,
due to strong growth in both middle market and small commercial. The increase in
middle  market  of $295,  or 21%,  was due  primarily  to  double-digit  pricing
increases as well as continued  strong new business  growth and premium  renewal
retention.  Small  commercial  increased $231, or 16%,  reflecting  double-digit
written pricing increases, particularly in the property line of business.

Business  Insurance earned premiums increased $496 (including $15 of reinsurance
cessions  related to September  11), or 19%, due to strong 2002 and 2001 written
pricing increases impacting 2002 earned premiums.  Middle market increased $260,
or 20%, and small  commercial  increased $221, or 16%,  reflecting  double-digit
earned pricing increases.

Underwriting  results improved $286 (including $245 of underwriting loss related
to September 11 in 2001), with a corresponding 10.9 point decrease  (including a
9.3 point impact related to September 11) in the combined ratio. The improvement
in  underwriting  results  and  combined  ratio,  excluding  September  11,  was
primarily due to double-digit  earned pricing  increases and minimal loss costs.
Business  Insurance  continues to benefit from  favorable  frequency loss costs.
While  2002  catastrophe  losses  are in line  with  prior  year,  the  level of
catastrophes  is below  management  expectations.  In

                                     - 36 -


addition,  the beneficial effects of strong pricing on the underwriting  expense
ratio have been  offset by an increase in taxes,  licenses  and fees rates,  and
increased technology spending.

2001  COMPARED TO 2000 -- Written  premiums  increased  $466  (including  $15 of
reinsurance  cessions  related to September 11), or 19%, driven by strong growth
in small commercial and middle market.  Small commercial increased $278, or 24%,
as a result of written pricing  increases,  strong premium renewal retention and
the success of product,  marketing,  technology and service growth  initiatives.
The increase in middle  market of $203,  or 16%, was  attributable  primarily to
double-digit pricing increases and improved premium renewal retention as well as
strong new business growth.

Earned premiums increased $332 (including $15 of reinsurance cessions related to
September  11), or 14%, due  primarily to strong earned  premium  growth in both
small commercial and middle market.  Small commercial increased $252, or 23%, as
a result of  mid-single  digit earned  pricing  increases,  while middle  market
achieved double-digit earned pricing increases, driving $95, or 8% growth.

Underwriting results decreased $192 (including $245 of underwriting loss related
to September 11) with a corresponding 6.5 point increase  (including a 9.3 point
impact related to September 11) in the combined  ratio.  Excluding the impact of
September 11, the improvement in underwriting results and the combined ratio was
primarily due to strong pricing and decreased frequency loss costs as well as an
improved  expense  ratio.  The  favorable  expense  ratio was the result of 2001
benefits from the field office  reorganization and reorganization  costs in 2000
not recurring in 2001.

OUTLOOK

Firming  market  conditions  in the standard  commercial  sector are expected to
continue  in  2003,  although  price  competition  within  many  markets  of the
commercial  industry  will remain a  challenge.  Passage of the  Terrorism  Risk
Insurance Act of 2002  alleviates some of the economic  uncertainty  surrounding
the industry in the event of future terrorist attacks.  (For further discussion,
see Capital  Resources and Liquidity section under "Terrorism Risk Insurance Act
of 2002".)  Management  expects the  Business  Insurance  segment to continue to
deliver positive results in 2003 despite an expected return to a normal level of
catastrophes.   Significant   growth  in  small  commercial  and  middle  market
businesses  is expected to be  achieved,  in part,  due to  continued  strategic
actions being  implemented.  This includes providing a complete product solution
for agents and customers,  expanding non-traditional  distribution alternatives,
executing geographic market share strategies and developing technology solutions
that deliver  superior  business tools to The  Hartford's  agents and alliances.
Continued  pricing  and  underwriting  actions  are  expected to have a positive
impact on the segment's overall profitability in 2003.


- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
PERSONAL LINES
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------



Personal  Lines  provides   automobile,   homeowners'  and  home-based  business
coverages  to the  members  of AARP  through a direct  marketing  operation;  to
individuals who prefer local agent involvement  through a network of independent
agents  in  the  standard   personal  lines  market   ("Standard")  and  in  the
non-standard  automobile market through the Company's Omni Insurance Group, Inc.
("Omni")  subsidiary.  Personal  Lines also operates a member contact center for
health  insurance  products  offered  through  AARP's Health Care  Options.  The
Hartford's  exclusive licensing  arrangement with AARP, which was renewed during
the fourth quarter of 2001,  continues  through  January 1, 2010 for automobile,
homeowners and home-based business.  The Health Care Options agreement continues
through 2007.

2002 COMPARED TO 2001 -- Personal Lines written premiums  increased $190, or 7%,
primarily driven by growth in AARP, partially offset by a reduction in Standard.
AARP increased $217, or 13%,  primarily as a result of written pricing increases
and improved  premium  renewal  retention.  Standard  decreased  $27, or 3%, due
primarily to the conversion to six-month policies in certain states.

                                     - 37 -


Earned  premiums  increased  $237,  or 9%, due  primarily  to growth in AARP and
Standard.  AARP increased  $187, or 12%, and Standard  increased $30, or 4%, due
primarily to earned pricing increases.

Underwriting  results improved $41 (including $9 of underwriting loss related to
September 11), with a  corresponding  2.3 point decrease  (including a 0.3 point
impact related to September 11) in the combined ratio.  While automobile results
improved  due to  favorable  frequency  loss  costs,  the line of  business  was
negatively  impacted by the increasing severity of automobile claims as a result
of medical  inflation  and higher  repair  costs.  The  underwriting  experience
relating to  homeowners  has  remained  favorable  due to improved  frequency of
claims, despite an increase in the severity of individual homeowners' claims. An
improvement in the underwriting expense ratio,  primarily due to written pricing
increases and prudent  expense  management,  resulted in a 1.0 point decrease in
the expense ratio over the prior year.

2001  COMPARED TO 2000 -- Written  premiums  increased  $213,  or 8%,  driven by
growth in both the AARP  program and  Standard.  AARP  increased  primarily as a
result of strong  new  business  growth and  continued  steady  premium  renewal
retention.  Written  premium  growth in the standard  automobile  and homeowners
lines  was  primarily  due to  pricing  increases  and  strong  premium  renewal
retention.

Earned  premiums  increased  $200, or 8%, driven by growth in AARP and Standard.
AARP increased $113, or 8%, and Standard  increased $50, or 7%, due primarily to
earned pricing increases.

Underwriting results decreased $89 (including $9 of underwriting loss related to
September 11), with a  corresponding  3.0 point increase  (including a 0.3 point
impact related to September 11) in the combined ratio.  Higher automobile losses
continue to adversely  impact  underwriting  results and the combined  ratio. In
addition, the loss adjustment expense ratio increased,  primarily as a result of
higher losses and increased  litigation costs.  Although  underwriting  expenses
increased,  primarily  due to  increased  written  premiums,  the expense  ratio
improved  as  compared  to the  prior  year,  primarily  as a  result  of  lower
commissions and prudent expense management.

OUTLOOK

While the personal lines industry operating fundamentals are expected to improve
in  2003,  the  market  will  continue  to face  significant  challenges.  Price
increases in automobile and  homeowners  are expected to continue,  but industry
rates may remain inadequate.  State regulatory constraints may prevent companies
from obtaining the necessary rates.  Regulatory requirements applying to premium
rates vary from state to state, and, in most states,  rates are subject to prior
regulatory approval. Industry loss costs are expected to continue to increase in
2003, but pricing is expected to exceed loss cost inflation.  The  deterioration
in loss performance since 2000 has been driven primarily by severity loss costs.
Issues  surrounding  mold and  medical  inflation  may  continue  to impact loss
performance in Personal Lines.

The Personal  Lines  segment is focused on managing  premium  growth to optimize
earnings,  while  investing  to enhance its product  and  technology  platforms.
Improved  financial  results in 2003 are expected for the Personal Lines segment
as a result of continuing  state-driven pricing and underwriting  actions,  even
though  catastrophes  are expected to return to a normal level.  Personal Lines'
product breadth,  channel diversity and technology position this segment to deal
effectively with the market risks that face the personal lines industry.


- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SPECIALTY COMMERCIAL
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------



                                     - 38 -


Specialty  Commercial offers a variety of customized insurance products and risk
management services. The segment provides standard commercial insurance products
including  workers'   compensation,   automobile  and  liability   coverages  to
large-sized  companies.  Specialty  Commercial also provides bond,  professional
liability,  specialty  casualty  and  agricultural  coverages,  as  well as core
property and excess and surplus lines coverages not normally written by standard
lines insurers.  Alternative  markets,  within  Specialty  Commercial,  provides
insurance products and services primarily to captive insurance companies,  pools
and  self-insurance  groups. In addition,  Specialty  Commercial  provides third
party administrator  services for claims  administration,  integrated  benefits,
loss control and performance measurement through Specialty Risk Services.

2002 COMPARED TO 2001 -- Specialty  Commercial  written premiums  increased $373
(including  $7 of  reinsurance  cessions  related  to  September  11),  or  38%,
primarily driven by the property,  specialty casualty and professional liability
lines of  business.  Written  premiums  for property  grew $121,  or 43%,  while
specialty  casualty grew $114, or 55%, both primarily due to  significant  price
increases and new business growth reflecting an improving operating environment.
Professional   liability  written  premiums  grew  $71,  or  42%,  also  due  to
significant price increases.

Earned premiums increased $200 (including $7 of reinsurance  cessions related to
September  11), or 20%,  primarily  driven by robust  earned  premium  growth in
property of $65, or 23%,  specialty  casualty of $73, or 35%,  and  professional
liability of $83, or 71%, as a result of double-digit earned pricing increases.

Underwriting  results improved $239 (including $167 of underwriting loss related
to September 11), with a  corresponding  26.7 point  decrease  (including a 16.5
point impact related to September 11) in the combined ratio.  The improvement in
underwriting  results and combined ratio,  excluding September 11, was primarily
due  to  favorable  property,  specialty  casualty  and  professional  liability
results,  as a result of the favorable  pricing  environment.  Increased  losses
incurred  in  agriculture,  due to the  Midwest  drought;  the  risk  management
division,  due  to  deductible  workers'  compensation  losses  on a  few  large
accounts;  and bond  partially  mitigated  the  improvement.  In  addition,  the
underwriting  expense  ratio  improved  primarily  due to pricing  increases and
prudent expense  management.  Lower  catastrophes,  primarily as a result of the
Seattle  earthquake  in the  first  quarter  of 2001,  also  contributed  to the
improvement in underwriting results.

2001  COMPARED  TO 2000 --  Written  premiums  decreased  $91  (including  $7 of
reinsurance  cessions  related  to  September  11),  or 8%,  primarily  due to a
decrease in written  premiums from sold or exited  business  lines which include
farm,  public  entity and  Canada.  Partially  offsetting  the  decrease  was an
increase  in  written  premiums  due to The  Hartford's  purchase,  in the third
quarter of 2000, of the in-force,  new and renewal financial  products business,
as well as the majority of the excess and surplus  lines  business,  of Reliance
Group Holdings,  Inc. ("Reliance"),  which resulted in $60 of additional written
premiums as compared with 2000.

Earned premiums  declined $12 (including $7 of reinsurance  cessions  related to
September  11), or 1%,  primarily due to a decrease in earned  premiums from the
sold or exited  business  lines  referred  to above.  Partially  offsetting  the
decrease was an increase in earned  premiums due to The  Hartford's  purchase of
the  financial  products  and excess and surplus  lines  businesses  of Reliance
mentioned above, which resulted in $74 of additional earned premiums as compared
with 2000.

Underwriting results decreased $159 (including $167 of underwriting loss related
to September 11), with a  corresponding  17.7 point  increase  (including a 16.5
point impact  related to  September  11) in the combined  ratio.  Excluding  the
impact of September 11, underwriting results improved despite an increase in the
combined  ratio.  The improved  underwriting  results were primarily a result of
favorable  results  in the  property  lines of  business  and lower  losses  and
underwriting  expenses  from  the  sold  or  exited  business  lines.  Partially
offsetting  the  improvement  were  deteriorating  underwriting  results in risk
management and a decrease in underwriting  results related to Enron Corporation.
The increase in the combined  ratio was  primarily due to an increase in the net
commissions  as  well  as  additional  taxes,  licenses  and  fees  in the  risk
management and  professional  liability  lines of business.  The increase in the
commission ratio was primarily a result of lower ceding commissions.

OUTLOOK

Specialty Commercial is made up of a diverse group of businesses that are unique
to commercial lines. Each line of business operates  independently  with its own
set of  business  objectives  and  focuses on the  operational  dynamics  of its
specific industry.  These businesses,  while somewhat interrelated,  each have a
unique business model and operating cycle.  Firming market conditions in most of
the specialty  commercial  sectors are expected to continue in 2003.  Passage of
the  Terrorism  Risk  Insurance  Act of 2002  alleviates  some  of the  economic
uncertainty  surrounding the industry in the event of future terrorist  attacks.
(For further  discussion,  see the Capital Resources and Liquidity section under
"Terrorism  Risk Insurance Act of 2002".)  Strong  written  pricing in 2002 will
contribute to earned premium growth expected in 2003.  Management  believes that
continued  strategic  actions being taken,  which include focusing on maximizing
growth  in  the  segment's  most  profitable  lines;  providing  innovative  new
products;  expanding  non-traditional  distribution  alternatives;  and  further
leveraging  underwriting discipline and capabilities will continue to enable the
segment to capitalize on an improved marketplace.

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
REINSURANCE
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------




The  Reinsurance   segment  offers  a  full  range  of  treaty  and  facultative
reinsurance  products  including  property,  casualty,  catastrophe,  marine and
alternative risk transfer which includes  non-traditional  reinsurance  products
such as multi-year property  catastrophe  treaties,  aggregate of excess of loss
agreements and quota share treaties with event or aggregate loss ratio caps. The
segment assumes  insurance from other insurers,  primarily  through  reinsurance
brokers, but also through direct channels and pools in the worldwide reinsurance
market.

2002 COMPARED TO 2001 -- Reinsurance  written premiums decreased $146 (including
$69 of  reinsurance  cessions  related  to  September  11),  or 17%,  and earned
premiums  decreased $138 (including $69 related to September 11), or 16%, due to
the exclusion of the exited international  business,  which in January 2002, was
transferred to Other Operations and a reduction in the Alternative Risk Transfer
("ART") line of business.  Written and earned  premiums  from the  international
business  in 2001 were $131 and  $136,  respectively.  ART  written  and  earned
premiums decreased $97, or 53%, and $94, or 51%, respectively,  due primarily to
the expiration of a non-recurring  loss portfolio  reinsurance  contract and the
non-renewal  of a quota share  treaty with one ceding  company.  Excluding  ART,
international and the impact of September 11, written premiums increased $13, or
2%, and earned  premiums  increased  $23, or 4%, due  primarily  to  significant
pricing increases as a result of continued market firming,  substantially offset
by premium reductions due to underwriting requirements to maintain profitability
targets.

Underwriting  results improved $316 (including $226 of underwriting loss related
to September 11), with a  corresponding  36.8 point  decrease  (including a 27.8
point impact related to September 11) in the combined ratio.  The improvement in
underwriting  results and combined ratio,  excluding September 11, was primarily
due to underwriting initiatives including a shift to excess of loss policies and
increased   property  business  mix,  as  well  as  the  exit  from  nearly  all
international  lines,  an  intense  focus on  returns  and  lower  catastrophes.
Underwriting  results and the combined ratio were negatively impacted by adverse
loss development on prior underwriting years.

2001  COMPARED  TO 2000 -- Written  premiums  increased  $23  (including  $69 of
reinsurance  cessions  related to  September  11),  or 3%,  and earned  premiums
increased $42 (including  $69 related to September 11), or 5%,  primarily due to
growth in the ART line of business.  ART written and earned  premiums  increased
$91, or 100%, and $98, or 111%, respectively,  driven primarily by a significant
first quarter ART transaction. The achievement of double-digit pricing increases
in traditional reinsurance was offset by the termination of business that failed
to meet profitability targets.

Underwriting results decreased $302 (including $226 of underwriting loss related
to September 11), with a  corresponding  35.0 point  increase  (including a 27.8
point impact related to September 11) in the combined ratio. Excluding September
11, the  decrease  in  underwriting  results and  corresponding  increase in the
combined  ratio  were  primarily  attributable  to reserve  development  in 2001
compared to 2000.

OUTLOOK

The property and casualty  reinsurance market remains extremely  competitive and
stressed.  The  pricing  environment  continued  to improve  in 2002,  and it is
anticipated by management  that favorable rates and terms will continue in 2003.
Reserve deficiencies,  low investment yields and poor historical performance are
driving a renewed focus on profitability. The marketplace is also experiencing a
flight to quality as customers pay more for reinsurance. Additionally, terrorism
remains a key  underwriting  issue.  Terrorism losses incurred by reinsurers are
not covered by the Terrorism  Risk  Insurance Act of 2002.  The  dislocation  of
certain broker market competitors continues in the aftermath of September 11. In
addition,  some companies are raising capital,  while others are reviewing their
strategic  options.  New Bermuda  companies are emerging with a greater share of
the overall  market.  This will  continue to put pressure on industry  rates and
terms.

OTHER OPERATIONS (INCLUDING ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS)
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------



The  Other  Operations  segment  includes  operations  that  are  under a single
management structure,  Heritage Holdings,  that was finalized in late 2001 to be
responsible for two related activities.  The first activity is the management of
certain  subsidiaries  and  operations  of The Hartford  that have  discontinued
writing new business. The second is the management of claims (and the associated
reserves) related to asbestos and environmental exposures.

The companies in this segment  which are not writing new business  include First
State  Insurance  Company and two  affiliated  subsidiaries,  located in Boston,
Massachusetts; Heritage Reinsurance Company, Ltd. ("Heritage Re"), headquartered
in Bermuda;  and Excess Insurance Company,  Ltd., located in the United Kingdom.
Each of these  companies  is  primarily  focused on managing  claims,  resolving
disputes  and  collecting  reinsurance  proceeds,  related  largely to  business
underwritten and reinsured in 1985 and prior years.  While the business that was
written in these units on either a direct or  reinsurance  basis  spanned a wide
variety of insurance and reinsurance  policies and coverages,  a significant and
increasing  proportion of current and future claims activity  arising from these
businesses  relates  to  environmental  and,  to  a  greater  extent,   asbestos
exposures.  Other  Operations  also  includes  the  results  of  The  Hartford's
international  property-casualty  businesses  (substantially  all of which  were
disposed  of  in  a  series  of   transactions   concluding  in  2001)  and  the
international  businesses  of the  Reinsurance  segment,  exited  in the  fourth
quarter of 2001. (For further discussion of the restructuring, see Note 18(c) of
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.)

In 2001, The Hartford consolidated  management and claims handling of all of its
asbestos and  environmental  exposures  under the Other  Operations'  management
structure. This action was taken to maximize The Hartford's management expertise
in this area. As part of this  organizational  change, the Company  consolidated
substantially all of its asbestos and environmental loss reserves into one legal
entity,  Heritage Re, within Other Operations through  intercompany  reinsurance
agreements. These reinsurance agreements ceded $602 of the then carried reserves
(net of reinsurance),  primarily related to asbestos and environmental exposures
from 1985 and prior, from the Specialty Commercial segment to Other Operations.

In  September  2001,  The  Hartford  entered  into  an  agreement  to  sell  its
Singapore-based  Hartford  Insurance  Company  (Singapore),   Ltd.  The  Company
recorded a net realized capital loss of $9 after-tax  related to the sale, which
was  recorded in the 2001  investment  results of North  American.  The sale was
completed in January 2002.

On  February  8,  2001,  The  Hartford  completed  the  sale of its  Spain-based
subsidiary,  Hartford  Seguros.  The Hartford received $29, before costs of sale
and recorded a $16 after-tax net realized  capital loss that was reported in the
2001 investment results of North American.

On December 22, 2000, The Hartford  completed the sale of its  Netherlands-based
Zwolsche  Algemeene N.V.  ("Zwolsche")  subsidiary  located in the  Netherlands,
Belgium and  Luxembourg.  The Hartford  received $547,  before costs of sale and
recorded a $69 after-tax net realized capital gain that was reported in the 2000
investment results of North American.

2002  COMPARED  TO 2001 --  Revenues  for the year  increased  $21 due to earned
premium,  offset by net realized capital losses.  The increase in earned premium
was primarily due to runoff  premium from the exited  international  business of
the Reinsurance  segment,  which was transferred to Other  Operations in January
2002.

Operating income was relatively flat compared to the prior year period.

2001 COMPARED TO 2000 -- Revenues  were down $434, or 72%, and operating  income
was down $11, or 65%, primarily due to the sale of Zwolsche.

Asbestos and Environmental Claims

The Hartford  continues to receive asbestos and  environmental  claims,  both of
which  affect  Other  Operations.  These  claims  are made  pursuant  to several
different  categories of insurance

                                     - 41 -


coverage.  First,  The  Hartford  wrote direct  policies as a primary  liability
insurance  carrier.  Second, The Hartford wrote direct excess insurance policies
providing  additional coverage for insureds that exhaust their primary liability
insurance coverage.  Third, The Hartford acted as a reinsurer assuming a portion
of risks  previously  assumed  by other  insurers  writing  primary,  excess and
reinsurance  coverages.  Fourth,  The Hartford  participated  as a London Market
company that wrote both direct insurance and assumed reinsurance business.

With regard to both environmental and particularly asbestos claims,  significant
uncertainty  limits the  ability of insurers  and  reinsurers  to  estimate  the
ultimate reserves necessary for unpaid losses and related  settlement  expenses.
Conventional  reserving  techniques cannot reasonably estimate the ultimate cost
of these claims,  particularly during periods where theories of law are in flux.
As a result of the factors discussed in the following paragraphs,  the degree of
variability of reserve  estimates for these exposures is  significantly  greater
than for other more traditional exposures. In particular,  The Hartford believes
there is a high degree of  uncertainty  inherent in the  estimation  of asbestos
loss reserves.

In the case of the reserves for asbestos exposures,  factors contributing to the
high degree of uncertainty include inadequate development patterns,  plaintiffs'
expanding  theories of liability,  the risks  inherent in major  litigation  and
inconsistent   emerging  legal  doctrines.   Courts  have  reached  inconsistent
conclusions  as to when losses are deemed to have  occurred  and which  policies
provide coverage; what types of losses are covered;  whether there is an insurer
obligation  to defend;  how policy  limits are  determined;  whether  particular
claims are product/completed  operation claims subject to an aggregate limit and
how policy  exclusions and conditions are applied and interpreted.  Furthermore,
insurers in general,  including  The  Hartford,  have  recently  experienced  an
increase in the number of  asbestos-related  claims due to, among other  things,
more intensive advertising by lawyers,  seeking asbestos claimants,  plaintiffs'
increased focus on new and previously  peripheral  defendants and an increase in
the  number  of  insureds   seeking   bankruptcy   protection  as  a  result  of
asbestos-related  liabilities.  Plaintiffs  and  insureds  have  sought  to  use
bankruptcy  proceedings to accelerate and increase loss payments by insurers. In
addition  some  policyholders  have begun to assert new classes of claims for so
called "non-product"  coverages to which an aggregate limit of liability may not
apply. Recently, many insurers, including, in a limited number of instances, The
Hartford,  also have been sued  directly by asbestos  claimants  asserting  that
insurers  had a duty to  protect  the  public  from  the  dangers  of  asbestos.
Management  believes  these  issues  are not likely to be  resolved  in the near
future.

In the case of the reserves for environmental exposures, factors contributing to
the high degree of uncertainty  include:  court decisions that have  interpreted
the  insurance  coverage to be broader than  originally  intended;  inconsistent
decisions,  especially  across  jurisdictions and uncertainty as to the monetary
amount being sought by the claimant from the insured.

Further  uncertainties include the effect of the recent acceleration in the rate
of  bankruptcy  filings  by  asbestos  defendants  on the rate and amount of The
Hartford's asbestos claims payments;  a further increase or decrease in asbestos
and  environmental  claims  which  cannot  now  be  anticipated;   whether  some
policyholders'  liabilities  will reach the  umbrella  or excess  layer of their
coverage;  the  resolution or  adjudication  of some disputes  pertaining to the
amount of available  coverage for asbestos claims in a manner  inconsistent with
The Hartford's  previous  assessment of these claims;  the number and outcome of
direct actions against The Hartford; and unanticipated  developments  pertaining
to The Hartford's ability to recover  reinsurance for asbestos and environmental
claims.  It is also not possible to predict changes in the legal and legislative
environment  and  their  impact  on  the  future  development  of  asbestos  and
environmental claims.  Additionally,  the reporting pattern for excess insurance
and reinsurance claims is much longer than direct claims. In many instances,  it
takes months or years to determine that the customer's own obligations have been
met and how the  reinsurance in question may apply to such claims.  The delay in
reporting reinsurance claims and exposures adds to the uncertainty of estimating
the related reserves.

Given the factors and emerging trends described above, The Hartford believes the
actuarial tools and other techniques it employs to estimate the ultimate cost of
claims for more  traditional  kinds of  insurance  exposure  are less precise in
estimating reserves for its asbestos and environmental  exposures.  The Hartford
continually  evaluates new  information and new  methodologies  in assessing its
potential  asbestos  exposures.  At any time,  The Hartford may be conducting an
analysis of newly identified information.  Completion of exposure analyses could
cause The Hartford to change its  estimates  of its  asbestos and  environmental
reserves  and the effect of these  changes  could be material  to the  Company's
consolidated operating results, financial condition and liquidity.

Reserve Activity

Reserves and reserve  activity in the Other  Operations  segment are categorized
and reported as asbestos,  environmental or "all other" activity. The discussion
below relates to reserves and reserve activity, net of applicable reinsurance.

There are a wide  variety of claims  that  drive the  reserves  associated  with
asbestos,  environmental  and all other  categories  the  Company has defined in
Other  Operations.  Asbestos claims relate primarily to bodily injuries asserted
by those who came in contact  with  asbestos  or products  containing  asbestos.
Environmental  claims relate  primarily to pollution and related clean-up costs.
The all other category of reserves  covers a wide range of insurance  coverages,
including liability for breast implants,  blood products,  construction  defects
and lead paint.

The Other Operations  historic book of business  contains  policies written from
the 1940s to 1992, with the majority of the business  spanning the interval 1960
to 1990. The Hartford's  experience has been that this book of business has over
time produced  significantly  higher claims and losses than were contemplated at
inception. The areas of active claim activity have also shifted based on changes
in plaintiff focus and the overall litigation environment. A significant portion
of the claim reserves of the Other Operations segment relates to exposure to the
insurance businesses of other insurers or reinsurers ("whole account" exposure).
Many  of  these  whole  account  exposures  arise  from  reinsurance  agreements
previously  written  by The  Hartford.  The  Hartford's  net  exposure  in these
arrangements  has  increased for a variety of reasons  including

                                     - 42 -


The Hartford's  commutation of previous  retrocessions of such business.  Due to
the reporting  practices of cedants to their  reinsurers,  determination  of the
nature of the individual  risks involved in these whole account  exposures (such
as asbestos, environmental, or other exposures) requires various assumptions and
estimates, which are subject to uncertainty, as previously discussed.

Consistent with the Company's  long-standing  reserving practices,  The Hartford
will continue to regularly  review and monitor these  reserves and, where future
developments  indicate,  make appropriate  adjustments to the reserves. The loss
reserving  assumptions,   drawn  from  both  industry  data  and  the  Company's
experience,  have  over  time  been  applied  to all of this  business  and have
resulted in  strengthening  or weakening  actions at various times over the past
decade.

During 2001,  the Company  observed a decrease in newly  reported  environmental
claims  as well as  favorable  settlements  with  respect  to  certain  existing
environmental   claims.  Both  observations  were  consistent  with  longer-term
positive trends for environmental  liabilities.  In the same period,  consistent
with the reports of other insurers,  The Hartford experienced an increase in the
number of new asbestos  claims by  policyholders  not  previously  identified as
potentially   significant   claimants,   including  installers  or  handlers  of
asbestos-containing  products. In addition, new classes of claims were beginning
to arise whereby some policyholders  were asserting that their  asbestos-related
claims fall within  so-called  "non-products"  coverage  contained  within their
policies rather than products hazard coverage and that the claimed  non-products
coverage was not subject to any aggregate limit.  Also, as previously noted, The
Hartford  consolidated  management and claims handling  responsibility of all of
its asbestos and environmental  exposures within Other Operations in 2001. Based
on a review of the  environmental  claim trends that was completed in the fourth
quarter of 2001 under the supervision of the then newly consolidated  management
structure  and in  light of the  further  uncertainties  posed by the  foregoing
asbestos trends,  the Company  reclassified  $100 of  environmental  reserves to
asbestos reserves.

During 2002,  as part of the  Company's  ongoing  monitoring  of  reserves,  the
Company  reclassified $600 of reserves from the all other reserve  category,  of
which  $540  was   reclassified   to  asbestos  and  $60  was   reclassified  to
environmental   claim  reserves.   The  increase  in  reserves   categorized  as
environmental of $60 (as contrasted with the $100 decrease in the fourth quarter
of 2001)  occurred  because  the  reviews  in each of the two  periods  employed
actuarial techniques to analyze distinct and non-overlapping  blocks of reserves
and associated  exposures.  Facts and  circumstances  associated with each block
determined   the  resulting   changes  in  category.   A  portion  of  the  2002
reclassification relates to re-estimates of the appropriate allocation among the
asbestos,  environmental and all other categories of the aggregate reserves (net
of reinsurance) carried for certain assumed  reinsurance,  commuted cessions and
commuted   retrocessions  of  whole  account  business.  As  part  of  the  2002
reclassification,  The  Hartford  also  revised  formulas  that it  will  use to
allocate (among the asbestos,  environmental  and all other  categories)  future
claim payments for which reinsurance  arrangements were commuted and to allocate
claim  payments  made to effect  commutations.  As a result of these  revisions,
payments  categorized as asbestos and environmental  exposures will be higher in
future periods than in prior periods.

Approximately  $390 of the $600  reclassification  resulted  from changes in the
estimates of the proportions of certain of the Company's  broad-based  liability
and assumed reinsurance reserves that would more appropriately be categorized as
asbestos or environmental  reserves.  The change in allocation did not involve a
change in The Hartford's estimated net liability with respect to the policies in
question.  Instead,  the  Company's  estimate of what type of claims the insured
would present against these liabilities  changed.  To give an example:  when the
Company writes a broad  reinsurance  contract for another insurer,  it gives the
insurer  the right to submit a variety of  different  types of  claims,  up to a
limit,  against that policy.  The Company  establishes a reserve for that policy
that  considers the exposure for total incurred  claims under that policy.  Over
time,  the Company  changes its view as to what type of claims may be presented,
but its aggregate  liability and appropriate  reserve are less likely to change,
particularly if the reserves are already at the limit payable under the policy.

The  foregoing  $390  reduction  of the all other  reserves  was  related to the
Company's  assessment of trends that suggested  noteworthy changes in the claims
made against  these  reserves.  These trends  indicated  that the  categories of
claims  presented  were  becoming  better  defined.  In  response to these noted
trends,  management decided to study whether sufficient  information  existed to
change estimates of what portions of certain reserves were likely to be used for
asbestos  and  environmental  claims.  This  study was  completed  in the second
quarter of 2002. On a net basis,  it resulted in  approximately  $60 of reserves
being  categorized as likely to be associated  with an  environmental  claim and
approximately  $330 as likely to be  associated  with an  asbestos  claim.  This
resulted in a reclassification of $390 of reserves previously categorized in the
all other  category  to the  asbestos  and  environmental  reserves  categories,
respectively.

In the 2000 review of non-asbestos or  non-environmental  latent exposures,  the
Company  noted that  business  written from 1986 to 1992 has produced  less mass
tort development over the ensuing 10-15 years than was the case for the business
written from 1960 to 1986. At the time of this review,  the Company developed an
estimated  actuarial  range that  indicated  there could be a potential  reserve
deficiency but there was also a strong potential for reserve redundancy. At that
time,  the Company  concluded that there was  insufficient  foundation to make a
determination of redundancy and that to do so would be aggressive. In the second
quarter  2002,  The  Hartford  also  completed a separate  but related  study of
liabilities other than asbestos and environmental exposures in Other Operations.
The study  confirmed a  continuation  of the trends  previously  noted.  It also
produced a  conservative  end of the  actuarial  range  indicating  no  material
potential  deficiency.  With this new  information,  the Company felt sufficient
foundation  existed to estimate a redundancy of approximately  $210 for reserves
covering  latent   exposures  in  Other   Operations  other  than  asbestos  and
environmental.

While the Company was  conducting  the foregoing  studies,  the Company was also
monitoring  the continued  adverse  trends in the  reporting  and  settlement of
asbestos claims. In light of these trends,  which management  believed likely to
continue,

                                     - 43 -


management  decided to increase the Company's reserves for asbestos liability by
approximately $210.

The following table presents reserve  activity,  inclusive of estimates for both
reported and incurred but not reported  claims,  net of  reinsurance,  for Other
Operations, categorized by asbestos, environmental and all other claims, for the
years ended  December 31, 2002,  2001 and 2000.  Also included are the remaining
asbestos and environmental exposures of North American.



In comparing  environmental  claims and claim adjustment expenses paid from year
to year, 2001 includes $56 of payments resulting from a global commutation where
settlement was reached on both assumed and ceded reinsurance  involvements.  The
trend in all other paid losses,  when adjusted for the 2002  inclusion of HartRe
international  paids  of $62,  continues  to  decline  year to year.  Trends  in
asbestos  paids and  incurreds  are  addressed in the  paragraphs  preceding the
table. The $11 negative incurred of environmental reserve development in 2002 is
the result of continued favorable trends in environmental  claims, as previously
discussed.

The Company  manages its asbestos  and  environmental  claims in three  distinct
categories of coverage types as reported in the following table. Direct policies
include insurance policies issued to customers providing either primary coverage
or excess of loss coverage over either The  Hartford's  own primary  policies or
the primary policies of other insurance companies.  Assumed Reinsurance includes
both  "treaty"  reinsurance  (covering  broad  categories of claims or blocks of
business) and "facultative"  reinsurance  (covering specific risks or individual
policies  of primary or excess  insurance  companies).  London  Market  business
includes the business written by one or more subsidiaries in the United Kingdom,
which are no longer  active  in the  insurance  or  reinsurance  business.  Such
business includes both direct insurance and contracts of assumed reinsurance.

Exposures  on direct  policies  are the  easiest to  identify  because  specific
policies can be  associated  with  specific  accounts and reserves  established,
where appropriate,  for claims presented.  Over the last three years,  including
the current  reporting  period,  the Company  experienced  a reduction  in newly
reported environmental claims on Direct business, and actual claim payments have
been made at levels within the Company's previously  established  provisions for
loss.  However,  with  respect to asbestos  claims,  the Company  experienced  a
variety of negative trends, including: increasing number of policyholders making
claims,  an apparent increase in the number of claimants under such policies and
an accelerated rate of policyholder bankruptcies. The combination of such events
has the total value of  potential  claims  higher into the excess

                                     - 44 -


layers of the Company's  policies and into later years of coverage than had been
expected.

Assumed  Reinsurance  claims  (treaty and  facultative)  related to asbestos and
environmental  exposures  continue to be reported by  customers  years after the
expiration  of their  contracts  with the  Company.  The reports the Company has
received  during 2002 are largely related to asbestos and  environmental  claims
and  reflect  the same  trends as those of the Direct  policies,  as  previously
discussed.

The asbestos and environmental liability components of the London Market book of
business  consist of both direct  policies of insurance and contracts of assumed
reinsurance. As a participant in the London Market (comprised of both Lloyd's of
London and London Company Markets), the Company wrote business on a subscription
basis,  with the  Company's  involvement  being  limited to a  relatively  small
percentage of a total contract placement.  Claims are reported, via a broker, to
the "lead"  underwriter  and,  once agreed to, are  presented  to the  following
markets for  concurrence.  This  reporting  and claim  agreement  process  makes
estimating  liabilities  for this  business  the  most  uncertain  of the  three
categories of claims (Direct, Assumed - Domestic and London Market).

Over the last  three  years,  The  Hartford  has been  experiencing  lower  than
previously  expected  claim  activity  with  respect  to  claims  classified  as
environmental.  During the last two years,  The Hartford  has been  experiencing
higher than previously expected claim activity with respect to claims classified
as asbestos.  The increase in both the number of claims being  submitted and the
number of customer  bankruptcies,  being driven by asbestos related issues, have
accelerated  over the last year. The following  table sets forth,  for the three
years ended  December 31, 2002,  paid and  incurred  loss  activity by the three
categories  of claims for  asbestos and  environmental.  The table shows that in
this timeframe asbestos payments and incurred losses have been increasing, while
environmental activity generally has been improving.




OUTLOOK

As previously noted, The Hartford reviews various components of its asbestos and
environmental  reserves  on a  periodic  basis.  Given  the  continuing  adverse
development experienced by The Hartford, as well as the negative trends that the
insurance industry as a whole has recently seen with respect to asbestos, it was
determined  that a more  in-depth and  comprehensive  review was  necessary.  In
January 2003,  The Hartford  announced a  comprehensive  ground-up  study of its
asbestos related exposures,  and expects the study to be completed by the second
quarter  2003.  This study  will  accomplish  three  objectives:  (1)  provide a
ground-up  framework to evaluate the Company's  overall asbestos  exposure,  (2)
accumulate  the detailed  information  necessary  to provide even more  detailed
disclosures  of the  components  of  asbestos  reserves,  and (3)  evaluate  the
Company's exposures in relation to current reserve levels.

INVESTMENTS
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

General
- -------

The Hartford's  investment  portfolios  are divided  between Life and Property &
Casualty.  The  investment  portfolios  are  managed  based  on  the  underlying
characteristics and nature of each operation's respective liabilities and within
established  risk  parameters.  (For a  further  discussion  of  The  Hartford's
approach to managing risks, see the Capital Markets Risk Management section.)

The  investment  portfolios  of Life and  Property  &  Casualty  are  managed by
Hartford Investment Management Company ("HIMCO"),  a wholly-owned  subsidiary of
The  Hartford.   HIMCO  is   responsible   for   monitoring   and  managing  the
asset/liability  profile,  establishing investment objectives and guidelines and
determining,  within  specified risk tolerances and investment  guidelines,  the
appropriate asset allocation,  duration,  convexity and other characteristics of
the portfolios.  Security  selection and monitoring are performed by asset class
specialists working within dedicated portfolio management teams.

Return on  general  account  invested  assets  is an  important  element  of The
Hartford's  financial results.  Significant  fluctuations in the fixed income or
equity markets could weaken the Company's  financial condition or its results of
operations.  Net  investment  income and net realized  capital  gains and losses
accounted  for  approximately  16%,  17% and 19% of the  Company's  consolidated
revenues for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively.

Fluctuations  in interest  rates  affect the  Company's  return on, and the fair
value of, fixed maturity investments,  which comprised approximately 90% and 86%
of the fair  value of its  invested  assets as of  December  31,  2002 and 2001,
respectively.  Other events  beyond the Company's  control could also  adversely
impact the fair value of these  investments.  Specifically,  a  downgrade  of an
issuer's  credit  rating or default of  payment  by an issuer  could  reduce the
Company's investment return.

The Company also invests in  unaffiliated  limited  partnership  arrangements in
order to further diversify its investment portfolio.  These limited partnerships
represent approximately 2% and 3% of the fair value of its invested assets as of
December 31, 2002 and 2001,  respectively.  Limited  partnerships  are typically
less liquid  than  direct  investments  in fixed  income or equity  investments.
Market  volatility and other factors beyond the Company's  control can adversely
affect the value of these investments. Because the Company is a limited partner,
its ability to control the timing or the  realization of the related  investment
income is restricted.

A  decrease  in the fair  value of any  investment  that is  deemed  other  than
temporary  would result in the Company's  recognition  of a realized loss in its
financial  results  prior to the actual sale of the  investment.  (For a further
discussion,  see the Company's  discussion of evaluation of other than temporary
impairment in Critical Accounting  Estimates under "Valuation of Investments and
Derivative Instruments".)

LIFE

The  primary  investment  objective  of Life's  general  account is to  maximize
after-tax  returns  consistent with acceptable  risk  parameters,  including the
management  of  the  interest  rate  sensitivity  of  invested  assets  and  the
generation   of  sufficient   liquidity   relative  to  that  of  corporate  and
policyholder  obligations,  as discussed in the Capital  Markets Risk Management
section under "Market Risk - Life - Interest Rate Risk".

The weighted average duration of the fixed maturity portfolio was 4.8 and 4.9 as
of  December  31,  2002 and  2001,  respectively.  Duration  is  defined  as the
approximate  percentage  change in market price of the portfolio for a 100 basis
point change in interest rates. For example,  if interest rates increased by 100
basis points,  the fair value of the portfolio  would be expected to decrease by
approximately 4.8% and 4.9% as of December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively.  The
following  table  identifies  the  invested  assets by type held in the  general
account as of December 31, 2002 and 2001.





During 2002, fixed maturity investments increased 26% primarily due to increased
operating  cash flows,  transfers  into the general  account  from the  variable
annuity  separate  account and an increase in fair value due to a lower interest
rate  environment.   Limited  partnerships   decreased  $292,  or  36%,  due  to
redemptions and a decision to reallocate funds to other asset classes.

The following table identifies,  by type, the fixed maturity  securities held in
the general account as of December 31, 2002 and 2001.

                                     - 46 -




There were no material changes in asset allocation during 2002 and 2001.

As of December  31, 2002 and 2001,  18% and 21%,  respectively,  of Life's fixed
maturities were invested in private placement securities  (including 11% and 12%
of Rule 144A offerings as of December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively).  Private
placement securities are generally less liquid than public securities.  However,
private placements generally have covenants designed to compensate for liquidity
risk. Most of the private placement securities in the Life operation's portfolio
are rated by nationally  recognized rating agencies.  (For further discussion of
the  Company's  investment  credit  policies,   see  the  Capital  Markets  Risk
Management section under "Credit Risk".)

INVESTMENT RESULTS

The following table summarizes Life's investment results.



2002 COMPARED TO 2001 -- Net investment  income,  excluding  policy loan income,
increased  $132,  or 9%. The increase was  primarily due to income earned on the
previously  discussed  higher invested asset base partially  offset by $36 lower
income on limited  partnerships  and the impact of lower  interest  rates on new
investment purchases. Yields on average invested assets decreased as a result of
lower  rates on new  investment  purchases,  decreased  policy  loan  income and
decreased income on limited partnerships.

Included in 2002 net realized  capital  losses were  write-downs  for other than
temporary  impairments on primarily  corporate and asset-backed fixed maturities
of $363.  Write-downs on corporate  fixed  maturities  totaled $185 and included
impairments in the communications and technology sector of $142 (including a $74
loss related to  securities  issued by WorldCom  Corporation)  and the utilities
sector of $32. Write-downs on asset-backed  securities totaled $167 and included
impairments of securities backed by aircraft lease receivables of $73, corporate
debt  of  $35,   manufactured  housing  receivables  of  $16,  mutual  fund  fee
receivables of $16 and on various other  asset-backed  securities  totaling $27.
Also included in 2002 net realized  capital  losses were  write-downs  for other
than  temporary  impairments  on equity  securities  of $17.  These  losses were
partially offset by gains from the sale of fixed maturity securities.

2001 COMPARED TO 2000 -- Net investment  income,  excluding  policy loan income,
increased  $188,  or 15%. The increase was primarily due to income earned on the
higher  asset  base of fixed  maturity  investments,  partially  offset by lower
yields on fixed  maturities in the third and fourth quarters of 2001.  Yields on
overall average invested assets were flat.

Included in 2001 net realized  capital  losses were  write-downs  for other than
temporary  impairments on primarily  corporate and asset-backed fixed maturities
of  $105.   Write-downs  on  corporate   securities  totaled  $63  and  included
impairments in the utilities sector of $37 and the communications and technology
sector of $17. Write-downs on corporate fixed maturities in the utilities sector
were on securities  issued by Enron  Corporation.  Write-downs  on  asset-backed
securities  totaled  $31  and  included  impairments  of  securities  backed  by
corporate debt of $14 and on various other asset-backed securities totaling $17.
Also  included in net realized  capital  losses is a $35 loss  recognized on the
sale of the  Company's  interest in an Argentine  insurance  joint  venture,  in
addition  to  losses  associated  with  the  credit   deterioration  of  certain
investments in which the Company has an indirect economic interest. These losses
were partially offset by gains from the sale of fixed maturities.

SEPARATE ACCOUNT PRODUCTS

Separate  account  products  are  those  for  which a  separate  investment  and
liability  account is  maintained on behalf of the  policyholder.  The Company's
separate  accounts  reflect two  categories of risk  assumption:  non-guaranteed
separate  accounts  totaling $95.6 billion and $104.6 billion as of December 31,
2002 and 2001, respectively,  wherein the policyholder assumes substantially all
the risk and reward; and guaranteed separate accounts totaling $11.5 billion and
$10.1  billion as of  December  31,  2002 and 2001,  respectively,  wherein  The
Hartford  contractually  guarantees either a minimum return or the account value
to the policyholder.  Guaranteed  separate account products primarily consist of
modified guaranteed  individual annuities and modified guaranteed life insurance
and generally include market value adjustment  features and surrender charges to
mitigate  the risk of  disintermediation.  The primary  investment  objective of
guaranteed  separate accounts is to maximize  after-tax returns  consistent with
acceptable  risk  parameters,  including  the  management  of the interest  rate
sensitivity of invested assets relative to that of policyholder obligations,  as
discussed in the Capital  Markets Risk  Management  section under "Market Risk -
Life - Interest Rate Risk."

Investment objectives for non-guaranteed  separate accounts vary by fund account
type, as outlined in the applicable fund prospectus or separate  account plan of
operations. Non-guaranteed separate account products include variable annuities,
variable life insurance contracts and variable COLI.

PROPERTY & CASUALTY

The investment  objective for the majority of Property & Casualty is to maximize
economic value while  generating  after-tax  income and sufficient  liquidity to
meet corporate and  policyholder  obligations.  For Property & Casualty's  Other
Operations  segment,  the investment  objective is to ensure the full and timely
payment of all  liabilities.  Property & Casualty's  investment  strategies  are
developed based on a variety of factors  including  business  needs,  regulatory
requirements and tax considerations.

The weighted  average  duration of the fixed  maturity  portfolio  was 4.7 as of
December 31, 2002 and 2001.  Duration is defined as the  approximate  percentage
change in the market  value of the  portfolio  for a 100 basis  point  change in
interest  rates.  For example,  if interest rates increased by 100 basis points,
the fair value of the portfolio  would be expected to decrease by  approximately
4.7%.  The following  table  identifies  the invested  assets by type held as of
December 31, 2002 and 2001.




During 2002, fixed maturity  investments  increased 16% due to the investment of
increased  operating  cash  flows and an  increase  in fair value due to a lower
interest rate environment.  Total equity securities  decreased 50% primarily due
to the sale of foreign and  domestic  equity  holdings  and declines in domestic
equity  market  values.  Limited  partnerships  decreased  $199,  or 35%, due to
redemptions.  Other  investments  increased  due to the  purchase of a corporate
owned life insurance contract and increased investment in mortgage loans.

The following table identifies,  by type, the fixed maturity  securities held as
of December 31, 2002 and 2001.



                                     - 48 -


There were no material changes in asset allocation during 2002 and 2001.


INVESTMENT RESULTS

The following table below summarizes Property & Casualty's investment results.




2002  COMPARED  TO 2001 -- Both  before- and  after-tax  net  investment  income
increased  2%  compared  to the  prior  year as  increased  operating  cash flow
resulted in higher  investment  income on the higher invested asset base. Yields
on average invested assets declined due to the lower interest rate environment.

Net  realized  capital  losses  were $83  compared  to $103 for the prior  year.
Included in 2002 net realized  capital  losses were  write-downs  for other than
temporary  impairments on primarily  corporate and asset-backed fixed maturities
of $152.  Write-downs on corporate securities totaled $109 (including a $36 loss
related to securities issued by WorldCom  Corporation) and included  impairments
in the  communications  and technology sector of $91 and the utilities sector of
$11. Write-downs on asset-backed securities totaled $40 and included impairments
of securities  backed by corporate debt of $12,  aircraft  lease  receivables of
$11,  manufactured  housing  receivables of $8 and on various other asset-backed
securities  totaling $9. Also included in 2002 net realized  capital losses were
write-downs  for other than temporary  impairments on equity  securities of $47.
These losses were partially  offset by gains from the sale of fixed maturity and
equity securities.

2001  COMPARED  TO 2000 -- Both  before- and  after-tax  net  investment  income
decreased 2% compared to the prior year.  The decreases  were primarily due to a
reduction in investment income resulting from the sales of Zwolsche and Hartford
Seguros,  partially  offset by higher income on taxable fixed  maturities in the
North American Property & Casualty operations. Yields on average invested assets
declined slightly due to the lower interest rate environment.

Net realized  capital losses were $103 compared to net realized capital gains of
$234  for the  prior  year.  The  2001  net  realized  capital  losses  included
write-downs  for other than  temporary  impairments  on primarily  corporate and
asset-backed  fixed  maturities  of $61.  Write-downs  on  corporate  securities
totaled $39 and included impairments in the communications sector of $17 and the
utilities  sector of $16.  Write-downs  on  corporate  fixed  maturities  in the
utilities sector were all on securities issued by Enron Corporation. Write-downs
on asset-backed  securities  totaled $22 and included  impairments of securities
backed by  corporate  debt of $9 and on various  other  asset-backed  securities
totaling $13. The 2001 net realized capital losses also included write-downs for
other than temporary  impairments of $30 on equities and other invested  assets.
An additional $7 of losses were sustained on sales of Enron  Corporation  common
stock.  Also included in 2001 net realized  capital losses were losses generated
from the sales of  international  subsidiaries  of $54,  in  addition  to losses
associated  with the credit  deterioration  of certain  investments in which the
Company has an indirect economic interest. These losses were partially offset by
gains from the sale of fixed maturities.

CORPORATE

As of December 31, 2002 and 2001  Corporate  held $66 and $3,  respectively,  of
short-term fixed maturity investments.  These investments earned $2 of income in
2002.

In connection with The HLI Repurchase, the carrying value of the purchased fixed
maturity  security  investments was adjusted to fair market value as of the date
of the repurchase.  This adjustment was reported in Corporate.  The amortization
of the adjustment to the fixed maturity security investments' carrying values is
reported in Corporate's  net investment  income.  The total amount of before-tax
amortization for the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001 was $18.

CAPITAL MARKETS RISK MANAGEMENT
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------






The Hartford has a disciplined  approach to managing risks  associated  with its
capital markets and asset/liability management activities.  Investment portfolio
management  is organized to focus  investment  management  expertise on specific
classes of investments,  while asset/liability  management is the responsibility
of  dedicated  risk  management  units  supporting  Life,  including  guaranteed
separate accounts,  and Property & Casualty operations.  Derivative  instruments
are  utilized in  compliance  with  established  Company  policy and  regulatory
requirements and are monitored internally and reviewed by senior management.

The Company is exposed to two primary sources of investment and  asset/liability
management risk:  credit risk,  relating to the uncertainty  associated with the
ability of an obligor or  counterparty  to make  timely  payments  of  principal
and/or interest,  and market risk, relating to the market price and/or cash flow
variability associated with changes in interest rates, securities prices, market
indices,  yield curves or currency exchange rates. The Company does not hold any
financial instruments purchased for trading purposes.

CREDIT RISK

The Hartford has established investment credit policies that focus on the credit
quality of obligors and counterparties,  limit credit concentrations,  encourage
diversification  and  require  frequent  creditworthiness  reviews.   Investment
activity,  including  setting of policy and defining  acceptable risk levels, is
subject to regular review and approval by senior management and by the Company's
Finance Committee of the Board of Directors.

The Company invests primarily in securities which are rated investment grade and
has established exposure limits, diversification standards and review procedures
for  all   credit   risks   including   borrower,   issuer   and   counterparty.
Creditworthiness  of specific  obligors  is  determined  by an  internal  credit
evaluation   supplemented   by   consideration   of  external   determinants  of
creditworthiness,  typically ratings assigned by nationally  recognized  ratings
agencies.  Obligor,  asset  sector and  industry  concentrations  are subject to
established limits and monitored on a regular basis.

The Hartford is not exposed to any credit  concentration risk of a single issuer
greater than 10% of the Company's stockholders' equity.

DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS

The Company's derivative  counterparty exposure policy establishes  market-based
credit limits,  favors long-term  financial stability and  creditworthiness  and
typically requires credit  enhancement/credit  risk reducing agreements.  Credit
risk is  measured  as the amount  owed to the  Company  based on current  market
conditions  and  potential  payment  obligations  between  the  Company  and its
counterparties. Credit exposures are generally quantified weekly and netted, and
collateral is pledged to and held by, or on behalf of, the Company to the extent
the current value of derivatives exceeds exposure policy thresholds.

The  Company  periodically  enters  into swap  agreements  in which the  Company
assumes credit  exposure from a single entity,  referenced  index or asset pool.
Total return swaps involve the periodic exchange of payments with other parties,
at  specified  intervals,  calculated  using the agreed upon index and  notional
principal amounts. Generally, no cash or principal payments are exchanged at the
inception of the contract.  Typically,  at the time a swap is entered into,  the
cash flow streams exchanged by the counterparties are equal in value.

Credit default swaps involve a transfer of credit risk from one party to another
in exchange for periodic payments. One party to the contract will make a payment
based on an agreed  upon rate and a  notional  amount.  The  second  party,  who
assumes credit exposures, will only make a payment when there is a credit event,
and such payment will be equal to the notional value of the swap  contract,  and
in return, the second party will receive the debt obligation of the first party.
A credit  event is  generally  defined  as default  on  contractually  obligated
interest or principal payment or restructure.

As of December 31, 2002 and 2001 the  notional  value of total return and credit
default  swaps  totaled $1.0 billion and $686,  respectively,  and the swap fair
value totaled $(78) and $(105), respectively.

The following  tables  identify  fixed maturity  securities for Life,  including
guaranteed  separate  accounts,  and Property & Casualty by credit quality.  The
ratings  referenced  in the  tables  are based on the  ratings  of a  nationally
recognized rating organization or, if not rated, assigned based on the Company's
internal  analysis  of such  securities.  In  addition,  an aging  of the  gross
unrealized loss position is presented for fixed maturity and equity securities.

LIFE

As of December 31, 2002 and 2001, over 94% and 96%,  respectively,  of the fixed
maturity  portfolio was invested in securities  rated  investment grade (BBB and
above).  During  2002,  the  percentage  of BB and below  rated  fixed  maturity
investments  increased due to increased downgrades of corporate and asset-backed
securities.

                                     - 50 -




The Company's total and below investment grade ("BIG") fixed maturity and equity
securities held as of December 31, 2002 and 2001 that were in an unrealized loss
position are presented in the tables below by length of time the security was in
an unrealized loss position.




The total  securities  that were in an unrealized  loss position for longer than
six  months as of  December  31,  2002  primarily  consisted  of  corporate  and
asset-backed securities.  The significant corporate security industry sectors of
banking and financial  services,  utilities,  technology and  communications and
airlines comprised 20%, 13%, 13% and 3%,  respectively,  of the greater than six
months  unrealized  loss amount.  Asset-backed  securities  comprised 33% of the
greater than six month unrealized loss amount and included  securities backed by
corporate  debt,  aircraft lease  receivables  and credit card  receivables.  At
December 31, 2002,  the Company held no  securities of a single issuer that were
at an  unrealized  loss in excess of 4% of total  unrealized  losses.  The total
unrealized loss position of $(466) consisted of $(344) in general account losses
and $(122) in guaranteed separate account losses.

The BIG and equity  securities  that were in an  unrealized  loss  position  for
longer than six months as of December 31, 2002 primarily  consisted of corporate
securities in the technology and communications and utilities sectors as well as
asset-backed  securities  backed by corporate  debt,  equipment loans and credit
card receivables.  The technology and communications and utilities sectors along
with diversified equity mutual funds and asset-backed  securities comprised 26%,
22%, 18% and 15%, respectively, of the BIG and equity securities that were in an
unrealized  loss position for greater than six months at December 31, 2002.  The
total unrealized loss position of BIG and equity  securities of $(192) consisted
of $(157) in general  account  losses and $(35) in guaranteed  separate  account
losses.

The total  securities  that were in an unrealized  loss position for longer than
six  months as of  December  31,  2001  primarily  consisted  of  corporate  and
asset-backed  securities.  The significant  corporate  security industry sectors
that were in an unrealized  loss  position for greater than six months  included
banking  and  financial  services of 22%.  The  communications  and  technology,
utilities and petroleum sectors  comprised 13%, 12% and 4%,  respectively of the
total  securities  that were in an unrealized loss position for greater than six
months at  December  31,  2001.  Asset-backed  securities  comprised  19% of the
greater than six month unrealized loss amount, and included securities backed by
corporate  debt,  franchise  loans,  aircraft  lease  receivables,  credit  card
receivables,  and manufactured  housing  receivables.  At December 31, 2001, the
Company held no securities of a single issuer that were at an unrealized loss in
excess of 3% of total unrealized  losses.  The total unrealized loss position of
$(476)  consisted of $(370) in general  account  losses and $(106) in guaranteed
separate account losses.

The BIG and equity  securities  that were in an  unrealized  loss  position  for
longer than six months as of December 31, 2001 primarily  consisted of corporate
securities in the utilities and technology and communications sectors as well as
asset-backed  securities backed primarily by manufactured  housing  receivables,
corporate debt and equipment lease receivables. Diversified equity mutual funds,
asset-backed  securities,  technology and  communications  sector securities and
utilities sector securities  comprised 28%, 21%, 18% and 14%,  respectively,  of
the BIG securities in an unrealized loss position for greater than six months at
December  31,  2001.  The  total  unrealized  loss  position  of BIG and  equity
securities of $(128)  consisted of $(90) in general  account losses and $(38) in
guaranteed separate account losses.

As part of the Company's ongoing monitoring process by a committee of investment
and  accounting  professionals,  the Company has reviewed  these  securities and
concluded that there were no additional  other than temporary  impairments as of
December 31, 2002 and 2001. Due to the issuers'  continued  satisfaction  of the
securities'  obligations in accordance  with their  contractual  terms and their
continued expectation to do so, as well as the evaluation of the fundamentals of
the issuers'  financial  condition,  the Company believes that the prices of the
securities in the sectors identified above, were temporarily depressed primarily
as a  result  of a market  dislocation  and  generally  poor  cyclical  economic
conditions and sentiment.  (See the Critical Accounting Estimates section in the
MD&A for the factors considered in evaluating other than temporary impairments.)

The  evaluation  for other than  temporary  impairments  is a  quantitative  and
qualitative  process,  which  is  subject  to  risks  and  uncertainties  in the
determination  of whether  declines in the fair value of  investments  are other
than temporary.  The risks and uncertainties include changes in general economic
conditions, the issuer's financial condition or near term recovery prospects and
the effects of changes in interest rates. In addition, for securitized financial
assets with contractual cash flows (e.g. asset-backed  securities),  projections
of expected  future cash flows may change based upon new  information  regarding
the performance of the underlying collateral.

PROPERTY & CASUALTY

As of December 31, 2002 and 2001,  over 94% of the fixed maturity  portfolio was
invested in securities rated investment grade. During 2002, the percentage of BB
and below rated fixed maturity investments increased due to increased downgrades
of corporate and asset-backed securities.



The total and BIG fixed maturity and equity  securities  held as of December 31,
2002 and 2001 that were in an  unrealized  loss  position  are  presented in the

airlines  comprised 22%, 8%, 12% and 6%,  respectively,  of the greater than six
months  unrealized  loss amount.  Asset-backed  securities  comprised 17% of the
greater than six month unrealized loss amount and include  securities  backed by
corporate debt,  aircraft lease  receivables,  home equity loans and credit card
receivables.  At December 31, 2002,  the Company held no  securities of a single
issuer  that were at an  unrealized  loss in  excess  of 6% of total  unrealized

future  cash  flows  may  change  based  upon  new  information   regarding  the
performance of the underlying collateral pools.

MARKET RISK

The Hartford has material exposure to both interest rate and equity market risk.
The  Company  analyzes   interest  rate  risk  using  various  models  including
multi-scenario  cash flow  projection  models  that  forecast  cash flows of the
liabilities and their supporting investments, including derivative instruments.

The Hartford has several objectives in managing market risk associated with Life
and Property & Casualty.  Life is responsible for maximizing  after-tax  returns
within acceptable risk parameters, including the management of the interest rate
sensitivity  of invested  assets and the  generation of sufficient  liquidity to
that of corporate and policyholder obligations. Life's fixed maturity portfolios
have  material  market  exposure  to  interest  rate  risk.  Property & Casualty
attempts  to maximize  economic  value while  generating  appropriate  after-tax
income and sufficient liquidity to meet corporate and policyholder  obligations.
Property & Casualty has  material  exposure to interest  rate and equity  market
risk.  The Company  continually  monitors  these  exposures and makes  portfolio
adjustments to manage these risks within established limits.

Downward movement in market interest rates during 2002 resulted in a significant
increase in the unrealized appreciation of the fixed maturity security portfolio
from 2001.  However,  The Hartford's asset allocation and its exposure to market
risk as of December  31, 2002 have not changed  materially  from its position at
December 31, 2001.

The Company is subject to the risk of a change in financial condition due to the
effect of interest rate and equity market fluctuations on the calculation of the
Company's minimum pension liabilities. As discussed in the Capital Resources and
Liquidity  section,  in the fourth quarter 2002, the Company  recorded a minimum
pension liability charge directly to stockholders' equity of $364, after-tax.

DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS

The Hartford  utilizes a variety of  derivative  instruments,  including  swaps,
caps,  floors,  forwards and exchange traded futures and options,  in compliance
with Company policy and regulatory  requirements in order to achieve one of four
Company approved objectives:  to hedge risk arising from interest rate, price or
currency exchange rate volatility;  to manage liquidity;  to control transaction
costs; or to enter into income enhancement and replication transactions.

Interest  rate swaps  involve  the  periodic  exchange  of  payments  with other
parties,  at  specified  intervals,  calculated  using the agreed upon rates and
notional  principal  amounts.  Generally,  no cash  or  principal  payments  are
exchanged at the  inception of the  contract.  Typically,  at the time a swap is
entered into, the cash flow streams exchanged by the counterparties are equal in
value.

Foreign  currency swaps exchange an initial  principal amount in two currencies,
agreeing to re-exchange  the currencies at a future date, at an agreed  exchange
rate.  There is also  periodic  exchange  of  payments  at  specified  intervals
calculated using the agreed upon rates and exchanged principal amounts.

Interest rate cap and floor contracts  entitle the purchaser to receive from the
issuer at specified dates, the amount,  if any, by which a specified market rate
exceeds the cap strike rate or falls below the floor strike  rate,  applied to a
notional  principal  amount.  A premium  payment is made by the purchaser of the
contract at its inception, and no principal payments are exchanged.

Forward  contracts  are  customized  commitments  to  either  purchase  or  sell
designated  financial  instruments,  at a future date, for a specified price and
may be settled in cash or through delivery of the underlying instrument.

Financial  futures  are  standardized  commitments  to either  purchase  or sell
designated  financial  instruments,  at a future date, for a specified price and
may be settled in cash or through delivery of the underlying instrument. Futures
contracts trade on organized exchanges.  Margin requirements for futures are met
by pledging securities,  and changes in the futures' contract values are settled
daily in cash.

Option contracts grant the purchaser, for a premium payment, the right to either
purchase from or sell to the issuer a financial instrument at a specified price,
within a specified period or on a stated date.

Derivative  activities are monitored by an internal  compliance  unit,  reviewed
frequently  by senior  management  and reported to the Finance  Committee of the
Board of Directors.  The notional amounts of derivative  contracts represent the
basis upon which pay or receive amounts are calculated and are not reflective of
credit risk.  Notional amounts pertaining to derivative  instruments used in the
management of market risk for both general and guaranteed  separate  accounts at
December  31,  2002  and  2001  totaled   $13.2   billion  and  $10.5   billion,
respectively.

The following discussions focus on the key market risk exposures within Life and
Property & Casualty.

LIFE

Interest Rate Risk
- ------------------

Life's general account and guaranteed separate account exposure to interest rate
risk relates to the market price and/or cash flow  variability  associated  with
changes in market  interest  rates.  Changes in interest  rates can  potentially
impact Life's  profitability.  In certain  scenarios  where  interest  rates are
volatile,  Life could be exposed to disintermediation  risk and reduction in net
interest rate spread or profit margins.

Life's general account and guaranteed  separate  account  investment  portfolios
primarily  consist of investment  grade,  fixed maturity  securities,  including
corporate bonds, asset-backed securities, commercial mortgage-backed securities,
tax-exempt municipal  securities and collateralized  mortgage  obligations.  The
fair value of these and Life's other invested assets fluctuates depending on the
interest rate environment and other general economic conditions.  During periods
of  declining  interest  rates,  paydowns  on  mortgage-backed   securities  and
collateralized  mortgage  obligations  increase as the underlying  mortgages are
prepaid. During such periods, the Company generally will not be able to reinvest
the proceeds of any such prepayments at comparable  yields.  Conversely,  during
periods of rising interest rates,  the rate of prepayments  generally

                                     - 54 -


declines,  exposing the Company to the possibility of asset/liability  cash flow
and yield  mismatch.  (For further  discussion of the Company's risk  management
techniques to manage this market risk,  see the "Asset and Liability  Management
Strategies Used to Manage Market Risk" discussed below.)

As described  above,  Life holds a significant  fixed  maturity  portfolio  that
includes both fixed and variable rate  securities.  The following table reflects
the principal  amounts of Life's general and guaranteed  separate accounts fixed
and variable rate fixed maturity portfolios,  along with the respective weighted
average  coupons by estimated  maturity  year at December 31, 2002.  Comparative
totals are  included as of December 31, 2001.  Expected  maturities  differ from
contractual  maturities  due to  call or  prepayment  provisions.  The  weighted
average coupon ("WAC") on variable rate  securities is based on spot rates as of
December 31, 2002 and 2001, and is primarily based on London  Interbank  Offered
Rate ("LIBOR"). Callable bonds and notes are distributed to either call dates or
maturity,  depending  on  which  date  produces  the  most  conservative  yield.
Asset-backed securities, collateralized mortgage obligations and mortgage-backed
securities are distributed based on estimates of the rate of future  prepayments
of principal  over the remaining  life of the  securities.  These  estimates are
developed  using  prepayment  speeds  provided in broker  consensus  data.  Such
estimates  are derived from  prepayment  speeds  previously  experienced  at the
interest rate levels projected for the underlying collateral.  Actual prepayment
experience may vary from these  estimates.  Financial  instruments  with certain
leverage  features have been included in each of the fixed maturity  categories.
These  instruments  have  not  been  separately   displayed  because  they  were
immaterial to the Life investment portfolio.

and trust  preferred  securities  and reflects  principal cash flows and related
weighted  average  interest  rates by  maturity  year.  Comparative  totals  are

Asset and Liability Management Strategies Used to Manage Market Risk
- ---------------------------------------------------------------------

Life employs  several risk  management  tools to quantify and manage market risk
arising from their investments and interest sensitive  liabilities.  For certain
portfolios,  management monitors the changes in present value between assets and
liabilities  resulting  from various  interest rate scenarios  using  integrated
asset/liability  measurement systems and a proprietary system that simulates the
impacts of parallel and non-parallel  yield curve shifts.  Based on this current
and prospective  information,  management implements risk reducing techniques to
improve the match between assets and liabilities.

Derivatives  play an important role in  facilitating  the management of interest
rate risk, creating opportunities to efficiently fund obligations, hedge against
risks that affect the value of certain  liabilities and adjust broad  investment
risk  characteristics  as a result of any  significant  changes in market risks.
Life uses a variety of derivatives,  including swaps, caps, floors, forwards and
exchange-traded  financial  futures  and  options,  in order  to hedge  exposure
primarily to interest rate risk on anticipated  investment purchases or existing
assets and liabilities.  At December 31, 2002,  notional  amounts  pertaining to
derivatives totaled $10.0 billion ($8.3 billion related to insurance investments
and $1.7  billion  related  to life  insurance  liabilities).  Notional  amounts
pertaining  to  derivatives  totaled  $9.3  billion at  December  31, 2001 ($7.6
billion  related  to  insurance  investments  and $1.7  billion  related to life
insurance liabilities).

The  economic   objectives  and  strategies  for  which  the  Company   utilizes
derivatives are categorized as follows:

Anticipatory  Hedging -- For certain  liabilities,  the  Company  commits to the
price of the  product  prior to receipt of the  associated  premium or  deposit.
Anticipatory hedges are executed to offset the impact of changes in asset prices
arising from interest rate changes pending the receipt of premium or deposit and
the subsequent purchase of an asset. These hedges involve taking a long position
(purchase)  in interest rate futures or entering into an interest rate swap with
duration

                                     - 56 -


characteristics   equivalent  to  the  associated   liabilities  or  anticipated
investments. The notional amounts of anticipatory hedges as of December 31, 2002
and 2001 were $265 and $320, respectively.

Liability Hedging -- Several products obligate the Company to credit a return to
the contract holder which is indexed to a market rate. To hedge risks associated
with these  products,  the Company  enters into  various  derivative  contracts.
Interest  rate  swaps are used to  convert  the  contract  rate into a rate that
trades in a more liquid and efficient market.  This hedging strategy enables the
Company to customize  contract terms and  conditions to customer  objectives and
satisfies the operation's asset/liability matching policy. In addition, interest
rate swaps are used to convert  certain  variable  contract  rates to  different
variable  rates,  thereby  allowing  them to be  appropriately  matched  against
variable rate assets. Finally,  interest rate caps and option contracts are used
to hedge  against  the risk of  contract  holder  disintermediation  in a rising
interest  rate  environment.  The  notional  amounts  of  derivatives  used  for
liability hedging as of December 31, 2002 and 2001 were $1.7 billion.

Asset  Hedging -- To meet the various  policyholder  obligations  and to provide
cost-effective, prudent investment risk diversification, the Company may combine
two or more financial instruments to achieve the investment characteristics of a
fixed  maturity  security  or that  match an  associated  liability.  The use of
derivative  instruments in this regard effectively transfers unwanted investment
risks or  attributes  to others.  The  selection of the  appropriate  derivative
instruments  depends on the investment risk, the liquidity and efficiency of the
market and the asset and  liability  characteristics.  The  notional  amounts of
asset  hedges  as of  December  31,  2002 and 2001 were  $7.2  billion  and $6.2
billion, respectively.

Portfolio  Hedging  --  The  Company  periodically  compares  the  duration  and
convexity  of its  portfolios  of assets to its  corresponding  liabilities  and
enters  into  portfolio  hedges to reduce  any  difference  to  desired  levels.
Portfolio  hedges reduce the duration and convexity  mismatch between assets and
liabilities  and offset the potential  impact to cash flows caused by changes in
interest rates. The notional amounts of portfolio hedges as of December 31, 2002
and 2001 were $910 and $1.1 billion, respectively.

The  following  tables  provide   information  as  of  December  31,  2002  with
comparative  totals for  December  31, 2001 on  derivative  instruments  used in
accordance with the aforementioned hedging strategies.  For interest rate swaps,
caps and floors,  the tables present  notional amounts with weighted average pay
and  receive  rates for swaps and  weighted  average  strike  rates for caps and
floors by maturity year. For interest rate futures,  the table presents contract
amount and weighted  average  settlement  price by expected  maturity  year. For
option contracts, the table presents contract amount by expected maturity year.

Currency Exchange Risk
- ----------------------

Currency  exchange  risk exists with  respect to  investments  in non-US  dollar
denominated  securities.  The fair value of these fixed  maturity  securities at
December 31, 2002 and 2001 was $1.2 billion and $494, respectively.  In order to
manage a portion of these  currency  exposures,  the Company enters into foreign
currency  swaps to hedge the  variability in cash flow  associated  with certain
foreign  denominated  securities.  These foreign  currency swap  agreements  are
structured  to match the  foreign  currency  cash  flows of the  hedged  foreign
denominated  securities.  At December  31, 2002 and 2001,  the foreign  currency
swaps had a  notional  value of $794 and $435,  respectively,  and fair value of
$(67) and $6,  respectively.  In the fourth quarter of 2002, the Company entered
into a  costless  collar  strategy  to  temporarily  mitigate  a portion  of its
residual  currency  risk in foreign  denominated  securities.  Accordingly,  the
Company purchased foreign put options and wrote foreign call options expiring in
January  2003.  At December  31,  2002 the  foreign  put and call  options had a
notional value of $469 and fair value of $(3). The Company had no foreign put or
call options at December 31, 2001.

Life Product Liability Characteristics
- --------------------------------------

Life's product liabilities, other than non-guaranteed separate accounts, include
accumulation vehicles such as fixed and variable annuities, other investment and
universal  life-type  contracts and other  insurance  products such as long-term
disability and term life insurance.

Asset Accumulation Vehicles

While  interest  rate risk  associated  with these  insurance  products has been
reduced  through  the use of market  value  adjustment  features  and  surrender
charges,  the primary  risk  associated  with these  products is that the spread
between  investment  return  and  credited  rate may not be  sufficient  to earn
targeted returns.

Fixed Rate -- Products in this category  require the payment of a fixed rate for
a certain period of time. The cash flows are not interest  sensitive because the
products are written with a market value adjustment  feature and the liabilities
have protection against the early withdrawal of funds through surrender charges.
Product examples include fixed rate annuities with a market value adjustment and
fixed rate guaranteed  investment  contracts.  Contract duration is dependent on
the policyholder's choice of guarantee period.

Indexed  --  Products  in this  category  are  similar  to the fixed  rate asset
accumulation  vehicles  but  require the life  operations  to pay a rate that is
determined  by an external  index.  The amount  and/or timing of cash flows will
therefore  vary based on the level of the  particular  index.  The primary risks
inherent  in these  products  are  similar to the fixed rate asset  accumulation
vehicles,  with the  additional  risk that  changes  in the index may  adversely
affect  profitability.  Product examples include  indexed-guaranteed  investment
contracts with an estimated duration of up to two years.

Interest Credited -- Products in this category credit interest to policyholders,
subject to market conditions and minimum guarantees. Policyholders may surrender
at book  value but are  subject to  surrender  charges  for an  initial  period.
Product  examples  include  universal  life  contracts  and the general  account
portion of Life's variable  annuity  products.  Liability  duration is short- to
intermediate-term.

Other Insurance Products

Long-term  Pay Out  Liabilities  -- Products in this  category are  long-term in
nature and may contain significant actuarial (including mortality and morbidity)
pricing  and cash flow  risks.  The cash  flows  associated  with  these  policy
liabilities  are not interest rate sensitive but do vary based on the timing and
amount of benefit payments. The primary risks associated with these products are
that the benefits will exceed expected  actuarial pricing and/or that the actual
timing  of the  cash  flows  differ  from  those  anticipated,  resulting  in an
investment  return lower than that assumed in pricing.  Product examples include
structured  settlement  contracts,  on-benefit annuities (i.e., the annuitant is
currently  receiving  benefits  thereon)  and  long-term  disability  contracts.
Contract duration is generally five to ten years.

Short-term  Pay Out  Liabilities -- These  liabilities  are short-term in nature
with a duration of less than one year. The primary risks  associated  with these
products are determined by the non-investment contingencies such as mortality or
morbidity  and  the  variability  in the  timing  of the  expected  cash  flows.
Liquidity is of greater  concern  than for the  long-term  pay out  liabilities.
Products  include  individual  and  group  term  life  insurance  contracts  and
short-term disability contracts.

Management  of  the  duration  of  investments   with  respective   policyholder
obligations  is  an  explicit  objective  of  Life's  management  strategy.  The
estimated  cash  flows of  insurance  policy  liabilities  based  upon  internal
actuarial  assumptions  as of December 31, 2002 are reflected in the table below
by expected  maturity  year.  Comparative  totals are  included for December 31,
2001.

                                     - 59 -






Sensitivity to Changes in Interest Rates
- ----------------------------------------

For liabilities  whose cash flows are not  substantially  affected by changes in
interest  rates  ("fixed   liabilities")  and  where  investment  experience  is
substantially  absorbed  by Life,  the  sensitivity  of the net  economic  value
(discounted  present value of asset cash flows less the discounted present value
of  liability  cash  flows) of those  portfolios  to 100 basis  point  shifts in
interest rates is shown in the following table.

                             Change in Net Economic Value
                               2002                 2001
                       ------------------------------------------
 Basis point shift      - 100      + 100      - 100     + 100
- -----------------------------------------------------------------
 Amount                $    17   $    (51)  $      6  $    (31)
 Percent of liability
    value                 0.08%     (0.23)%     0.03%    (0.16)%
=================================================================

These  fixed  liabilities  represented  about 57% and 61% of Life's  general and
guaranteed   separate  account  liabilities  at  December  31,  2002  and  2001,
respectively.   The  remaining  liabilities  generally  allow  Life  significant
flexibility to adjust credited rates to reflect actual investment experience and
thereby pass through a substantial  portion of actual  investment  experience to
the  policyholder.  The fixed  liability  portfolios  are managed and  monitored
relative  to defined  objectives,  are  analyzed  regularly  by  management  for
internal risk management purposes using scenario  simulation  techniques and are
evaluated on an annual basis, in compliance with regulatory requirements.

Equity Risk
- -----------

The Company's  Life  operations are  significantly  influenced by changes in the
equity  markets.  Life's  profitability  depends largely on the amount of assets
under management, which is primarily driven by the level of sales, equity market
appreciation  and  depreciation  and the  persistency  of the in-force  block of
business. A prolonged and precipitous decline in the equity markets, as has been
experienced of late, can have a significant impact on the Company's  operations,
as sales of variable  products may decline and surrender  activity may increase,
as customer sentiment towards the equity market turns negative. The lower assets
under management will have a negative impact on the Company's financial results,
primarily  due to lower  fee  income  related  to the  Investment  Products  and
Individual Life segments,  where a heavy concentration of equity linked products
are administered and sold.  Furthermore,  the Company may experience a reduction
in profit  margins if a  significant  portion of the assets held in the variable
annuity separate  accounts move to the general account and the Company is unable
to earn an  acceptable  investment  spread,  particularly  in  light  of the low
interest rate environment and the presence of contractually  guaranteed  minimum
interest credited rates, which for the most part are at a 3% rate.

In  addition,  prolonged  declines in the equity  market may also  decrease  the
Company's  expectations of future gross profits, which are utilized to determine
the amount of DAC to be  amortized  in a given  financial  statement  period.  A
significant  decrease in the Company's estimated gross profits would require the
Company  to  accelerate  the  amount  of DAC  amortization  in a  given  period,
potentially  causing a material  adverse  deviation in that period's net income.
Although an acceleration of DAC amortization would have a negative impact on the
Company's  earnings,  it would not affect the  Company's  cash flow or liquidity
position.

Additionally,  the Investment  Products segment sells variable annuity contracts
that offer various  guaranteed  death  benefits.  For certain  guaranteed  death
benefits,  The Hartford pays the greater of (1) the account value at death;  (2)
the sum of all  premium  payments  less prior  withdrawals;  or (3) the  maximum
anniversary value of the contract,  plus any premium payments since the contract
anniversary,  minus any  withdrawals  following  the contract  anniversary.  The
Company  currently  reinsures  a  significant  portion  of these  death  benefit
guarantees associated with its in-force block of business. The Company currently
records the death  benefit  costs,  net of  reinsurance,  as they are  incurred.
Declines in the equity  market may increase the  Company's net exposure to death
benefits under these contracts.

The Company's total gross exposure (i.e. before reinsurance) to these guaranteed
death  benefits as of December 31, 2002 is $22.4  billion.  Due to the fact that
82% of this amount is  reinsured,  the  Company's  net exposure is $4.1 billion.
This amount is often referred to as the net amount at risk. However, the Company
will only incur these  guaranteed  death  benefit  payments in the future if the
policyholder  has an  in-the-money  guaranteed  death  benefit  at their time of
death.  In order to analyze  the total  costs that the  Company may incur in the
future related to these  guaranteed  death  benefits,  the Company  performed an
actuarial  present value  analysis.  This analysis  included  developing a model
utilizing 250 stochastically generated investment performance scenarios and best
estimate  assumptions related to mortality and lapse rates. A range of projected
costs was developed and  discounted  back to the  statement  date  utilizing the
Company's cost of capital, which for this purpose was assumed to be 9.25%. Based
on this analysis,  the Company  estimated that the present value of the retained

                                     - 60 -


death  benefit  costs to be incurred in the future fell within a range of $86 to
$349. This range was calculated utilizing a 95% confidence interval.  The median
of the 250 stochastically generated scenarios was $159.

Furthermore,  the  Company is involved  in  arbitration  with one of its primary
reinsurers  relating to policies with such death benefit guarantees written from
1994 to 1999. The arbitration  involves  alleged  breaches under the reinsurance
treaties.  Although  the Company  believes  that its  position  in this  pending
arbitration  is strong,  an adverse  outcome  could  result in a decrease to the
Company's  statutory  surplus  and capital and  potentially  increase  the death
benefit costs incurred by the Company in the future. The arbitration hearing was
held during the fourth quarter of 2002, but no decision has been rendered.

PROPERTY & CASUALTY

Interest Rate Risk
- ------------------

The primary exposure to interest rate risk in Property & Casualty relates to its
fixed maturity investments. Changes in market interest rates directly impact the
market value of the fixed  maturity  securities.  In  addition,  but to a lesser
extent, interest rate risk exists on debt and trust preferred securities issued.
Derivative  instruments  are used to manage  interest  rate risk and had a total
notional  amount as of  December  31,  2002 and 2001 of $1.1  billion  and $797,
respectively.

The principal amounts of the fixed and variable rate fixed maturity  portfolios,
along with the respective weighted average coupons by estimated maturity year at
December 31, 2002, are reflected in the following table.  Comparative totals are
included as of December 31, 2001.  Expected  maturities  differ from contractual
maturities  due to call or  prepayment  provisions.  The  WAC on  variable  rate
securities is based on spot rates as of December 31, 2002 and 2001, and is based
primarily on LIBOR.  Callable bonds and notes are primarily municipal bonds, and
are  distributed  to either  call  dates or  maturity  depending  on which  date
produces the most conservative yield.  Asset-backed  securities,  collateralized
mortgage  obligations and  mortgage-backed  securities are distributed  based on
estimates of the rate of future prepayments of principal over the remaining life
of the  securities.  These  estimates  are  developed  using  prepayment  speeds
contained in broker  consensus  data. Such estimates are derived from prepayment
speeds  previously  experienced  at  interest  rate  levels  projected  for  the
underlying  collateral.   Actual  prepayment  experience  may  vary  from  these
estimates.  Financial  instruments  with  certain  leverage  features  have been
included in each of the fixed maturity  categories.  These  instruments have not
been  separately  displayed,  as they were  immaterial  to Property & Casualty's
investment portfolio.

Equities Price Risk
- -------------------

Property & Casualty  holds a  diversified  portfolio  of  investments  in equity
securities  representing  firms in  various  countries,  industries  and  market
segments  ranging from small market  capitalization  stocks to Standard & Poor's
500 stocks.  The risk  associated  with these  securities  relates to  potential
decreases in value resulting from changes in equity prices.

The following  table reflects equity  securities  owned at December 31, 2002 and
2001, grouped by major market type.



Currency Exchange Risk
- ----------------------

Currency  exchange  risk exists with  respect to  investments  in non-US  dollar
denominated  securities.  The fair value of these fixed  maturity  securities at
December 31, 2002 and 2001 was $1 billion and $649, respectively.  In the fourth
quarter  of 2002,  the  Company  entered  into a  costless  collar  strategy  to
temporarily  mitigate  a  portion  of  its  currency  risk  in  certain  foreign
denominated securities.  Accordingly,  the Company purchased foreign put options
and wrote  foreign call options  expiring in January 2003. At December 31, 2002,
the foreign put and call options had a notional  value of $793 and fair value of
$(4). Forward foreign contracts with a notional amount of $7 were used to manage
currency exchange risk at December 31, 2001.

CORPORATE

Interest Rate Risk
- ------------------

The  primary  exposure to interest  rate risk in  Corporate  relates to the debt
issued in connection with The HLI Repurchase.

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CAPITAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Capital resources and liquidity  represent the overall financial strength of The
Hartford and its ability to generate strong cash flows from each of the business
segments,  borrow  funds at  competitive  rates and raise  new  capital  to meet
operating and growth needs. The capital structure of The Hartford as of December
31, 2002, 2001 and 2000 consisted of debt and equity, summarized as follows:



CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND COMMITMENTS

The following table identifies the Company's contractual  obligations by payment
due period.



In addition to the  contractual  obligations  above,  The  Hartford  had certain
unfunded   commitments  at  December  31,  2002  to  fund  limited   partnership
investments  totaling  $396.  These  capital  commitments  can be  called by the
partnerships  during  the  commitment  period  (on  average,  3-6 years) to fund
working  capital  needs or the purchase of new  investments.  If the  commitment
period expires and the commitment has not been fully funded, The Hartford is not
required to fund the remaining unfunded commitment but may elect to do so.

CAPITALIZATION

The Hartford  endeavors to maintain a capital structure that provides  financial
and operational flexibility to its insurance subsidiaries,  ratings that support
its competitive  position in the financial services marketplace (see the Ratings
section below for further  discussion),  and strong  shareholder  returns.  As a
result,  the Company may from time to time raise  capital  from the  issuance of
stock, debt or other capital  securities.  The issuance of common stock, debt or
other capital  securities could result in the dilution of shareholder  interests
or reduced net income due to additional interest expense.

During the third quarter of 2002, the Company  increased its  capitalization  by
$649  through  the  issuance of $330 in common  stock and $319 in equity  units.
Proceeds  of $300  were  contributed  to the  property  and  casualty  insurance
subsidiaries,   proceeds  of  $150  were   contributed  to  the  life  insurance
subsidiaries and the balance has been held for general corporate purposes, which
may include additional capital contributions to the insurance subsidiaries.

                                     - 64 -


In addition, as was the case after September 11, the Company may use the capital
markets to replace capital upon completion of its asbestos review.

During the year ended  December 31, 2002, The  Hartford's  total  capitalization
increased by $2.1 billion,  while total capitalization  excluding AOCI increased
by  $1.6  billion.   This  increase  was  a  result  of  2002  net  income;  the
aforementioned  third quarter 2002 capital raising activities;  and stock issued
related to stock  compensation  plans.  These increases were partially offset by
dividends declared.

AOCI - AOCI increased by $560 as of December 31, 2002 compared with December 31,
2001.  The increase  resulted  primarily  from the impact of decreased  interest
rates on unrealized  gains on the fixed maturity  portfolio,  the recognition of
unrealized  losses on other than  temporary  impairments  on fixed  maturity and
equity securities and the net gain on cash-flow hedging  instruments,  partially
offset by an increase in the Company's minimum pension liability adjustment.

The funded status of the Company's pension and postretirement plans is dependent
upon many factors,  including returns on invested assets and the level of market
interest  rates.  Recent  declines in the value of  securities  traded in equity
markets  coupled with declines in long-term  interest  rates have had a negative
impact on the funded status of the plans. As a result,  the Company has recorded
a minimum  pension  liability  as of December  31,  2002,  which  resulted in an
after-tax  reduction  of  stockholders'  equity of $383.  This  minimum  pension
liability did not affect the Company's results of operations.

AOCI  increased by $165 as of December 31, 2001 compared with December 31, 2000.
The increase resulted  primarily from the impact of decreased  interest rates on
unrealized gains on the fixed maturity portfolio,  the recognition of unrealized
losses  on other  than  temporary  impairments  on  fixed  maturity  and  equity
securities and the net gain on cash-flow hedging instruments.

SHELF REGISTRATION

On May 15, 2001, HLI filed with the SEC a shelf  registration  statement for the
potential  offering  and  sale  of up to $1.0  billion  in  debt  and  preferred
securities.  The registration  statement was declared effective on May 29, 2001.
As of December 31, 2002, HLI had $1.0 billion remaining on its shelf.

On  November  9, 2000,  The  Hartford  filed  with the SEC a shelf  registration
statement  and a  prospectus,  as amended  on May 21,  2002,  for the  potential
offering  and  sale of up to an  additional  $2.6  billion  in debt  and  equity
securities.  Specifically,  the registration  statement allows for the following
types of securities to be offered:  debt  securities,  preferred  stock,  common
stock,  depositary shares,  warrants,  stock purchase contracts,  stock purchase
units and junior  subordinated  deferrable  interest  debentures of the Company,
preferred  securities  of any of one or more  capital  trusts  organized  by The
Hartford ("The  Hartford  Trusts") and guarantees by the Company with respect to
the preferred securities of any of The Hartford Trusts. As of December 31, 2002,
The Hartford had $1.3 billion remaining on the shelf.

DEBT

The following discussion describes the Company's debt financing activities.  The
table below details the Company's  short-term  debt programs and the  applicable
balances outstanding.




The Hartford has a commercial  paper  program which allows the Company to borrow
up to a maximum amount of $2.0 billion in short-term  commercial paper notes. As
of December 31, 2002, the Company had $315 of outstanding  borrowings  under the
program.

On December 31, 2002, the Company and HLI entered into a joint  three-year  $490
competitive  advance and revolving credit facility comprised of 12 participating
banks,  and HLI's  previous  revolving  credit  facility was  terminated.  As of
December 31, 2002, there were no outstanding borrowings under the facility.

On  September  13, 2002,  The  Hartford  issued 6.6 million 6% equity units at a
price of  $50.00  per unit and  received  net  proceeds  of $319.  The  Hartford
contributed  $150 of the net proceeds to its  property  and  casualty  insurance
subsidiaries and $75 of the net proceeds to its life insurance subsidiaries. The
remaining balance of the net proceeds is for general corporate  purposes,  which
may include additional capital contributions to subsidiaries.

Each equity unit offered  initially  consists of a corporate  unit with a stated
amount of $50.00.  Each corporate unit consists of one purchase contract for the
sale of a certain number of shares of the Company's  stock and $50.00  principal
amount of senior notes due November 16, 2008.

The  corporate  unit  may be  converted  by the  holder  into  a  treasury  unit
consisting of the purchase contract and a 5% undivided  beneficial interest in a
zero-coupon  U.S.  Treasury

                                     - 65 -


security  with a  principal  amount of  one-thousand  dollars  that  matures  on
November 15, 2006. The holder of an equity unit owns the underlying senior notes
or treasury  portfolio but has pledged the senior notes or treasury portfolio to
the Company to secure the holder's obligations under the purchase contract.

The purchase  contract  obligates  the holder to  purchase,  and  obligates  The
Hartford to sell, on November 16, 2006, for $50.00,  a variable  number of newly
issued common shares of The Hartford.  The number of The Hartford's shares to be
issued will be determined  at the time the purchase  contracts are settled based
upon the then current price of The Hartford's  common stock. If the price of The
Hartford's  common stock is equal to or less than $47.25,  then the Company will
deliver  1.0582  shares to the  holder of the equity  unit.  If the price of The
Hartford's  common stock is greater than $47.25 but less than $57.645,  then the
Company will  deliver a fraction of shares  equal to $50.00  divided by the then
current  price of The  Hartford's  common  stock.  Finally,  if the price of The
Hartford's  common stock is equal to or greater than  $57.645,  then the Company
will deliver 0.8674 shares to the holder.  Accordingly,  upon  settlement of the
purchase  contracts on November 16, 2006, The Hartford will receive  proceeds of
approximately  $330 and will deliver  between 5.7 million and 7.0 million common
shares in the aggregate.  The proceeds will be credited to stockholders'  equity
and allocated between the common stock and additional  paid-in-capital accounts.
The Hartford will make quarterly contract adjustment payments to the equity unit
holders  at a rate of 1.90% of the stated  amount  per year  until the  purchase
contract is settled.

Each corporate unit also includes $50.00  principal  amount of senior notes that
will mature on November 16, 2008. The notes are pledged by the holders to secure
their obligations under the purchase contracts. The Hartford will make quarterly
interest  payments  to the holders of the notes  initially  at an annual rate of
4.10%.  On August 11,  2006,  the notes will be  remarketed.  At that time,  The
Hartford's remarketing agent will have the ability to reset the interest rate on
the notes in order to generate  sufficient  remarketing  proceeds to satisfy the
holder's obligation under the purchase contract. In the event of an unsuccessful
remarketing,  the Company will  exercise its rights as a secured party to obtain
and extinguish the notes.

The total  distributions  payable on the equity  units are at an annual  rate of
6.0%,  consisting of interest (4.10%) and contract  adjustment payments (1.90%).
The corporate  units are listed on the New York Stock  Exchange under the symbol
"HIG PrA".

The present  value of the contract  adjustment  payments of $23 was accrued upon
the issuance of the equity units as a charge to additional  paid-in  capital and
is included in other liabilities in the accompanying  consolidated balance sheet
as of  December  31,  2002.  Subsequent  contract  adjustment  payments  will be
allocated  between  this  liability  account  and  interest  expense  based on a
constant rate calculation over the life of the transaction.  Additional  paid-in
capital  as of  December  31,  2002  reflected  a  charge  of  approximately  $9
representing  a portion of the equity unit issuance costs that were allocated to
the purchase contracts.

The  equity  units  have  been  reflected  in the  diluted  earnings  per  share
calculation using the treasury stock method,  which would be used for the equity
units at any time before the issuance of shares of The  Hartford's  common stock
upon settlement of the purchase contracts.  Under the treasury stock method, the
number of shares of common stock used in calculating  diluted earnings per share
is  increased  by the  excess,  if any,  of the number of shares  issuable  upon
settlement  of the  purchase  contracts  over the number of shares that could be
purchased by The Hartford in the market,  at the average market price during the
period,  using the proceeds  received upon settlement.  The Company  anticipates
that there will be no dilutive  effect on its earnings per share  related to the
equity units,  except during periods when the average market price of a share of
the Company's common stock is above the threshold appreciation price of $57.645.
Because the average  market  price of The  Hartford's  common  stock  during the
period from date of issuance  through December 31, 2002 was below this threshold
appreciation price, the shares issuable under the purchase contract component of
the equity  units  have not been  included  in the  diluted  earnings  per share
calculation for the period.

On August 29, 2002, The Hartford  issued 4.7% senior notes due September 1, 2007
and received  proceeds  before  underwriting  expenses of $300.  Interest on the
notes is payable  semi-annually  on March 1 and September 1, commencing on March
1, 2003. The Company used the proceeds to repay $300 of 6.375% senior notes that
matured on November 1, 2002.

In March 2002,  the Company  borrowed  $16 of  short-term  commercial  notes for
general corporate purposes.

Effective  June 20,  2001,  The  Hartford  entered  into an amended and restated
five-year  revolving  $1.0 billion  credit  facility with fourteen  banks.  This
facility is available for general corporate  purposes and to provide  additional
support to the  Company's  commercial  paper  program.  As of December 31, 2002,
there were no outstanding borrowings under the facility.

On December 1, 2001,  The  Hartford's  8.3%  medium term notes  became due.  The
Company borrowed $200 under its commercial paper program to retire the debt.

On March 1,  2001,  HLI  issued  and sold  $400 of  senior  debt  securities  to
partially finance the Fortis acquisition.

For additional  information  regarding debt, see Note 8 of Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements.

COMPANY  OBLIGATED  MANDATORILY  REDEEMABLE  PREFERRED  SECURITIES OF SUBSIDIARY
TRUSTS  HOLDING  SOLELY  JUNIOR   SUBORDINATED   DEBENTURES   (TRUST   PREFERRED
SECURITIES)

On December 31,  2001,  The Hartford  redeemed  its  20,000,000  Series B, 8.35%
Cumulative  Quarterly Income Preferred Securities due October 30, 2026 for $500.
The Company  used  proceeds  from its  October 26, 2001  issuance of 7.45% Trust
Originated Preferred Securities, Series C to redeem the securities.

On October 26, 2001,  Hartford Capital III, a Delaware  statutory business trust
formed by The  Hartford,  issued  20,000,000  7.45% Trust  Originated  Preferred
Securities, Series C and received proceeds before underwriting expenses of $500.

On March 6,  2001,  HLI issued and sold $200 of trust  preferred  securities  to
partially finance the Fortis acquisition.

PENSION PLANS AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS

The Company maintains a U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plan (the "Plan")
that covers  substantially  all employees,  as well as unfunded  excess plans to
provide  benefits in excess of amounts  permitted to be paid to  participants of
the Plan under the provisions of the Internal  Revenue Code.  Additionally,  the
Company has entered into individual  retirement  agreements with certain current
and retired directors providing for unfunded supplemental pension benefits.

The Company made a voluntary contribution of $90 in cash to the Plan in 2001 and
made  no  contributions  in 2002  or  2000.  Pension  expense  reflected  in the
Company's  operating  earnings  was  $67,  $57 and $48 in 2002,  2001 and  2000,
respectively.   The  Company   estimates  its  2003  pension   expense  will  be
approximately $135, based on current assumptions provided below. The assumptions
that  primarily  impact  the amount of the  Company's  pension  obligations  and
periodic  pension expense are the  weighted-average  discount rate and the asset
portfolio's long-term rate of return.

In determining the discount rate assumption,  the Company  utilizes  information
provided by its plan actuaries. In particular, the Company uses an interest rate
yield curve  developed  and  published by its plan  actuaries to make  judgments
pursuant to EITF Topic No. D-36, "Selection of Discount Rates Used for Measuring
Defined Benefit Pension  Obligations and Obligations of  Postretirement  Benefit
Plans Other Than  Pensions".  The yield curve is  comprised of AAA/AA bonds with
maturities  between  zero and thirty  years.  Discounting  the cash flows of the
Company's  pension plan using this yield curve,  it was determined that 6.50% is
the appropriate discount rate as of December 31, 2002 to calculate the Company's
accrued  benefit cost  liability.  Accordingly,  as  prescribed  by SFAS No. 87,
"Employers' Accounting for Pensions",  the 6.50% discount rate will also be used
to determine the Company's 2003 pension expense.

The Company  determines the long-term  rate of return  assumption for the Plan's
asset portfolio based on analysis of the portfolio's  historical  compound rates
of return since 1979 (the earliest date for which  comparable  portfolio data is
available) over rolling 5 year, 10 year and 20 year periods, balanced along with
future long-term  return  expectations.  The Company selected these periods,  as
well as shorter durations,  to assess the portfolio's  volatility,  duration and
total returns as they relate to pension  obligation  characteristics,  which are
influenced by the Company's workforce demographics.  While the historical return
of the Plan's  portfolio  has been 10.7%  since  1979,  management  lowered  its
long-term rate of return  assumption from 9.75% to 9.00% as of December 31, 2002
based on its  long-term  outlook  with  respect to the  markets,  which has been
influenced  by the poor equity market  performance  in recent years coupled with
the recent decline in fixed income security yields during 2002.

The  Plan's  asset  portfolio  is  generally  structured  over  time to  include
approximately 60% equity securities  (substantially  securities issued by United
States-based   companies)  and  40%  fixed  income   securities   (substantially
investment  grade and above).  At December 31, 2002,  the portfolio  composition
varied from the targeted mix and was approximately 55% equity securities and 45%
fixed  income  securities  due in part to  declines  in the equity  markets  and
declining interest rates.

As provided for under SFAS No. 87, the Company uses a five-year averaging method
to determine the market-related value of Plan assets, which is used to determine
the expected return component of pension expense. Under this methodology,  asset
gains/losses  that result from returns that differ from the Company's  long-term
rate of return assumption are recognized in the  market-related  value of assets
on a level  basis over a five year  period.  Due  primarily  to the  unfavorable
performance   of  the  equity  markets  in  2001  and  2002,  the  actual  asset
return/(loss)  for the Plan was $(111) and $(119) for the years  ended  December
31, 2002 and 2001,  respectively,  as compared to an expected return of $183 and
$168 for the  years  ended  December  31,  2002 and  2001,  respectively.  These
differentials will be fully reflected in the market-related value of Plan assets
over the next five years using the methodology  described  above.  The effect of
the 2002 asset  return loss has caused the level of  unrecognized  net losses to
exceed the allowable  amortization  corridor as defined under SFAS No. 87. Based
on the selected 2003  discount  rate of 6.50% and taking into account  estimated
future minimum funding, the differential between actual and expected performance
in 2002 will increase  annual pension  expense in future years by  approximately
$10 in 2003, increasing to approximately $40 in 2007. Additionally, the decrease
in the long-term  rate of return  assumption  from 9.75%

                                     - 67 -


to 9.00% is  expected  to  increase  the  Company's  annual  pension  expense by
approximately $15.

During  2002,  the change in the  discount  rate from 7.50% (as of December  31,
2001) to 6.50%  (as of  December  31,  2002)  increased  the  projected  benefit
obligation  ("PBO") by $354.  The effect of this  increase  in PBO will serve to
increase annual pension expense by approximately $40, assuming no future changes
in discount rates going forward.

Changes in the  economic  assumptions  used to  determine  pension  expense will
impact the Company's  pension expense.  As mentioned  earlier,  the two economic
assumptions  that have the most impact on pension  expense are the discount rate
and the expected  long-term  rate of return.  To illustrate  the impact of these
assumptions  on annual pension  expense for 2003 and going  forward,  a 25 basis
point  change in the discount  rate will  increase/decrease  pension  expense by
approximately  $12,  and a 25 basis point change in the  long-term  asset return
assumption will increase/decrease pension expense by approximately $5.

While the Company has significant  discretion in making voluntary  contributions
to the Plan, the Employee  Retirement  Income  Security Act of 1974  regulations
mandate  minimum   contributions   in  certain   circumstances.   Under  current
assumptions, the 2003 required minimum funding contributions are estimated to be
approximately $40.

CASH FLOW

Cash - end of year            $     377  $     353  $     227
================================================================

2002 COMPARED TO 2001 -- The increase in cash  provided by operating  activities
was  primarily  the  result of higher  net  income  reported  for the year ended
December  31,  2002 than for the prior year as well as an increase in income tax
refunds  received in 2002  compared  with the prior year.  The  increase in cash
provided by financing  activities was primarily the result of increased proceeds
from investment and universal  life-type  contracts,  partially  offset by lower
proceeds  received  from  issuances  of common  stock and no  issuances of trust
preferred  securities in 2002.  The increase in cash from  financing  activities
accounted for the majority of the change in cash for investing activities.

2001 COMPARED TO 2000 -- The increase in cash from financing  activities was the
result of current year proceeds on investment  type  contracts  versus the prior
year  disbursements  for  investment  type  contracts and  financing  activities
related to Fortis and  September  11. Cash  provided by financing  and operating
activities  accounted  for the  majority  of the  change  in cash for  investing
activities.  The cash flows from operating activities were comparable with prior
year.

Operating  cash flows in each of the last three years have been adequate to meet
liquidity requirements.


RATINGS

Ratings are an important factor in establishing the competitive  position in the
insurance and financial services marketplace. There can be no assurance that the
Company's  ratings will  continue for any given period of time or that they will
not be changed. In the event the Company's ratings are downgraded,  the level of
revenues or the persistency of the Company's business may be adversely impacted.

The following table summarizes The Hartford's  significant  United States member
companies'  financial ratings from the major independent rating organizations as
of February 28, 2003.

On January 28, 2003, following The Hartford's announcement that it is commencing
a comprehensive review of its asbestos loss reserves, A.M. Best Co. placed under
review with negative  implications  the commercial paper and debt ratings of The
Hartford  Financial  Services  Group,  Inc.  ("HFSG")  and Hartford  Life,  Inc.
Concurrently,  the financial strength ratings of The Hartford's various life and
property and casualty subsidiaries remain unaffected.  On December 16, 2002, all
of The

                                     - 68 -


Hartford's  financial strength and debt ratings were affirmed.  The under review
status is expected to be completed in conjunction with the Company's  completion
of its asbestos reserve study prior to the end of second quarter 2003.

On January 28, 2003,  Fitch Ratings placed its fixed income ratings for HFSG and
its insurer  financial  strength ratings for The Hartford Fire Intercompany Pool
on Rating Watch  Negative.  Ratings for HFSG's life insurance  subsidiaries  and
fixed income  ratings at the life  insurance  operation's  intermediate  holding
company,  Hartford Life,  Inc.,  were not impacted by Fitch's rating actions and
remain  on  stable  outlook.   Fitch's  rating  action  followed  the  Company's
announcement  that it is commencing a comprehensive  review of its asbestos loss
reserves.   Fitch  anticipates  responding  to  the  Rating  Watch  status  upon
completion of the asbestos review or potentially sooner if certain uncertainties
are resolved earlier.

On September 19, 2002,  Fitch  Ratings  lowered the ratings of The Hartford Life
Group as part of a  comprehensive  industry  review of all North  American  life
insurance company ratings.  For The Hartford Life Group, Fitch stated the rating
action was driven  primarily  by Fitch's  opinion  that most of the very strong,
publicly owned insurance  organizations are more appropriately rated in the `AA'
rating  category.  Fitch also changed its view on the variable  annuity business
and stated that it believes that the associated risks, mainly variable earnings,
are greater than previously  considered.  Fitch's long-term fixed income ratings
on The Hartford  Financial  Services  Group,  Inc. were also lowered,  while the
affiliated  property  and  casualty  insurer  financial  strength  ratings  were
affirmed. The rating outlooks are stable.

On January 28, 2003, Moody's confirmed the ratings of HFSG and its subsidiaries,
including  the  ratings  of  Hartford   Life,   Inc.   following  the  Company's
announcement  that it is commencing a comprehensive  review of its asbestos loss
reserves. The review is expected to be completed during the second quarter 2003.
In the same action, Moody's changed the outlook on the debt ratings for both the
parent  company  and HLI to  negative  from  stable  and also  placed a negative
outlook on the insurance financial strength ratings of members of The Hartford's
property and casualty  intercompany  pool.  The  negative  outlook  reflects the
significant  uncertainty  surrounding the Company's  asbestos  liabilities.  The
outlook  for the  insurance  financial  strength  ratings  (Aa3)  for  the  life
insurance companies remains stable.

On September 4, 2002, Moody's revised its outlook on The Hartford's debt ratings
to Stable from Negative  citing The  Hartford's  commitment to  maintaining  its
capital  strength  in the  event of a  significant  unforeseen  loss or  adverse
development that would weaken its capital position.

On  November  26,  2002,   Standard  &  Poor's  removed  from   CreditWatch  its
counterparty  credit rating on The Hartford  Financial  Services Group, Inc. and
related  entities  and  lowered it to `A-' from `A'  reflecting  concerns  about
trends in the retirement and savings sector, the consolidated  capitalization of
the Company's insurance operations and the increasingly  competitive environment
for spread-based and equity-linked  retirement and savings products. At the same
time,  Standard & Poor's lowered to AA- from AA the insurance financial strength
ratings of Hartford Fire Intercompany  Pool and the life insurance  subsidiaries
of HLI.

EQUITY MARKETS

For a discussion  of the potential  impact of the equity  markets on capital and
liquidity, see the Capital Markets Risk Management section under "Market Risk".

LIQUIDITY REQUIREMENTS

The liquidity requirements of The Hartford have been and will continue to be met
by funds from  operations  as well as the issuance of commercial  paper,  common
stock, debt securities and borrowings from its credit facilities.  The principal
sources  of  operating  funds  are  premiums  and  investment  income as well as
maturities and sales of invested assets.  The Hartford Financial Services Group,
Inc. is a holding  company  which  receives  operating  cash flow in the form of
dividends from its  subsidiaries,  enabling it to service debt, pay dividends on
its common stock and pay certain business expenses.

Dividends to The Hartford  Financial  Services Group, Inc. from its subsidiaries
are restricted.  The payment of dividends by  Connecticut-domiciled  insurers is
limited under the insurance  holding  company laws of  Connecticut.  Under these
laws, the insurance  subsidiaries  may only make their dividend  payments out of
unassigned  surplus.  These laws  require  notice to and  approval  by the state
insurance  commissioner  for the declaration or payment of any dividend,  which,
together with other dividends or distributions  made within the preceding twelve
months,  exceeds the greater of (i) 10% of the insurer's policyholder surplus as
of  December  31 of the  preceding  year or (ii) net  income  (or net gain  from
operations,  if such company is a life insurance  company) for the  twelve-month
period ending on the thirty-first  day of December last preceding,  in each case
determined under statutory insurance  accounting policies.  In addition,  if any
dividend  of  a  Connecticut-domiciled  insurer

                                     - 69 -


exceeds the  insurer's  earned  surplus,  it requires the prior  approval of the
Connecticut Insurance Commissioner.

The  insurance  holding  company  laws of the other  jurisdictions  in which The
Hartford's  insurance  subsidiaries  are  incorporated  (or deemed  commercially
domiciled)  generally contain similar  (although in certain  instances  somewhat
more restrictive) limitations on the payment of dividends.

As of December 31, 2002, the maximum amount of statutory  dividends which may be
paid  to  The  Hartford  Financial  Services  Group,  Inc.  from  its  insurance
subsidiaries in 2003, without prior regulatory approval, is $1.8 billion.

The primary uses of funds are to pay claims, policy benefits, operating expenses
and commissions and to purchase new investments. In addition, The Hartford has a
policy of carrying a significant  short-term investment position and accordingly
does  not  anticipate   selling   intermediate-  and  long-term  fixed  maturity
investments  to meet any  liquidity  needs.  (For a discussion  of the Company's
investment  objectives and  strategies,  see the Investments and Capital Markets
Risk Management sections.)

TERRORISM RISK INSURANCE ACT OF 2002

On November 26, 2002,  President Bush signed the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of
2002 (the "Act") into law. The Act  established  a program that will run through
2005 that provides a backstop for  insurance-related  losses  resulting from any
"act of terrorism"  certified by the Secretary of the Treasury,  in  concurrence
with the Secretary of State and Attorney General.

The Act created a program  under which the  federal  government  will pay 90% of
covered  losses after an insurer's  losses  exceed a deductible  determined by a
statutorily  prescribed formula, up to a combined annual aggregate limit for the
federal  government and all insurers of $100 billion.  If an act of terrorism or
acts of terrorism  result in covered  losses  exceeding the $100 billion  annual
limit,  insurers with losses exceeding their deductibles will not be responsible
for additional losses.

The statutory  formula for  determining a company's  deductible for each year is
based on the company's direct  commercial earned premiums for the prior calendar
year multiplied by a specified percentage.  The specified percentages are 7% for
2003, 10% for 2004 and 15% for 2005. For example,  based on The Hartford's  2002
direct commercial earned premiums of $5 billion,  The Hartford's 2003 deductible
would be $350.

The Act applies to a significant  portion of The Hartford's  commercial property
and casualty  contracts,  but it  specifically  excludes some of The  Hartford's
other insurance business, including crop or livestock insurance, reinsurance and
personal  lines  business.  The Act  currently  does not  apply  to  group  life
insurance  contracts  but permits the  Secretary  of the  Treasury to extend the
backstop protection to them.

The Act requires all property and casualty insurers,  including The Hartford, to
make terrorism  insurance  coverage available in all of their covered commercial
property and casualty  insurance  policies (as defined in the Act). The Hartford
will  evaluate  risks  with  terrorism  exposures  by  applying  its  internally
developed  underwriting  guidelines  and control  plans.  The Hartford  does not
anticipate significant increases in premiums due to the Act.

RISK-BASED CAPITAL

The National  Association of Insurance  Commissioners  ("NAIC") has  regulations
establishing  minimum  capitalization  requirements  based on risk-based capital
("RBC")  formulas  for both  life  and  property  and  casualty  companies.  The
requirements   consist  of  formulas,   which   identify   companies   that  are
undercapitalized  and require specific regulatory  actions.  The RBC formula for
life companies establishes capital requirements relating to insurance, business,
asset and  interest  rate risks.  RBC is  calculated  for  property and casualty
companies after adjusting capital for certain  underwriting,  asset,  credit and
off-balance  sheet  risks.  As of  December  31,  2002,  each of The  Hartford's
insurance  subsidiaries  within  Life and  Property  &  Casualty  had more  than
sufficient capital to meet the NAIC's RBC requirements.

CONTINGENCIES

Legal Proceedings - The Hartford is involved in claims litigation arising in the
ordinary course of business,  both as a liability insurer defending  third-party
claims brought  against  insureds and as an insurer  defending  coverage  claims
brought  against  it.  The  Hartford  accounts  for such  activity  through  the
establishment of unpaid claim and claim adjustment expense reserves.  Subject to
the  discussion of the litigation  involving  MacArthur in Part I, Item 3. Legal
Proceedings and the uncertainties  related to asbestos and environmental  claims
discussed in the MD&A under the caption "Other  Operations,"  management expects
that the ultimate liability, if any, with respect to such ordinary-course claims
litigation,  after  consideration  of provisions  made for potential  losses and
costs of defense, will not be material to the consolidated  financial condition,
results of operations or cash flows of The Hartford.

The  Hartford is also  involved in other kinds of legal  actions,  some of which
assert claims for  substantial  amounts.  These actions  include,  among others,
putative  state and federal class actions  seeking  certification  of a state or
national  class.  Such  putative  class  actions  have  alleged,   for  example,
underpayment  of claims or improper  underwriting  practices in connection  with
various kinds of insurance policies, such as personal and commercial automobile,
premises  liability  and  inland  marine.  The  Hartford  also  is  involved  in
individual actions in which punitive damages are sought, such as claims alleging
bad faith in the  handling of  insurance  claims.  Management  expects  that the
ultimate liability,  if any, with respect to such lawsuits,  after consideration
of  provisions  made for  potential  losses  and costs of  defense,  will not be
material to the consolidated  financial condition of The Hartford.  Nonetheless,
given the large or indeterminate amounts sought in certain of these actions, and
the inherent  unpredictability  of  litigation,  it is possible  that an adverse
outcome in certain  matters could,  from time to time,  have a material  adverse
effect on the  Company's  consolidated  results of  operations  or cash flows in
particular quarterly or annual periods.

Dependence on Certain Third Party  Relationships  - The Company  distributes its
annuity,  life and certain  property and casualty  insurance  products through a
variety of distribution channels, including broker-dealers,  banks, wholesalers,
its own internal  sales force and other third party  organizations.  The Company
periodically negotiates provisions and renewals of these relationships and there
can be no  assurance  that such terms

                                     - 70 -


will remain acceptable to the Company or such third parties.  An interruption in
the Company's continuing  relationship with certain of these third parties could
materially affect the Company's ability to market its products.

LEGISLATIVE INITIATIVES

Federal  measures which have been  previously  considered or enacted by Congress
and which,  if revisited,  could affect the insurance  business  include tax law
changes  pertaining  to the  tax  treatment  of  insurance  companies  and  life
insurance  and annuity  products,  as well as changes in  individual  income tax
rates and the estate tax.  These  changes  could have an impact on the  relative
desirability of various personal investment vehicles. Legislation to restructure
the  Social  Security  system,  expand  private  pension  plans,  and create new
retirement savings incentives also may be considered.

The Bush  Administration's  fiscal year 2004 budget contains  several  proposals
that could materially affect the Company's  business.  In particular,  there are
proposals  that would more fully  integrate  corporate and  individual  taxes by
permitting  the  distribution  of  nontaxable  dividends to  shareholders  under
certain circumstances. These proposals, if enacted, could have a material effect
on sales of the  Company's  variable  annuities  and  other  retirement  savings
products,  as well as  implications  for the Company's  shareholders,  both with
respect to the amount of taxable dividends received, as well as the price of and
tax  basis in  their  holdings  of the  Company's  common  stock.  The  dividend
exclusion  proposal,  if enacted,  also would  reduce the  federal tax  benefits
currently   received  by  the  Company  stemming  from  the  dividends  received
deduction.

There also are proposals in the federal 2004 budget  submitted by President Bush
that would create new investment vehicles with larger annual contribution limits
for  individuals to use for savings  purposes.  Some of these proposed  vehicles
would have  significant tax advantages,  and could have material  effects on the
Company's product  portfolio.  There have also been proposals  regarding certain
deferred  compensation  arrangements  that  could have  negative  effects on the
Company's product sales. Prospects for enactment of this legislation in 2003 are
uncertain.  Therefore, any potential effect on the Company's financial condition
or results of operations cannot be reasonably estimated at this time.

Congress is likely to  consider a number of legal  reform  proposals  this year.
Among  them is  legislation  that would  reduce the number and type of  national
class  actions  certified  by state  judges by  updating  the  federal  rules on
diversity  jurisdiction.  Other  proposals  that will  likely be  considered  by
Congress this year include those to reform the asbestos  litigation  environment
by,  among  other  things,  implementing  medical  criteria  that must be met by
asbestos  claimants  or  establishing  an  administrative   claims  facility  to
compensate  those with  asbestos-related  injuries.  Prospects  for enactment of
these proposals in 2003 are uncertain.

INSOLVENCY FUND

In all states,  insurers  licensed to transact  certain classes of insurance are
required to become members of an insolvency  fund. In most states,  in the event
of the  insolvency  of an insurer  writing  any such class of  insurance  in the
state,  members of the fund are assessed to pay certain  claims of the insolvent
insurer.  A  particular  state's  fund  assesses  its  members  based  on  their
respective  written  premiums in the state for the classes of insurance in which
the insolvent insurer is engaged. Assessments are generally limited for any year
to one or two percent of premiums written per year depending on the state.  Such
assessments paid by The Hartford  approximated $26 in 2002, $6 in 2001 and $2 in
2000.

NAIC CODIFICATION

The  NAIC  adopted  the   Codification   of  Statutory   Accounting   Principles
("Codification") in March 1998. The effective date for the statutory  accounting
guidance  was January 1, 2001.  Each of The  Hartford's  domiciliary  states has
adopted  Codification,  and the  Company has made the  necessary  changes in its
statutory reporting required for implementation.  The impact of applying the new
guidance resulted in a benefit of approximately $400 in statutory surplus.

Hartford during the three most recent fiscal years.

ITEM 11.  EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION

The information  called for by Item 11 is set forth in the Proxy Statement under
the captions  "Compensation  of Executive  Officers" and "The Board of Directors
and its  Committees - Directors'  Compensation"  and is  incorporated  herein by
reference.

ITEM 12.  SECURITY  OWNERSHIP OF CERTAIN  BENEFICIAL  OWNERS AND  MANAGEMENT AND
RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS

Certain  of the  information  called  for by Item 12 is set  forth in the  Proxy
Statement under the caption "Stock  Ownership of Directors,  Executive  Officers
and Certain Shareholders" and is incorporated herein by reference.

The  following  table  provides  information  as of December  31, 2002 about the
securities  authorized  for issuance  under the  Company's  equity  compensation
plans.  The Company  maintains The Hartford 1995 Incentive Stock Plan (the "1995
Plan"),  The Hartford 2000 Incentive Stock Plan (the "2000 Plan"),  The Hartford
Employee  Stock  Purchase  Plan (the "ESPP"),  and The Hartford 1996  Restricted
Stock Plan for Non-Employee Directors (the "Director's Plan"), pursuant to which
it may grant  equity  awards to  eligible  persons.  In  addition,  the  Company
maintains the 2000 PLANCO Non-employee Option Plan (the "PLANCO Plan"), pursuant
to which it may grant awards to non-employee wholesalers of PLANCO products.






SUMMARY DESCRIPTION OF THE 2000 PLANCO NON-EMPLOYEE OPTION PLAN

The Company's  Board of Directors  adopted the PLANCO Plan on July 20, 2000, and
amended  it on  February  20,  2003 to  increase  the  number  of  shares of the
Company's  common stock subject to the plan to 450,000 shares.  The stockholders
of the Company have not approved the PLANCO Plan.

Eligibility - Any non-employee  independent  contractor serving on the wholesale
sales force as an insurance  agent who is an  exclusive  agent of the Company or
who  derives  more than 50% of his or her  annual  income  from the  Company  is
eligible.

Terms of options - Nonqualified  stock options  ("NQSOs") to purchase  shares of
common stock are available for grant under the PLANCO Plan. The administrator of
the PLANCO Plan, the  Compensation and Personnel  Committee,  (i) determines the
recipients  of options  under the PLANCO  Plan,  (ii)  determines  the number of
shares of common stock covered by such options,  (iii)  determines the dates and
the manner in which  options  become  exercisable  (which is  typically in three
equal  annual  installments  beginning on the first  anniversary  of the date of
grant),  (iv) sets the exercise price of options (which may be less than,  equal
to or greater  than the fair market  value of common stock on the date of grant)
and (v) determines the other terms and conditions of each option. Payment of the
exercise price may be made in cash,  other shares of the Company's  common stock
or through a same day sale program. The term of an NQSO may not exceed ten years
from the date of grant.

If an optionee's  relationship with the Company terminates for any reason, other
than for  cause,  the option  remains  exercisable  for a fixed  period of three
months,  not to exceed the  remainder of the option's  term.  If the  optionee's
relationship is terminated for cause, the options are canceled immediately.

Acceleration  in Connection  with a Change in Control - Upon the occurrence of a
change  in  control,  each  option  outstanding  on the date of such  change  in
control,  and which is not then fully vested and exercisable,  shall immediately
vest and become exercisable. In general, a "Change in Control" will be deemed to
have  occurred upon the  acquisition  of 20% or more of the  outstanding  voting
stock of the Company,  a tender or exchange  offer to acquire 15% or more of the
outstanding   voting  stock  of  the  Company,   certain  mergers  or  corporate
transactions  in which the  Company is not the  surviving  entity or a change in
greater than 50% of the Board members over a 12-month period.

See Note 11 of Notes to Consolidated  Financial  Statements for a description of
the 1995 Plan, the 2000 Plan and the ESPP.

                              REPORT OF MANAGEMENT


The  management  of  The  Hartford   Financial  Services  Group,  Inc.  and  its
subsidiaries  ("The  Hartford") is responsible for the preparation and integrity
of information contained in the accompanying  consolidated  financial statements
and other sections of the Annual Report.  The financial  statements are prepared
in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
and, where  necessary,  include amounts that are based on management's  informed
judgments and estimates. Management believes these statements present fairly The
Hartford's  financial  position  and results of  operations,  and that any other
information  contained in the Annual  Report is  consistent  with the  financial
statements.

Management has made available The Hartford's  financial records and related data
to Deloitte & Touche LLP, independent auditors, in order to perform their audits
of The Hartford's  consolidated  financial  statements.  Their report appears on
page F-2.

An essential element in meeting management's  financial  responsibilities is The
Hartford's system of internal controls. These controls, which include accounting
controls and The Hartford's  internal auditing program,  are designed to provide
reasonable assurance that assets are safeguarded,  and transactions are properly
authorized,  executed and  recorded.  The  controls,  which are  documented  and
communicated  to employees in the form of written  codes of conduct and policies
and procedures,  provide for careful  selection of personnel and for appropriate
division of  responsibility.  Management  continually  monitors for  compliance,
while The Hartford's internal auditors independently assess the effectiveness of
the controls and make recommendations for improvement.

Another important element is management's recognition and acknowledgement within
the organization of its responsibility for fostering a strong,  ethical climate,
thereby  firmly  establishing  an  expectation  that The  Hartford's  affairs be
transacted  according  to the highest  standards  of personal  and  professional
conduct.  The Hartford has a  long-standing  reputation of integrity in business
conduct and utilizes  communication and education to create and fortify a strong
compliance culture.

The Audit  Committee  of the Board of  Directors  of The  Hartford,  composed of
independent  directors,  meets  periodically  with  the  external  and  internal
auditors to evaluate the  effectiveness of work performed by them in discharging
their  respective  responsibilities  and to ensure their  independence  and free
access to the Committee.

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT



To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of
The Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc.
Hartford, Connecticut


We have audited the  accompanying  consolidated  balance  sheets of The Hartford
Financial  Services  Group,  Inc.  and  its  subsidiaries  (collectively,   "the
Company")  as of  December  31,  2002 and  2001,  and the  related  consolidated
statements of income, changes in stockholders' equity,  comprehensive income and
cash flows for each of the three years in the period  ended  December  31, 2002.
Our audits also included the financial  statement  schedules listed in the Index
at Item 15. These financial statements and financial statement schedules are the
responsibility of the Company's management.  Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these financial statements and financial statement schedules based on
our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted
in the  United  States of  America.  Those  standards  require  that we plan and
perform the audit to obtain  reasonable  assurance  about  whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a
test basis,  evidence  supporting  the amounts and  disclosures in the financial
statements.  An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant  estimates  made by  management,  as well as evaluating  the overall
financial  statement  presentation.   We  believe  that  our  audits  provide  a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion,  such consolidated  financial  statements present fairly, in all
material  respects,  the financial  position of The Hartford  Financial Services
Group,  Inc.  and its  subsidiaries  as of December  31, 2002 and 2001,  and the
results of their  operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in
the period ended  December 31, 2002, in conformity  with  accounting  principles
generally accepted in the United States of America.  Also, in our opinion,  such
financial  statement  schedules,  when  considered  in  relation  to  the  basic
consolidated  financial  statements  taken as a  whole,  present  fairly  in all
material respects the information set forth therein.

As discussed in Note 1 (d) of the consolidated financial statements, the Company
changed its method of accounting  for goodwill and  indefinite-lived  intangible
assets in 2002. In addition,  the Company  changed its method of accounting  for
derivative  instruments and hedging  activities and its method of accounting for
the  recognition  of  interest  income  and  impairment  on  purchased  retained
beneficial interests in securitized financial assets in 2001.

                   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(DOLLAR AMOUNTS IN MILLIONS, EXCEPT FOR PER SHARE DATA, UNLESS OTHERWISE STATED)


1.       BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND ACCOUNTING POLICIES

(A)      BASIS OF PRESENTATION

The Hartford  Financial  Services Group, Inc. and its consolidated  subsidiaries
("The  Hartford"  or the  "Company")  provide  investment  products and life and
property and casualty insurance to both individual and business customers in the
United States and internationally.

On April 2, 2001,  The Hartford  acquired the U.S.  individual  life  insurance,
annuity  and mutual  fund  businesses  of  Fortis,  Inc.  (operating  as "Fortis
Financial Group", or "Fortis").  The acquisition was accounted for as a purchase
transaction  and, as such, the revenues and expenses  generated by this business
from April 2, 2001 forward are included in the Company's Consolidated Statements
of Income. (For further discussion of the Fortis acquisition, see Note 18(a).)

On December 22, 2000, The Hartford  completed the sale of its  Netherlands-based
Zwolsche  Algemeene  N.V.  ("Zwolsche")  subsidiary to  Assurances  Generales de
France, a subsidiary of Allianz AG. For purposes of these consolidated financial
statements,   Zwolsche's  operating  results  are  included  in  The  Hartford's
Consolidated  Statements  of  Income  through  the  date of sale.  (For  further
discussion of this disposition, see Note 18(b).)

On June 27,  2000,  The  Hartford  acquired  all of the  outstanding  shares  of
Hartford Life, Inc. ("HLI") that it did not already own ("The HLI  Repurchase").
The accompanying consolidated financial statements reflect the minority interest
in HLI of  approximately  19%  prior to the  acquisition  date.  (For a  further
discussion of The HLI Repurchase, see Note 18(a).)

The  consolidated  financial  statements  have  been  prepared  on the  basis of
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America,  which
differ materially from the accounting prescribed by various insurance regulatory
authorities.  Less than majority-owned subsidiaries in which The Hartford has at
least a 20% interest are reported on the equity basis. All material intercompany
transactions and balances between The Hartford,  its subsidiaries and affiliates
have been eliminated.

(B)      USE OF ESTIMATES

The  preparation  of  financial   statements,   in  conformity  with  accounting
principles  generally  accepted  in  the  United  States  of  America,  requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of
assets and  liabilities  and disclosure of contingent  assets and liabilities at
the date of the financial  statements  and the reported  amounts of revenues and
expenses  during the reporting  period.  Actual  results could differ from those
estimates.

The most  significant  estimates  include  those used in  determining  reserves;
deferred  policy  acquisition  costs;  valuation of  investments  and derivative
instruments; pension and other postretirement benefits; and contingencies.

(C)      RECLASSIFICATIONS

Certain  reclassifications have been made to prior year financial information to
conform to the current year classifications.

(D)      ADOPTION OF NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

In  April  2002,  the  Financial  Accounting  Standards  Board  ("FASB")  issued
Statement of Financial  Accounting  Standards  ("SFAS") No. 145,  "Rescission of
FASB  Statements  No. 4, 44, and 64,  Amendment  of FASB  Statement  No. 13, and
Technical  Corrections".   Under  historical  guidance,  all  gains  and  losses
resulting from the extinguishment of debt were required to be aggregated and, if
material, classified as an extraordinary item, net of related income tax effect.
SFAS No. 145 rescinds  that  guidance  and  requires  that gains and losses from
extinguishments  of debt be classified as  extraordinary  items only if they are
both unusual and infrequent in occurrence. SFAS No. 145 also amends SFAS No. 13,
"Accounting for Leases" for the required  accounting  treatment of certain lease
modifications that have economic effects similar to sale-leaseback transactions.
SFAS No. 145 requires  that those lease  modifications  be accounted  for in the
same manner as sale-leaseback  transactions.  In the fourth quarter of 2002, the
Company early adopted the  provisions of SFAS No. 145 related to the  rescission
of SFAS No. 4 retroactively  and reclassified the 2001  extraordinary  loss from
early retirement of debt of $13, before-tax,  to other expenses.  The provisions
of SFAS No. 145 related to SFAS No. 13 are effective for transactions  occurring
after May 15, 2002.  Adoption of the  provisions of SFAS No. 145 related to SFAS
No. 13 did not have a material  impact on the Company's  consolidated  financial
condition or results of operations.

Effective  September  2001,  the  Company  adopted  Emerging  Issues  Task Force
("EITF") Issue No. 01-10, "Accounting for the Impact of the Terrorist Attacks of
September 11,  2001".  Under the  consensus,  costs related to the terrorist act
should be reported as part of income from  continuing  operations  and not as an
extraordinary  item.  The Company has  recognized  and classified all direct and
indirect costs associated with the attack of September 11 in accordance with the
consensus.  (For  discussion of the impact of the September 11 terrorist  attack
("September 11"), see Note 2.)

In August 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 144,  "Accounting for the Impairment or
Disposal of Long-Lived Assets". SFAS No. 144 establishes an accounting model for
long-lived  assets to be  disposed  of by sale that  applies  to all  long-lived
assets,  including  discontinued  operations.  SFAS No. 144 requires  that those
long-lived assets be measured at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less
cost to sell,  whether  reported in  continuing  operations  or in  discontinued
operations.  The  provisions  of  SFAS  No.  144  are  effective  for  financial
statements  issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2001.  Adoption
of SFAS No. 144 did not have a  material  impact on the  Company's  consolidated
financial condition or results of operations.

In June 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141,  "Business  Combinations".  SFAS No.
141 eliminates the pooling-of-

                                      F-7

(D)      ADOPTION OF NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS (CONTINUED)

interests method of accounting for business combinations, requiring all business
combinations  to be accounted for under the purchase  method.  Accordingly,  net
assets  acquired  are  recorded  at fair  value with any excess of cost over net
assets assigned to goodwill.

SFAS No. 141 also requires that certain intangible assets acquired in a business
combination be recognized  apart from  goodwill.  The provisions of SFAS No. 141
apply to all business  combinations  initiated after June 30, 2001.  Adoption of
SFAS No.  141 did not  have a  material  impact  on the  Company's  consolidated
financial condition or results of operations.

In June 2001,  the FASB  issued  SFAS No. 142,  "Goodwill  and Other  Intangible
Assets".  Under SFAS No. 142, effective January 1, 2002 amortization of goodwill
is  precluded;  however,  its  recoverability  must be  periodically  (at  least
annually) reviewed and tested for impairment.

Goodwill must be tested at the reporting  unit level for  impairment in the year
of adoption,  including an initial test performed within six months of adoption.
If the  initial  test  indicates a potential  impairment,  then a more  detailed
analysis to determine the extent of impairment  must be completed  within twelve
months of adoption.

During the second quarter of 2002, the Company completed the review and analysis
of its goodwill  asset in  accordance  with the  provisions of SFAS No. 142. The
result of the analysis  indicated that each reporting unit's fair value exceeded
its  carrying  amount,  including  goodwill.  As a  result,  goodwill  for  each
reporting unit was not considered impaired.

SFAS No. 142 also requires that useful lives for intangibles other than goodwill
be reassessed and remaining  amortization periods be adjusted accordingly.  (For
further discussion of the impact of SFAS No. 142, see Note 5.)

Effective April 1, 2001, the Company adopted EITF Issue No. 99-20,  "Recognition
of Interest Income and Impairment on Purchased and Retained Beneficial Interests
in Securitized  Financial  Assets".  Under the  consensus,  investors in certain
securities with contractual cash flows, primarily asset-backed  securities,  are
required to periodically  update their best estimate of cash flows over the life
of the security.  If the fair value of the  securitized  financial asset is less
than its carrying  amount and there has been a decrease in the present  value of
the  estimated  cash flows since the last  revised  estimate,  considering  both
timing and amount, an other than temporary impairment charge is recognized.  The
estimated  cash  flows are also used to  evaluate  whether  there  have been any
changes in the securitized  asset's  estimated yield. All yield  adjustments are
accounted for on a prospective basis. Upon adoption of EITF Issue No. 99-20, the
Company  recorded  an $11  charge  as the net of tax  cumulative  effect  of the
accounting change.

Effective  January 1, 2001, the Company  adopted SFAS No. 133,  "Accounting  for
Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities",  as amended by SFAS Nos. 137 and
138. The standard requires,  among other things, that all derivatives be carried
on the balance sheet at fair value. The standard also specifies hedge accounting
criteria under which a derivative can qualify for special  accounting.  In order
to receive special accounting, the derivative instrument must qualify as a hedge
of either  the fair  value or the  variability  of the cash flow of a  qualified
asset or liability, or forecasted transaction. Special accounting for qualifying
hedges  provides  for  matching  the timing of gain or loss  recognition  on the
hedging instrument with the recognition of the corresponding changes in value of
the hedged item.  The  Company's  policy  prior to adopting  SFAS No. 133 was to
carry its derivative instruments on the balance sheet in a manner similar to the
hedged item(s).

Upon  adoption of SFAS No. 133, the Company  recorded a $23 charge as the net of
tax cumulative effect of the accounting change.  This transition  adjustment was
primarily  comprised of gains and losses on derivatives that had been previously
deferred  and not  adjusted  to the  carrying  amount of the hedged  item.  Also
included  in  the  transition  adjustment  were  gains  and  losses  related  to
recognizing  at fair value all  derivatives  that are  designated  as fair-value
hedging  instruments  offset by the difference  between the book values and fair
values of related  hedged items  attributable  to the hedged  risks.  The entire
transition  amount was previously  recorded in Accumulated  Other  Comprehensive
Income ("AOCI") - Unrealized Gain/Loss on Securities in accordance with SFAS No.
115,  "Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities".  Gains
and losses on derivatives  that were  previously  deferred as adjustments to the
carrying amount of hedged items were not affected by the  implementation of SFAS
No. 133. Upon adoption, the Company also reclassified $24, net of tax, to AOCI -
Gain on  Cash-Flow  Hedging  Instruments  from AOCI -  Unrealized  Gain/Loss  on
Securities.  This  reclassification  reflects the January 1, 2001 net unrealized
gain for all derivatives that were designated as cash-flow hedging  instruments.
(For further discussion of the Company's derivative-related accounting policies,
see Note 1(h).)

In September  2000, the FASB issued SFAS No. 140,  "Accounting for Transfers and
Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities - a Replacement
of  FASB   Statement  No.  125".   SFAS  No.  140  revises  the  accounting  for
securitizations,  other financial  asset transfers and collateral  arrangements.
SFAS No. 140 was effective  for transfers and servicing of financial  assets and
extinguishments  of liabilities  occurring after March 31, 2001. For recognition
and  disclosure  of  collateral  and  for  additional   disclosures  related  to
securitization  transactions,  SFAS  No.  140 was  effective  for the  Company's
December 31, 2000 financial statements.  Adoption of SFAS No. 140 did not have a
material impact on the Company's  consolidated financial condition or results of
operations.

In March 2000, the FASB issued  Interpretation  No. 44,  "Accounting for Certain
Transactions  Involving  Stock  Compensation - an  Interpretation  of Accounting
Principles  Board  ("APB")  Opinion No. 25" ("FIN  44").  FIN 44  clarifies  the
application of APB Opinion No. 25,  "Accounting  for Stock Issued to Employees",
regarding  the   definition  of  employee,   the  criteria  for   determining  a
non-compensatory plan, the

                                      F-8


             NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)


1.   BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

(D)  ADOPTION OF NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS (CONTINUED)

accounting for changes to the terms of a previously fixed stock option or award,
the  accounting  for an  exchange  of stock  compensation  awards in a  business
combination and other stock compensation related issues. FIN 44 became effective
July 1, 2000, with respect to new awards,  modifications  to outstanding  awards
and changes in grantee  status that occur on or after that date. The adoption of
FIN 44 did not have a material  impact on the Company's  consolidated  financial
condition or results of operations.

Effective  January 1, 2000, The Hartford  adopted  Statement of Position ("SOP")
No. 98-7,  "Accounting  for  Insurance  and  Reinsurance  Contracts  That Do Not
Transfer Insurance Risk". This SOP provides guidance on the method of accounting
for insurance and  reinsurance  contracts that do not transfer  insurance  risk,
defined in the SOP as the  deposit  method.  Adoption of this SOP did not have a
material impact on the Company's  consolidated financial condition or results of
operations.

(E)      FUTURE ADOPTION OF NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

In January  2003,  the FASB  issued  Interpretation  No. 46,  "Consolidation  of
Variable Interest Entities" ("FIN 46") which requires an enterprise to assess if
consolidation  of an entity is  appropriate  based  upon its  variable  economic
interests in a variable  interest entity ("VIE").  The initial  determination of
whether  an  entity  is a VIE  shall be made on the date at which an  enterprise
becomes  involved  with the  entity.  A VIE is an  entity  in which  the  equity
investors do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or
do not have  sufficient  equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities
without  additional  subordinated  financial  support  from  other  parties.  An
enterprise  shall  consolidate  a VIE if it has a  variable  interest  that will
absorb a majority of the VIEs expected losses if they occur,  receive a majority
of the  entity's  expected  residual  returns if they occur or both. A direct or
indirect ability to make decisions that significantly  affect the results of the
activities of a VIE is a strong indication that an enterprise has one or both of
the characteristics that would require consolidation of the VIE.

FIN 46 is effective for new VIEs established subsequent to January 31, 2003, and
for  existing  VIEs as of July 1,  2003.  The  Hartford  invests in a variety of
investment structures that require analysis under FIN 46, including asset-backed
securities, partnerships and certain trust securities and is currently assessing
the impact of adopting FIN 46. Based upon a preliminary  review, the adoption of
FIN 46 is not  expected  to have a material  impact on the  Company's  financial
condition or results of  operations  as there were no material  VIEs  identified
which would require  consolidation.  FIN 46 further  requires the  disclosure of
certain  information  related to VIEs in which the Company  holds a  significant
variable interest.  The Company does not believe that it owns any such interests
that require disclosure at this time.

In November 2002, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 45, "Guarantor's Accounting
and Disclosure  Requirements for Guarantees,  Including  Indirect  Guarantees of
Indebtedness  of Others" ("FIN 45").  FIN 45 requires  certain  guarantees to be
recorded at fair value and also  requires a guarantor  to make new  disclosures,
even when the likelihood of making  payments  under the guarantee is remote.  In
general, the Interpretation  applies to contracts or indemnification  agreements
that contingently require the guarantor to make payments to the guaranteed party
based on changes in an underlying  that is related to an asset,  liability or an
equity security of the guaranteed  party.  The recognition  provisions of FIN 45
are effective on a prospective  basis for  guarantees  issued or modified  after
December 31, 2002.  The  disclosure  requirements  are  effective  for financial
statements of interim and annual  periods  ending after  December 15, 2002.  See
disclosures in Note 1(h),  "Other  Investment and Risk  Management  Activities -
Specific  Strategies".  Adoption  of this  statement  is not  expected to have a
material impact on the Company's  consolidated financial condition or results of
operations.

In June 2002,  the FASB issued SFAS No. 146,  "Accounting  for Costs  Associated
with Exit or Disposal  Activities",  which  addresses  financial  accounting and
reporting for costs  associated  with exit or disposal  activities and nullifies
EITF Issue No. 94-3,  "Liability  Recognition for Certain  Employee  Termination
Benefits and Other Costs to Exit an Activity  (including  Certain Costs Incurred
in a Restructuring)"  ("Issue 94-3"). The principal  difference between SFAS No.
146 and Issue 94-3 is that SFAS No. 146  requires  that a  liability  for a cost
associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is
incurred,  rather  than at the date of an entity's  commitment  to an exit plan.
SFAS No. 146 is effective  for exit or disposal  activities  after  December 31,
2002.  Adoption  of SFAS No. 146 will result in a change in the timing of when a
liability  is  recognized  if the Company  has  restructuring  activities  after
December 31, 2002.

(F)  EXPENSING STOCK OPTIONS

In December  2002,  the FASB issued SFAS No. 148,  "Accounting  for  Stock-Based
Compensation - Transition  and Disclosure and Amendment to FASB No. 123",  which
provides  three  optional   transition  methods  for  entities  that  decide  to
voluntarily  adopt  the fair  value  recognition  principles  of SFAS  No.  123,
"Accounting  for  Stock  Issued  to  Employees",  and  modifies  the  disclosure
requirements  of  SFAS  No.  123.  Under  the  prospective  method,  stock-based
compensation expense is recognized for awards granted after the beginning of the
fiscal  year in which  the  change  is made.  The  modified  prospective  method
recognizes  stock-based  compensation expense related to new and unvested awards
in the year of change  equal to that which would have been  recognized  had SFAS
No. 123 been adopted as of its  effective  date,  fiscal years  beginning  after
December  15,  1994.  The  retrospective  restatement  method  recognizes  stock
compensation costs for the year of change and restates financial  statements for
all prior periods presented as though the fair value  recognition  provisions of
SFAS No. 123 had been adopted as of its effective date.

In January 2003, the Company  adopted the fair value  recognition  provisions of
accounting for employee stock compensation.

Prior to January 2003, the Company applied the intrinsic value-based  provisions
set forth in APB Opinion No. 25. Under the

                                      F-9

             NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

(F)  EXPENSING STOCK OPTIONS (CONTINUED)

intrinsic  value method,  compensation  expense is determined on the measurement
date, which is the first date on which both the number of shares the employee is
entitled to receive, and the exercise price are known.  Compensation expense, if
any, is measured based on the award's  intrinsic  value,  which is the excess of
the market price of the stock over the exercise price on the  measurement  date.
For the years ended  December  31,  2002,  2001 and 2000,  compensation  expense
related to the Company's  stock-based  compensation plans,  including non-option
plans,  was $6,  $8 and $23  after-tax,  respectively.  The  expense,  including
non-option plans, related to stock-based employee  compensation  included in the
determination  of net income  for 2002 is less than that  which  would have been
recognized  if the fair value  method had been  applied to all awards  since the
effective date of SFAS No. 123. (For further  discussion of the Company's  stock
compensation plans, see Note 11.)

The following table  illustrates the effect on net income and earnings per share
as if the fair value  method had been  applied to all  outstanding  and unvested
awards in each period.




The fair value of each option grant was estimated on the date of the grant using
the  Black-Scholes  options-pricing  model with the following  weighted  average
assumptions  used for grants in 2002, 2001 and 2000:  dividend yield of 1.6% for
2002, 1.6% for 2001 and 1.5% for 2000;  expected price  variability of 40.8% for
2002, 29.1% for 2001 and 35.7% for 2000;  risk-free  interest rates of 4.27% for
2002 grants, 4.98% for 2001 grants and 6.41% for 2000 grants; and expected lives
of six years for 2002, six years for 2001 and four years for 2000.

(G)  INVESTMENTS

The  Hartford's  investments  in both fixed  maturities,  which  include  bonds,
redeemable  preferred stock and commercial paper, and equity  securities,  which
include common and non-redeemable preferred stocks, are classified as "available
for sale" as defined in SFAS No. 115. Accordingly,  these securities are carried
at fair value with the after-tax difference from amortized cost, as adjusted for
the effect of deducting the life and pension policyholders' share related to the
Company's immediate participation guaranteed contracts and the related change in
amortization of deferred policy  acquisition  costs,  reflected in stockholders'
equity as a component of AOCI.  Policy loans are carried at outstanding  balance
which  approximates fair value.  Other investments  consist primarily of limited
partnership  investments,  which are  accounted  for by the equity  method.  The
Company's net income from  partnerships  is included in net  investment  income.
Other  investments  also include  mortgage  loans carried at amortized  cost and
derivatives at fair value.

The fair value of securities  is based upon quoted market prices when  available
or  broker  quotations.  Where  market  prices  or  broker  quotations  are  not
available,  management  typically estimates the fair value based upon discounted
cash flows,  applying current interest rates for similar  financial  instruments
with  comparable  terms  and  credit  quality.  The  estimated  fair  value of a
financial  instrument  may differ  significantly  from the amount  that could be
realized  if the  security  was sold  immediately.  Derivative  instruments  are
reported at fair value based upon  internally  established  valuations  that are
consistent with external  valuation models,  quotations  furnished by dealers in
such instrument or market quotations.

Net realized capital gains and losses on security  transactions  associated with
the  Company's  immediate  participation  guaranteed  contracts are recorded and
offset by amounts  owed to  policyholders  and were $(1),  $(1) and $(9) for the
years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000,  respectively.  Under the terms of
the  contracts,  the net realized  capital  gains and losses will be credited to
policyholders in future years as they are entitled to receive them. Net realized
capital gains and losses,  after  deducting the life and pension  policyholders'
share and related  amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs for certain
Life  products,  are reported as a component of revenues and are determined on a
specific identification basis.

The  Company's  accounting  policy  requires  that a  decline  in the value of a
security  below its amortized cost basis be assessed to determine if the decline
is other than  temporary.  If so, the  security is deemed to be  impaired  and a
charge is  recorded  in net  realized  capital  losses  equal to the  difference
between the fair value and amortized cost basis of the security.  The fair value
of the impaired investment becomes its new cost basis.

(G)  INVESTMENTS (CONTINUED)

The  Company  has a security  monitoring  process  overseen  by a  committee  of
investment and accounting  professionals that identifies securities that, due to
certain  characteristics,  are subjected to an enhanced  analysis on a quarterly
basis. Such characteristics  include, but are not limited to: a deterioration of
the financial  condition of the issuer, the magnitude and duration of unrealized
losses, credit rating and industry category.

The primary  factors  considered  in  evaluating  whether a decline in value for
fixed income and equity  securities  is other than  temporary  include:  (a) the
length of time and the  extent to which the fair  value has been less than cost,
(b) the financial  conditions and near-term prospects of the issuer, (c) whether
the  debtor  is  current  on  contractually  obligated  interest  and  principal
payments, and (d) the intent and ability of the Company to retain the investment
for a  period  of  time  sufficient  to  allow  for  any  anticipated  recovery.
Additionally,  for certain  securitized  financial  assets with contractual cash
flows  (including  asset-backed  securities),  EITF Issue No. 99-20 requires the
Company to periodically  update its best estimate of cash flows over the life of
the security.  If management  determines  that the fair value of its securitized
financial  asset is less than its carrying  amount and there has been a decrease
in the  present  value of the  estimated  cash  flows  since  the  last  revised
estimate,  considering  both  timing and  amount,  then an other than  temporary
impairment  charge is recognized.  Furthermore,  for  securities  expected to be
sold,  an other than  temporary  impairment  charge is recognized if the Company
does not expect  the fair  value of a  security  to recover to cost prior to the
expected date of sale. Once an impairment charge has been recorded,  the Company
then  continues to review the other than  temporarily  impaired  securities  for
appropriate valuation on an ongoing basis.

(H)  DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS

Overview
- --------

The Company utilizes a variety of derivative instruments, including swaps, caps,
floors,  forwards and exchange  traded  futures and options  through one of four
Company-approved  objectives: to hedge risk arising from interest rate, price or
currency exchange rate volatility;  to manage liquidity;  to control transaction
costs; or to enter into income enhancement and replication transactions.

All of the Company's  derivative  transactions are permitted uses of derivatives
under the  derivatives  use plan filed and/or  approved,  as applicable,  by the
State of Connecticut  and State of New York insurance  departments.  The Company
does not make a market or trade in these  instruments for the express purpose of
earning short-term trading profits.

Accounting and Financial  Statement  Presentation of Derivative  Instruments and
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hedging Activities
- ------------------

Effective  January 1, 2001, and in accordance with SFAS No. 133, all derivatives
are  recognized  on the  balance  sheet at  their  fair  value.  On the date the
derivative  contract is entered into,  the Company  designates the derivative as
(1) a hedge of the fair value of a recognized  asset or liability  ("fair value"
hedge),  (2) a hedge of a forecasted  transaction or of the  variability of cash
flows  to be  received  or paid  related  to a  recognized  asset  or  liability
("cash-flow"  hedge),  (3) a  foreign-currency,  fair value or  cash-flow  hedge
("foreign-currency"  hedge),  (4) a  hedge  of a  net  investment  in a  foreign
operation or (5) held for other investment and risk management activities, which
primarily involve managing asset or liability related risks which do not qualify
for  hedge  accounting  under  SFAS No.  133.  Changes  in the  fair  value of a
derivative  that is designated and qualifies as a fair-value  hedge,  along with
the gain or loss on the hedged asset or liability  that is  attributable  to the
hedged risk,  are recorded in current  period  earnings as net realized  capital
gains and losses.  Changes in the fair value of a derivative  that is designated
and  qualifies as a cash-flow  hedge are  recorded in AOCI and are  reclassified
into earnings when earnings are impacted by the  variability of the cash flow of
the hedged item.  Changes in the fair value of  derivatives  that are designated
and qualify as  foreign-currency  hedges are recorded in either  current  period
earnings or AOCI,  depending on whether the hedged  transaction  is a fair value
hedge or a cash-flow  hedge.  If, however,  a derivative is used as a hedge of a
net investment in a foreign operation,  its changes in fair value, to the extent
effective  as  a  hedge,  are  recorded  in  the  foreign  currency  translation
adjustments account within  stockholders'  equity.  Changes in the fair value of
derivative  instruments held for other  investment and risk management  purposes
are  reported in current  period  earnings  as net  realized  capital  gains and
losses.  As of December 31, 2002, and 2001,  the Company  carried $299 and $138,
respectively,  of  derivative  assets  in other  investments  and $208 and $208,
respectively, of derivative liabilities in other liabilities.

Hedge Documentation and Effectiveness Testing
- ---------------------------------------------

At hedge inception,  the Company formally  documents all  relationships  between
hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as its  risk-management  objective
and strategy for  undertaking  each hedge  transaction.  In connection  with the
implementation  of SFAS No. 133, the Company  designated anew all existing hedge
relationships.  The documentation  process includes linking all derivatives that
are designated as fair value,  cash-flow or foreign-currency  hedges to specific
assets  and  liabilities  on  the  balance  sheet  or  to  specific   forecasted
transactions.  The Company also formally assesses, both at the hedge's inception
and on an  ongoing  basis,  whether  the  derivatives  that are used in  hedging
transactions are highly  effective in offsetting  changes in fair values or cash
flows of hedged items.  At inception,  and on a quarterly  basis,  the change in
value of the hedging  instrument  and the change in value of the hedged item are
measured to assess the validity of maintaining special hedge accounting. Hedging
relationships  are considered  highly effective if the changes in the fair value
or discounted cash flows of the hedging instrument are within a ratio of 80-125%
of the inverse  changes in the fair value or discounted cash flows of the hedged
item. Hedge effectiveness is evaluated primarily based on regression analysis or
the  cumulative  change in cash flow or fair  value,  as  appropriate.  If it is
determined  that a derivative  is no longer  highly  effective  as a hedge,  the
Company  discontinues hedge accounting in the period in which  effectiveness was
lost  and  prospectively,  as  discussed  below  under  discontinuance  of hedge
accounting.

Credit Risk
- -----------

The Company's derivatives  counterparty exposure policy establishes market-based
credit limits,  favors long-term financial stability and  creditworthiness,  and
typically requires credit  enhancement/credit risk reducing agreements. By using
derivative instruments, the Company is exposed to credit risk, which is measured
as the  amount  owed to the  Company  based on  current  market  conditions  and
potential payment obligations  between the Company and its counterparties.  When
the fair value of a derivative  contract is positive,  this  indicates  that the
counterparty  owes the Company,  and,  therefore,  exposes the Company to credit
risk.  Credit  exposures  are  generally   quantified  weekly  and  netted,  and
collateral is pledged to and held by, or on behalf of, the Company to the extent
the current value of derivatives exceeds exposure policy thresholds. The Company
also  minimizes  the credit risk in  derivative  instruments  by  entering  into
transactions with high quality  counterparties that are reviewed periodically by
the Company's internal compliance unit, reviewed frequently by senior management
and reported to the Company's Finance  Committee of the Board of Directors.  The
Company also maintains a policy of requiring  that all  derivative  contracts be
governed by an International Swaps and Derivatives  Association Master Agreement
which is  structured  by legal entity and by  counterparty  and permits right of
offset.

Embedded Derivatives
- --------------------

The Company occasionally  purchases or issues financial instruments that contain
a derivative instrument that is embedded in the financial instrument. When it is
determined that (1) the embedded derivative  possesses economic  characteristics
that are not clearly and closely related to the economic  characteristics of the
host contract,  and (2) a separate  instrument with the same terms would qualify
as a derivative instrument,  the embedded derivative is bifurcated from the host
for measurement  purposes.  The embedded derivative,  which is reported with the
host instrument,  is carried at fair value with changes in value reported in net
realized capital gains and losses.

Discontinuance of Hedge Accounting
- ----------------------------------

The  Company  discontinues  hedge  accounting   prospectively  when  (1)  it  is
determined  that the  derivative  is no longer  highly  effective in  offsetting
changes in the fair value or cash flows of a hedged item;  (2) the derivative is
dedesignated  as a hedge  instrument,  because it is unlikely  that a forecasted
transaction will occur; or (3) the derivative expires or is sold, terminated, or
exercised.  When hedge accounting is discontinued  because it is determined that
the  derivative  no longer  qualifies  as an  effective  fair-value  hedge,  the
derivative  continues  to be  carried at fair  value on the  balance  sheet with
changes in its fair value recognized in current period earnings.  The changes in
the fair  value of the  hedged  asset or  liability  are no longer  recorded  in
earnings.  When hedge  accounting is  discontinued  because the Company  becomes
aware that it is probable  that a  forecasted  transaction  will not occur,  the
derivative  continues to be carried on the balance sheet at its fair value,  and
gains and losses that were  accumulated  in AOCI are  recognized  immediately in
earnings. In all other situations in which hedge accounting is discontinued on a
cash-flow  hedge,  including  those where the derivative is sold,  terminated or
exercised,  amounts previously deferred in AOCI are amortized into earnings when
earnings are impacted by the variability of the cash flow of the hedged item.

SFAS No. 133 Categorization of the Company's Hedging Activities
- ---------------------------------------------------------------

Cash-Flow Hedges

General

For the years ended  December 31, 2002 and 2001,  the Company's  gross gains and
losses  representing  the total  ineffectiveness  of all  cash-flow  hedges were
immaterial,  with the net impact  reported  as net  realized  capital  gains and
losses.

Gains and losses on  derivative  contracts  that are  reclassified  from AOCI to
current period earnings are included in the line item in the statement of income
in which the hedged  item is  recorded.  As of December  31, 2002 and 2001,  the
after-tax deferred net gains on derivative instruments  accumulated in AOCI that
are expected to be reclassified to earnings during the next twelve months are $7
and $2,  respectively.  This  expectation is based on the  anticipated  interest
payments on hedged investments in fixed maturity securities that will occur over
the next twelve  months,  at which time the Company will  recognize the deferred
net  gains/losses  as an  adjustment  to  interest  income  over the term of the
investment  cash flows.  The maximum  term over which the Company is hedging its
exposure  to  the   variability   of  future  cash  flows  (for  all  forecasted
transactions,  excluding  interest  payments  on  variable-rate  debt) is twelve
months.  As of December 31, 2002 and 2001, the Company held derivative  notional
value related to strategies  categorized as cash-flow hedges of $3.2 billion and
$2.6 billion,  respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001, the
net reclassifications from AOCI to earnings resulting from the discontinuance of
cash-flow hedges were immaterial.

Specific Strategies

The Company's primary use of cash-flow hedging is to use interest-rate  swaps as
an  "asset  hedging"  strategy,   in  order  to  convert  interest  receipts  on
floating-rate  fixed maturity  investments to fixed rates.  When multiple assets
are designated in a hedging  relationship under SFAS No. 133, a homogeneity test
is  performed  to ensure that the assets  react  similarly  to changes in market
conditions.  To satisfy  this  requirement,  at  inception  of the hedge,  fixed
maturity  investments  with identical  variable rates are grouped  together (for
example, 1-month LIBOR or 3-month LIBOR, not both).

The Company  enters into  "receive  fixed/pay  variable"  interest rate swaps to
hedge the variability in the first  LIBOR-based  interest  payments  received on
each pool of eligible variable rate fixed maturity investments.  Ineffectiveness
is measured by comparing  the present value of the variable rate pay side of the
swaps to the  present  value of the first  anticipated  variable  rate  interest
receipts on the hedged  fixed  maturity  investments.  At December  31, 2002 and
2001, the Company held $2.7 billion

and $2.0 billion,  respectively,  in derivative  notional  value related to this
strategy.

The Company enters into foreign  currency swaps to hedge the variability in cash
flow associated with certain foreign denominated fixed maturity investments. The
foreign  currency swap  agreements are structured to match the foreign  currency
cash  flows  of  the  foreign  denominated  fixed  maturity  investments  (i.e.,
par/notional value,  currency,  initial cost, maturity date, and payment dates).
If hedge ineffectiveness  exists, it is recorded as net realized capital gain or
loss.  Notional  value of foreign  currency  swaps at December 31, 2002 and 2001
totaled $389 and $147, respectively.

Fair-Value Hedges

General

For the years ended  December 31, 2002 and 2001,  the Company's  gross gains and
losses  representing  the total  ineffectiveness  of all fair-value  hedges were
immaterial,  with the net impact  reported  as net  realized  capital  gains and
losses.  All  components of each  derivative's  gain or loss are included in the
assessment of hedge effectiveness. As of December 31, 2002 and 2001, the Company
held $800 and $899,  respectively,  in  derivative  notional  value  related  to
strategies categorized as fair-value hedges.

Specific Strategies

During  2001,  the  Company  entered  into a callable  interest  rate swap as an
economic  hedge of a  portion  of its Trust  Preferred  Securities  issued.  The
interest  rate swap  agreement was  structured  to exactly  offset the terms and
conditions of the hedged trust preferred securities (i.e.,  notional value, call
provisions, maturity date, and payment dates) and has been designated as a hedge
of the benchmark interest rate (i.e., LIBOR). The calculation of ineffectiveness
involves a  comparison  of the  present  value of the  cumulative  change in the
expected  future cash flows on the interest  rate swap and the present  value of
the  cumulative  change in the  expected  future cash flows on the hedged  trust
preferred  securities.  If hedge  ineffectiveness  exists, it is recorded as net
realized  capital gain or loss. At December 31, 2002 and 2001,  the Company held
$500 in derivative notional value related to this strategy.

The Company purchases interest rate caps and sells interest rate floor contracts
in an "asset hedging"  strategy utilized to offset  corresponding  interest rate
caps and  floors  that  exist in certain  of its  variable-rate  fixed  maturity
investments. The standalone interest rate cap and floor contracts are structured
to  offset  those  embedded  in  the  hedged  investment.   The  calculation  of
ineffectiveness  involves a comparison  of the present  value of the  cumulative
change in the expected  future cash flows on the interest rate cap/floor and the
present  value of the  cumulative  change in the expected  future  interest cash
flows that are hedged on the fixed maturity investment. If hedge ineffectiveness
exists,  it is  recorded  as net  realized  capital  gain or  loss.  All  hedges
involving  variable rate bonds with  embedded  interest rate caps and floors are
perfectly matched with respect to par/notional values,  payment dates, maturity,
index, and the hedge  relationship does not contain any other basis differences.
No  component  of the  hedging  instruments  fair  value  is  excluded  from the
determination of effectiveness.  At December 31, 2002 and 2001, the Company held
$180 and $200,  respectively,  in  derivative  notional  value  related  to this
strategy.

The Company enters into swaption  arrangements  in an "asset  hedging"  strategy
utilized  to offset  the change in the fair value of call  options  embedded  in
certain  of  its  investments  in  municipal  fixed  maturity  investments.  The
swaptions give the Company the option to enter into a "receive  fixed" swap. The
swaption's  exercise dates  coincide with the municipal  fixed  maturity's  call
dates,  and the receive side of the swaps closely matches the coupon rate on the
original municipal fixed maturity investment. The purpose of the swaptions is to
ensure a fixed return over the original  term to maturity.  Should the municipal
fixed maturity  investment be called,  the swaptions  would be either settled in
cash or  exercised.  The proceeds  from the call are used to purchase a variable
rate fixed  maturity  investment.  If the bonds are not  called,  the  swaptions
expire  worthless.   Each  swaption  contract  hedges  multiple  fixed  maturity
investments  containing embedded call options.  These fixed maturity investments
are subdivided into portfolio  hedges. In accordance with SFAS No. 133, a stress
test is performed at the inception of the hedge to prove the homogeneity of each
portfolio  (with regard to the risk being hedged) and thereby qualify that hedge
for special hedge accounting treatment.  Correlation  calculations are performed
at various  interest  rate levels  comparing  the total change in the  aggregate
value of the  embedded  calls in the hedged  portfolio to the change in value of
the embedded call in each individual fixed maturity investment in the portfolio.
The  correlation  statistic  for  homogeneity  must be within a range of 0.85 to
1.00.  Regression  calculations  are  performed  quarterly to validate  that the
changes  in value of the  swaption  offset the  inverse  changes in value of the
aggregate  embedded  bond  call  option,  within a range  of 0.80 to  1.25.  The
calculation of ineffectiveness involves a comparison of the cumulative change in
fair value of the embedded call option with the cumulative  change in fair value
of the swaption.  Ineffectiveness  is reported as net realized capital gains and
losses. No component of the hedging instruments' fair value is excluded from the
determination of effectiveness.  At December 31, 2002 and 2001, the Company held
$90 and  $133,  respectively,  in  derivative  notional  value  related  to this
strategy.

Other Investment and Risk Management Activities

General

The Company's other investment and risk management  activities  primarily relate
to strategies used to reduce economic risk or enhance income, and do not receive
hedge  accounting  treatment.  Swap  agreements,  interest  rate  cap and  floor
agreements  and  option  contracts  are used to  reduce  economic  risk.  Income
enhancement and replication transactions include

General (continued)

the use of written  covered  call  options,  which offset  embedded  equity call
options,   total  return  swaps  and  synthetic   replication   of  cash  market
instruments.  The  change  in  the  value  of all  derivatives  held  for  other
investment and risk  management  purposes is reported in current period earnings
as realized  capital gains or losses.  For the years ended December 31, 2002 and
2001,  the Company  recognized  an after-tax net gain of $6 and an after-tax net
loss of $23, respectively, (reported as net realized capital gains and losses in
the statement of income),  which represented the total change in value for other
derivative-based strategies which do not qualify for hedge accounting under SFAS
No. 133. As of December  31, 2002 and 2001,  the Company  held $6.8  billion and
$4.6 billion,  respectively,  in derivative notional value related to strategies
categorized as Other Investment and Risk Management Activities.

Specific Strategies

The Company issues liability contracts in which policyholders have the option to
surrender  their  policies at book value and that  guarantee a minimum  credited
rate of interest.  Typical  products  with these  features  include  Whole Life,
Universal  Life and  Repetitive  Premium  Variable  Annuities.  The Company uses
interest rate cap and swaption  contracts as an economic  hedge,  classified for
internal purposes as a "liability hedge",  thereby mitigating the Company's loss
in a rising interest rate  environment.  The Company is exposed to the situation
where  interest  rates rise and the  Company  is not able to raise its  credited
rates to competitive  yields.  The policyholder can then surrender at book value
while the underlying bond portfolio may experience a loss. The increase in yield
in a rising interest rate  environment due to the interest rate cap and swaption
contracts  may be  used  to  raise  credited  rates,  increasing  the  Company's
competitiveness  and reducing the  policyholder's  incentive  to  surrender.  In
accordance with Company policy, the amount of notional value will not exceed the
book  value of the  liabilities  being  hedged  and the  term of the  derivative
contract will not exceed the average maturity of the liabilities. As of December
31, 2002 and 2001, the Company held $516 in derivative notional value related to
this strategy.

When  terminating  certain  hedging  relationships,  the  Company  will  enter a
derivative  contract with terms and conditions that directly offset the original
contract,  thereby  offsetting its changes in value from that date forward.  The
Company  de-designates  the  original  contract  and  prospectively  records the
changes in value of both the original  contract and the new offsetting  contract
through net realized  capital  gains and losses.  At December 31, 2002 and 2001,
the Company  held $2.5 billion and $2.0  billion,  respectively,  in  derivative
notional value related to this strategy.

Periodically,  the  Company  enters  into swap  agreements  in which the Company
assumes credit  exposure from a single entity,  referenced  index or asset pool.
These  arrangements are entered into to modify portfolio duration or to increase
diversification while controlling  transaction costs. The Company assumes credit
exposure to individual  entities  through credit default swaps. In assuming this
obligation,  the Company  receives a periodic fee. These contracts  obligate the
Company to compensate  the derivative  counterparty  in the event of bankruptcy,
failure to pay or  restructuring,  and in return,  the  Company  receives a debt
obligation of the referenced  entity.  This debt  obligation may then be sold to
offset the  payment  made to the  counterparty.  The  maximum  potential  future
exposure  to the  Company  is the  notional  value of the swap  contracts,  $137
after-tax  as of  December  31,  2002.  The  market  value  of these  swaps  was
immaterial  at December 31, 2002.  The Company did not transact  credit  default
swaps in 2001.  The term of the credit  default swaps range from 3-5 years.  The
Company  also  assumes  exposure to the change in value of the Lehman CMBS index
and an asset pool through total return swaps.  As of December 31, 2002 and 2001,
the  maximum  potential  future  exposure  to the  Company  is  $291  and  $166,
after-tax,  respectively.  The market  value of these swaps at December 31, 2002
and 2001 was a loss of $79 and $105,  respectively,  which was  reported  on the
consolidated  balance sheet in Other  Liabilities.  The term of the total return
swaps  range  from 6 months to 10 years.  At  December  31,  2002 and 2001,  the
Company held $915 and $687,  respectively,  in derivative notional value related
to this strategy.

The Company issues an option in an "asset hedging" strategy utilized to monetize
the option  embedded in certain of its fixed maturity  investments.  The Company
receives a premium for  issuing  the  freestanding  option.  The written  option
grants the holder the ability to call the bond at a predetermined  strike value.
The maximum  potential future economic  exposure is represented by the then fair
value of the bond in  excess  of the  strike  value,  which  is  expected  to be
entirely  offset by the  appreciation  in the value of the embedded long option.
The  structure  is  designed  such  that  the  fixed  maturity   investment  and
freestanding  option have  identical  expected  lives,  typically 2-5 years.  At
December  31, 2002 and 2001,  the Company held $473 and $580,  respectively,  in
derivative  notional value related to the written option and held $473 and $580,
respectively, of derivative notional value related to the embedded option.

Periodically, in order to mitigate its foreign currency risk, the Company enters
into a costless collar strategy.  Accordingly, the Company purchases foreign put
options and writes foreign call options to hedge the foreign currency  exposures
in certain of its foreign fixed maturity investments.  At December 31, 2002, the
maximum potential exposure to the Company was $3 after-tax. At December 31, 2002
and 2001,  the Company held $1.1  billion and $0,  respectively,  in  derivative
notional  value  related to this  strategy.  The term of the  options is up to 4
months.

During 2002, the Company  purchased an interest rate cap as an economic hedge to
minimize interest rate risk on Trust Preferred Securities.  In a rising interest
rate  environment,  the  cap  will  limit  the  interest  rate to be paid on the
interest rate swap that is  designated as a fair value hedge of Trust  Preferred
Securities.  At December 31, 2002, the Company held $500 in derivative  notional
value related to this strategy.

             NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)


1.   BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

(I)  SEPARATE ACCOUNTS

The  Company  maintains  separate  account  assets  and  liabilities,  which are
reported  at fair  value.  Separate  account  assets are  segregated  from other
investments,  and investment  income and gains and losses accrue directly to the
policyholders.  Separate  accounts  reflect two  categories of risk  assumption:
non-guaranteed   separate  accounts,   wherein  the  policyholder   assumes  the
investment  risk,  and  guaranteed   separate  accounts,   wherein  the  Company
contractually  guarantees a minimum return to the policyholder.  The fees earned
for administrative and contractholder  maintenance  services performed for these
separate accounts are included in fee income.

(J)  DEFERRED POLICY ACQUISITION COSTS

LIFE - Policy  acquisition  costs,  which include  commissions and certain other
expenses that vary with and are primarily  associated  with acquiring  business,
are deferred and amortized over the estimated lives of the contracts, usually 20
years.  The  deferred  costs are  recorded as an asset  commonly  referred to as
deferred policy  acquisition  costs ("DAC").  At December 31, 2002 and 2001, the
carrying value of the Company's Life  operations'  DAC was $5.2 billion and $5.0
billion, respectively.

DAC related to traditional policies are amortized over the premium-paying period
in  proportion  to  the  present  value  of  annual  expected   premium  income.
Adjustments  are made each year to recognize  actual  experience  as compared to
assumed experience for the current period.

DAC related to  investment  contracts  and  universal  life-type  contracts  are
deferred  and  amortized  using  the  retrospective  deposit  method.  Under the
retrospective  deposit method,  acquisition costs are amortized in proportion to
the present value of estimated gross profits ("EGPs") from projected investment,
mortality  and  expense  margins  and  surrender  charges.  A portion of the DAC
amortization is allocated to realized gains and losses.  The DAC balance is also
adjusted by an amount that  represents  the change in  amortization  of deferred
policy  acquisition costs that would have been required as a charge or credit to
operations had unrealized  amounts been realized.  Actual gross profits can vary
from management's estimates,  resulting in increases or decreases in the rate of
amortization.

The Company  regularly  evaluates  its  estimated  gross profits to determine if
actual  experience or other evidence  suggests that earlier  estimates should be
revised.  Several assumptions considered to be significant in the development of
EGPs include  separate  account  fund  performance,  surrender  and lapse rates,
estimated  interest spread and estimated  mortality.  The separate  account fund
performance assumption is critical to the development of the EGPs related to the
Company's  variable annuity and variable and  interest-sensitive  life insurance
businesses.  The  average  long-term  rate  of  assumed  separate  account  fund
performance  used in  estimating  gross  profits  for the  variable  annuity and
variable  life  business was 9% at December 31, 2002 and December 31, 2001.  For
all other  products  including  fixed  annuities and other  universal  life type
contracts the average  assumed  investment  yield ranged from 5% to 8.5% for the
years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001.

Due to the increased  volatility and precipitous decline experienced by the U.S.
equity markets in 2002, the Company  enhanced its DAC evaluation  process during
the  course  of  the  year.  The  Company   developed   sophisticated   modeling
capabilities, which allowed it to run 250 stochastically determined scenarios of
separate  account  fund  performance.  These  scenarios  were then  utilized  to
calculate a reasonable  range of estimates for the present value of future gross
profits.  This  range is then  compared  to the  present  value of future  gross
profits  currently  utilized in the DAC  amortization  model. As of December 31,
2002, the current estimate falls within the reasonable range, and therefore, the
Company does not believe  there is evidence to suggest a revision to the EGPs is
necessary.

Additionally,  the Company  has  performed  various  sensitivity  analyses  with
respect to separate  account fund performance to provide an indication of future
separate  account  fund  performance  levels,  which could result in the need to
revise future EGPs. The Company has estimated that a revision to the future EGPs
is  unlikely in 2003 in the event that the  separate  account  fund  performance
meets or exceeds the Company's long-term assumption of 9% and that a revision is
likely if the overall  separate  ACCOUNT  fund  performance  is negative for the
year. In the event that separate account fund  performance  falls between 0% and
9% during  2003,  the Company  will need to evaluate  the actual  gross  profits
versus the mean EGPs  generated by the  stochastic  DAC  analysis and  determine
whether  or not to  make a  revision  to the  future  EGPs.  Factors  that  will
influence  this  determination  include  the degree of  volatility  in  separate
account fund performance,  when during the year performance becomes negative and
shifts in asset allocation  within the separate  account made by  policyholders.
The overall  return  generated by the  separate  account is dependent on several
factors,  including the relative mix of the underlying  sub-accounts  among bond
funds  and  equity  funds as well as equity  sector  weightings.  The  Company's
overall separate account fund performance has been reasonably  correlated to the
overall performance of the S&P 500 Index,  although no assurance can be provided
that this correlation will continue in the future.

Should the Company  change its  assumptions  utilized to develop EGPs  (commonly
referred to as  "unlocking")  the Company  would  record a charge (or credit) to
bring its DAC  balance to the level it would have been had EGPs been  calculated
using the new assumptions  from the date of each policy.  The Company  evaluates
all critical  assumptions  utilized to develop EGPs (e.g. lapse,  mortality) and
will make a revision  to future EGPs to the extent  that  actual  experience  is
significantly different than expected.

The  overall  recoverability  of the  DAC  asset  is  dependent  on  the  future
profitability of the business. The Company tests the aggregate recoverability of
the DAC asset by  comparing  the DAC to total  EGPs.  In  addition,  the Company
routinely stress tests its DAC asset for recoverability  against severe declines
in its  separate  account  assets,  which  could  occur  if the  equity  markets
experienced  another  significant  sell-off,  as the majority of  policyholders'
money held in the  separate  accounts is invested  in the equity  market.  As of
December 31, 2002, the Company believed its DAC asset was recoverable.

(J)      DEFERRED POLICY ACQUISITION COSTS (CONTINUED)

PROPERTY &  CASUALTY - The  Property  &  Casualty  operations  also incur  costs
including  commissions,  premium  taxes  and  certain  underwriting  and  policy
issuance costs,  that vary with and are related  primarily to the acquisition of
property casualty insurance business and are deferred and amortized ratably over
the period the related  premiums  are  earned.  Deferred  acquisition  costs are
reviewed to determine if they are  recoverable  from future income,  and if not,
are charged to  expense.  Anticipated  investment  income is  considered  in the
determination of the recoverability of deferred acquisition costs. For the years
ended  December  31,  2002,  2001  and  2000 no  material  amounts  of  deferred
acquisition  costs  were  charged  to  expense  based  on the  determination  of
recoverability.

(K)      RESERVE FOR FUTURE POLICY BENEFITS,  UNPAID CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT
         EXPENSES

Life insurance  subsidiaries of The Hartford  establish and carry as liabilities
actuarially  determined  reserves,  which are  calculated to meet The Hartford's
future  obligations.  Reserves for life insurance and  disability  contracts are
based on actuarially recognized methods using prescribed morbidity and mortality
tables in general use in the United  States,  which are  modified to reflect The
Hartford's actual  experience when  appropriate.  These reserves are computed at
amounts that,  with additions  from  estimated  premiums to be received and with
interest on such reserves  compounded  annually at certain  assumed  rates,  are
expected to be sufficient to meet The  Hartford's  policy  obligations  at their
maturities or in the event of an insured's  disability  or death.  Reserves also
include unearned  premiums,  premium deposits,  claims incurred but not reported
and claims  reported  but not yet paid.  Reserves  for assumed  reinsurance  are
computed in a manner that is comparable to direct insurance reserves.

Liabilities  for future  policy  benefits are computed by the net level  premium
method using  interest  assumptions  ranging from 3% to 11% and  withdrawal  and
mortality  assumptions  appropriate at the time the policies were issued.  Claim
reserves,  which  are the  result  of sales of group  long-term  and  short-term
disability, stop loss, and Medicare supplement, are stated at amounts determined
by estimates on individual  cases and  estimates of  unreported  claims based on
past experience.

The following table displays the development of the claim reserves  (included in
reserve for future policy benefits in the Consolidated Balance Sheets) resulting
primarily from group disability products.

(L)      RESERVE FOR UNPAID CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES

The  Hartford  establishes  property  and  casualty  reserves to provide for the
estimated  costs of paying  claims made under  policies  written by the Company.
These  reserves  include  estimates  for both claims that have been reported and
those that have been  incurred but not  reported,  and include  estimates of all
expenses  associated with  processing and settling these claims.  Estimating the
ultimate cost of future claims and claim adjustment expenses is an uncertain and
complex  process.   This  estimation  process  is  based  significantly  on  the
assumption that past developments are an appropriate predictor of future events,
and involves a variety of actuarial  techniques that analyze experience,  trends
and other  relevant  factors.  The  uncertainties  involved  with the  reserving
process  have  become  increasingly  unpredictable  due to a number  of  complex
factors  including  social and  economic  trends and changes in the  concepts of
legal liability and damage awards. Accordingly, final claim settlements may vary
from the present estimates, particularly when those payments may not occur until
well into the future.

The Hartford  continually reviews the adequacy of its estimated claims and claim
adjustment  expense  reserves on an overall  basis.  Adjustments  to  previously
established  reserves,  if any, are  reflected in the  operating  results of the
period in which the adjustment is determined to be necessary. In the judgment of
management,  all information currently available has been properly considered in
the reserves established for claims and claim adjustment expenses.

Most of the  Company's  property  and  casualty  reserves  are  not  discounted.
However,  certain  liabilities  for unpaid claims,  principally  for permanently
disabled claimants, and certain structured settlement contracts,  that fund loss
run-offs  for  unrelated  parties  having  payment  patterns  that are fixed and
determinable,  have been  discounted to present value using an average  interest
rate of 4.9% in 2002 and 5.1% in 2001.  At  December  31,  2002 and  2001,  such
discounted  reserves  totaled $594 and $719,  respectively  (net of discounts of
$424 and $429, respectively). Accretion of this discount did not have a material
effect on net income during 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively.

(M)  OTHER POLICYHOLDER FUNDS AND BENEFITS PAYABLE

Other  policyholder  funds and benefits  payable include reserves for investment
contracts  without  life  contingencies,  corporate  owned  life  insurance  and
universal life insurance contracts.  Of the amounts included in this item, $22.2
billion  and $18.8  billion,  as of December  31,  2002 and 2001,  respectively,
represent  policyholder  obligations.  The  liability  for policy  benefits  for
universal  life-type  contracts  is equal to the  balance  that  accrues  to the
benefit of policyholders,  including credited  interest,  amounts that have been
assessed to  compensate  the Company for  services to be  performed  over future
periods,  and any amounts  previously  assessed against  policyholders  that are
refundable on termination of the contract.

For investment contracts,  policyholder liabilities are equal to the accumulated
policy account values, which consist of an accumulation of deposit payments plus
credited interest,  less withdrawals and amounts assessed through the end of the
period.

(N)  REVENUE RECOGNITION

LIFE - For investment and universal life-type  contracts,  the amounts collected
from policyholders are considered deposits and are not included in revenue.  Fee
income for  investment  and  universal  life-type  contracts  consists of policy
charges for policy  administration,  cost of  insurance  charges  and  surrender
charges assessed against  policyholders'  account balances and are recognized in
the period in which services are provided.  Traditional life and the majority of
the  Company's  accident and health  products are long duration  contracts,  and
premiums are  recognized as revenue when due from  policyholders.  Retrospective
and contingent  commissions and other related expenses are incurred and recorded
in the same  period  that  the  retrospective  premiums  are  recorded  or other
contract provisions are met.

PROPERTY &  CASUALTY  - Property  and  casualty  insurance  premiums  are earned
principally  on a pro rata  basis  over the lives of the  policies  and  include
accruals  for  ultimate   premium  revenue   anticipated   under  auditable  and
retrospectively  rated  policies.  Unearned  premiums  represent  the portion of
premiums  written  applicable  to the  unexpired  terms of  policies  in  force.
Unearned  premiums  also  include  estimated  and unbilled  premium  adjustments
related  to  a  small  percentage  of  the  Company's   loss-sensitive  workers'
compensation  business.  Other revenue consists primarily of revenues associated
with  the  Company's   servicing   businesses.   Retrospective   and  contingent
commissions  and other  related  expenses  are incurred and recorded in the same
period that the retrospective premiums are recorded or other contract provisions
are met.

(O)  FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION

Foreign  currency  translation  gains and losses are reflected in  stockholders'
equity as a component of accumulated other  comprehensive  income. The Company's
foreign  subsidiaries'  balance  sheet  accounts are  translated at the exchange
rates in effect at each year end and income statement accounts are translated at
the average rates of exchange  prevailing  during the year.  Gains and losses on
foreign currency transactions are reflected in earnings. The national currencies
of the international operations are generally their functional currencies.

(P)  DIVIDENDS TO POLICYHOLDERS

Policyholder  dividends  are accrued  using an estimate of the amount to be paid
based on underlying contractual  obligations under policies and applicable state
laws.

LIFE - Participating  life insurance in force accounted for 6%, 8% and 17% as of
December  31,  2002,  2001 and 2000,  respectively,  of total life  insurance in
force.  Dividends  to  policyholders  were $65,  $68 and $67 for the years ended
December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. There were no additional amounts
of income allocated to participating policyholders.  If limitations exist on the
amount of net income from  participating  life  insurance  contracts that may be
distributed to  stockholders,  the  policyholders'  share of net income on those
contracts that cannot be distributed is excluded from stockholders'  equity by a
charge to operations and a credit to a liability.

PROPERTY  & CASUALTY - Net  written  premiums  for  participating  property  and
casualty  insurance  policies  represented  9%, 9% and 9% of total  net  written
premiums for the years ended  December 31,  2002,  2001 and 2000,  respectively.
Dividends to  policyholders  were $57, $38 and $33 for the years ended  December
31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively.

(Q) MUTUAL FUNDS

The Company  maintains  a retail  mutual fund  operation,  whereby the  Company,
through   wholly-owned   subsidiaries,   provides   investment   management  and
administrative  services to The  Hartford  Mutual  Funds,  Inc.,  a family of 33
mutual funds.  The Company charges fees to the shareholders of the mutual funds,
which are recorded as revenue by the Company. Investors can purchase "shares" in
the mutual funds,  all of which are registered  with the Securities and Exchange
Commission  ("SEC"),  in accordance with the Investment Company Act of 1940. The
mutual  funds  are  owned  by the  shareholders  of those  funds  and not by the
Company.  As such, the mutual fund assets and liabilities and related investment
returns are not reflected in the  Company's  consolidated  financial  statements
since they are not assets, liabilities and operations of the Company.

(R) REINSURANCE

Written  premiums,  earned  premiums  and  incurred  insurance  losses  and loss
adjustment  expense all reflect the net effects of assumed and ceded reinsurance
transactions.  Assumed reinsurance refers to our acceptance of certain insurance
risks that other insurance companies have underwritten.  Ceded reinsurance means
other  insurance  companies  have agreed to share  certain risks the Company has
underwritten.   Reinsurance   accounting  is  followed  for  assumed  and  ceded
transactions when the risk transfer provisions of SFAS No. 113,  "Accounting and
Reporting for Reinsurance of Short-Duration  and Long-Duration  Contracts," have
been met. For the years ended December 31, 2002,  2001 and 2000, the Company did
not make any significant  changes in the terms under which  reinsurance is ceded
to other insurers.

(S) INCOME TAXES

The Company  recognizes  taxes  payable or  refundable  for the current year and
deferred  taxes for the future  tax  consequences  of  differences  between  the
financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets
and  liabilities  are  measured  using  enacted  tax rates  expected to apply to
taxable income in the years the temporary differences are expected to reverse.

2.  SEPTEMBER 11, 2001

As a  result  of  September  11,  the  Company  recorded  in 2001  an  estimated
before-tax loss amounting to $678, net of reinsurance:  $647 related to property
and  casualty  operations  and $31 related to life  operations.  The  Property &
Casualty loss included a $1.1 billion gross reserve  addition,  an estimated net
reserve addition of $556 with cessions under reinsurance contracts of $569. Also
included  in the  Property & Casualty  loss was $91 of  reinstatement  and other
reinsurance  premiums.  The  property-casualty  portion of the estimate includes
coverages related to property, business interruption, workers' compensation, and
other liability exposures, including those underwritten by the Company's assumed
reinsurance operation. The Company based the loss estimate,  including estimated
amounts for incurred but not reported  policyholder  losses,  costs  incurred in
settling  claims and the impact of  reinsurance  recoverables,  upon a review of
insured exposures using a variety of assumptions and actuarial techniques. Since
the  September  11  terrorist  attack was a single event that was unique and had
such a substantial  impact on such a large number of individuals and businesses,
the nature of this  unusual  event  adds to the  uncertainty  of loss  estimates
relating to the event.  The Company  continues  to carry the  original  incurred
amount  related to September  11, less any paid losses;  with the exception of a
$12 reserve release related to positive  development in Life. Reported losses to
date have  fallen  within  the  original  reserved  amounts.  However,  there is
significant  uncertainty  around  September  11,  particularly  with  regard  to
inhalation claims,  stress claims, and other bodily injury, as well as the three
year statute of limitations in New York State.  Although the Company anticipates
certain claims for recovery to be challenged,  the impact of these challenges is
not expected to be material.  As a result of the  uncertainties  involved in the
estimation process,  final claims settlement may significantly vary from present
estimates.

(G)      CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK

The Hartford is not exposed to any credit  concentration risk of a single issuer
greater than 10% of the Company's stockholders' equity.

(H)      DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS

The notional amounts of derivative  contracts represent the basis upon which pay
or  receive  amounts  are  calculated  and are not  reflective  of credit  risk.
Notional  amounts  pertaining to derivative  instruments  (excluding  guaranteed
separate  accounts) totaled $10.8 billion at December 31, 2002, and $8.0 billion
at December 31, 2001.

A  reconciliation  between  notional amounts as of December 31, 2002 and 2001 by
derivative type and strategy is as follows:



(I)  COLLATERAL ARRANGEMENTS

The Hartford entered into various collateral arrangements which require both the
pledging  and  accepting  of  collateral  in  connection   with  its  derivative
instruments.  As of December 31, 2002 and 2001,  collateral pledged has not been
separately  reported in the Consolidated  Balance Sheets. The classification and
carrying  amounts of  collateral  pledged at December  31, 2002 and 2001 were as
follows:


ASSETS                                            2002      2001

    TOTAL                                       $    96   $    54
=================================================================

At December 31, 2002 and 2001, The Hartford had accepted  collateral  consisting
of cash, U.S.  Government,  and U.S.  Government  agency  securities with a fair
value of $454 and $167,  respectively.  At December 31, 2002 and 2001, only cash
collateral  of $176 and $108,  respectively,  was  invested  and recorded on the
balance sheet in fixed  maturities and other  liabilities.  The Hartford is only
permitted by contract to sell or repledge the noncash collateral in the event of
a  default  by the  counterparty  and none of the  collateral  has been  sold or
repledged  at December  31, 2002 and 2001.  As of December 31, 2002 and 2001 all
collateral accepted was held in separate custodial accounts.

4.       FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

SFAS No. 107, "Disclosure about Fair Value of Financial  Instruments",  requires
disclosure  of fair value  information  of  financial  instruments.  For certain
financial  instruments  where  quoted  market  prices are not  available,  other
independent  valuation techniques and assumptions are used. Because considerable
judgment is used, these estimates are not necessarily indicative of amounts that
could be realized in a current market  exchange.  SFAS No. 107 excludes  certain
financial instruments from disclosure, including insurance contracts, other than
financial guarantees and investment  contracts.  The Hartford uses the following
methods and  assumptions in estimating the fair value of each class of financial
instrument.

             NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

4.       FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS (CONTINUED)

Fair value for fixed maturities and marketable  equity  securities  approximates
those quotations  published by applicable stock exchanges or received from other
reliable sources.

For policy loans, carrying amounts approximate fair value.

Fair  value of  limited  partnerships  and  trusts is based on  external  market
valuations from partnership and trust management.

Derivative  instruments  are  reported  at  fair  value  based  upon  internally
established  valuations  that are  consistent  with external  valuation  models,
quotations  furnished by dealers in such instrument or market quotations.  Other
policyholder  funds and benefits payable fair value information is determined by
estimating future cash flows, discounted at the current market rate.

For short-term debt, carrying amounts approximate fair value.

Fair value for long-term debt and trust preferred  securities is equal to market
value.


The carrying amounts and fair values of The Hartford's financial  instruments at
December 31, 2002 and 2001 were as follows:

                                   2002               2001

5.       GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS

Effective  January 1, 2002,  the Company  adopted  SFAS No. 142 and  accordingly
ceased all amortization of goodwill.

The following  tables show net income and earnings per share for the years ended
December 31, 2002,  2001 and 2000,  with the 2001 and 2000 periods  adjusted for

6.       SEPARATE ACCOUNTS

The Hartford maintained separate account assets and liabilities  totaling $107.1
billion and $114.7  billion at December 31, 2002 and 2001,  respectively,  which
are reported at fair value.  Separate account assets,  which are segregated from
other  investments,  reflect two categories of risk  assumption:  non-guaranteed
separate accounts totaling $95.6 billion and $104.6 billion at December 31, 2002
and 2001,  respectively,  wherein the policyholder  assumes the investment risk,
and  guaranteed  separate  accounts  totaling $11.5 billion and $10.1 billion at
December 31, 2002 and 2001,  respectively,  wherein The  Hartford  contractually
guarantees  either a minimum  return or the account  value to the  policyholder.
Included in the non-guaranteed category were policy loans totaling $384 and $575
at December 31, 2002 and 2001,  respectively.  Net investment  income (including
net realized capital gains and losses) and interest credited to policyholders on
separate  account  assets are not  reflected in the  Consolidated  Statements of
Income.

Separate account  management fees and other revenues included in fee income were
$1.2  billion,   $1.3  billion  and  $1.4  billion  in  2002,   2001  and  2000,
respectively.  The  guaranteed  separate  accounts  include  fixed  market value
adjusted ("MVA")  individual  annuities and modified  guaranteed life insurance.
The  average  credited  interest  rate on these  contracts  was 6.3% and 6.4% at
December  31,  2002 and  2001,  respectively.  The  assets  that  support  these
liabilities were comprised of $11.1 billion and $9.8 billion in fixed maturities
as of  December  31,  2002 and  2001,  respectively,  and $385 and $234 of other
investments as of December 31, 2002 and 2001,  respectively.  The portfolios are
segregated  from other  investments  and are managed to minimize  liquidity  and
interest  rate  risk.  In  order  to  minimize  the  risk  of  disintermediation
associated  with early  withdrawals,  fixed MVA annuity and modified  guaranteed
life insurance  contracts  carry a graded  surrender  charge as well as a market
value  adjustment.  Additional  investment  risk is hedged  using a  variety  of
derivatives  which  totaled $135 and $37 in net carrying  value and $3.6 billion
and $3.2  billion  in  notional  amounts  as of  December  31,  2002  and  2001,
respectively.

7.       RESERVES FOR CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES

As described  in Note 1(l),  The  Hartford  establishes  reserves for claims and
claim  adjustment  expenses on reported and  unreported  claims.  These  reserve
estimates are based on known facts and  interpretations  of  circumstances,  and
consideration of various internal  factors  including The Hartford's  experience
with similar cases,  historical  trends involving claim payment  patterns,  loss
payments,  pending  levels of unpaid claims,  loss control  programs and product
mix. In addition,  the reserve  estimates  are  influenced by  consideration  of
various external  factors  including court  decisions,  economic  conditions and
public  attitudes.  The effects of inflation  are  implicitly  considered in the
reserving process.

The establishment of appropriate  reserves,  including reserves for catastrophes
and asbestos and  environmental  claims, is inherently  uncertain.  The Hartford
regularly updates its reserve estimates as new information becomes available and
events unfold that may have an impact on unsettled claims. Changes in prior year
reserve  estimates,  which may be  material,  are  reflected  in the  results of
operations in the period such changes are determined to be necessary.

      international subsidiaries for the years ended December 31,
      2001 and 2000, respectively.

The Company has an exposure to catastrophic  losses,  both natural and man made,
which can be caused by significant  events including  hurricanes,  severe winter
storms,  earthquakes,  windstorms,  fires and terrorist  acts. The frequency and
severity  of  catastrophic  losses  are  unpredictable,  and the  exposure  to a
catastrophe  is a function of both the total amount  insured in an area affected
by the  event and the  severity  of the  event.  Catastrophes  generally  impact
limited geographic areas; however, certain events may produce significant damage
in heavily  populated areas. The Company  generally seeks to reduce its exposure
to catastrophic losses through individual risk selection, aggregation of risk by
geographic location and the purchase of catastrophe reinsurance.

In the opinion of  management,  based upon the known facts and current  law, the
reserves  recorded  for The  Hartford's  property  and  casualty  businesses  at
December  31,  2002  represent  the  Company's  best  estimate  of its  ultimate
liability for claims and claim adjustment  expenses related to losses covered by
policies  written by the Company.  Based on  information  or trends that are not
presently known,  future reserve  reestimates may result in adjustments to these
reserves. Such adjustments could possibly be significant, reflecting any variety
of new and adverse trends,  including  increases in medical cost inflation rates
and physical  damage repair costs,  as well as further  adverse  development  of
asbestos  and  environmental  claims.  (For further  discussion  of asbestos and
environmental claims, see Note 16(b).)

On May 15, 2001, HLI filed with the SEC a shelf  registration  statement for the
potential  offering  and  sale  of up to $1.0  billion  in  debt  and  preferred
securities.  The registration  statement was declared effective on May 29, 2001.

On  November  9, 2000,  The  Hartford  filed  with the SEC a shelf  registration
statement  and a  prospectus,  as amended  on May 21,  2002,  for the  potential
offering  and  sale of up to an  additional  $2.6  billion  in debt  and  equity
securities.  Specifically,  the registration  statement allows for the following
types of securities to be offered:  debt  securities,  preferred  stock,  common
stock,  depositary shares,  warrants,  stock purchase contracts,  stock purchase
units and junior  subordinated  deferrable  interest  debentures of the Company,
preferred  securities  of any of one or more  capital  trusts  organized  by The
Hartford ("The  Hartford  Trusts") and guarantees by the Company with respect to
the preferred securities of any of The Hartford Trusts. As of December 31, 2002,

On December 31, 2002, the Company and HLI entered into a joint  three-year  $490
competitive  advance and revolving credit facility comprised of 12 participating
banks. As of December 31, 2002, there were no outstanding  borrowings under this
facility.

(C)  LONG-TERM DEBT OFFERINGS

Equity Unit Offering
- --------------------

On  September  13, 2002,  The  Hartford  issued 6.6 million 6% equity units at a
price of $50.00 per unit and received net proceeds of $319.

Each equity unit offered  initially  consists of a corporate  unit with a stated
amount of $50.00 per unit. Each corporate unit consists of one purchase contract
for the sale of a certain  number of  shares  of the  Company's  stock and fifty
dollars principal amount of senior notes due November 16, 2008.

The  corporate  unit  may be  converted  by the  holder  into  a  treasury  unit
consisting of the purchase contract and a 5% undivided  beneficial interest in a
zero-coupon  U.S.  Treasury  security  with a principal  amount of one  thousand
dollars that matures on November 15, 2006. The holder of an equity unit owns the
underlying  senior notes or treasury  portfolio but has pledged the senior notes
or treasury  portfolio to the Company to secure the holder's  obligations  under
the purchase contract.

The purchase  contract  obligates  the holder to  purchase,  and  obligates  The
Hartford to sell, on November 16, 2006, for fifty dollars,  a variable number of
newly issued common shares of The Hartford.  The number of The Hartford's shares
to be issued will be determined  at the time the purchase  contracts are settled
based upon the then current  applicable  market value of The  Hartford's  common
stock. If the applicable market value of The Hartford's common stock is equal to
or less than $47.25,  then the Company will deliver  1.0582 shares to the holder
of the equity unit,  or an aggregate of 7.0 million  shares.  If the  applicable
market value of The Hartford's common stock is greater than $47.25 but less than
$57.645,  then the  Company  will  deliver  the number of shares  equal to fifty
dollars  divided by the then current  applicable  market value of The Hartford's
common  stock to the holder.  Finally,  if the  applicable  market  value of The
Hartford's  common stock is equal to or greater than  $57.645,  then the Company
will deliver 0.8674 shares to the holder, or an aggregate of 5.7 million shares.
Accordingly, upon settlement of the purchase contracts on November 16, 2006, The
Hartford will receive  proceeds of  approximately  $330 and will deliver between
5.7 million and 7.0 million common shares in the aggregate. The proceeds will be
credited to  stockholders'  equity and  allocated  between the common  stock and
additional  paid-in capital accounts.  The Hartford will make quarterly contract
adjustment  payments to the equity unit holders at a rate of 1.90% of the stated
amount per year until the purchase contract is settled.

Each corporate unit also includes fifty dollars principal amount of senior notes
that will mature on November  16,  2008.  The  aggregate  maturity  value of the
senior  notes is $330.  The notes are  pledged by the  holders  to secure  their
obligations  under the  purchase  contracts.  The Hartford  will make  quarterly
interest  payments  to the holders of the notes  initially  at an annual rate of
4.10%.  On August 11,  2006,  the notes will be  remarketed.  At that time,  The
Hartford's remarketing agent will have the ability to reset the interest rate on
the notes in order to generate  sufficient  remarketing  proceeds to satisfy the
holder's obligation under the purchase contract. In the event of an unsuccessful
remarketing,  the Company will  exercise its rights as a secured party to obtain
and extinguish the notes.

The total  distributions  payable on the equity  units are at an annual  rate of
6.0%,  consisting of interest (4.10%) and contract  adjustment payments (1.90%).
The corporate  units are listed on the New York Stock  Exchange under the symbol
"HIG PrA".

The present  value of the contract  adjustment  payments of $23 was accrued upon
the issuance of the equity units as a charge to additional  paid-in  capital and
are included in other liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet
as of  December  31,  2002.  Subsequent  contract  adjustment  payments  will be
allocated  between  this  liability  account  and  interest  expense  based on a
constant rate calculation over the life of the transaction.  Additional  paid-in
capital as of December 31, 2002,  also  reflected a charge of $9  representing a
portion of the equity unit  issuance  costs that was  allocated  to the purchase
contracts.

The equity  units are  reflected in the diluted  earnings per share  calculation
using the treasury stock method, which would be used for the equity units at any
time before the issuance of the shares of The  Hartford's  common stock upon the
settlement of the purchase contracts. Under the treasury stock method, the

number of shares of common stock used in calculating  diluted earnings per share
is  increased  by the  excess,  if any,  of the number of shares  issuable  upon
settlement  of the  purchase  contracts  over the number of shares that could be
purchased by The Hartford in the market,  at the average market price during the
period,  using the proceeds  received upon settlement.  The Company  anticipates
that there will be no dilutive  effect on its earnings per share  related to the
equity units,  except during periods when the average market price of a share of
the Company's common stock is above the threshold appreciation price of $57.645.
Because the average  market  price of The  Hartford's  common  stock  during the
period from the date of  issuance  through  December  31,  2002,  was below this
threshold  appreciation  price, the shares issuable under the purchase  contract
component of the equity units have not been included in the diluted earnings per
share calculation.

Senior Note Offering
- --------------------

On August 29, 2002, The Hartford  issued 4.7% senior notes due September 1, 2007
and  received   net  proceeds  of  $298.   Interest  on  the  notes  is  payable
semi-annually  on March 1 and  September  1,  commencing  on March 1, 2003.  The
Company used the  proceeds to repay $300 of 6.375%  senior notes that matured on
November 1, 2002.

(D)  DESCRIPTION OF TRUST PREFERRED SECURITIES

The Hartford, and its subsidiary Hartford Life Insurance Company ("HLIC"),  have
formed statutory business trusts,  which exist for the exclusive purposes of (i)
issuing Trust  Securities  representing  undivided  beneficial  interests in the
assets of the Trust;  (ii) investing the gross proceeds of the Trust  Securities
in Junior  Subordinated  Deferrable  Interest  Debentures  (Junior  Subordinated
Debentures) of its parent; and (iii) engaging in only those activities necessary
or incidental  thereto.  These Junior  Subordinated  Debentures  and the related
income effects are eliminated in the consolidated financial statements.

The  financial  structure of Hartford  Capital I, II, and III, and Hartford Life
Capital I and II, as of December 31, 2002 and 2001,  were as follows (except for
Hartford  Capital  II for which  the  underlying  securities  were  redeemed  on
December 31, 2001):

9.       STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY

(A)  COMMON STOCK

On September 13, 2002, The Hartford issued  approximately  7.3 million shares of
common stock pursuant to an underwritten offering at a price of $47.25 per share
and  received net proceeds of $330.  Also on  September  13, 2002,  The Hartford
issued  6.6  million  6% equity  units.  Each  equity  unit  contains a purchase
contract  obligating the holder to purchase and The Hartford to sell, a variable
number of newly-issued shares of The Hartford's common stock. Upon settlement of
the purchase  contracts on November 16, 2006, The Hartford will receive proceeds
of  approximately  $330 and will  deliver  between  5.7  million and 7.0 million
shares in the  aggregate.  (For further  discussion of this  issuance,  see Note
8(c).)

At the  Company's  annual  meeting  of  shareholders  held on  April  18,  2002,
shareholders  approved an amendment to Section (a) Article Fourth of the Amended
and Restated  Certificate of Incorporation to increase the aggregate  authorized
number of shares of common stock from 400 million to 750 million.

On October 22,  2001,  The  Hartford  issued 7.0 million  shares of common stock
under its current shelf  registration to Salomon Smith Barney Inc. at a price of
$56.82 per share and received  proceeds of $400. The shares were then re-offered
by Salomon Smith Barney Inc. to investors.  The proceeds from this issuance were
contributed to the Company's  insurance  operations  to, in part,  replenish the
surplus of those operations after the September 11 loss.

On February 16,  2001,  The  Hartford  issued 10 million  shares of common stock
pursuant to an underwritten  offering under its current shelf  registration  for
net  proceeds  of $615.  The  proceeds  were used to  partially  fund the Fortis
acquisition.

(B)  PREFERRED STOCK

The Company has 50,000,000 shares of preferred stock  authorized,  none of which
have been issued. In 1995, the Company approved The Hartford  Stockholder Rights
Plan,  pursuant  to which a  nonvoting  right  attaches  to each share of common
stock. Upon the occurrence of certain  triggering  events, the right will permit
each shareholder to purchase a fraction of a share of the Series A Participating
Cumulative  Preferred  Stock (the "Series A Preferred  Stock") of The  Hartford.
There are 300,000  authorized shares of Series A Preferred Stock. No shares were
issued or outstanding at December 31, 2002 or 2001.

(C)  STATUTORY RESULTS

    TOTAL                           $    8,150    $   7,150
===============================================================

A significant  percentage of the consolidated  statutory  surplus is permanently
invested  or is subject  to  various  state and  foreign  government  regulatory
restrictions or other  agreements  which limit the payment of dividends  without
prior approval.  The payment of dividends by  Connecticut-domiciled  insurers is
limited under the insurance  holding  company laws of  Connecticut.  Under these
laws, the insurance  subsidiaries  may only make their dividend  payments out of
unassigned  surplus.  These laws  require  notice to and  approval  by the state
insurance  commissioner  for the declaration or payment of any dividend,  which,
together with other dividends or distributions  made within the preceding twelve
months,  exceeds the greater of (i) 10% of the insurer's policyholder surplus as
of  December  31 of the  preceding  year or (ii) net  income  (or net gain  from
operations,  if such company is a life insurance  company) for the  twelve-month
period ending on the thirty-first  day of December last preceding,  in each case
determined under statutory insurance  accounting policies.  In addition,  if any
dividend  of  a  Connecticut-domiciled  insurer  exceeds  the  insurer's  earned
surplus,   it  requires  the  prior  approval  of  the   Connecticut   Insurance
Commissioner.  The insurance holding company laws of the other  jurisdictions in
which  The  Hartford's  insurance   subsidiaries  are  incorporated  (or  deemed
commercially domiciled) generally contain similar (although in certain instances
somewhat  more  restrictive)  limitations  on the  payment of  dividends.  As of
December 31, 2002, the maximum amount of statutory  dividends  which may be paid
to HFSG from its insurance subsidiaries in 2003, without prior approval, is $1.8
billion.

The domestic  insurance  subsidiaries of HFSG prepare their statutory  financial
statements in accordance with accounting  practices prescribed by the applicable
state insurance  department.  Prescribed  statutory accounting practices include
publications of the National Association of Insurance Commissioners ("NAIC"), as
well as state laws, regulations and general administrative rules.

The  NAIC  adopted  the   Codification   of  Statutory   Accounting   Principles
("Codification") in March 1998. The effective date for the statutory  accounting
guidance  was January 1, 2001.  Each of The  Hartford's  domiciliary  states has
adopted  Codification,  and the  Company has made the  necessary  changes in its
statutory reporting required for implementation.  The impact of applying the new
guidance resulted in a benefit of approximately $400 in statutory surplus.

10.      EARNINGS PER SHARE

Earnings per share amounts have been computed in accordance  with the provisions
of  SFAS  No.  128,  "Earnings  per  Share".  The  following  tables  present  a
reconciliation  of net income and shares used in calculating  basic earnings per
share to those used in calculating diluted earnings per share.

                                      F-26


             NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)



Basic  earnings per share are computed  based on the weighted  average number of
shares  outstanding  during the year.  Diluted  earnings  per share  include the
dilutive effect of outstanding options and the Company's equity units, using the
treasury stock method, and also contingently issuable shares. Under the treasury
stock method,  exercise of options is assumed with the proceeds used to purchase
common stock at the average market price for the period.  The difference between
the number of shares  assumed issued and number of shares  purchased  represents
the dilutive shares. Contingently issuable shares are included upon satisfaction
of certain conditions related to the contingency.

11.      STOCK COMPENSATION PLANS

On May 18, 2000,  the  shareholders  of The Hartford  approved The Hartford 2000
Incentive  Stock  Plan (the "2000  Plan"),  which  replaced  The  Hartford  1995
Incentive  Stock  Plan  (the  "1995  Plan").  The  terms of the 2000  Plan  were
substantially  similar to the terms of the 1995 Plan  except  that the 1995 Plan
had an annual award limit and a higher maximum award limit.

Under the 2000  Plan,  awards may be  granted  in the form of  non-qualified  or
incentive stock options  qualifying  under Section 422A of the Internal  Revenue
Code,  performance  shares  or  restricted  stock,  or  any  combination  of the
foregoing.  In addition,  stock appreciation rights may be granted in connection
with all or part of any stock options granted under the 2000 Plan. The aggregate
number of shares of stock, which may be awarded is subject to a maximum limit of
17,211,837 shares applicable to all awards for the ten-year duration of the 2000
Plan.

All  options  granted  have an exercise  price equal to the market  price of the
Company's common stock on the date of grant, and an option's maximum term is ten
years.  Certain options become  exercisable over a three year period  commencing
one year from the date of grant,  while certain other options become exercisable
upon the  attainment  of specified  market price  appreciation  of the Company's
common  shares  or at seven  years  after the date of  grant.  For any year,  no
individual  employee  may  receive an award of options  for more than  1,000,000
shares. As of December 31, 2002, The Hartford had not issued any incentive stock
options under the 2000 Plan.

Performance  awards of common stock granted  under the 2000 Plan become  payable
upon the attainment of specific  performance goals achieved over a period of not
less than two nor more than five  years,  and the  restricted  stock  granted is
subject to a restriction  period. On a cumulative basis, no more than 20% of the
aggregate  number  of  shares  which  may be  awarded  under  the 2000  Plan are
available for performance shares and restricted stock awards.  Also, the maximum
award of performance  shares for any individual  employee in any year is 200,000
shares.

In 1997, the Company  awarded special  performance-based  options and restricted
stock to certain key  executives  under the 1995 Plan. The awards vested only if
the Company's stock traded at certain  predetermined  levels for ten consecutive
days by March 1, 2001.  Vested  options  could not be exercised  nor  restricted
shares  disposed  of until  March 1, 2001.  As a result of the  Company's  stock
trading at predetermined  levels for ten consecutive  days, in May 1999 and also
in September 2000, the special  performance-based  options and restricted  stock
vested. As a result, the Company began recognizing  compensation  expense in May
1999 and continued to recognize expense through March 1, 2001.

In 1996,  the Company  established  The Hartford  Employee  Stock  Purchase Plan
("ESPP").  Under this plan,  eligible  employees  of The  Hartford  may purchase
common stock of the Company at a 15% discount from the lower of the market price
at the beginning or end of the quarterly  offering period.  The Company may sell
up to 5,400,000 shares of stock to eligible employees under the

                                      F-27


             NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)


11.      STOCK COMPENSATION PLANS (CONTINUED)

ESPP, and 408,304,  315,101 and 241,742 shares were sold in 2002, 2001 and 2000,
respectively.  The per share  weighted  average fair value of the discount under
the ESPP was  $11.70,  $14.31 and $13.96 in 2002,  2001 and 2000,  respectively.
Additionally,  during 1997,  The Hartford  established  employee  stock purchase
plans for certain employees of the Company's international  subsidiaries.  Under
these plans,  participants  may purchase common stock of The Hartford at a fixed
price at the end of a three-year period.

Currently, the Company applies APB Opinion No. 25 and related interpretations in
accounting for its stock-based compensation plans. (See Note 1(f) for discussion
of accounting for stock compensation plans beginning January 1, 2003.) A summary
of the status of non-qualified options included in the Company's incentive stock
plan as of December 31, 2002,  2001 and 2000 and changes  during the years ended
December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000 is presented below:



The following table summarizes  information about stock options  outstanding and
exercisable (shares in thousands) at December 31, 2002:




12.   PENSION PLANS AND  POSTRETIREMENT  HEALTH CARE AND LIFE INSURANCE  BENEFIT
      PLANS

The Company maintains a U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plan ("the Plan")
that covers  substantially  all  employees.  U.S.  employees  of the Company and
certain  affiliates  with 5 or more  years of  service  are  entitled  to annual
pension benefits,  beginning at normal retirement age (65), equal to 2% of their
final average pay per year multiplied by the number of years of credited service
up to a maximum of 60% of the average (50% for employees  hired prior to January
1, 2001),  less 1 2/3% of primary Social Security per year of credited  service.
Final  average  pay  represents  the  average  of any of their 60  highest  paid
calendar  months  during  the last  120  calendar  months  of  credited  service
preceding termination or retirement.  Effective for all new employees who joined
the Company on or after  January 1, 2001, a new component or formula was applied
under the Plan referred to as the "cash balance formula". Under the cash balance
formula,  the Company will  contribute a percentage of an employee's  pay to the
Plan for each pay period,  based on the employee's age. Once they become vested,
employees can elect to receive the value of their plan benefit (the  accumulated
sum of their  annual plan  allocations  with  interest) in a single cash payment
when they leave the Company.

Under certain  conditions,  as described in the Plan document,  the Plan permits
early  retirement at ages 50-64 with a reduced  benefit.  Employees may elect to
receive their pension benefits in the form of a joint and survivor  annuity.  If
employees terminate before rendering 5 years of service,  they forfeit the right
to receive the portion of their  accumulated  plan benefits  attributable to the
Company's contributions. Employees receive the portion of their accumulated plan
benefits as a lump-sum distribution upon retirement or termination, if less than
five thousand  dollars,  or they may elect to receive  their  benefits as a life
annuity  payable  monthly  from date of  retirement  if their  accumulated  plan
benefits are in excess of five thousand dollars.

The Company also maintains  unfunded excess plans to provide  benefits in excess
of amounts permitted to be paid to participants

             NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

12.   PENSION PLANS AND  POSTRETIREMENT  HEALTH CARE AND LIFE INSURANCE  BENEFIT
      PLANS (CONTINUED)

of the plan under the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code. Additionally, the
Company has entered into individual  retirement  agreements with certain current
and retired directors providing for unfunded supplemental pension benefits.

The  Hartford  provides  certain  health care and life  insurance  benefits  for
eligible retired employees. The Hartford's contribution for health care benefits
will depend  upon the  retiree's  date of  retirement  and years of service.  In
addition,  the plan has a  defined  dollar  cap  which  limits  average  Company
contributions.  The Hartford has prefunded a portion of the health care and life
insurance   obligations  through  trust  funds  where  such  prefunding  can  be
accomplished  on a tax  effective  basis.  Effective  January 1,  2002,  retiree
medical,  retiree dental and retiree life insurance benefits were eliminated for
employees with original hire dates with the Company on or after January 1, 2002.

The following tables set forth a reconciliation of beginning and ending balances
of the  benefit  obligation  and fair value of plan assets as well as the funded
status of The Hartford's defined benefit pension and postretirement  health care
and life insurance benefit plans for the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001.
International plans represent an immaterial  percentage of total pension assets,
liabilities and expense and, for reporting purposes,  are combined with domestic
plans.






Assumptions used in calculating the net amount  recognized for the plans were as
follows:

                                             As of December 31,
                                            ---------------------
                                               2002      2001

 Weighted average discount rate                 6.50%    7.50%
 Rate of increase in compensation levels        4.00%    4.25%
=================================================================

For measurement  purposes,  a 10% annual rate of increase in the per capita cost
of covered  health care  benefits was assumed for 2002.  The rate was assumed to
decrease  gradually  to 5.0% for  2007  and  remain  at that  level  thereafter.
Increasing/decreasing  the health care trend rates by one percent per year would
have the effect of increasing/decreasing the benefit obligation as of

December 31, 2002 by $14 and the annual net  periodic  expense for the year then
ended by $1, for the postretirement health care and life insurance benefit plan.
Total pension cost for the years ended December 31, 2002,  2001 and 2000 include
the following components:





Assumptions  used in  calculating  the net  pension  cost for the plans  were as
follows:

                                         Twelve Months Ended
                                             December 31,

 Weighted average discount rate        7.50%    7.75%       8.25%

==================================================================

As of December 31, 2002, the Company  determined  that 6.50% is the  appropriate
discount rate to calculate the Company's 2003 pension expense. At the same time,
the Company lowered its expected  long-term rate of return assumption from 9.75%
to 9.00%.

13.      INVESTMENT AND SAVINGS PLAN

Substantially  all U.S.  employees are eligible to participate in The Hartford's
Investment and Savings Plan under which designated contributions may be invested
in  common  stock  of  The  Hartford  or  certain   other   investments.   These
contributions  are  matched,  up to 3%  of  compensation,  by  the  Company.  In
addition,  the  Company  allocates  0.5% of base  salary  to the  plan  for each
eligible employee. The cost to The Hartford for the above plan was approximately
$34, $30 and $28 for 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively.

14.      REINSURANCE

The Hartford  cedes  insurance  to other  insurers in order to limit its maximum
losses and to  diversify  its  exposures.  Such  transfer  does not  relieve The
Hartford of its primary liability under policies it wrote and, as such,  failure
of reinsurers to honor their obligations could result in losses to The Hartford.
The Hartford also assumes reinsurance from other insurers.  The Hartford also is
a member of and participates in several reinsurance pools and associations.  The
Hartford  evaluates  the  financial  condition  of its  reinsurers  and monitors
concentrations  of credit risk.  Virtually  all of The  Hartford's  property and
casualty  reinsurance  is placed  with  reinsurers  that meet  strict  financial
criteria  established  by a credit  committee.  As of  December  31,  2002,  The
Hartford had no  reinsurance-related  concentrations of credit risk greater than
10% of the Company's  stockholders'  equity.

In  accordance  with  normal  industry  practice,  Life is  involved in both the
cession  and  assumption  of  insurance  with other  insurance  and  reinsurance
companies.  As of  December  31,  2002,  the  largest  amount of life  insurance
retained  on any one life by any one of the life  operations  was  approximately
$2.5. In addition,  the Company  reinsures the majority of minimum death benefit
guarantee and the guaranteed  withdrawal benefits offered in connection with its
variable annuity contracts.

Life reinsures  certain of its risks to other  reinsurers under yearly renewable
term, coinsurance, and modified coinsurance arrangements.  Yearly renewable term
and  coinsurance  arrangements  result in  passing a portion  of the risk to the
reinsurer.  Generally,  the  reinsurer  receives a  proportionate  amount of the
premiums  less an  allowance  for  commissions  and expenses and is liable for a
corresponding proportionate amount of all benefit payments. Modified coinsurance
is similar to coinsurance  except that the cash and investments that support the
liabilities for contract  benefits are not transferred to the assuming  company,
and settlements are made on a net basis between the companies.

Life also  purchases  reinsurance  covering the death  benefit  guarantees  on a
portion  of  its  variable  annuity  business.   The  Company  is  currently  in
arbitration with one of its reinsurers related to this reinsurance. (See further
discussion in Note 16(a).)

The cost of reinsurance related to long-duration contracts is accounted for over
the life of the underlying reinsured policies using assumptions  consistent with
those used to account for the underlying policies.  Life insurance recoveries on
ceded reinsurance contracts, which reduce death and other benefits,

Prior to the Tax Reform Act of 1984, the Life  Insurance  Company Income Tax Act
of 1959  permitted the deferral  from taxation of a portion of statutory  income
under  certain  circumstances.  In these  situations,  the  deferred  income was
accumulated in a "Policyholders' Surplus Account" and, based on current tax law,
will be taxable in the future only under conditions  which management  considers
to be remote;  therefore,  no federal  income  taxes have been  provided  on the
balance in this account, which was $104 as of December 31, 2002.

16.      COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

(A)      LITIGATION

The Hartford is involved in claims litigation  arising in the ordinary course of
business,  both as a liability  insurer  defending  third-party  claims  brought
against insureds and as an insurer defending coverage claims brought against it.
The Hartford  accounts for such  activity  through the  establishment  of unpaid
claim and claim adjustment  expense  reserves.  Subject to the discussion of the
litigation  involving Mac Arthur Company and its subsidiary,  Western  MacArthur
Company, both former regional distributors of asbestos products (collectively or
individually,  "MacArthur"),  below and the uncertainties discussed in (b) below
under the caption "Asbestos and Environmental  Claims,"  management expects that
the ultimate  liability,  if any,  with respect to such  ordinary-course  claims
litigation,  after  consideration  of provisions  made for potential  losses and
costs of defense, will not be material to the consolidated  financial condition,
results of operations or cash flows of The Hartford.

The  Hartford is also  involved in other kinds of legal  actions,  some of which
assert claims for  substantial  amounts.  These actions  include,  among others,
putative  state and federal class actions  seeking  certification  of a state or
national  class.  Such  putative  class  actions  have  alleged,   for  example,
underpayment  of claims or improper  underwriting  practices in connection  with
various kinds of insurance policies, such as personal and commercial automobile,
premises  liability,  and  inland  marine.  The  Hartford  also is  involved  in
individual actions in which punitive damages are sought, such as claims alleging
bad faith in the  handling of  insurance  claims.  Management  expects  that the
ultimate liability,  if any, with respect to such lawsuits,  after consideration
of  provisions  made for  potential  losses  and costs of  defense,  will not be
material to the consolidated  financial condition of The Hartford.  Nonetheless,
given the large or indeterminate amounts sought in certain of these actions, and
the inherent  unpredictability  of  litigation,  it is possible  that an adverse
outcome in certain  matters could,  from time to time,  have a material  adverse
effect on the  Company's  consolidated  results of  operations  or cash flows in
particular quarterly or annual periods.

The MacArthur  Litigation - Hartford Accident and Indemnity  Company  ("Hartford
A&I"), a subsidiary of the Company, issued primary general liability policies to
MacArthur  during  the  period  1967 to  1976.  MacArthur  sought  coverage  for
asbestos-related  claims from  Hartford  A&I under these  policies  beginning in
1978.  During  the  period  between  1978 and 1987,  Hartford  A&I paid its full
aggregate limits under these policies plus defense costs. In 1987,  Hartford A&I
notified  MacArthur  that its  available  limits  under these  policies had been
exhausted,  and MacArthur ceased  submitting  claims to Hartford A&I under these
policies.

On October 3, 2000,  thirteen years after it had accepted  Hartford A&I's notice
of  exhaustion,  MacArthur  filed an action  against  Hartford  A&I and  another
insurer in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York, seeking
for the first time  additional  coverage for asbestos bodily injury claims under
the Hartford A&I primary  policies.  MacArthur seeks additional  coverage on the
theory that  Hartford A&I has  exhausted  only its products  aggregate  limit of
liability,   not  separate  limits   MacArthur   alleges  to  be  available  for
non-products  liability.  The  complaint  seeks a  declaration  of coverage  and
unquantified  damages.  Hartford A&I has moved for summary  judgment  dismissing
MacArthur's  claims with  prejudice.  MacArthur  has moved to dismiss the action
without prejudice. Both motions are pending.

On June  3,  2002,  The St.  Paul  Companies,  Inc.  ("St.  Paul")  announced  a
settlement  of a coverage  action  brought by MacArthur  against  United  States
Fidelity and Guaranty  Company  ("USF&G"),  a subsidiary of St. Paul.  Under the
settlement,  St.  Paul  agreed to pay a total of $975 to  resolve  its  asbestos
liability to MacArthur in conjunction  with a proposed  bankruptcy  petition and
pre-packaged plan of reorganization to be filed by MacArthur.  USF&G provided at
least twelve years of primary  general  liability  coverage to  MacArthur,  but,
unlike  Hartford A&I, had denied  coverage and had refused to pay for defense or
indemnity.

On October 7, 2002,  MacArthur  filed an action in the Superior Court in Alameda
County,  California,  against Hartford A&I and two other insurers. As in the New
York action,  MacArthur seeks a declaration of coverage and damages for asbestos
bodily  injury  claims.  Five asbestos  claimants  who  allegedly  have obtained
default judgments against MacArthur also are joined as plaintiffs;  they seek to
recover the amount of their default  judgments and additional  damages  directly
from the defendant insurers and assert a right to an accelerated trial.

In its October 7, 2002 complaint,  MacArthur  alleges that it has  approximately
$1.8 billion of unpaid  asbestos  liability  judgments  against it to date.  The
ultimate  amount  of  MacArthur's  alleged   non-products   asbestos  liability,
including

16.      COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES (CONTINUED)

any  unresolved  current claims and future  demands,  is currently  unknown.  On
Hartford A&I's motion, the court stayed the action until March 3, 2003, to allow
the New York federal court time to rule first on the motions pending there.

On November 22, 2002, MacArthur filed a bankruptcy petition and proposed plan of
reorganization,  which seeks to implement the terms of its  settlement  with St.
Paul. MacArthur's bankruptcy filings indicate that it will seek to have the full
amount of its current and future  asbestos  liability  estimated in  conjunction
with plan confirmation.  If such an estimation is made, MacArthur intends to ask
the Alameda County court to enter  judgment  against the insurers for the amount
of its total liability,  including  unliquidated claims and future demands, less
the  estimated  amount  ultimately  paid by St. Paul.  Hartford A&I has filed an
adversary complaint in the MacArthur  bankruptcy seeking a declaratory  judgment
that any estimation made in the bankruptcy proceedings is not an adjudication of
MacArthur's asbestos liability for purposes of insurance coverage.

Hartford A&I intends to defend the MacArthur  actions  vigorously.  Based on the
information  currently  available,   management  believes  that  Hartford  A&I's
liability, if any, to MacArthur will not be finally resolved for at least a year
and most  probably  not for several  years.  In the opinion of  management,  the
ultimate outcome is highly uncertain for many reasons.  It is not yet known, for
example,  in which venue Hartford A&I's  liability,  if any, will be determined;
whether  Hartford A&I's  defenses  based on MacArthur's  long delay in asserting
claims for further coverage will be successful;  how other significant  coverage
defenses  will be  decided;  or the  extent  to which  the  claims  and  default
judgments against MacArthur involve injury outside of the products and completed
operations hazard definitions of the policies. In the opinion of management,  an
adverse outcome could have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of
operations, financial condition and liquidity.

Bancorp Services, LLC - On March 15, 2002, a jury in the U.S. District Court for
the  Eastern  District  of Missouri  issued a verdict in Bancorp  Services,  LLC
("Bancorp") v. HLIC, et al., in favor of Bancorp in the amount of $118. The case
involved claims of patent  infringement,  misappropriation of trade secrets, and
breach  of  contract  against  HLIC and its  affiliate  International  Corporate
Marketing Group, LLC ("ICMG"). The judge dismissed the patent infringement claim
on summary  judgment.  The  jury's  award was based on the last two  claims.  On
August  28,  2002,  the Court  entered  an order  awarding  Bancorp  prejudgment
interest on the breach of contract claim in the amount of $16.

HLIC and ICMG have  appealed  the  judgment  on the trade  secret  and breach of
contract claims. Bancorp has cross-appealed the pretrial dismissal of its patent
infringement claim. The Company's  management,  based on the advice of its legal
counsel,  believes that there is a substantial likelihood that the judgment will
not  survive  at its  current  amount.  Based on the  advice  of  legal  counsel
regarding the potential outcomes of this litigation, the Company recorded an $11
after-tax  charge  for this  matter in the  first  quarter  of 2002 to  increase
litigation reserves. Should HLIC and ICMG not succeed in eliminating or reducing
the judgment, a significant additional expense would be recorded in the future.

Reinsurance Arbitration - The Company is involved in arbitration with one of its
primary  reinsurers  relating to policies with death benefit  guarantees written
from  1994  to  1999.  The  arbitration  involves  alleged  breaches  under  the
reinsurance  treaties.  Although the Company  believes that its position in this
pending  arbitration is strong, an adverse outcome could result in a decrease to
the Company's  statutory surplus and capital and potentially  increase the death
benefit costs incurred by the Company in the future. The arbitration hearing was
held during the fourth quarter of 2002, but no decision has been rendered.

(B)      ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS

The Hartford  continues to receive claims that assert damages from asbestos- and
environmental-related  exposures.  Asbestos  claims  relate  primarily to bodily
injuries  asserted  by those  who came in  contact  with  asbestos  or  products
containing  asbestos.  Environmental  claims  relate  primarily to pollution and
related clean-up costs.

The Hartford wrote several different  categories of insurance  coverage to which
asbestos and  environmental  claims may apply.  First, The Hartford wrote direct
policies as a primary liability  insurance  carrier.  Second, The Hartford wrote
direct excess insurance policies providing additional coverage for insureds that
exhaust their primary liability insurance coverage. Third, The Hartford acted as
a reinsurer  assuming a portion of risks  previously  assumed by other  insurers
writing  primary,  excess  and  reinsurance  coverages.   Fourth,  The  Hartford
participated  as a London  Market  company that wrote both direct  insurance and
assumed reinsurance business.

With regard to both environmental and particularly asbestos claims,  significant
uncertainty  limits the  ability of insurers  and  reinsurers  to  estimate  the
ultimate reserves necessary for unpaid losses and related  settlement  expenses.
Conventional  reserving  techniques cannot reasonably estimate the ultimate cost
of these claims,  particularly during periods where theories of law are in flux.
As a result of the factors discussed in the following paragraphs,  the degree of
variability of reserve  estimates for these exposures is  significantly  greater
than for other more traditional exposures. In particular,  The Hartford believes
there is a high degree of  uncertainty  inherent in the  estimation  of asbestos
loss reserves.

In the case of the reserves for asbestos exposures,  factors contributing to the
high degree of uncertainty include inadequate development patterns,  plaintiffs'
expanding  theories of liability,  the risks  inherent in major  litigation  and
inconsistent   emerging  legal  doctrines.   Courts  have  reached  inconsistent
conclusions  as to when losses are deemed to have  occurred  and which  policies
provide coverage; what types of losses are covered;  whether there is an insurer
obligation  to defend;  how policy  limits are  determined;  whether  particular
claims are product/completed  operation claims subject to an aggregate limit and
how policy  exclusions and conditions are applied and interpreted.  Furthermore,
insurers in general, including The

             NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

16.      COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES (CONTINUED)

(B)      ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS (CONTINUED)

Hartford,   have   recently   experienced   an   increase   in  the   number  of
asbestos-related  claims due to, among other things, more intensive  advertising
by lawyers seeking asbestos  claimants,  plaintiffs'  increased focus on new and
previously  peripheral  defendants  and an  increase  in the number of  insureds
seeking  bankruptcy  protection  as a result  of  asbestos-related  liabilities.
Plaintiffs and insureds have sought to use bankruptcy  proceedings to accelerate
and increase loss payments by insurers.  In addition,  some  policyholders  have
begun to assert new classes of claims for so called  "non-product"  coverages to
which an aggregate  limit of liability may not apply.  Recently,  many insurers,
including,  in a limited number of instances,  The Hartford, also have been sued
directly by asbestos claimants asserting that insurers had a duty to protect the
public from the dangers of asbestos.  Management  believes  these issues are not
likely to be resolved in the near future.

In the case of the reserves for environmental exposures, factors contributing to
the high degree of uncertainty include court decisions that have interpreted the
insurance  coverage  to  be  broader  than  originally  intended;   inconsistent
decisions,  especially  across  jurisdictions and uncertainty as to the monetary
amount being sought by the claimant from the insured.

Further uncertainties include, the effect of the recent acceleration in the rate
of  bankruptcy  filings  by  asbestos  defendants  on the rate and amount of The
Hartford's asbestos claims payments;  a further increase or decrease in asbestos
and  environmental  claims  which  cannot  now  be  anticipated;   whether  some
policyholders'  liabilities  will reach the  umbrella  or excess  layer of their
coverage;  the  resolution or  adjudication  of some disputes  pertaining to the
amount of available  coverage for asbestos claims in a manner  inconsistent with
The Hartford's  previous  assessment of these claims;  the number and outcome of
direct actions against The Hartford; and unanticipated  developments  pertaining
to The Hartford's ability to recover  reinsurance for asbestos and environmental
claims.  It is also not possible to predict changes in the legal and legislative
environment  and  their  impact  on  the  future  development  of  asbestos  and
environmental claims.  Additionally,  the reporting pattern for excess insurance
and reinsurance claims is much longer than direct claims. In many instances,  it
takes months or years to determine that the customer's own obligations have been
met and how the  reinsurance in question may apply to such claims.  The delay in
reporting reinsurance claims and exposures adds to the uncertainty of estimating
the related reserves.

Given the factors and emerging trends described above, The Hartford believes the
actuarial tools and other techniques it employs to estimate the ultimate cost of
claims for more  traditional  kinds of  insurance  exposure  are less precise in
estimating  reserves  for  its  asbestos  exposures.  The  Hartford  continually
evaluates  new  information  and new  methodologies  in assessing  its potential
asbestos  exposures.  At any time, The Hartford may be conducting an analysis of
newly identified  information.  Completion of exposure  analyses could cause The
Hartford to change its  estimates  of its  asbestos  reserves  and the effect of
these changes could be material to the Company's consolidated operating results,
financial condition and liquidity.

On May 14, 2002, The Hartford  announced its  participation,  along with several
dozen other insurance  carriers,  in a settlement in principle with its insured,
PPG Industries  ("PPG"), of litigation arising from asbestos exposures involving
Pittsburgh Corning  Corporation  ("Pittsburgh  Corning"),  which is 50% owned by
PPG.  The  structure  of the  settlement  will allow The  Hartford to make fixed
payments  to a  settlement  trust over a 20-year  period  beginning  in 2004 and
allows The Hartford to prepay its  obligations  at any time at a fixed  discount
rate of 5.5%. The settlement is subject to a number of contingencies,  including
the negotiation of a definitive  agreement among the parties and approval of the
bankruptcy  court  supervising the  reorganization  of Pittsburgh  Corning.  The
Hartford   estimated  the  settlement  amount  to  be  approximately  $130  (non
tax-effected)  on  a  discounted  basis  and  net  of  anticipated   reinsurance
recoveries.  The settlement was covered by existing asbestos reserves,  and as a
result, did not have a material impact on the Company's  consolidated  financial
condition or results of operations.

As of December 31, 2002 and 2001, the Company  reported $1.1 billion and $616 of
net  asbestos  and $591 and $654 of net  environmental  reserves,  respectively.
Because of the significant uncertainties previously described, principally those
related to asbestos,  the ultimate liabilities may exceed the currently recorded
reserves.  Any such  additional  liability (or any range of additional  amounts)
cannot be  reasonably  estimated  now but could be  material  to The  Hartford's
future  consolidated  operating  results,  financial  condition  and  liquidity.
Consistent with the Company's  longstanding  reserving  practices,  The Hartford
will continue to regularly  review and monitor these  reserves and, where future
circumstances indicate, make appropriate adjustments to the reserves.

Revenue  Service  ("IRS").  Throughout  the audit of the  1996-1997  years,  the

respect to other  taxpayers on this issue and consulted with outside tax counsel
and  advisors  on the merits of the  Company's  separate  account  DRD.  The due
diligence  was  completed  during  the  third  quarter  of 2001 and the  Company
concluded  that it was probable that a greater  portion of the separate  account
DRD  claimed on its filed  returns  would be  realized.  Based on the  Company's
assessment of the probable outcome, the Company concluded an additional $130 tax
benefit was appropriate to record in the third quarter of 2001,  relating to the
tax years  1996-2000.  Additionally,  the Company  increased its estimate of the
separate  account DRD recognized  with respect to tax year 2001 from $44 to $60.
Furthermore, for the tax year 2002 this amount was $63. During 2000, the Company
had recorded a $24 tax benefit as a result of a final settlement with the IRS on
different aspects of the Company's share of the DRD for the 1993-1995 tax years.

Earlier  in 2002,  the  Company  and its IRS  agent  requested  advice  from the
National Office of the IRS with respect to certain aspects of the computation of
the separate  account DRD that had been claimed by the Company for the 1996-1997
audit period. During September 2002 the IRS National Office issued a ruling that
confirmed  that the Company had  properly  computed the items in question in the
separate account DRD claimed on its 1996-1997 tax returns. Additionally,  during
the third  quarter,  the  Company  reached  agreement  with the IRS on all other
issues with respect to the 1996-1997 tax years.  The Company  recorded a benefit
of $76 during the third quarter of 2002, primarily relating to the tax treatment
of such issues for the 1996-1997  tax years,  as well as  appropriate  carryover
adjustments to the 1998-2002 years. The Company will continue to monitor further
developments surrounding the computation of the separate account DRD, as well as
other  items,  and will  adjust its  estimate of the  probable  outcome of these
issues as developments warrant.  Management believes that adequate provision has
been made in the financial  statements  for any potential  assessments  that may
result  from tax  examinations  and other  tax-related  matters for all open tax
years.

(E) UNFUNDED COMMITMENTS

At December 31, 2002, The Hartford has  outstanding  commitments to fund limited
partnership  investments  totaling $396. These capital commitments can be called
by the partnerships during the commitment period (on average, 3-6 years) to fund
working  capital  needs or the purchase of new  investments.  If the  commitment
period  expires and has not been fully  funded,  The Hartford is not required to
fund the remaining unfunded commitment but may elect to do so.

17.      SEGMENT INFORMATION

The  Hartford  is  organized  into two major  operations:  Life and  Property  &
Casualty. Within these operations, The Hartford conducts business principally in
nine  operating  segments.   Additionally,  the  capital  raising  and  purchase
accounting adjustment activities related to the June 27, 2000 acquisition of all
of the outstanding  shares of HLI that the Company did not already own,  capital
raised in 2002 that was not contributed to the Company's insurance subsidiaries,
and the  minority  interest in HLI for  pre-acquisition  periods are included in
Corporate.

Life is organized into four reportable operating segments:  Investment Products,
Individual  Life,  Group Benefits and Corporate  Owned Life Insurance  ("COLI").
Investment  Products  offers  individual  variable and fixed  annuities,  mutual
funds,  retirement plan services and other investment products.  Individual Life
sells a variety of life insurance products,  including variable life,  universal
life,  interest  sensitive  whole life and term life  insurance.  Group Benefits
sells  group  insurance  products,  including  group  life and group  disability
insurance  as well as other  products,  including  stop  loss and  supplementary
medical  coverages to employers and employer  sponsored plans,  accidental death
and dismemberment, travel accident and other special risk coverages to employers
and  associations.  COLI primarily offers variable products used by employers to
fund non-qualified  benefits or other postemployment benefit obligations as well
as leveraged  COLI.  Life also includes in an Other  category its  international
operations,  which are primarily  located in Japan and Latin  America;  realized
capital gains and losses;  as well as corporate items not directly  allocated to
any of its reportable  operating  segments,  principally  interest expense;  and
intersegment eliminations.

In January 2002,  Property & Casualty integrated its Affinity Personal Lines and
Personal  Insurance  segments,  now  reported  as Personal  Lines.  As a result,
Property & Casualty is now organized into five  reportable  operating  segments:
the North American underwriting segments of Business Insurance,  Personal Lines,
Specialty  Commercial and Reinsurance;  and the Other Operations segment,  which
includes   substantially  all  of  the  Company's   asbestos  and  environmental
exposures.  "North American" includes the combined  underwriting  results of the
Business  Insurance,   Personal  Lines,  Specialty  Commercial  and  Reinsurance
underwriting  segments  along with income and expense  items  allocated to these
segments,  such as net investment income, net realized capital gains and losses,
other expenses including interest, and income taxes.

Business  Insurance  provides standard  commercial  insurance  coverage to small
commercial and middle market commercial business primarily throughout the United
States.  This  segment  offers  workers'  compensation,   property,  automobile,
liability,  umbrella and marine coverages.  Commercial risk management  products
and services are also provided.

Personal  Lines  provides   automobile,   homeowners'  and  home-based  business
coverages  to the  members  of AARP  through a direct  marketing  operation;  to
individuals who prefer local agent involvement  through a network of independent
agents in the standard  personal  lines market;  and through the Omni  Insurance
Group in the  non-standard  automobile  market.  Personal  Lines also operates a
member  contact  center for health  insurance  products  offered  through AARP's
Health Care Options.

The  Specialty  Commercial  segment  offers a variety  of  customized  insurance
products and risk management  services.  Specialty  Commercial provides standard
commercial  insurance products including workers'  compensation,  automobile and
liability coverages to large-sized companies. Specialty Commercial also provides
bond, professional liability, specialty casualty and

17.      SEGMENT INFORMATION (CONTINUED)

agricultural  coverages,  as well as core  property and excess and surplus lines
coverages not normally written by standard lines insurers.  Alternative markets,
within Specialty Commercial,  provides insurance products and services primarily
to captive insurance  companies,  pools and self-insurance  groups. In addition,
Specialty  Commercial  provides  third party  administrator  services for claims
administration,  integrated benefits,  loss control and performance  measurement
through Specialty Risk Services.

The  Reinsurance  segment  assumes  reinsurance  in North  America and primarily
writes treaty  reinsurance  through  professional  reinsurance  brokers covering
various property,  casualty,  property catastrophe,  marine and alternative risk
transfer ("ART") products.  ART includes  non-traditional  reinsurance  products
such as multi-year property  catastrophe  treaties,  aggregate of excess of loss
agreements  and quota share  treaties  with event or aggregate  loss ratio caps.
International  property catastrophe,  marine and ART are also sourced outside of
North America through a London contact office.

The Other Operations segment consists of certain property and casualty insurance
operations  of The  Hartford  which have  discontinued  writing new business and
includes   substantially  all  of  the  Company's   asbestos  and  environmental
exposures.  The Other  Operations  segment results also include activity for the
Company's international property and casualty businesses up until their dates of
sale,  and for 2002  include the activity in the exited  international  lines of
Reinsurance  as a result of its  restructuring  in October  2001.  (For  further
discussion of this restructuring, see Note 18(c).)

The measure of profit or loss used by The  Hartford's  management  in evaluating
performance  is operating  income,  except for its North  American  underwriting
segments,  which are evaluated by The Hartford's management primarily based upon
underwriting  results.  Underwriting  results  represent  premiums  earned  less
incurred claims, claim adjustment expenses and underwriting expenses. "Operating
income" is defined as after-tax  operational  results excluding,  as applicable,
net  realized  capital  gains or losses,  the  cumulative  effect of  accounting
changes and certain other items. While not considered segments, the Company also
reports and evaluates operating income results for Life, Property & Casualty and
North American.

Certain  transactions  between  segments  occur  during the year that  primarily
relate to tax settlements, insurance coverage, expense reimbursements,  services
provided and capital  contributions.  Certain  reinsurance  stop loss agreements
exist between the segments which specify that one segment will reimburse another
for losses  incurred in excess of a predetermined  limit.  Also, one segment may
purchase  group annuity  contracts  from another to fund pension costs and claim
annuities  to  settle  casualty  claims.  In  addition,   certain   intersegment
transactions  occur in Life.  These  transactions  include  interest  income  on
allocated  surplus and the allocation of certain net realized  capital gains and
losses  through net  investment  income  utilizing the duration of the segment's
investment portfolios. On December 1, 2002, The Hartford entered into a contract
with a subsidiary,  Fencourt Reinsurance  Company,  Ltd.  ("Fencourt"),  whereby
Fencourt will provide  reinsurance for the Property & Casualty  operations.  The
financial results of this reinsurance program, net of retrocessions to unrelated
reinsurers, will be included in the Specialty Commercial segment.

18.      ACQUISITIONS, DISPOSITIONS AND RESTRUCTURING

(A)  ACQUISITIONS

Fortis
- ------

On April 2, 2001, The Hartford acquired Fortis Financial Group for $1.12 billion
in cash.  The Company  effected  the  acquisition  through  several  reinsurance
agreements  with  subsidiaries  of Fortis,  Inc. and the purchase of 100% of the
stock  of  Fortis  Advisers,  Inc.  and  Fortis  Investors,  Inc.,  wholly-owned
subsidiaries  of Fortis,  Inc. The  acquisition  was accounted for as a purchase
transaction  and, as such, the revenues and expenses  generated by this business
from April 2, 2001 forward are included in the Company's Consolidated Statements
of Income.

Purchase consideration for the transaction was as follows:

Issuance of:
- ------------
Common stock issuance (10 million shares
   @ $64.00 per share), net of transaction costs      $     615
Long-term notes:

(A)  ACQUISITIONS (CONTINUED)

Fortis (continued)
- ------------------

The assets and liabilities  acquired in this transaction were recorded at values
prescribed by applicable  purchase  accounting rules, which represent  estimated
fair value. In addition,  an intangible asset  representing the present value of
future profits ("PVP") of the acquired business was established in the amount of
$605. The PVP is amortized to expense in relation to the estimated gross profits
of  the  underlying  insurance  contracts,  and  interest  is  accreted  on  the
unamortized   balance.   For  the  years  ended  December  31,  2002  and  2001,
amortization  of PVP  amounted to $62 and $66,  respectively.  Goodwill of $553,
representing  the  excess of the  purchase  price  over the amount of net assets
(including  PVP)  acquired,  has  also  been  recorded  and was  amortized  on a
straight-line  basis until January 1, 2002, when  amortization  ceased under the
provisions of SFAS No. 142.

HLI Repurchase
- --------------

On June 27, 2000,  The Hartford  acquired all of the  outstanding  shares of HLI
that it did not already own. The HLI  Repurchase has been recorded as a purchase
transaction.  Consideration  totaled $1.4 billion and resulted in recognition of
goodwill  (excess  of the  purchase  price over the fair value of the net assets
acquired) of $862, which was amortized on a straight-line basis until January 1,
2002, when amortization ceased under the provisions of SFAS No. 142.

Purchase consideration for the transaction was as follows:

Issuance of:
- ------------
Common stock from treasury  (7.25  million  shares @
   $54.90 per share)                                  $     398
Long-term notes:
   $250  7.75% notes due June 15, 2005                      244
   $275  7.90% notes due June 15, 2010                      272
Commercial paper                                            400
- -----------------------------------------------------------------
     Consideration raised                                 1,314
Other, including conversion of HLI employee stock
   options and restricted shares                            102
- -----------------------------------------------------------------
     Total consideration                              $   1,416
=================================================================

Purchase  accounting  for this  transaction  resulted in adjustments to the cost
basis of certain  assets and  liabilities  acquired based on assessments of fair
value.  These adjustments also include the recognition of an asset  representing
the present value of estimated net cash flows,  PVP,  embedded in HLI's existing
insurance and investment  contracts.  The amount of the purchase price allocated
to PVP was $801. PVP is amortized to expense in relation to the estimated  gross
profits on those contracts, and interest is accreted on the unamortized balance.
For the years  ended  December  31,  2002,  2001 and 2000,  amortization  of PVP
amounted to $70, $79 and $47, respectively.

(B)  DISPOSITIONS

In  September  2001,  The  Hartford  entered  into  an  agreement  to  sell  its
Singapore-based  Hartford  Insurance  Company  (Singapore),   Ltd.  The  Company
recorded a net realized capital loss of $9 after-tax  related to the sale, which
was completed in January 2002.

On September 7, 2001,  HLI completed  the sale of its  ownership  interest in an
Argentine subsidiary,  Sudamerica Holding S.A. The Company recorded an after-tax
net realized capital loss of $21 related to the sale.

On  February  8,  2001,  The  Hartford  completed  the  sale of its  Spain-based
subsidiary,  Hartford  Seguros.  The Hartford recorded an after-tax net realized
capital loss of $16.

On December 22, 2000, The Hartford  completed the sale of its  Netherlands-based
Zwolsche  subsidiary.  The Hartford  received  $547,  before costs of sale,  and
reported  an  after-tax  net  realized  capital  gain  of  $69  related  to  the
transaction.  Management  used a portion of the proceeds from the sale to reduce
outstanding  commercial  paper  which  was  issued  to  partially  fund  The HLI
Repurchase.

(C)  RESTRUCTURING

During the fourth quarter of 2001, the Company  approved and  implemented  plans
for  restructuring  the  operations  of both HartRe and The  Hartford  Bank.  In
October 2001,  HartRe announced a restructuring of its entire  international and
domestic   operations,   with  the  purpose  of  centralizing  the  underwriting
organization in Hartford,  Connecticut.  Also during the fourth quarter of 2001,
the  Boards of  Directors  for both The  Hartford  Bank and HFSG,  approved  The
Hartford Bank's dissolution plan.

As a result of these restructuring  plans, the Company recorded a fourth quarter
pretax charge of approximately  $16, which is classified within "Other Expenses"
on the 2001  Consolidated  Statement  of  Income.  This  amount  includes  $8 in
employee-related  costs, $5 in  occupancy-related  costs and the remaining $3 in
other restructuring-related costs.

The 79 employees  terminated under these restructuring plans primarily relate to
all levels of the  underwriting and claims areas.  The  occupancy-related  costs
represent  the   remaining   lease   liabilities   for  both  the  domestic  and
international offices of HartRe to be closed pursuant to the restructuring plan.
As  of  December  31,   2002,   the  Company  has  paid   approximately   $6  in
employee-related  restructuring costs, $2 in  occupancy-related  costs and $1 in
other restructuring-related costs.
