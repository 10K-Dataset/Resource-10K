PART I


Item 1.  BUSINESS OF THE HARTFORD
(DOLLAR AMOUNTS IN MILLIONS UNLESS OTHERWISE STATED)

GENERAL

ITT Hartford Group, Inc. and its subsidiaries ("The Hartford"), headquartered in
Connecticut,  are among the largest  providers  of both  property  and  casualty
insurance  and life  insurance  products in the United  States.  (The terms "The
Hartford"  and the  "Company"  when  used  herein,  refer  to one or more of ITT
Hartford Group, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries.) Hartford Fire Insurance
Company ("Hartford Fire"),  founded in 1810, is the oldest and best known of The
Hartford's  subsidiaries.  Hartford Fire and its subsidiaries write insurance in
all fifty  states.  At December  31, 1996,  the total  assets and  stockholders'
equity of The Hartford were $108.8 billion and $4.5 billion, respectively.

ITT Hartford Group, Inc., a Delaware corporation,  was formed in December,  1985
as a wholly-owned  subsidiary of ITT Corporation  ("ITT"). On December 19, 1995,
ITT distributed all of the outstanding shares of ITT Hartford Group, Inc. to ITT
shareholders  of record in an action  known herein as the  "Distribution".  As a
result of the Distribution, The Hartford became an independent,  publicly traded
company.  In connection with this transaction,  ITT transferred the ownership of
First State Insurance Company,  together with its subsidiaries  ("First State"),
and Fencourt Reinsurance Company, Ltd.  ("Fencourt"),  both of which were wholly
owned   subsidiaries  of  ITT,  to  ITT  Hartford  Group,   Inc.  prior  to  the
Distribution.  Additional information regarding the Distribution may be found in
Note 2 of  Notes  to  Consolidated  Financial  Statements  and  in  Management's
Discussion  and  Analysis  of  Financial  Condition  and  Results of  Operations
("MD&A") within the Distribution section and "Distribution Agreement" within the
Capital Resources and Liquidity section.

As a holding  company,  ITT Hartford  Group,  Inc. has no  significant  business
operations of its own and, therefore, relies on the dividends from its insurance
company  subsidiaries,  which are  primarily  domiciled in  Connecticut,  as the
principal  source  of cash  to  meet  its  obligations.  Additional  information
regarding the cash flow and liquidity needs of ITT Hartford  Group,  Inc. may be
found in the Capital Resources and Liquidity section of the MD&A.

BUSINESS SEGMENTS

The Hartford  consists of four  business  segments:  North  American  Property &
Casualty,  Life,  International,  and Runoff.  The following is a description of
each  segment,   including  a  discussion  of  principal  products,  methods  of
distribution,  and  competitive  environments.  Additional  information  on  The
Hartford's business segments may be found in the MD&A on pages 10 to 19 and Note
1 and Note 17 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.


NORTH AMERICAN PROPERTY & CASUALTY

The  Hartford's  North American  Property & Casualty  segment is the 8th largest
property and casualty insurance  operation in the United States based on written
premiums  for the year ended  December  31, 1995,  per A.M.  Best.  With written
premiums of $5.7 billion for the year ended  December 31, 1996,  North  American
Property & Casualty  is the  largest of the  Company's  segments.  In 1996,  the
states  producing 5% or more of this  segment's  written  premiums were New York
(12%),  California (10%), Florida (7%),  Connecticut (6%) and Illinois and Texas
(5% each).

Principal Products
- ------------------

The Hartford's  North  American  Property & Casualty  segment  consists of three
major lines of  business:  Commercial,  Personal  and  Reinsurance.  These lines
provide a wide range of insurance  coverages  for  individuals  and  businesses.
Commercial is the largest line of business with $3.2 billion in written premiums
in  1996.  Workers'  compensation,   property,  automobile,  liability,  marine,
agricultural  and bond coverages are offered by the Commercial line of business.
The  Hartford  ranks among the largest  carriers  of personal  lines  insurance,
providing homeowners,  automobile and fire coverages to individuals across North
America  including a special  program  designed  exclusively  for members of the
American Association of Retired Persons ("AARP").  Additionally, The Hartford is
a major international reinsurer, with operations in Hong Kong, Spain, the United
Kingdom,  Germany and Canada. (See the Reinsurance section of Item 1 under Other
Matters for additional information.)

Methods of Distribution
- -----------------------

The North American Property & Casualty segment provides  insurance  products and
services  through  its home  office  located in  Hartford,  Connecticut,  and 39
domestic regional offices. The Company markets its products nationwide utilizing
a variety of  distribution  networks  including the use of  approximately  6,000
independent agents and direct marketing. Independent agents, who often represent
other  companies as well,  are  compensated  on a  commission  basis and are not
employees of The Hartford.  Additionally,  the Company  assumes  insurance  from
other  insurers  and cedes  insurance  to other  insurers or  reinsurers  in the
worldwide reinsurance market.

Competition
- -----------

The property and casualty insurance industry is a highly challenging environment
in which The Hartford  competes with other stock  companies,  mutual  companies,
self insurers and other underwriting  organizations.  Intense  competition among
insurers,  combined  with the continued  effects of the last economic  downturn,
have created  difficult market  conditions in the domestic property and casualty
industry.   This   competitive   environment  is  created  by  tremendous  price
competition,  consolidation  and  globalization  of companies,  exploration  and
utilization  of  alternative   distribution  techniques  and  emphasis  on  cost
containment and reduction.  

                                     - 2 -

A  major  competitive  advantage  of The  Hartford  is the  exclusive  licensing
arrangement with AARP to provide personal automobile,  homeowners and home-based
business  insurance  products  to its members  through the year 2002.  Favorable
"baby   boomer"   demographics   are  expected  to  increase   AARP   membership
significantly during this period. During 1996, The Hartford's  relationship with
AARP was further strengthened when it was awarded a contract to provide customer
service for all health  insurance  products  offered through AARP's Group Health
Insurance  Program  effective  January 1, 1998.  Additionally,  The Hartford has
implemented expense management  disciplines within the North American Property &
Casualty  segment  which  are  designed  to  maintain  efficient  and  effective
underwriting, servicing and claim settlement operations.

LIFE

The Hartford's Life segment provides  insurance and retirement  products for the
benefit of  millions  of  individuals.  This  segment has been among the fastest
growing major life insurance  operations for the past several years, as measured
by assets. The Hartford's  domestic life insurance  operations achieved the rank
of 8th largest life insurer in the United States at December 31, 1995,  based on
statutory  admitted  assets  according to A.M.  Best. In the past year, the Life
segment's total assets have grown 25% to $76.3 billion at December 31, 1996. The
Life segment generated $4.4 billion in revenues and $249 in net income in 1996.

The Life  segment,  headquartered  in Simsbury,  Connecticut,  operates in three
principal  divisions:   Investment  Products,  Individual  Life  Insurance,  and
Employee  Benefits.  Each  division  has grown  significantly  in  revenues  and
operating income. In addition,  the Life segment maintains a Corporate Operation
through which it reports net investment  income on assets  representing  surplus
not  assigned to any of its  business  segments  and certain  other  revenue and
expenses not specifically allocable to any of its business segments.

Principal Products
- ------------------

The Investment  Products division focuses on the savings and retirement needs of
the growing  number of  individuals  who are  preparing  for  retirement or have
already  retired.  This division  offers fixed and variable  annuities,  certain
deferred  compensation  and retirement plan services,  mutual funds,  investment
management  services and certain other financial  products.  The Individual Life
Insurance   division  markets  both  variable  and  fixed  universal   life-type
contracts,  as well as single premium variable life and term life products.  The
primary  products of the Employee  Benefits  division  include group life, group
long-term and short-term managed disability, stop-loss and supplementary medical
coverage to employers and  employer-sponsored  plans,  and accidental  death and
dismemberment,  travel and special risk coverage to employers and  associations,
as well as specialty  business such as corporate  owned life insurance  ("COLI")
and reinsurance.

Methods of Distribution
- -----------------------

The Life segment sells a variety of individual and group financial  services and
insurance  products  through a combination of  broker-dealers,  licensed agents,
third party  administrators  and a direct sales force.  The Investment  Products
division primarily distributes through broker-dealers and financial institutions
for individual  sales,  and through  employees of the Company for  institutional
sales. The Individual Life Insurance  division  distributes its products through
insurance agents, broker-dealers and financial institutions,  typically assisted
by a dedicated group of Company  employees.  Employee Benefits division products
are distributed  through  insurance  agents and brokers,  usually  assisted by a
dedicated group of Company employees.

Competition
- -----------

The life  insurance  industry in the United  States is highly  competitive  with
approximately 2,000 insurers vying for business. Competitive factors in the life
insurance  industry  include,  but are not limited to, price,  name recognition,
quality of distribution systems and financial ratings. In the individual annuity
market, sales volume is also dependent on fund performance, an array of fund and
product  options,  product design and credited rates.  The Company was rated the
number  one  writer  of  variable  annuities  for 1996 with a 13%  market  share
according to the Variable Annuity and Research Data Service.

INTERNATIONAL

The Hartford's  International  segment consists of European companies offering a
variety of  insurance  products  designed to meet the needs of local  customers.
These companies  include ITT London & Edinburgh  ("L&E"),  headquartered  in the
United Kingdom, Zwolsche Algemeene ("Zwolsche"), located in both the Netherlands
and Belgium,  and ITT Ercos in Spain. The  International  segment generated $1.6
billion in revenues and $139 in net income in 1996.  Assets totaled $5.3 billion
at December 31, 1996.

Principal Products
- ------------------

L&E offers both personal and commercial  lines property and casualty  insurance.
Personal lines include  automobile,  homeowners and creditor  (including  credit
life) products. Commercial lines include property and liability products sold to
small to medium sized  clients.  L&E also provides  marine  products  within the
London market. Zwolsche sells property and casualty and life insurance products.
Personal  lines products at Zwolsche  include  automobile,  hospitalization  and
homeowners.  Commercial  products,  including  automobile,  are sold to small to
medium  sized  clients.  Zwolsche  life  insurance  operations  offer term life,
mortgage and pension products.  ITT Ercos provides both personal and commercial,
property and casualty, and life insurance products.

Methods of Distribution
- -----------------------

The  International  segment  conducts the majority of its business  through over
10,000 independent brokers in Western Europe. 

                                     - 3 -

These  brokers are not  employees  of The  Hartford  and often  represent  other
companies as well. As such, they are compensated on a commission basis.

Competition
- -----------

In the  International  segment,  competition in personal lines  insurance  comes
primarily  from  direct  writers,  while  in the  commercial  insurance  market,
competition  comes largely from  "composites".  Composites are well  established
companies with both life and property and casualty  operations.  Within Europe's
life  insurance  industry,  there also exists heavy  competition  from banks and
direct writers.

RUNOFF

The Hartford's  Runoff segment  consists of the property and casualty  insurance
operations of The Hartford  which have ceased  writing new and renewal  business
and the closed book of  guaranteed  rate contract  business  ("Closed Book GRC")
which includes life products with fixed or indexed rates that are guaranteed for
a specific period.  Closed Book GRC had no new or renewal business as of the end
of 1994. The Runoff segment has no new product sales,  distribution  system,  or
competitive  issues.  The property and casualty insurance  operations  primarily
include   First  State,   located  in  Boston,   Massachusetts   and   Fencourt,
headquartered in Bermuda.

The  primary  objective  of the Runoff  segment is to ensure the full and timely
payment  of all  runoff  liabilities.  Specifically,  the  primary  focus of the
property and casualty insurance  operations is the proper disposition of claims,
the resolution of disputes,  and the collection of reinsurance  proceeds related
to policies  written and reinsured  prior to 1985. The Closed Book GRC's primary
focus is to closely  match the interest  rate  sensitivities  of the assets with
those of the  liabilities,  as well as,  matching  the duration of its assets to
that of its liabilities.


OTHER MATTERS

PROPERTY AND CASUALTY RESERVES

The Hartford  establishes  reserves to provide for the estimated costs of paying
claims made by  policyholders or against  policyholders.  These reserves include
estimates  for both  claims  that have been  reported  and those  that have been
incurred  but not yet  reported to The  Hartford  and include  estimates  of all
expenses  associated with processing and settling these claims.  This estimation
process is primarily  based on historical  experience  and involves a variety of
actuarial  techniques which analyze trends and other relevant  factors.  Further
discussion on The Hartford's  property and casualty reserves may be found in the
Reserves section of the MD&A. In addition,  a separate process including a study
which reviewed and identified environmental and asbestos exposures in the United
States,  was performed in 1996 and is fully discussed in the  Environmental  and
Asbestos Claims section of the MD&A.

The  Hartford  continually  reviews its  estimated  claims and claim  adjustment
expense  reserves  as  additional  experience  and other  relevant  data  become
available and reserve  levels are adjusted  accordingly.  Such  adjustments  are
reflected in net income of the period in which they are made.

The Hartford  continues to receive claims asserting  damages from  environmental
pollution   and  related   clean-up   costs  and  injuries   from  asbestos  and
asbestos-related  products. Due to deviations from past experience and a variety
of social,  economic and legal  issues,  the  Company's  ability to estimate the
future  policy  benefits,   unpaid  claims  and  claim  adjustment  expenses  is
significantly impacted.

Certain  liabilities for unpaid claims,  principally  for  permanently  disabled
claimants,  terminated reinsurance treaties and certain contracts that fund loss
run-offs for unrelated parties have been discounted to present value. The amount
of the  discount  was  approximately  $472 and $451 as of December  31, 1996 and
1995, respectively,  and the amortization of the discount had no material effect
on net income during 1996, 1995 and 1994, respectively.

In  the  judgment  of  The  Hartford's  management,  all  information  currently
available has been properly  considered in establishing  the reserves for unpaid
claims and claim adjustment expenses.

                                     - 4 -

PROPERTY AND CASUALTY RESERVES (CONTINUED)

A reconciliation of liabilities for unpaid claims and claim adjustment  expenses
is  herein  referenced  from  Note  1(c)  of  Notes  to  Consolidated  Financial
Statements.  A table depicting the historical development of the liabilities for
unpaid claims and claim adjustment expenses follows.




                                     - 5 -

LIFE RESERVES

In accordance with applicable insurance regulations under which the Life segment
operates,  life insurance  subsidiaries  of The Hartford  establish and carry as
liabilities  actuarially  determined  reserves  which are calculated to meet The
Hartford's  future  obligations.  Reserves  for life  insurance  and  disability
contracts are based on actuarially recognized methods using prescribed morbidity
and mortality tables in general use in the United States modified to reflect The
Hartford's actual  experience when  appropriate.  These reserves are computed at
amounts that,  with  additions from premiums to be received and with interest on
such reserves  compounded  annually at certain assumed rates, are expected to be
sufficient to meet The Hartford's  policy  obligations at their maturities or in
the event of an insured's death.  Reserves include  unearned  premiums,  premium
deposits, claims reported but not yet paid, claims incurred but not reported and
claims in the  process of  settlement.  Reserves  for  assumed  reinsurance  are
computed on bases essentially comparable to direct insurance reserves.

For The Hartford's individual life, universal life and interest-sensitive  whole
life policies,  reserves are set according to premiums collected,  plus interest
credited,  less charges. Other fixed death benefit reserves are based on assumed
investment  yield,  persistency,  mortality  and  morbidity as per commonly used
actuarial tables, expenses and margins for adverse deviations. For the Company's
group  disability  policies,  the level of  reserves  is based on a  variety  of
factors including particular diagnoses, termination rates and benefit payments.

The  stability  of The  Hartford's  annuity  and other  interest-sensitive  life
insurance  reserves is  enhanced by policy  restrictions  on the  withdrawal  of
funds.  Withdrawals in excess of allowable  penalty-free  amounts are assessed a
surrender  charge during a penalty  period of  approximately  seven years.  Such
surrender  charge is initially a percentage  of the  accumulation  value,  which
varies by product,  and generally decreases gradually during the penalty period.
Surrender  charges are set at levels to protect The Hartford  from loss on early
terminations  and to reduce the likelihood of  policyholders  terminating  their
policies during periods of increasing  interest rates,  thereby  lengthening the
effective  duration of policy liabilities and improving the Company's ability to
maintain  profitability  on such policies.  In addition,  The  Hartford's  fixed
market value  adjusted  annuities  discourage  surrender by  policyholders.  The
Hartford's  reserves  comply  in all  material  respects  with  state  insurance
department  statutory  requirements;  however,  in  the  Consolidated  Financial
Statements,  life insurance reserves are determined in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles, which may vary from statutory requirements.

REGULATION AND PREMIUM RATES

Insurance  companies are subject to  comprehensive  and detailed  regulation and
supervision  throughout the United States. The extent of such regulation varies,
but generally has its source in statutes which delegate regulatory,  supervisory
and administrative powers to state insurance departments. Such powers relate to,
among other things,  the standards of solvency which must be met and maintained;
the licensing of insurers and their  agents;  the nature of and  limitations  on
investments; premium rates; claim handling and trade practices;  restrictions on
the size of risks  which  may be  insured  under a single  policy;  deposits  of
securities for the benefit of policyholders;  approval of policy forms; periodic
examinations of the affairs of companies;  annual and other reports  required to
be filed on the financial  condition of companies or for other purposes;  fixing
maximum  interest  rates on life  insurance  policy loans and minimum  rates for
accumulation  of  surrender  values;  and the  adequacy  of  reserves  and other
necessary  provisions for unearned premiums,  unpaid claims and claim adjustment
expenses and other liabilities, both reported and unreported.

Regulatory  requirements  applying to property and casualty  premium  rates vary
from state to state,  but generally  provide that rates shall not be inadequate,
excessive  or  unfairly  discriminatory.  Rates  for  many  products,  including
automobile and homeowners insurance, are subject to prior regulatory approval in
many  states.  Ocean  marine  insurance  rates are exempt from rate  regulation.
Subject to regulatory requirements,  management determines the rates charged for
its policies.  Methods for arriving at rates vary by product,  exposure  assumed
and size of risk.

While premium rates in the property and casualty  insurance business are for the
most part subject to regulation,  such rates are not in most  instances  uniform
for all  insurers  within a given  jurisdiction,  or in all  jurisdictions.  The
Hartford is a member of various fire, casualty and surety rating  organizations.
For some lines of business,  The Hartford  uses the rates and rating plans which
are filed by these organizations in the various states, while for other lines of
business it uses loss cost data  published by such  organizations.  The Hartford
also  uses  its  own  independent   rates  or  otherwise   departs  from  rating
organization rates, where appropriate.

Most states have enacted  legislation which regulates  insurance holding company
systems such as The Hartford.  This  legislation  provides  that each  insurance
company in the system is required to register with the  insurance  department of
its state of domicile  and furnish  information  concerning  the  operations  of
companies  within the holding  company  system which may  materially  affect the
operations, management or financial condition of the insurers within the system.
All transactions within a holding company system affecting insurers must be fair
and  equitable.  Notice to the insurance  departments  is required  prior to the
consummation  of  transactions  affecting the ownership or control of an insurer
and of certain  material  transactions  between an insurer and any entity in its
holding  company system.  In addition,  certain of such  transactions  cannot be
consummated without the applicable insurance department's prior approval.

State  insurance   regulation   requires   property  and  casualty  insurers  to
participate   in  assigned  risk  plans,   reinsurance   facilities   and  joint
underwriting  associations,  which are  mechanisms to provide risks with various
basic or minimum  insurance  coverage  when they are not  available in voluntary

                                     - 6 -

markets.  Such  mechanisms  are  most  prevalent  for  automobile  and  workers'
compensation  insurance,  but a majority of states also mandate participation in
so-called  FAIR Plans or Windstorm  Plans  providing  basic  property  coverage.
Additionally, some states mandate such participation in facilities for providing
medical  malpractice  insurance.  Participation  is based  upon the  amount of a
company's  written  premiums in a particular  state for the classes of insurance
involved.

The extent of insurance  regulation on business outside the United States varies
significantly among the countries in which The Hartford operates. Some countries
have  minimal   regulatory   requirements,   while  others   regulate   insurers
extensively.   Foreign  insurers  in  many  countries  are  faced  with  greater
restrictions   than   domestic   competitors   domiciled   in  that   particular
jurisdiction.  The Hartford's International operations are comprised of insurers
licensed in their respective countries and, therefore,  are subject to generally
less restrictive domestic insurance regulations.

REINSURANCE

In accordance  with normal industry  practice,  The Hartford is involved in both
the cession and  assumption of insurance  with other  insurance and  reinsurance
companies. For property and casualty operations,  these reinsurance arrangements
provide greater diversification of business and limit The Hartford's maximum net
loss arising from large risks or catastrophes.

A major portion of The Hartford's property and casualty  reinsurance is effected
under general reinsurance contracts known as treaties, or, in some instances, is
negotiated on an individual risk basis,  known as facultative  reinsurance.  The
Hartford also has in-force  excess of loss contracts with other  reinsurers that
protect it against a specified  part or all of certain  losses  over  stipulated
amounts.

The ceding of insurance does not discharge the original insurer from its primary
liability to the policyholder. The original insurer would remain liable in those
situations  where the reinsurer is unable to meet the obligations  assumed under
reinsurance  agreements.  The Hartford has  established  strict  standards  that
govern the  placement of  reinsurance  and monitors  ceded  insurance  security.
Virtually all of The Hartford's property and casualty reinsurance is placed with
reinsurers  that  meet  strict  financial  criteria   established  by  a  credit
committee.

Relative to life operations,  The Hartford reinsures with other companies. As of
December 31, 1996, the maximum amount of life insurance retained on any one life
by any of the life operations is approximately $1.3,  excluding accidental death
benefits.

INVESTMENT OPERATIONS

An important  element of the financial  results of The Hartford is the return on
invested  assets.  The Hartford's  investment  activities are generally  divided
between  property and casualty  insurance  and life  insurance.  The  investment
portfolios of both the property and casualty and the life operations are managed
based  on  the  underlying   characteristics  and  nature  of  their  respective
liabilities.

The investment objective of property and casualty operations is the maximization
of after-tax income  consistent with long-term capital growth and maintenance of
appropriate liquidity to meet corporate and policyholder  obligations.  Property
and casualty  investment  strategies are developed based on a variety of factors
including business needs, regulatory requirements and tax considerations.

The primary  investment  objective  of the Life  segment's  general  account and
guaranteed  separate accounts is to maximize  after-tax returns  consistent with
acceptable  risk  parameters  (including  the  management  of the interest  rate
sensitivity  of  invested  assets  to that of  policyholder  obligations).  Life
operations  use  various  derivatives  to  modify  the  characteristics  of  its
investments.

For a further discussion of strategies including derivative utilization, see the
Investments  section  of the MD&A under  "Life  Asset and  Liability  Management
Strategies" , as well as Note 3 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

ITEM 2.  PROPERTIES

The Hartford owns the land and buildings  comprising  its Hartford  location and
other  properties  within the  greater  Hartford,  Connecticut  area which total
approximately 1.6 million square feet. The Hartford's international subsidiaries
own  approximately  202  thousand  square  feet of  office  space in the  United
Kingdom,  218  thousand  square feet of office space in the  Netherlands  and 94
thousand square feet of office space in Spain. In addition,  The Hartford leases
approximately  5.1 million  square  feet  throughout  the United  States and 156
thousand square feet in other countries.

ITEM 3.  LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

The Hartford is a defendant in various lawsuits arising out of its business.  In
the opinion of  management,  final outcome of these matters will not  materially
affect the consolidated financial position,  results of operations or cash flows
of The Hartford.

The Hartford is involved in claim  litigation  arising in the ordinary course of
business and  accounts for such  activity  through the  establishment  of policy
reserves.  As  further  discussed  above  and  in the  MD&A  under  the  section
Environmental   and  Asbestos   Claims,   The  Hartford   continues  to  receive
environmental  and  asbestos  claims  which  involve   significant   uncertainty
regarding  policy  coverage  issues.   Regarding  these  claims,   The  Hartford
continually  reviews its overall reserve  levels,  reserving  methodologies  and
reinsurance coverages.

ITEM 4.  SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS

No matter was submitted to a vote of security holders of The Hartford during the
fourth quarter of the fiscal year covered by this report.

PART II

ITEM 5.  MARKET FOR THE HARTFORD'S COMMON STOCK AND RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS

Hartford's  common stock  commenced on the NYSE) through  December 29, 1995 (the
last trading day in 1995).

At February 28, 1997, there were approximately  60,000 shareholders of record of
The Hartford's common stock.

In 1997,  The  Hartford  expects to continue to pay  quarterly  dividends on its
common  stock  of  $0.40  per  share.  Dividend  decisions  will be based on and
affected by a number of factors,  including the operating  results and financial
requirements of The Hartford on a stand-alone basis and the impact of

                                     - 8 -

regulatory  restrictions  discussed in the Liquidity Requirements section of the
MD&A. Prior to the Distribution,  dividends that The Hartford declared were paid
to ITT, which then paid dividends to its shareholders.

There are also  various  legal  limitations  governing  the  extent to which The
Hartford's insurance  subsidiaries may extend credit, pay dividends or otherwise
provide funds to ITT Hartford Group,  Inc. as discussed in the Capital Resources
and Liquidity section of the MD&A under "Liquidity Requirements".

================================================================================
DISTRIBUTION
================================================================================
On December 19, 1995, ITT Corporation ("ITT") distributed all of the outstanding
shares of common stock of The Hartford to the  shareholders  of ITT common stock
(the  "Distribution"  or  "Spin-off").  As a  result  of the  Distribution,  The
Hartford became an independent publicly-traded company. "Regular Way" trading of
The  Hartford's  common stock on the New York Stock  Exchange  (under the symbol
"HIG") commenced on December 20, 1995. In connection with this transaction,  ITT
transferred First State Insurance Company,  together with its subsidiaries,  and
Fencourt Reinsurance Company, Ltd., both of which were wholly owned companies of
ITT, to The Hartford prior to the Distribution. Consistent with the Consolidated
Financial  Statements  and related  Notes,  the financial  information  included
herein  reflects the results of The Hartford as if it were a separate entity for
all periods presented. For additional information,  see "Distribution Agreement"
under Capital Resources and Liquidity.



                                     - 10 -

Net income,  excluding the impact of accounting  changes,  net realized  capital
gains,  after-tax,  other charges and allocated  Distribution items was $537 for
1996  compared  with $478 for 1995 and $523 in 1994.  The Hartford  defines this
presentation of after-tax operational results as "core earnings".

Core earnings  increased $59, or 12%, to $537 in 1996 due primarily to increased
revenues  earned on a  growing  annuity  asset  base,  growth in net  investment
income,  increased group insurance premiums and favorable mortality  experience,
partially  offset  by  after-tax   underwriting  losses  resulting  from  higher
catastrophes in 1996.

1995 core earnings  decreased  $45, or 9%, from 1994 due primarily to the impact
of the Dow  Corning  breast  implant  claims  settlement,  a loss  from a single
industrial fire covered by the Industrial Risk Insurance ("IRI") pool and losses
attributable  to  Hurricane  Opal.  Additionally,  results in the closed book of
guaranteed rate contract  business  ("Closed Book GRC") reflected  losses due to
lower  investment  earnings  on  mortgage-backed   securities,   the  result  of
prepayment  experience  in excess  of  assumed  levels.  Improved  property  and
casualty net  investment  income and growth in sales of annuities  and corporate
owned life  insurance  ("COLI")  products  partially  offset  the core  earnings
decline.

CUMULATIVE EFFECT OF ACCOUNTING CHANGES

Items  excluded  from  core  earnings  include  the  impact of the  adoption  of
Statement of Financial  Accounting  Standards ("SFAS") No. 115,  "Accounting for
Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities", and the change in the method
of  discounting to present value certain  workers'  compensation  reserves,  the
cumulative net effect of which totaled $12, after-tax, recorded as of January 1,
1994. Upon adoption of SFAS No. 115, the amortized cost basis of mortgage-backed
interest-only  investments  were written  down to fair value and  reflected as a
cumulative  effect  of  accounting  change of $(30)  after-tax.  A change in the
method of discounting certain workers'  compensation reserves from one that used
statutory  interest rates to one utilizing a "risk-free" market rate resulted in
a $42 after-tax cumulative effect benefit.

NET REALIZED CAPITAL GAINS

See Investment Results in the Investments discussion.

OTHER CHARGES

Net income for 1996 includes other charges related to environmental and asbestos
reserve  increases,  net of taxes,  of $(429) in the North  American  Property &
Casualty segment and $(81) at First State in the Runoff segment (as discussed in
the Environmental and Asbestos Claims section),  recognition of losses on Closed
Book GRC of $(169) (as  discussed in the Runoff  section)  and other,  primarily
foreign  tax-related  items,  of $(2) in each of the North  American  Property &
Casualty and Life segments and $(10) in the Runoff segment.

ALLOCATED DISTRIBUTION ITEMS

As part of the  Distribution,  The Hartford  was  allocated  amounts  originally
recorded at the ITT corporate level.  The allocations  resulted in net income of
$14 and $50 in 1995 and 1994,  respectively.  For more  information on liability
sharing arrangements related to the Distribution,  see "Distribution  Agreement"
and "Tax Allocation Agreement" under Capital Resources and Liquidity.

INCOME TAXES

The  effective  tax  rates  for  1996,  1995 and  1994  were  20%,  24% and 25%,
respectively, excluding the impact of other charges in 1996. Tax-exempt interest
earned on invested  assets was the principal cause of effective rates lower than
the 35% U.S. statutory rate. Income taxes paid in 1996, 1995 and 1994 were $170,
$302 and $317,  respectively.  For additional  information,  see "Tax Allocation
Agreement" under Capital Resources and Liquidity.

SEGMENT RESULTS

The  Hartford's  reporting  segments  reflect the  management  structure  of the
Company. These segments consist of North American Property & Casualty, Life, and
International,  all of which represent ongoing  operations,  and Runoff.  Runoff
includes operations which have ceased writing new and renewal business.

Certain  transactions  between  segments  occur  during the year that  primarily
relate to tax settlements, insurance coverage, expense reimbursements,  services
provided and capital  contributions.  Certain  reinsurance  stop loss agreements
exist between the segments which specify that for  consideration  received,  one
segment will reimburse  another for losses incurred in excess of a predetermined
limit.  Also, one segment may purchase  group annuity  contracts from another to
fund pension costs and claim annuities to settle casualty claims.

The following is a summary of core earnings by segment.

                                     1996      1995       1994

                                     - 11 -

================================================================================
NORTH AMERICAN PROPERTY & CASUALTY
================================================================================


Core earnings for the North American  Property & Casualty  segment were $270, an
increase of $19 from 1995,  primarily  due to a $53  increase in  after-tax  net
investment  income partially offset by a $37 increase in after-tax  underwriting
loss.  The  increased  underwriting  loss  resulted  from  significantly  higher
catastrophe  and winter  storm losses in 1996  partially  offset by two material
items discussed in the following  Summary  Underwriting  Results section,  which
adversely affected underwriting results in 1995. 1995 core earnings of $251 were
down $58 from 1994 due to the two  material  items  noted,  as well as decreased
income  from  third  party  servicing  contracts  and  very  favorable  workers'
compensation loss experience in 1994.

Within the North American Property & Casualty segment,  management  analyzes the
results of  operations by the  following  four major  components on a before-tax
basis:

                                     1996      1995       1994
- ----------------------------------------------------------------
Underwriting results               $ (986)  $  (270)   $  (182)
Net investment income                 661       646        606
Net realized capital gains             15        29         69
Other miscellaneous expenses           89        71         29
- ----------------------------------------------------------------
  Operating income                 $ (399)  $   334    $   464
- ----------------------------------------------------------------

The following discussion summarizes  underwriting results by major operation (as
defined  below) and other  miscellaneous  expenses.  As  previously  noted,  net
investment  income  and net  realized  capital  gains are  covered in a separate
discussion in the Investments section. Other charges, consisting primarily of an
increase  in  environmental  and  asbestos   reserves,   are  discussed  in  the
Environmental and Asbestos Claims section.

SUMMARY UNDERWRITING RESULTS

Underwriting  results  represent  premiums  earned less incurred  claims,  claim
adjustment expenses and underwriting expenses. The following table shows written
premiums,  underwriting  results and combined  ratios for The  Hartford's  North
American Property & Casualty segment.

                                     1996      1995       1994
- ----------------------------------------------------------------
Written premiums                  $ 5,688   $ 5,670   $  5,648
Underwriting results [1]          $  (326)  $  (270)  $   (182)
Combined ratio [1] [2]              105.2     104.5      102.5
- ----------------------------------------------------------------
[1] 1996  excludes the impact of $660,  before-tax,  environmental  and asbestos
charge.  Including  the impact of this charge,  the combined  ratio for 1996 was
116.9 for the North American Property & Casualty  segment.
[2] "Combined ratio" is a common industry measurement of the results of property
and  casualty  insurance  underwriting.  This  ratio is the sum of the  ratio of
incurred claims and claim expenses to premiums earned (the "loss ratio") and the
ratio of  underwriting  expenses  incurred to  premiums  written  (the  "expense
ratio").  A combined  ratio  under 100.0  generally  indicates  an  underwriting
profit. Federal income taxes, net investment income, deferred policy acquisition
costs and other  non-underwriting  expenses  are not  reflected  in the combined
ratio.

Written  premiums  for this  segment  were up slightly in 1996 and 1995 from the
respective  prior year's  results.  Continued  growth in target  markets such as
reinsurance,  small commercial  accounts and business written under an exclusive
licensing  arrangement with The American Association of Retired Persons ("AARP")
was offset by decreased premiums from mid-to-large  commercial accounts,  agency
personal  lines  and  residual  markets.  The  conversion  of  certain  workers'
compensation  business to large deductible programs also depressed the growth in
written premiums.

1996  underwriting  losses  before-tax  increased $56 over 1995 primarily due to
severe  weather-related  catastrophe  experience,  most  notably  several  first
quarter winter storms and Hurricane Fran in September.  These events drove total
catastrophe  losses in 1996 to exceed 1995 by  approximately  $130 causing a 2.3
point increase in the combined ratio.

Underwriting  results for 1995 were $88 lower than the prior year largely due to
the impact of two items: a $40 loss, net of reinsurance,  in connection with the
settlement of claims against Dow Corning  Corporation  alleging  product defects
arising  from  breast  implants,  and a net $32  loss  resulting  from a  single
industrial fire covered by the IRI pool. These non-recurring items increased the
combined ratio by 1.3 points in 1995. The 1994 combined ratio of 102.5 was lower
than  both  the  adjusted  (excluding  the  non-recurring  items)  1995 and 1996
combined  ratios by 0.7  points and 0.4  points,  respectively,  largely  due to
favorable loss experience in workers' compensation in 1994.

The  North  American  Property  &  Casualty  segment  consists  of  three  major
operations:   Commercial,  Personal  and  Reinsurance.  A  description  of  each
operation, including an analysis of underwriting results, follows.

Commercial Insurance Operations (CIO) provides workers' compensation,  property,
automobile,  liability,  marine,  agricultural  and bond coverages to commercial
accounts  throughout  the United  States and Canada.  Excess and  surplus  lines
business not normally  written by standard lines insurers is also provided.  CIO
is organized into three customer market segments:  Commercial Business Insurance
Operations (CBI),  Commercial  Affinity Segment (CAS), and Specialty  Commercial
Lines  (SCL).  CBI provides  standard  commercial  business  for small  accounts
(Select Customer) and mid-sized insureds (Key Accounts). Agricultural, livestock
and marine  products are also managed within CBI. CAS provides  commercial  risk
management  products and services to members of affinity groups and customers of
financial institutions. SCL provides insurance through retailers and wholesalers
to large  commercial  clients and  insureds  requiring a variety of  specialized
coverages.  SCL's  results  include  the bond lines and First  State  Management
Group,  a leading  underwriter  of excess and surplus  lines  business  produced
primarily through wholesale brokers.

Written premiums decreased 4% in 1996 to $3.2 billion, compared to a 3% decrease
in the  previous  year.  A decline in workers'  compensation  premium  from less
profitable  involuntary  workers'  compensation  pools and increasingly  intense
price competition are the primary causes for the 1996 decrease.  The decrease in
1995 premium volume reflected the conversion of workers'  compensation  business
to large deductible programs and a reduction in The Hartford's  participation in
the less profitable voluntary and involuntary workers' compensation pools.

1996 underwriting results improved $26 compared with the prior year,  reflecting
the  impact in 1995 of a $40 loss,  net of  reinsurance,  in  connection  with a
settlement of claims against Dow Corning  Corporation  alleging  product defects
arising from breast  implants.  Excluding  the impact of this  settlement on the
prior year comparison,  1996  underwriting  results  deteriorated $14 from 1995,
reflecting a 0.3 increase in the combined  ratio to 105.7 from the adjusted 1995
level.  This decline was due to  deterioration  in property  results  which were
adversely  impacted by severe  catastrophes  and winter storms and several large
losses.  Despite intense  competition,  workers'  compensation results partially
offset the 1996  deterioration  reflecting the impacts of  legislative  reforms,
depopulation in residual pools and effective managed care related initiatives.

1995 underwriting  performance  deteriorated $108 compared with 1994, increasing
the combined ratio 4.1 points to 106.6.  Excluding the impact of the Dow Corning
settlement,  1995 results declined $68 over 1994. This decline was the result of
higher claims and claim  adjustment  expense costs in workers'  compensation and
liability products and the increase in intensity of competition.

Personal operations  provides  automobile,  homeowners,  home-based business and
fire coverages to individuals throughout the United States and Canada.  Personal
operations  are organized to provide  customized  products and services to three
market  opportunities:  the  membership  of  AARP  through  a  direct  marketing
operation;  customers  who prefer local agent  involvement  through a network of
independent  agents;  and  members  of  other  affinity  groups  through  a  new
organization  that is  building  from the AARP  operation  competencies.  AARP's
exclusive licensing  arrangement continues through the year 2002, thus providing
the Company with an important competitive advantage.

Written  premiums  increased 3% in 1996 compared to a 4% increase in 1995.  Both
years  include  strong  growth  in AARP  premium  which is  benefiting  from the
favorable  expansion of this demographic group,  partially offset by a selective
disinvestment in unprofitable states and under-performing  agents. AARP premiums
represented 64% of the 1996 Personal operations premium, up from 62% in 1995 and
59% in 1994.

Underwriting  results decreased by $89 in 1996, with a 4.3 point increase in the
combined  ratio.  These results were due to severe  catastrophe and winter storm
losses,  partially offset by improved  automobile  profitability  resulting from
expanded cost containment  initiatives.  Underwriting results improved by $35 in
1995 over 1994 with a corresponding  1.8 point improvement in the combined ratio
due to lower catastrophe losses and improved automobile results.

The  Hartford  assumes   reinsurance   worldwide   through  its  seven  Hartford
Reinsurance  Company  ("HartRe")  offices  located in Hartford,  San  Francisco,
Toronto,  London,  Madrid,  Munich and Hong Kong. HartRe primarily writes treaty
reinsurance through professional  reinsurance brokers covering various property,
casualty, specialty and marine classes of business.

Written premiums increased 17% in 1996 and 9% in 1995 primarily due to growth in
U.S.  casualty and specialty  lines.  This growth resulted from a combination of
new business  opportunities,  an increased level of renewals,  and continued new
product  development  in  specialty  lines,  partially  offset by a reduction in
domestic and international property and marine rates.

1996 underwriting  results increased $7 compared with 1995. Excluding the impact
of the 1995 IRI fire loss described  previously,  underwriting results decreased
$25 in 1996 due to underwriting  losses of $11, resulting from a strategic shift
in the business mix to longer-tailed  casualty and specialty lines,  catastrophe
and severe winter storm losses of $5 and several large individual risk losses of
$9.

1995  underwriting  results  decreased  $15 compared  with 1994 due primarily to
HartRe's  participation  in the IRI pool which suffered its largest single loss.
HartRe's  share of that single loss was $32.  Excluding the impact of this loss,
HartRe  generated an  underwriting  gain of $10 and a combined  ratio of 97.4 in
1995.

OTHER MISCELLANEOUS EXPENSES

Other miscellaneous  expenses,  which also include  miscellaneous  income items,
were  $89 in 1996,  up from $71 in 1995.  This  increase  was  primarily  due to
increased debt costs from additional  borrowings  partially  offset by increased
service  fee  income  from  third  party  administration  and  involuntary  pool
servicing  contracts.  Two major national servicing  contracts,  entered into in
1996, contributed to this increase in service fee income.

Other  miscellaneous  expenses for 1995 of $71 increased from $29 in 1994.  This
increase was largely attributable to a decrease in service fee income from third
party administration and involuntary pool servicing contracts.  The reduction in
service fee income was due to lower servicing  carrier  allowances caused by the
substantial   depopulation  of  workers'  compensation  and  involuntary  pools.
Increased debt costs also impacted other miscellaneous expenses in 1995.

OUTLOOK

Difficult market  conditions and intense price  competition  within the property
and casualty  industry show no signs of diminishing  in the near term.  However,
two  major  actions  were  completed  in 1996  which  management  believes  will
counterbalance  these negative  external factors and position the North American
Property & Casualty segment for significant improvement in operating performance
in 1997.  First, the adverse impact on earnings from  environmental and asbestos
liabilities that had been  experienced in prior years was addressed  through the
establishment  of  additional  reserves upon  completion of a thorough  database
review as  described  in the  Environmental  and  Asbestos  Claims  section.  In
addition,  the North  American  Property & Casualty  segment was  reorganized to
maximize responsiveness to its customers by grouping market segments and product
lines according to their respective markets and further strengthening an already
strong,  results-focused  management team. As a result of these actions, as well
as dedication to growing targeted market segments,  rigorous expense  management
and utilization of alternative  distribution  channels,  management believes the
North  American  Property  &  Casualty  segment  stands  poised to  successfully
overcome the challenges ahead.



                                     - 14 -

Core  earnings in the Life segment  increased  $30, or 14%, to $251 in 1996 from
$221 in 1995  primarily  reflecting  (i) an  increase  in earnings of $32 in the
Investment Products division  principally driven by an increase in total account
value due to sales of individual annuities and stock market appreciation, (ii) a
$7  increase  in  the  Individual  Life  Insurance  division  due to  growth  in
individual life insurance in force and favorable mortality experience,  (iii) an
increase in earnings of $13 in the Employee Benefits division principally due to
an increase in group insurance premiums and favorable  morbidity  experience and
(iv) a decrease in core earnings of $22 in the Corporate  Operation division due
primarily to a guaranty fund adjustment of $10 in 1995 resulting from lower than
expected  insolvencies in the insurance  industry as well as an increase in debt
service costs in 1996.

Core earnings  increased  $72, or 48%, to $221 in 1995 from $149 in 1994 largely
due to (i) a $30 increase in the Investment Products division principally driven
by an increase in total account  value,  (ii) an $11 increase in the  Individual
Life  Insurance  division  principally  due to growth in the  inforce  block and
favorable  mortality  experience  and expense trends and (iii) a $21 increase in
the Employee Benefits division  principally due to an increase in group premiums
and  favorable  morbidity  experience,  as well as growth  in the COLI  block of
business.

The Life segment  operates in three principal  divisions:  Investment  Products,
Individual Life Insurance and Employee  Benefits as outlined in the table below.
In addition,  the Life segment maintains a Corporate  Operation through which it
reports net investment income on assets representing surplus not assigned to any
of its business segments and certain other revenue and expenses not specifically
allocable to any of its business segments.



The following describes each division,  including products and services offered,
and analyzes the above results.

Investment Products
- -------------------

The Investment Products division markets fixed and variable annuities,  deferred
compensation   plan  services  for  municipal   governments  and   corporations,
structured  settlements and other special purpose annuity contracts,  investment
management  contracts,  and mutual  funds.  The Company was rated the number one
writer of variable  annuities for 1996 with a 13% market share  according to the
Variable Annuity and Research Data Service.

Revenues increased $257, or 34%, to $1.0 billion in 1996 from $761 in 1995. This
increase  was  principally  the result of a $216  increase in premiums and other
considerations,  reflecting a substantial  increase in aggregate fees earned due
to the division's growing block of separate account assets. The average separate
account  assets of this segment  increased  to $37.5  billion in 1996 from $26.3
billion in 1995 primarily due to sales of individual  annuities of approximately
$10  billion  in 1996 and $7  billion  in 1995,  as well as  significant  market
appreciation  in both 1996 and 1995. In addition,  the average  general  account
assets of this  segment  increased  to $7.7 billion in 1996 from $6.5 billion in
1995  largely  as a result of  growth  in the  general  account  portion  of the
individual  variable annuity products of the Investment  Products division.  The
growth in this division in 1996 also resulted in an increase in total  benefits,
claims and expenses of $199, or 34%, to $791 in 1996 from $592 in 1995.  The 38%
growth in average  account value in 1996,  coupled with an overall  reduction in
individual  annuity expenses as a percentage of total individual annuity account
value to 28 basis  points in 1996 from 31 basis points in 1995,  contributed  to
the growth in core earnings of $32, or 28%, to $146 in 1996 from $114 in 1995.

Similar  factors  generated  an increase  in 1995,  as  compared  with 1994,  in
revenues of $190, or 33%,  average  general  account assets of $1.3 billion,  or
26%, average  separate  account assets of $8.0 billion,  or 44%, total benefits,
claims and  expenses  of $149,  or 34%,  core  earnings  of $30,  or 36%,  and a
reduction in individual  annuity  expenses as a percentage  of total  individual
annuity account value to 31 basis points in 1995 from 35 basis points in 1994.

Individual Life Insurance
- -------------------------

Individual Life Insurance  products include  variable life insurance,  universal
life insurance,  interest-sensitive whole life insurance and term life policies.
Individual Life Insurance  business also includes  modified  guaranteed life and
traditional whole life.

Revenues  increased  $64, or 16%, to $472 from $408 in 1995.  This  increase was
primarily due to a $47 increase in premiums and other considerations, reflecting
an increase in cost of  insurance  charges and  variable  life fees applied to a
larger

                                     - 15 -

block of business as  insurance  in force  increased to $52 billion in 1996 from
$48 billion in 1995. Total benefits,  claims and expenses increased $54, or 15%,
to $404 in 1996 from $350 in 1995.  This  increase  reflects the increase in the
block of  individual  life  insurance  business  offset  partially  by favorable
mortality  results.  The combination of business growth and favorable  mortality
experience  resulted in an  increase  in core  earnings of $7, or 19%, to $44 in
1996 from $37 in 1995.

Two other events,  along with those mentioned  above,  influenced the results of
1995 compared with 1994.  In 1994,  the Life segment  assumed $218 of individual
life insurance reserves from the Pacific Standard Life Insurance  Company.  This
affected  both  revenues  and total  benefits,  claims  and  expenses  for 1994.
Expenses  were  also  positively   influenced  by  the   consolidation   of  the
professional  functions previously performed in Minneapolis,  Minnesota into the
Life  segment's  Simsbury,   Connecticut  location.   The  combination  of  this
acquisition,   internal  growth,  expense  management  and  favorable  mortality
experience caused core earnings in this division to increase $11, or 42%, to $37
in 1995 from $26 in 1994.

Employee Benefits
- -----------------

Employee  Benefits  consists  of two areas of  operation:  Group  Insurance  and
Specialty  Insurance  Operations.  Through the Group  Insurance  Operation,  the
Company markets group long-term and short-term managed  disability,  group life,
stop   loss,   and    supplementary    medical   coverage   to   employers   and
employer-sponsored  plans and  accidental  death and  dismemberment,  travel and
special risk coverage to associations.  The Specialty  Insurance  Operation unit
consists of the Company's COLI business, life/health reinsurance operations, and
international operations.

Revenues  increased  $311,  or 12%, to $2.8 billion in 1996 from $2.5 billion in
1995.  This  increase was largely the result of (i) a $162  increase in premiums
and other considerations, reflecting a $226 increase in group insurance premiums
from strong group disability  sales and renewals,  partially offset by a decline
in leveraged COLI premiums as a result of the Health  Insurance  Portability and
Accountability  Act of 1996 ("HIPA Act of 1996", as discussed below) legislation
and (ii) a $149 increase in net investment income,  primarily due to an increase
in COLI account values.  Total benefits,  claims and expenses increased $295, or
12%, to $2.7 billion in 1996 from $2.4 billion in 1995. This increase  generally
reflected  an  increased  block of group  disability  business  and other  group
insurance  and an  increase  in the  Life  segment's  COLI  block  of  business,
partially offset by a $41 decrease in dividends to  policyholders  primarily due
to the  elimination  of sales of leveraged  COLI as a result of the enactment of
the HIPA Act of 1996. In addition,  expenses in the group insurance business, as
a percentage of premiums, have declined over the past several years. This trend,
along with favorable mortality and morbidity experience,  as well as the factors
mentioned  above,  resulted in an increase in core  earnings in this division of
$13, or 20%, to $79 in 1996 from $66 in 1995.

Sales of  leveraged  COLI  were  $867 and $306 in 1995 and  1994,  respectively.
Revenues  increased  $474,  or 23%, in 1995,  primarily  due to a $353  increase
related to COLI premiums. Total benefits, claims and expenses increased $442, or
22%, in 1995 of which $344 related to COLI.  The  additional  growth in the COLI
and group insurance business, expense reductions associated with the decision to
exit the fully insured medical business,  and factors similar to those discussed
above for 1996 caused core earnings in this division to increase $21, or 47%, to
$66 in 1995 from $45 in 1994.

OUTLOOK

Management believes that it has developed and implemented strategies to maintain
and  enhance its  position  as a market  leader  within the  financial  services
industry,   to  continue  the  Life  segment's  asset  growth  and  to  maximize
shareholder  value.  The Life  segment's  strong market  position in each of its
businesses,  coupled with the growth potential management believes exists in its
markets, provides opportunities to increase sales of the Life segment's products
and services as individuals  increasingly save and plan for retirement,  protect
themselves  and their  families  against  disability  or death and prepare their
estates for an efficient transfer of wealth between generations.

The HIPA Act of 1996 phases out the  deductibility  of interest on policy  loans
under COLI by 1998,  thus  eliminating  all future sales of leveraged  COLI. The
leveraged  COLI product has been an important  contributor to the Life segment's
profitability   in  recent  years  and  will   continue  to  contribute  to  the
profitability  of the Life  segment in the future,  although the level of profit
will decline  after 1998.  However,  the Employee  Benefits  division has growth
opportunities   through   variable   COLI  and  other   non-qualified   deferred
compensation  vehicles,  reinsurance and international  operations.  The Company
expects  continued growth in core earnings for the Life segment in 1997. See the
Capital Resources and Liquidity section under "Subsequent Events".

================================================================================
INTERNATIONAL
================================================================================

The  International  segment includes direct insurance  business written by local
companies in the United Kingdom, namely ITT London & Edinburgh,  the Netherlands
and Belgium, Zwolsche Algemeene, and Spain, ITT Ercos. These companies primarily
offer  property and casualty  products in both  personal and  commercial  lines.
Zwolsche  Algemeene and ITT Ercos also offer life products  designed to meet the
needs of local customers.

Core earnings in the  International  segment of $87 in 1996 decreased $4, or 4%,
from 1995,  following a $29, or 47%, increase in 1995 over 1994. The decrease in
earnings  from  1995 was  primarily  the  result of  deteriorating  underwriting
results due to  heightened  competition  in the United  Kingdom and  unfavorable
foreign exchange impacts,  partially offset by growth in net investment  income.
1996 revenues of $1.6 billion were $86, or 6%, higher than 1995 primarily due to
growth at Zwolsche Algemeene and 1995 results at ITT Ercos only reflecting eight
months of activity  due to its  acquisition  by the Company in May 1995.  Growth
over  1995  was  dampened  by soft  market  conditions  in the  United  Kingdom.
Additionally,  the  U.S.  dollar  strengthened  during  1996  compared  to 1995,
resulting in unfavorable  foreign  exchange  translation  movements  during 1996
resulting  in  approximately  $37 and $3 of the  decrease in  revenues  and core
earnings, respectively.

1995  revenues of $1.5 billion and core  earnings of $91 were $266,  or 21%, and
$29,  or 47%,  respectively,  higher  than  1994,  the  result of  significantly
improved  investment  and  underwriting  performance,  premium  growth,  and the
acquisition  of ITT Ercos.  Favorable  foreign  exchange  translation  movements
during 1995 accounted for  approximately  $89 and $2 of the increase in revenues
and core earnings, respectively.

The International  segment is organized into the following three business units:
ITT London & Edinburgh,  Zwolsche  Algemeene and ITT Ercos.  In addition,  Other
primarily represents home office expenses associated with managing international
operations.



ITT London & Edinburgh
- ----------------------

1996  revenues at ITT London & Edinburgh of $1.1 billion  increased  $17, or 2%,
over 1995.  Core earnings of $56 decreased  $10, or 15%, from 1995 primarily the
result of deteriorating  underwriting  results due to heightened  competition in
the United Kingdom,  partially offset by growth in net investment income.  Also,
strengthening  of the U.S. dollar resulted in negative  foreign exchange impacts
on revenues of $15 and core  earnings of $2. The increase in revenues was due to
improved investment income,  partially offset by a shortfall in written premiums
due to the intense  competitive  climate in the United  Kingdom.  Personal lines
underperformed  the prior year where  shortfalls  in automobile  were  partially
offset by improvements in personal credit insurance,  including life. Commercial
lines sales were also dampened due to the increasingly competitive market.

                                     - 17 -

1995 revenues at ITT London & Edinburgh of $1.1 billion and core earnings of $66
were $126,  or 13%,  and $20,  or 44%,  respectively,  higher  than 1994.  These
increases were due to significant improvement in investment performance, premium
growth  and  foreign   exchange   rates,   offset  somewhat  by  slightly  lower
underwriting results. Commercial lines growth moderated during the year due to a
more  competitive  market.  Personal  lines  growth  was  mixed  with  continued
improvement in automobile and creditor products.

Zwolsche Algemeene
- ------------------

Zwolsche  Algemeene's  1996  revenues of $459 and core  earnings of $32 improved
$43, or 10%, and $7, or 28%,  respectively,  compared with 1995. These increases
were due to improved premium growth and stronger  underwriting  results.  Due to
the strengthening U.S. dollar,  foreign exchange had an adverse effect of $20 on
revenues and a negligible impact on core earnings.  Property and casualty growth
in 1996 was relatively strong in motor as market pricing  improved.  Performance
was also strong in life savings and mortgage products business.

Zwolsche  Algemeene's  1995  revenues of $416 and core  earnings of $25 improved
$88, or 27%, and $8, or 47%,  respectively,  compared with 1994. These increases
were due to improved investment  performance,  moderate premium growth, stronger
underwriting results and foreign exchange impacts.  Property and casualty growth
in 1995 was moderate as market  pricing slowly  improved.  Strong growth in life
savings and pension  products was partially offset by lower than expected growth
in mortgage savings product business.

ITT Ercos
- ---------

The Hartford  acquired ITT Ercos in May 1995.  1996 revenues at ITT Ercos of $78
exceeded the eight months  reported for 1995 by $27. Core earnings of $3 were $1
higher than 1995.  During 1996 the company has  consolidated  its branch offices
into one centralized  location and reorganized its national sales  organization.
These actions were taken to improve  expense  competitiveness  and service which
will position the company for future growth.

OUTLOOK

The outlook for 1997 for commercial and personal lines at ITT London & Edinburgh
is a continuation of heightened  competition.  Personal lines should  experience
strong  growth in  homeowners  business due to an agreement  entered into during
1996 with Nationwide Building Society.  This agreement provides exclusive rights
to ITT London & Edinburgh to sell homeowners products to the retail customers of
Nationwide.  Continuing  competition from direct writing  companies and entry by
non-traditional risk bearers into markets such as homeowners is anticipated.

The outlook at  Zwolsche  Algemeene  for 1997 is for  moderate  written  premium
growth in property  and casualty  due to an increase in  competition.  Continued
growth is also expected for life operations.  Sales expectations of life savings
and  pension  products  in the  Netherlands  continue  to be strong due to their
associated tax advantages and expected  continued low interest rate environment.
The Company continues to explore the viability of opportunities in both life and
property  and casualty  business in the  Netherlands  in 1997 as the  government
continues to review moving  certain  social  security  programs into the private
sector.

Relative to ITT Ercos, the outlook in the Spanish market is for moderate growth.
ITT  Ercos  will  build  on the  improved  expense  and  operational  foundation
established  in 1996 to expand its presence in both life and  non-life  business
during 1997.

The  International  segment  continues to explore  acquisition  opportunities in
Western Europe, Latin America and Asia.

================================================================================
RUNOFF
================================================================================


                                     - 18 -

The  Runoff   segment   consists  of  operations  of  The  Hartford  which  have
discontinued  writing  new and  renewal  business.  The  property  and  casualty
operations of the Runoff segment primarily include First State Insurance Company
and its  subsidiaries  ("First State") and Fencourt  Reinsurance  Company,  Ltd.
("Fencourt"). The primary focus of these operations is the proper disposition of
claims,  resolving disputes and collecting  reinsurance proceeds related largely
to business underwritten and reinsured prior to 1985.

The Runoff  segment also consists of Closed Book GRC which had no new or renewal
business as of the end of 1994.  Substantially  all of the products  included in
Closed Book GRC are guaranteed  investment  contracts with  guaranteed  fixed or
indexed rates for a specific period. Prior to 1996, Closed Book GRC was reported
as a component of the Life segment.

Closed Book GRC results have been negatively  affected by lower investment rates
and  earnings in the  related  investment  portfolio  (primarily  consisting  of
collateralized  mortgage  obligations  and mortgage  backed  securities)  due to
prepayments  experienced  in excess of  assumed  levels in years  prior to 1995.
Closed  Book GRC was also  affected by the  interest  rate rise in 1994 when the
duration of its assets  lengthened  relative to that of the liabilities.  Due to
the reduced  investment  earnings  and  duration  mismatch,  the  portfolio  had
insufficient  assets to fully fund its liability  commitments.  During the third
quarter of 1996,  the Life segment  transferred  assets in the amount of $200 to
the Runoff  segment to  adequately  fund  Closed  Book GRC so that  future  cash
infusions would be minimal.

Although the Closed Book GRC asset portfolio as a whole is duration matched with
its  liabilities,  certain  investments  continue to have a longer maturity than
their corresponding liabilities and will need to be liquidated prior to maturity
in order to meet the  specific  liability  commitments.  To protect the existing
value of these investments,  the Company entered into various hedge transactions
in late September 1996 which  substantially  eliminated  further  fluctuation in
fair value of the investments due to interest rate changes.

The  Hartford's   accounting  policy  for  impairment  of  investments  requires
recognition of an other than temporary  impairment charge on a security if it is
determined  that the  Company is unable to  recover  all  amounts  due under the
contractual   obligations  of  the  security.  In  addition,   the  Company  has
established  specific  criteria to be used in the  impairment  evaluation  of an
individual  portfolio  of  assets.  Specifically,  if  the  asset  portfolio  is
supporting a runoff  operation,  is forced to be liquidated prior to maturity to
meet liability  commitments,  and has a fair value below amortized  cost,  which
will not materially fluctuate as a result of future interest rate changes,  then
an other than temporary  impairment has been  determined to have occurred and is
recognized.  The Company then  continues to review the impaired  securities  for
appropriate valuation.

With the initiation of the hedge transactions,  which eliminated the possibility
that the fair value of the Closed Book GRC  investments  would  recover to their
current  amortized  cost,  an  other  than  temporary  impairment  loss of $(82)
after-tax was  determined  to have occurred and was recorded in September  1996.
Also,  during the third  quarter,  Closed Book GRC had asset sales  resulting in
proceeds of approximately $500 and a realized loss of $(55) after-tax. The asset
sales  were  undertaken  as a result of  liquidity  needs and  favorable  market
conditions for certain  securities.  Other charges of $(32)  after-tax were also
incurred in the third quarter.

During the fourth quarter of 1996, an additional other than temporary impairment
loss of $(6) after-tax was determined to have occurred, and has been included in
realized losses.

Other  charges  primarily  consist of a $169 third  quarter  1996  charge in the
Closed Book GRC (as discussed  previously) and an increase in environmental  and
asbestos  reserves at First State of $81 as discussed in the  Environmental  and
Asbestos Claims section.

Revenues  decreased  76% in 1996 and 15% in 1995 as a result of a decline in net
investment  income for both periods and net realized  capital losses for 1996 in
Closed Book GRC.  Runoff  segment core earnings  increased $14 in 1996 over 1995
and  decreased $88 in 1995 from the prior year.  These results  reflect the core
earnings  of  Closed  Book GRC of $(51),  $(68) and $1 for 1996,  1995 and 1994,
respectively.

OUTLOOK

Management  expects that the net income (loss) from Closed Book GRC in the years
subsequent  to 1996 will be  immaterial  based on  current  projections  for the
performance of the assets and  liabilities  associated  with Closed Book GRC and
expectations  regarding  future  asset sales and the  stabilizing  effect of the
hedge  transactions.  However,  no assurance  can be given that,  under  certain
unanticipated economic  circumstances,  further losses in respect of Closed Book
GRC will not occur in the  future.  Additionally,  except for the  uncertainties
related to dispute resolution,  reinsurance  collection,  and those discussed in
the  Environmental  and Asbestos Claims section,  management does not anticipate
the future financial  performance of the property and casualty operations of the
Runoff  segment  to have a  material  effect  on the  operating  results  of the
Company.

================================================================================
RESERVES
================================================================================
The  Hartford  establishes  property  and  casualty  reserves to provide for the
estimated costs of paying claims made by policyholders or against policyholders.
These reserves  include  estimates for both claims that have been reported,  and
those that have been incurred,  but not yet reported,  and include  estimates of
all expenses  associated with  processing and settling these claims.  Estimating
the ultimate cost of future claims and claim adjustment expenses is an uncertain
and complex process.  This estimation process is based largely on the assumption
that past  developments  are an  appropriate  predictor  of future  events,  and
involves a variety of actuarial  techniques that analyze experience,  trends and
other relevant factors.  The  uncertainties  involved with the reserving process
have  become  increasingly  unpredictable  due to a number  of  complex  factors
including  social and  economic  trends and  changes  in the  concepts  of legal
liability and damage awards. Accordingly,  final claim settlements may vary from
the present estimates, particularly when those payments may not occur until well
into the future.

The  Hartford  continually  reviews its  estimated  claims and claim  adjustment
expense  reserves  as  additional  experience  and other  relevant  data  become
available and reserve levels are adjusted accordingly. Adjustments to previously
established  reserves, if any, will be reflected in the operating results of the
period in which the  adjustment  is made.  In the  judgment of  management,  all
information  currently  available has been  properly  considered in the reserves
established  for claims  and claim  adjustment  expenses.  For a  discussion  of
environmental  and  asbestos  claims  and the  uncertainties  related  to  these
reserves, refer to the next section.

In accordance with the insurance laws and regulations under which Life operates,
life insurance  subsidiaries of The Hartford  establish  actuarially  determined
reserves to meet their  obligations  on their  outstanding  life and  disability
insurance contracts, as well as reserves for their universal life and investment
contracts.  Reserves for life  insurance and  disability  contracts are based on
mortality and morbidity tables in general use in the United States,  modified to
reflect The Hartford's experience. Management believes that these reserves, with
additions  from  premiums to be  received,  and with  interest on such  reserves
compounded  annually at certain  assumed  rates,  will be sufficient to meet The
Hartford's  policy  obligations  at  their  maturities  or in  the  event  of an
insured's death.  Reserves for universal life insurance and investment  products
represent policy account balances before applicable surrender charges.

================================================================================
ENVIRONMENTAL AND ASBESTOS CLAIMS
================================================================================
The Hartford  continues to receive claims asserting  damages from  environmental
exposures and for injuries from asbestos and asbestos-related  products, both of
which affect the North American  Property & Casualty,  International  and Runoff
segments.  Environmental  claims  relate  primarily  to  pollution  and  related
clean-up costs.  With regard to these claims,  uncertainty  exists which impacts
the ability of insurers and  reinsurers  to estimate  the ultimate  reserves for
unpaid  losses  and  related  settlement  expenses.   The  Hartford  finds  that
conventional  reserving  techniques  cannot  estimate the ultimate cost of these
claims  because of inadequate  development  patterns and  inconsistent  emerging
legal  doctrine.  For the  majority  of  environmental  claims and many types of
asbestos claims,  unlike any other type of contractual claim, there is almost no
agreement or consistent  precedent to determine what, if any, coverage exists or
which,  if any,  policy years and insurers or reinsurers may be liable.  Further
uncertainty arises with  environmental  claims since claims are often made under
policies,  the existence of which may be in dispute, the terms of which may have
changed over many years,  which may or may not provide for legal defense  costs,
and which may or may not contain  environmental  exclusion  clauses  that may be
absolute or allow for fortuitous events. Courts in different  jurisdictions have
reached disparate  conclusions on similar issues and in certain  situations have
broadened the  interpretation  of policy coverage and liability issues. In light
of the extensive claim settlement process for environmental and asbestos claims,
involving  comprehensive fact gathering,  subject matter expertise and intensive
litigation, The Hartford established an environmental claims facility in 1992 to
defend itself  aggressively  against  unwarranted  claims and to minimize costs.

Within the property and casualty insurance  industry,  progress has been made in
developing sophisticated, alternative methodologies utilizing company experience
and supplemental  databases to assess  environmental  and asbestos  liabilities.
Consistent with The Hartford's practice of using the best techniques to estimate
the Company's  environmental  and asbestos  exposures,  a study was initiated in
April 1996. The Hartford, utilizing internal staff supplemented by outside legal
and actuarial consultants, completed the study in October 1996.

The study included a review of identified  environmental and asbestos  exposures
of  North  American  Property  &  Casualty,  U.S.  exposures  of The  Hartford's
International  segment  and  exposures  of the Runoff  segment,  and covered the
Company's  Commercial,  Personal,  and Reinsurance  operations.  The methodology
utilized a ground up  analysis  of policy,  site and  exposure  level data for a
representative  sample of The Hartford's  claims.  The results of the evaluation
were  extrapolated  against the balance of the claim  population to estimate the
Company's overall exposure for reported claims.

In addition to estimating  liabilities  on reported  environmental  and asbestos
claims,  The Hartford  estimated  reserves for claims  incurred but not reported
("IBNR"). The IBNR reserve was estimated using information on reporting patterns
of  known  insureds,   characteristics  of  insureds  such  as  limits  exposed,
attachment points and number of coverage years involved,  third party costs, and
closed claims.

Included in The Hartford's  analysis of environmental and asbestos exposures was
a review of applicable reinsurance

                                     - 20 -

coverage. Reinsurance coverage applicable to the sample was used to estimate the
reinsurance  coverage that applied to the balance of the reported  environmental
and asbestos claims and to the IBNR estimates.

An international  actuarial firm reviewed The Hartford's  approach and concluded
that the way the Company studied its exposures, the thoroughness of its analysis
and the way The Hartford came to its estimates was reasonable and comprehensive.

Upon  completion of the study and assessment of the results in October 1996, The
Hartford  determined  that its  environmental  and asbestos  reserves  should be
increased,  on an undiscounted basis, by $493 (net of reinsurance) and $292 (net
of reinsurance), respectively.

Reserve  activity for both reported and  unreported  environmental  and asbestos
claims, including reserves for legal defense costs, for the years ended December
31, 1996 and 1995, was as follows (net of reinsurance):


The Hartford's pretax operating  earnings have been impacted over the last three
years by  incurred  environmental  and  asbestos  claims  and  claim  adjustment
expenses as follows:  $925 in 1996, $163 in 1995 and $145 in 1994 with all years
reported net of reinsurance.

The Hartford  believes that the  environmental and asbestos reserves reported at
December 31, 1996 are a reasonable  estimate of the ultimate remaining liability
for these claims based upon known facts,  current assumptions and The Hartford's
methodologies.  Future social,  economic,  legal or legislative developments may
alter the original  intent of policies  and the scope of coverage.  The Hartford
will  continue to evaluate new  developments  and  methodologies  as they become
available for use in supplementing  the Company's ongoing analysis and review of
its environmental and asbestos  exposures.  These future reviews may result in a
change in reserves, impacting The Hartford's results of operations in the period
in which the reserve estimates are changed.  While the effects of future changes
in facts,  legal and other issues could have a material effect on future results
of  operations,  The Hartford does not expect such changes would have a material
effect on its liquidity or financial condition.

================================================================================
INVESTMENTS
================================================================================
An  important  element of the  financial  results of The  Hartford  is return on
invested assets.  The Hartford's  investment  activities are divided between the
reportable segments of North American Property & Casualty, Life,  International,
and Runoff. The investment  portfolios for these operations are managed based on
the underlying characteristics and nature of their respective liabilities.

NORTH AMERICAN PROPERTY & CASUALTY

The investment  objective of the North American  Property & Casualty  segment is
the  maximization of after-tax income  consistent with long-term  capital growth
and  maintenance  of appropriate  liquidity to meet  corporate and  policyholder
obligations.  Investment  strategies are developed based on a variety of factors
including business needs, regulatory requirements and tax considerations.

During  1996,  the North  American  Property & Casualty  segment  continued  its
strategy  of  maximizing   after-tax  income  through  increased   ownership  of
tax-exempt  municipal  bonds. On an after-tax  basis,  municipal bonds generally
continued to provide significant incremental income over taxable securities.  In
1996,  net purchases of  tax-exempt  municipal  bonds of $2.0 billion  increased
holdings to 55% of total invested  assets compared to 44% and 26% as of December
31,  1995 and 1994,  respectively.  In addition  to  employing  new cash flow to
purchase  municipal bonds,  lower yielding taxable bonds were sold with proceeds
reallocated to the higher after-tax yielding municipal market.

A supplemental  benefit resulting from the purchase of municipal bonds continued
to  be  the  improvement  in  credit  quality.  While  the  bond  portfolio  has
consistently  remained  "AA" average  quality over many years,  municipal  bonds
purchased in 1996 had an average  rating of "AA+",  an  improvement on the "AA-"
rating on the taxable bonds sold.

Another  strategy   employed  in  1996,  which  increased  income  and  provided
diversification,  was the purchase of additional high yield securities. The high
yield sector also achieved excellent total return performance in 1996.  Holdings
of high yield  investments  increased to $708, or 6%, of total  invested  assets
compared to $505,  or 4%, at December  31,  1995.  Included in December 31, 1996
high yield  holdings  were $135 in  emerging  market  bonds  compared  to $60 at
December 31, 1995.

The North  American  Property & Casualty  segment also continued its strategy of
increasing  equity  exposure.  In 1996,  $275 of net  purchases  of common stock
increased holdings to $1.3 billion, or 10%, of total invested assets at year end
compared to $922, or 8%, of total invested assets at year end 1995.

Increased  holdings of municipal  bonds,  high yield securities and common stock
were  partially  accomplished  through the sale of more interest rate  sensitive
collateralized  mortgage  obligations  (CMO)  and  residential  mortgage  backed
securities  (MBS).  At December 31, 1996,  holdings in CMO and MBS were $868, or
7%, of total invested assets  compared to $1.7 billion,  or 14%, at December 31,
1995.

Total invested assets were $12.8 billion at December 31, 1996 and were comprised
primarily of fixed  maturities  of $11.3 billion and other  investments  of $1.5
billion,  primarily equity securities.  Real estate investments consisted of $29
of land after the sale of substantially all real estate in 1995. The table below
summarizes fixed maturity holdings by type.

 [2]  Represents net investment  income  (excluding net realized  capital gains)
      divided by average invested assets at cost (fixed  maturities at amortized
      cost).

For the year ended December 31, 1996,  before-tax net investment income was $661
compared to $646 in 1995,  an increase of 2%,  while  after-tax  net  investment
income  increased 11%.  Although  before-tax  yields on average  invested assets
decreased to 5.52% in 1996 from 5.77% in 1995, the after-tax  yield increased to
4.44% in 1996 from 4.28% in 1995.  The  increase in  before-tax  net  investment
income was  primarily  due to  increased  ownership  of high  yield  securities,
duration  extension  of 0.6 years and an  increase  in  invested  assets.  While
before-tax  yield decreased due to an increased  allocation to common stocks and
municipal bonds and the sale of taxable bonds,  increases in after-tax yield and
income were primarily due to the strategic  increase in allocation to tax-exempt
municipal bonds.

For the year ended December 31, 1995,  before-tax net investment income was $646
compared to $606 in 1994, an increase of 7%, while  after-tax  income  increased
9%. Before-tax yields on average invested assets increased to 5.77% in 1995 from
5.65% in 1994.  The  after-tax  yield  increased  to 4.28% in 1995 from 4.09% in
1994.  The increases in net  investment  income and yields were primarily due to
the  transition  from lower  yielding  taxable  bonds and real estate along with
increased ownership of tax-exempt municipal bonds.

Net realized capital gains declined to $15 in 1996 from $29 in 1995. Included in
1996 activity was the  generation  of $77 of realized  gains in the common stock
portfolios  which were partially  offset by losses incurred in the sale of lower
yielding taxable bonds and certain real estate writedowns.

Net  realized  capital  gains  decreased  to $29 in 1995  from $69 in 1994.  The
reduction was primarily  from the impact of the sale of the majority of the real
estate portfolio along with the sale of the lower yielding  taxable bonds,  both
at realized losses.

LIFE

The Life segment's investment  operations are managed by its investment strategy
group which reports directly to senior management of the Company and consists of
a risk management unit and portfolio  management  unit. The risk management unit
is responsible for monitoring and managing the segment's asset/liability profile
and  establishing  investment  objectives  and  guidelines;  and, the  portfolio
management unit is responsible for determining, within specified risk tolerances
and investment guidelines, the general asset allocation,  duration and convexity
and other  characteristics  of the  segment's  general  account  and  guaranteed
separate  account  investment  portfolios.  The investment staff of The Hartford
executes the strategic  investment  decisions of the portfolio  management unit,
including  the  identification  and  purchase  of  securities  that  fulfill the
objectives of the investment strategy group.

The  primary  investment  objective  of the Life  segment  general  account  and
guaranteed  separate accounts is to maximize  after-tax returns  consistent with
acceptable  risk  parameters  (including  the  management  of the interest  rate
sensitivity of invested assets to that of policyholder obligations). The segment
is exposed to two primary sources of investment risk:  credit risk,  relating to
the uncertainty associated with the continued ability of a given obligor to make
timely payments of principal and interest,  and interest rate risk,  relating to
the market price and/or cash flow variability  associated with changes in market
yield curves. Credit risk is managed through industry and issuer diversification
and asset  allocation.  Interest  rate risk is managed as part of the  segment's
asset/liability  management  strategies,  including  the use of certain  hedging
techniques (which may include the use of certain financial derivatives), product
design,  such as the use of the market value  adjustment  feature and  surrender
charges,  and proactive  monitoring  and  management  of certain  non-guaranteed
elements of the segment's  products (such as the resetting of credited  interest
rates for policies that permit such  adjustments).  For a further  discussion of
hedging strategies,  including  derivatives  utilization,  see the discussion on
Asset  and  Liability  Management  Strategies  below,  as well as the  Notes  to
Consolidated Financial Statements.

During 1996,  the Life segment  continued its objective of managing  exposure to
securities  that  "underperform"  in a falling  interest rate  environment.  The
segment  concentrated  on reducing  exposure to CMO and MBS asset  sectors,  and
re-deployed  the funds  into  public  and  private  corporate  bonds,  and other
nonresidential  asset-backed  securities.  At December 31, 1996, holdings in CMO
and  residential  MBS  were  $1.5  billion,  or 12%,  of total  invested  assets
excluding policy loans compared to $2.7 billion, or 23%, at December 31, 1995.

At December  31,  1996,  approximately  10.3% of the  segment's  fixed  maturity
portfolio  was invested in private  placement  securities  (including  Rule 144A
offerings).  Private placement  securities are generally less liquid than public
securities.  However, covenants for private placements are generally designed to
mitigate  the  impact of such  increased  liquidity  risk.  Most of the  private
placement securities in the segment's portfolio are rated by rating agencies.

Invested assets, excluding separate accounts,  totaled $16.3 billion at December
31, 1996 and were comprised of $12.2 billion of fixed  maturities,  $3.8 billion
of policy loans,  and other  investments  of $276.  Policy loans,  which carry a
weighted-average interest rate of 11.9%, as of December 31, 1996, are secured by
the cash value of the life policy.  These loans do not mature in a  conventional
sense, but expire in conjunction with the related policy liabilities.  The table
below summarizes fixed maturity holdings by type.

The  estimated  maturities  of the fixed and variable  rate  investments  in the
general  account,  along with the  respective  yields at December 31, 1996,  are
reflected below.  Asset-backed  securities including CMO and MBS are distributed
to  maturity  year  based  on the  Company's  estimate  of the  rate  of  future
prepayments  of principal  over the  remaining  lives of the  securities.  These
estimates are developed using  prepayment  speeds  reported in broker  consensus
data and can be  expected to vary from actual  experience.  Expected  maturities
differ from contractual maturities due to call or prepayment provisions.

Investment Results
- ------------------

The table below summarizes the Life segment's results for the past three years.

                                      1996      1995     1994
 ---------------------------------------------------------------

 Net investment income, before-tax   $1,323   $1,114     $922
 Yield on average invested assets,
    before-tax [1]                     8.51%    8.30%    8.56%
 Net realized capital gains
    (losses), before-tax                 --      $(4)      $1
 ---------------------------------------------------------------
 [1]  Represents net  investment  income  (excluding net realized  capital gains
      (losses))  divided by average invested assets at cost (fixed maturities at
      amortized cost).

For the year ended December 31, 1996,  before-tax net investment  income totaled
$1.3  billion  compared to $1.1 billion in 1995,  an increase of 19%.  Yields on
average  invested  assets  increased  to 8.51% in 1996 from  8.30% in 1995.  The
increase in net  investment  income was  primarily  due to an increase in policy
loans,  new  business  cash  flow  invested  in fixed  maturities  and asset mix
changes.  The increase in before-tax  yield was primarily due to the increase in
policy loan yields;  excluding  policy loans,  the before-tax yield decreased to
7.09% from 7.37% in 1995.  The decrease in  before-tax  yield  excluding  policy
loans  was the  result  of  sales  and  maturities  of  higher  yielding  assets
reinvested at lower average yields.

For the year ended December 31, 1995,  before-tax net investment  income totaled
$1.1 billion compared to $922 in 1994, an increase of 21%.  Before-tax yields on
average  invested  assets  decreased  to 8.30% in 1995 from  8.56% in 1994.  The
increase in before-tax net investment income was primarily due to an increase in
policy loans and additional new business cash flow invested in fixed maturities.

There were no net realized  capital gains (losses) in 1996. Net realized capital
losses  decreased  to a $(4) loss in 1995 from a $1 gain in 1994.  During  1995,
certain mortgage-backed securities were written down to fair value in accordance
with generally  accepted  accounting  principles.  These writedowns  amounted to
$(45)  and were  substantially  offset by gains  generated  on the sale of other
fixed maturity investments.

Asset And Liability Management Strategies
- -----------------------------------------

The Life segment employs  several risk  management  tools to quantify and manage
interest  rate  risk  arising  from  its  investments  and  interest   sensitive
liabilities. Management monitors the changes in present value between assets and
liabilities  resulting  from various  interest rate scenarios  using  integrated
asset/liability  measurement systems and a proprietary system that simulates the
impacts of parallel and non-parallel  yield curve shifts.  Based on this current
and prospective  information,  management implements risk reducing techniques to
improve the match between assets and liabilities.

Derivatives  play an important role in  facilitating  the management of interest
rate risk,  creating  opportunities  to fund  product  obligations  efficiently,
hedging against risks that affect the value of certain liabilities and adjusting
broad investment risk  characteristics  when dictated by significant  changes in
market  risks.  As an end user of  derivatives,  the  segment  uses a variety of
derivatives,   including  swaps,  caps,  floors,  forwards  and  exchange-traded
financial  futures  and  options in order to hedge  exposure  to price,  foreign
currency  and/or  interest  rate risk on  anticipated  investment  purchases  or
existing assets and liabilities.  The notional  amounts of derivative  contracts
represent the basis upon which pay and receive  amounts are  calculated  and are
not  reflective  of  credit  risk  for  derivative  contracts.  Credit  risk for
derivative  contracts  is limited  to the  amounts  calculated  to be due to the
Company on such contracts.  The Company maintains prudent policies regarding the
financial  stability  and  credit  standing  of  its  major  counterparties  and
typically  requires  credit  enhancement  provisions to further limit its credit
risk. Many of these derivative  contracts are bilateral  agreements that are not
assignable  without the consent of the relevant  counterparty.  Notional amounts
pertaining  to  derivatives  totaled  $3.4  billion at  December  31, 1996 ($2.7
billion related to life insurance investments and $749 related to life insurance
liabilities) and $4.0 billion at December 31, 1995 ($3.4 billion related to life
insurance   investments  and  $565  related  to  life  insurance   liabilities).
Management  believes that the use of derivatives allows the Company to sell more
innovative  products,  capitalize  on market  opportunities  and  execute a more
flexible investment  strategy for its general account portfolio.  The strategies
described  below are used by the  segment  to manage  the  aforementioned  risks
associated with its obligations.

Anticipatory Hedging -- For certain liabilities, the Life segment commits to the
- --------------------
price of the product prior to receipt of the associated premium or deposit.  The
segment routinely executes  anticipatory  hedges to offset the impact of changes
in asset  prices  arising from  interest  rate  changes,  pending the premium or
deposit  payment and the resulting  purchase of an asset.  These hedges  involve
taking a long  position in interest  rate  futures or entering  into an interest
rate swap with duration characteristics equivalent to the associated liabilities
or anticipated  investments.  The notional amount of  anticipatory  hedges as of
December 31, 1996 and 1995 was $392 and $718, respectively.

Liability  Hedging -- Several  products  obligate  the Life  segment to credit a
- ------------------
return to the contract  holder  which is indexed to a market  rate.  In order to
hedge risks  associated with these products,  the Life segment  typically enters
into interest rate swaps to convert the contract rate into a rate that trades in
a more liquid and  efficient  market.  This  hedging  strategy  enables the Life
segment to customize  contract terms and  conditions to customer  objectives and
satisfies the segment's asset/liability matching policy. Additionally,  interest
rate swaps are used to convert certain fixed contract rates into floating rates,
thereby allowing them to be appropriately  matched against floating rate assets.
The notional amount of derivatives used for liability hedging as of December 31,
1996 and 1995 was $749 and $565, respectively.

Asset  Hedging  -- To meet the  various  life  policyholder  obligations  and to
- --------------
provide prudent  investment risk  diversification,  the Life segment may combine
two or more financial instruments to achieve the investment characteristics that
match  the  associated  liability.   The  use  of  derivatives  in  this  regard
effectively  transfers  unwanted  investment risks or attributes to others.  The
selection of the  appropriate  derivatives

                                     - 25 -

depends on the investment risk, the liquidity and efficiency of the market,  and
the asset and liability characteristics.  The notional amount of asset hedges as
of December 31, 1996 and 1995 was $1.5 billion and $1.7 billion, respectively.

Portfolio  Hedging -- The Life  segment  periodically  compares the duration and
- ------------------
convexity of its portfolios of assets to their  corresponding  liabilities,  and
enters into  portfolio  hedges to reduce any  difference to  acceptable  levels.
Portfolio  hedges reduce the mismatch  between assets and liabilities and offset
the potential  cash flow impact  caused by interest  rate changes.  The notional
amount of  portfolio  hedges as of December  31, 1996 and 1995 was $755 and $1.0
billion, respectively.

Life Insurance Liability Characteristics
- ----------------------------------------

Insurance  liabilities,  other than  non-guaranteed  separate accounts,  totaled
$27.3 billion, net of ceded reinsurance, at December 31, 1996 and were backed by
$37.0 billion in total assets including  investments of $26.7 billion.  Matching
of the duration of the investments with respective  policyholder  obligations is
an explicit objective of the Life segment's management  strategy.  The segment's
insurance policy  liabilities,  along with estimated duration periods based upon
internal actuarial  assumptions,  can be summarized based on investment needs in
the following five categories at December 31, 1996:

- --------------------------------------------------------------------
[1]  The duration of liabilities reflects management's  assessment of the market
     price  sensitivity of the  liabilities to changes in market interest rates,
     and is not necessarily  reflective of the projected liabilities' cash flows
     under any specific scenario.

Fixed Rate Asset Accumulation  Vehicles -- Products in this category require the
- ---------------------------------------
Life  segment to pay a fixed rate for a certain  period of time.  The cash flows
are not interest  sensitive because the products are written with a market value
adjustment  feature  and the  liabilities  have  protection  against  the  early
withdrawal of funds through surrender charges.  The primary risk associated with
these  products is that the spread between  investment  return and credited rate
may not be sufficient to earn the segment's  targeted  return.  Product examples
include  fixed rate  annuities  with a market  value  adjustment  and fixed rate
guaranteed  investment  contracts.  Contract  duration is reflected above and is
dependent on the policyholder's choice of guarantee period. The weighted average
credited  policyholder rate for these  policyholder  liabilities was 6.60% as of
December 31, 1996.

Indexed Asset Accumulation  Vehicles -- Products in this category are similar to
- ------------------------------------
the fixed rate asset accumulation  vehicles, but require the Life segment to pay
a rate that is determined by an external index. The amount and/or timing of cash
flows  will  therefore  vary  based on the level of the  particular  index.  The
primary  risks  inherent in these  products  are similar to the fixed rate asset
accumulation  vehicles,  with an  additional  risk that changes in the index may
adversely affect  profitability.  Product  examples  include  indexed-guaranteed
investment contracts with an estimated duration of up to two years. The weighted
average  credited  rate for these  contracts  was 5.78% as of December 31, 1996,
excluding policy loans.

Interest  Credited  Asset  Accumulation  Vehicles --  Products in this  category
- -------------------------------------------------
credit  interest  to  policyholders,  subject to market  conditions  and minimum
guarantees.  Policyholders  may  surrender  at book  value  but are  subject  to
surrender charges for an initial period. The primary risks vary depending on the
degree of insurance element  contained in the product.  Product examples include
universal  life  contracts  and the  general  account  portion of the  segment's
variable annuity products.  Liability duration is short to intermediate-term and
is reflected in the table above. The average credited rate for these liabilities
was 5.52% as of December 31, 1996, excluding policy loans.

Long-term  Pay Out  Liabilities  -- Products in this  category are  long-term in
- -------------------------------
nature and may contain significant actuarial (including mortality and morbidity)
pricing risks. The cash flows are not interest  sensitive,  but do vary based on
the timing and amount of benefit  payments.  The primary risks  associated  with
these  products are that the benefits  will exceed  expected  actuarial  pricing
and/or the  investment  return will be lower than  assumed in  pricing.  Product
examples include structured  settlement  contracts,  on-benefit annuities (i.e.,
the annuitant is currently receiving benefits thereon) and long-term  disability
contracts.  Contract duration is generally 6 to 10 years but, at times,  exceeds
30 years.  Policy  liabilities  under  these  contracts  are not  interest  rate
sensitive.

Short-term  Pay Out  Liabilities -- These  liabilities  are short-term in nature
- --------------------------------
with a duration of less than one year. The primary risks  associated  with these
products are determined by the non-investment contingencies such as mortality or
morbidity.  Liquidity  is of  greater  concern  than for the  long-term  pay out
liabilities. Products include individual and group term life insurance contracts
and short-term disability contracts.

INTERNATIONAL

Consistent  with the  investment  objectives  of the North  American  Property &
Casualty segment, the investment  objectives of the International segment are to
optimize  after-tax  returns on  invested  assets and  preserve  capital,  while
meeting  obligations  to  policyholders.  The  International  segment  primarily
comprises  the  investment  activities  of  ITT  London  &  Edinburgh,  Zwolsche
Algemeene and ITT Ercos,  which are  primarily  engaged in property and casualty
insurance.

                                     - 26 -

Investments  are made in maturities and  currencies  which reflect the nature of
the liabilities.

Invested assets,  excluding separate accounts, were $3.0 billion at December 31,
1996  and  were  comprised  of  fixed  maturities  of  $2.5  billion  and  other
investments of $521,  primarily  equity  securities.  The table below summarizes

invested  assets  decreased  to 7.05% in 1996 from 7.10% in 1995.  The change in
income reflected the full year of investment results from ITT Ercos (acquired in
May,  1995), a change in asset  composition  favoring longer  maturities,  and a
modest increase in cash flow.

For the year ended December 31, 1995,  before-tax net investment  income totaled
$183 compared to $135 in 1994, an increase of 36%.  Before-tax yields on average
invested  assets  increased to 7.10% in 1995 from 6.10% in 1994. The increase in
before-tax net investment  income was primarily due to increased  operating cash
flow and the  acquisition of ITT Ercos in May 1995,  while the increase in yield
was the result of higher yields in the international bond and equity market.

Net  realized  capital  gains  increased  to $79 in 1996 from $48 in 1995 due to
increased  sales in 1996 of both  fixed  maturity  and  equity  securities.  Net
realized  capital gains  increased to $48 in 1995 from $23 in 1994,  again,  the
result of greater sales of fixed maturity and equity securities.

RUNOFF

The  primary  objective  of the Runoff  segment is to ensure the full and timely
payment of all runoff  liabilities.  The ongoing  strategy of this segment is to
match  closely the interest rate  sensitivities  of the assets with those of the
liabilities.

Invested assets were $5.5 billion at December 31, 1996 and were mostly comprised
of fixed maturities.  The Runoff segment uses derivatives  related to the Closed
Book GRC. As of December 31, 1996 and 1995, the Runoff  segment had  derivatives
with  an  aggregate   notional   amount  of  $7.5  billion  and  $5.6   billion,
respectively,  for asset/liability management purposes. The Company entered into
various hedge transactions  related to Closed Book GRC with a notional amount of
$4.0  billion in  September  and  October  1996 which  substantially  eliminated
further  fluctuation  in fair value of the Closed  Book GRC  investments  due to
interest rate changes.  (For additional  information on Closed Book GRC, see the
Runoff section.) The table below summarizes fixed maturity holdings by type.

 [1]  Represents net  investment  income  (excluding net realized  capital gains
      (losses))  divided by average invested assets at cost (fixed maturities at
      amortized cost).

For the year ended December 31, 1996,  before-tax net investment  income totaled
$334 compared to $477 in 1995, a decrease of 30%.  Before-tax  yields on average
invested  assets  decreased to 5.27% in 1996 from 5.85% in 1995.  Before-tax net
investment  income decreased  primarily due to asset sales and maturities in the
Closed Book GRC.  The  decrease in yield was  primarily  the result of sales and
maturities of higher yielding securities in the Closed Book GRC.

For the year ended December 31, 1995,  before-tax net investment  income totaled
$477 compared to $596 in 1994, a decrease of 20%.  Before-tax  yields on average
invested  assets  decreased to 5.85% in 1995 from 7.13% in 1994. The decrease in
before-tax  net  investment  income  was  primarily  the  result  of  sales  and
maturities of higher yielding securities and hedge costs in the Closed Book GRC.
The decrease in yield resulted  primarily from impact related to prepayments and
hedge costs associated with the Closed Book GRC.

Net realized  capital  losses were $220 in 1996  compared to a $29 gain in 1995,
primarily due to Closed Book GRC. (For additional  information  regarding Closed
Book GRC see the Runoff section.) Net realized capital gains increased to $29 in
1995 from a $3 loss in 1994 primarily due to gains taken in Fencourt.

RISK MANAGEMENT

The Hartford has a  disciplined  approach to managing the risks arising from its
assets and  liabilities.  Portfolio  management  is organized to bring  together
portfolios with similar investment criteria and objectives,  group common styles
and provide more  consistent  investment  management.  All investment  activity,
including  setting policy and defining  acceptable risk levels and  counterparty
qualifications,  is subject to the regular review and approval by The Hartford's
Finance  Committee.  The Hartford has a stringent  investment credit policy that
focuses   on  credit   quality,   limits   credit   concentrations,   encourages
diversification and requires frequent  creditworthiness reviews. The Company has
established exposure limits, diversification standards and review procedures for
all credit risk whether borrower, issuer or counterparty.  The Hartford analyzes
interest rate risk using various models including a proprietary,  multi-scenario
cash flow  projection  model that  forecasts  liabilities  and their  supporting
investments, including derivatives.

The  Investment  division has a compliance  function to affirm that  derivatives
transactions meet Company policy, are effectively  hedging identified risks, and
remain appropriately correlated. All derivatives strategies satisfy at least one
of the following objectives:  to hedge risk arising from interest rate, price or
foreign exchange rate volatility; to manage liquidity; or to control transaction
costs.  The  Company's  derivatives  counterparty  exposure  policy  establishes
market-based   credit  limits,   favors   long-term   financial   stability  and
creditworthiness, and typically requires credit enhancement/credit risk reducing
agreements. To initiate contracts,  counterparties must generally be rated A-/A3
or better by rating agencies.  Credit risk is measured as the amount owed to The
Hartford based on current market  conditions.  Payment  obligations  between The
Hartford and its counterparties are netted and quantified monthly. Collateral is
pledged/held  to the extent the current  value of  derivatives  exceed  exposure
thresholds. As of December 31, 1996, the Company's counterparty exposure, net of
$17 collateral held, was $27.

SEPARATE ACCOUNT PRODUCTS

Separate  account  products  are  those  for  which a  separate  investment  and
liability account is maintained on behalf of the policyholder. Separate accounts
reflect two  categories of risk  assumption:  non-guaranteed  separate  accounts
totaling $39.9 billion,  wherein the policyholder assumes  substantially all the
risk and reward,  and  guaranteed  separate  accounts  totaling  $10.6  billion,
wherein The Hartford contractually guarantees either a minimum return or account
value  to the  policyholder.  Investment  strategy  varies  by fund  choice,  as
outlined  in the  fund  prospectus  or  separate  account  plan  of  operations.
Non-guaranteed  products include variable annuities and variable life contracts.
Guaranteed  separate account products  primarily consist of modified  guaranteed
individual annuity and modified guaranteed life insurance, and generally include
market value adjustment provisions to mitigate the  disintermediation  risk upon
surrenders.

Additional  investment  risk is hedged  using a  variety  of  derivatives  which
totaled $86 and $133 in  carrying  value and $2.4  billion  and $2.7  billion in
notional  amounts at  December  31, 1996 and 1995,  respectively.  For a further
discussion of strategies,  including  derivative  utilization,  see the previous
discussion on Asset and Liability Management  Strategies as well as the Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements.

================================================================================
CAPITAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY
================================================================================
Capital resources and liquidity  represent the overall financial strength of The
Hartford and its ability to generate strong cash flows from each of the business
segments  and borrow funds at  competitive  rates to meet  operating  and growth
needs.  The  capital  structure  of The  Hartford  consists  of debt and equity,
summarized as follows:



CAPITALIZATION

The Hartford's total  capitalization  excluding  unrealized gain (loss),  net of
tax,  increased  by $335 in 1996.  This  change was a result of  additional  net
borrowings  totaling $624,  partially  offset by a net loss of $99 and dividends
declared of $188 on The Hartford common stock.

In 1995,  total  capitalization  excluding  unrealized gain (loss),  net of tax,
increased  by $378 from 1994 as a result of  earnings  of $559,  additional  net
borrowings  of $410 and  capital  contributions  of $250,  partially  offset  by
dividends  declared of $779 on The  Hartford  common  stock held by ITT prior to
December 20, 1995 and redemption of subsidiary preferred stock totaling $86.

DEBT

Total debt in 1996 increased $624 compared to a $410 increase in the prior year.
The  Hartford  used the  proceeds  of these  additional  borrowings  to fund the
insurance  operations  of its  subsidiaries,  and in 1995,  to  partially  repay
outstanding  commercial  paper  and other  short-term  debt,  redeem  subsidiary
preferred stock and pay dividends.

As of December 31, 1996,  The Hartford had an unsecured  aggregate  $2.0 billion
credit  facility with  twenty-nine  participating  banks which is comprised of a
$1.5 billion five year revolving  credit facility and a $500  short-term  credit
facility.  This  facility is  available  for general  corporate  purposes and to
provide additional  support to the Company's existing  commercial paper program.
At December 31, 1996,  there were no outstanding  borrowings under the facility.
On February 10, 1997, Hartford Life, Inc. ("HLI"), a wholly-owned  subsidiary of
The Hartford,  entered into a $1.3 billion unsecured  short-term credit facility
with four banks.

During 1996, The Hartford  expanded its  commercial  paper program by increasing
the maximum  allowable  outstanding  amount of unsecured  short-term  commercial
paper notes from $1.0 billion to $2.0 billion.

In  connection  with a shelf  registration  statement  filed  with and  declared
effective  by the  Securities  and  Exchange  Commission  ("SEC")  in 1995,  The
Hartford  registered for sale up to an aggregate $1.0 billion of debt securities
and preferred  stock.  In 1995,  the Company issued and sold $500 in senior debt
securities.  The intended use of the proceeds  from the sale of such  securities
has been and will continue to be primarily for the repayment and/or  replacement
of outstanding  commercial  paper and other  short-term  debt. This reflects The
Hartford's  strategy  of  managing  its  capital  within  acceptable  ranges  of
volatility  and financial  ratings while  achieving the lowest  long-run cost of
capital that is reasonably possible. On October 2, 1996, this shelf registration
statement was amended for an additional  $1.25 billion of securities,  making an
aggregate  of  $1.75  billion  available  for  sale.  The  amended  registration
statement also expanded the type of securities which could be offered under this
shelf registration  statement by including provisions for the offering of common
stock,  depositary shares,  warrants,  stock purchase contracts,  stock purchase
units and junior  subordinated  deferrable  interest  debentures of the Company,
preferred  securities  of any of the  Hartford  Trusts  (referred  to below) and
guarantees by the Company with respect to the preferred securities of any of the
Hartford  Trusts.  After the  issuance of QUIPS on October  30,  1996  discussed
below,  The Hartford had $1.25 billion  remaining on this shelf  registration at
December 31, 1996.

On January 19,  1996,  The  Hartford and several  wholly-owned  special  purpose
trusts  ("Hartford  Trusts")  formed by The Hartford  filed with the SEC a shelf
registration  statement  for the  potential  offering  and  sale of $500 of debt
securities  and  preferred  stock,  including  up to an  aggregate  $500  Junior
Subordinated  Deferrable  Interest  Debentures  of The  Hartford  and  Preferred
Securities  of the Hartford  Trusts which were issued as discussed  below.  (For
additional  information,  see Notes 5 and 6 of Notes to  Consolidated  Financial
Statements.)

                                     - 29 -

COMPANY  OBLIGATED  MANDATORILY  REDEEMABLE  PREFERRED  SECURITIES OF SUBSIDIARY
TRUSTS HOLDING SOLELY PARENT JUNIOR SUBORDINATED DEBENTURES ("QUIPS")

On February 28, 1996,  Hartford Capital I, a subsidiary trust, issued 20,000,000
Series A, 7.7% Cumulative  Quarterly Income Preferred  Securities.  The proceeds
from  the  sale of  these  securities  were  used  to  acquire  $500  of  Junior
Subordinated Deferrable Interest Debentures from The Hartford. The Hartford used
the  proceeds  from the sale of such  debentures  for the partial  repayment  of
outstanding  commercial paper and short-term bank indebtedness.  (For additional
information, see Note 6 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.)

On October 30, 1996, Hartford Capital II, a subsidiary trust, issued 20,000,000,
Series B, 8.35% Cumulative Quarterly Income Preferred  Securities.  The proceeds
from  the  sale of  these  securities  were  used  to  acquire  $500  of  Junior
Subordinated Deferrable Interest Debentures from The Hartford. The Hartford used
the proceeds from the sale of such  debentures for general  corporate  purposes.
(For  additional  information,  see Note 6 of Notes  to  Consolidated  Financial
Statements.)

SUBSIDIARY PREFERRED STOCK

During 1995,  Hartford Fire Insurance Company  ("Hartford Fire"), a wholly-owned
subsidiary of The Hartford, redeemed $86 of its Class A Preferred Stock - Series
2.

DIVIDENDS

In 1996, The Hartford  declared $188 and paid $140 in dividends to shareholders.
In 1995,  The  Hartford  paid  dividends to ITT  consisting  of cash of $384 and
non-cash of $395 prior to the Distribution.

On October 17,  1996,  The  Hartford  declared a dividend on its common stock of
$0.40 per share payable on January 2, 1997 to all  shareholders  of record as of
November 29, 1996.

In 1997,  The Hartford  expects to continue  paying  quarterly  dividends on its
common  stock of $0.40 per  share.  Dividend  decisions  will be based  on,  and
affected by, a number of factors,  including the operating results and financial
requirements  of The  Hartford  on a  stand-alone  basis  and the  impact of the
regulatory restrictions discussed in the Liquidity Requirements section below.

RATINGS

The following table summarizes The Hartford's significant U.S. member companies'
financial ratings from the major independent rating organizations as of February

On February 10, 1997,  Standard & Poor's  reaffirmed its  claims-paying  ability
ratings  and  various  other  ratings of The  Hartford  group of  companies.  On
September  24,  1996,  Standard  &  Poor's  announced  that it had  reduced  the
claims-paying ability ratings and various other ratings of The Hartford group of
companies.  In announcing the rating  change,  Standard & Poor's stated that the
action was based primarily on increased concern with the overall strength of The
Hartford's  consolidated  capital,  partially  offset  by  a  superior  business
position within the markets that The Hartford operates.

On January 23, 1997,  Moody's  Investors  Service  announced  that it downgraded
various  ratings of The Hartford and its  subsidiaries,  including the financial
strength  ratings of The  Hartford's  insurance  subsidiaries,  and the  ratings
assigned to the quarterly income preferred  securities of Hartford Capital I and
Hartford Capital II. Moody's  indicated that the action reflected The Hartford's
financial leverage,  the remaining risks as to adequacy of loss reserves related
to the  Company's  environmental  and  asbestos  exposures,  and the  continuing
intense competition in The Hartford's ongoing business segments.

On  February  10,  1997,  ratings  from Duff & Phelps  were  reaffirmed  for The
Hartford's  significant U.S. member  companies.  On February 10, 1997, A.M. Best
placed the ratings of The Hartford's  significant  member companies under review
with developing implications.

LIQUIDITY REQUIREMENTS

The liquidity requirements of The Hartford have been and will continue to be met
by funds from  operations  as well as the  issuance of  commercial  paper,  debt
securities and bank borrowings.  The principal sources of funds are premiums and
investment  income as well as  maturities  and  sales of  invested  assets.  The
Hartford is a holding company which receives  operating cash flow in the form of
dividends  from its  subsidiaries,  enabling it to service debt and pay business
expenses.

Dividends to ITT Hartford Group, Inc. from its subsidiaries are restricted.  The
payment of  dividends  by  Connecticut-domiciled  insurers is limited  under the
insurance  holding 

                                     - 30 -

company laws of  Connecticut.  Hartford Fire adheres to these laws which require
notice to and approval by the state insurance  commissioner  for the declaration
or payment of any dividend, which together with other dividends or distributions
made within the preceding  twelve months,  exceeds the greater of (i) 10% of the
insurer's  policyholder  surplus as of December 31 of the preceding year or (ii)
net income (or net gain from  operations,  if such  company is a life  insurance
company) for the twelve-month  period ending on the thirty-first day of December
last preceding,  in each case determined  under statutory  insurance  accounting
policies.  In  addition,  if any  dividend  of a  Connecticut-domiciled  insurer
exceeds the  insurer's  earned  surplus,  it requires the prior  approval of the
Connecticut  Insurance  Commissioner.  For this reason,  any statutory  dividend
which may be paid to ITT Hartford Group,  Inc. by its insurance  subsidiaries in
1997 requires prior approval.

The  insurance  holding  company  laws of the other  jurisdictions  in which The
Hartford's  insurance  subsidiaries  are  incorporated  (or deemed  commercially
domiciled)  generally contain similar  (although in certain  instances  somewhat
more restrictive) limitations on the payment of dividends.

The primary uses of funds are to pay claims, policy benefits, operating expenses
and  commissions,  and to purchase new  investments.  In addition,  The Hartford
carries a significant  short-term  investment  position and accordingly does not
anticipate selling intermediate and long-term fixed maturity investments to meet
any liquidity needs. For a discussion of the Company's investment objectives and
strategies, see Investments section.

DISTRIBUTION AGREEMENT

As  part  of the  Distribution  Agreement  entered  into  by The  Hartford,  ITT
Destinations,  Inc., and ITT Industries,  Inc. ("the former ITT  subsidiaries"),
provisions  were outlined  addressing the disposition of shared  liabilities.  A
shared  liability  is  defined as a  liability  arising  out of, or related  to,
business  conducted  by ITT  prior to the  Distribution  that was not  otherwise
specifically  related  to  one  of  the  former  ITT  subsidiaries.   Under  the
Distribution  Agreement,  responsibility  for shared  liabilities shall be borne
equally by each of the former ITT  subsidiaries,  including  related  attorney's
fees and other  out-of-pocket  expenses.  As of  December  31,  1996,  all known
liabilities covered by this agreement have been accrued.

TAX ALLOCATION AGREEMENT

ITT and The Hartford have entered into a Tax  Allocation  Agreement  whereby The
Hartford will pay a share of ITT's  consolidated tax liability for the tax years
that The Hartford was included in ITT's consolidated  federal income tax return.
The Tax Allocation  Agreement provides for the attribution to specific companies
of any state,  local and foreign  taxes related to periods prior to December 20,
1995.

RISK-BASED CAPITAL

The National Association of Insurance Commissioners ("NAIC") adopted regulations
establishing  minimum  capitalization  requirements  based on risk-based capital
("RBC") formulas for both property and casualty  companies  (effective  December
31, 1994) and life companies  (effective  December 31, 1993).  The  requirements
consist of formulas  which  identify  companies  that are  undercapitalized  and
require specific regulatory actions. RBC is calculated for property and casualty
companies after adjusting capital for certain  underwriting,  asset,  credit and
off-balance sheet risks. The RBC formula for life companies  establishes capital
requirements relating to insurance,  business, asset and interest rate risks. As
of December 31, 1996, each of The Hartford's  insurance  subsidiaries within the
North American  Property & Casualty and Life segments have more than  sufficient
capital to meet the NAIC's RBC requirements.

Cash - end of year               $    112  $     95   $     55
- ----------------------------------------------------------------

During 1996, cash provided by operating activities decreased from the prior year
due primarily to increased policy  acquisition costs related to strong growth in
the Life segment.  During 1995, cash provided by operating  activities  improved
over 1994 due to increased revenues and collections on reinsurance recoverables.
The changes in cash provided by both investing and financing  activities between
years were primarily due to declines in investment-type contracts written in the
Life segment  coupled  with  increases in  investment-type  contract  maturities
resulting in cash (used) provided of $(390), $530 and $2,584 for the years ended
December 31, 1996,  1995 and 1994,  respectively.  These funds,  along with cash
reserves, were invested in securities held by The Hartford. Operating cash flows
in each of the last three years have been more than  adequate to meet  liquidity
requirements.

SUBSEQUENT EVENTS

On February 10, 1997, HLI filed a registration statement with the Securities and
Exchange  Commission  relating to an initial public offering of up to 20% of HLI
common stock.  HLI is the holding  company parent of The Hartford's  significant
life insurance and related subsidiaries.  Management intends to use the proceeds
from  the  offering  to  reduce  certain  debt   outstanding,   to  fund  growth
initiatives,  and  for  other  general  corporate  purposes.  Management  of The
Hartford believes the offering will strengthen the Company's  financial position
and flexibility.  If and when the offering is completed,  The Hartford's current
intent is to continue to  beneficially  own at 

                                     - 31 -

least 80% of HLI, but it is under no contractual obligation to do so.

On February 14, 1997, HLI filed a shelf registration  statement for the issuance
and sale of up to $1.0  billion  in the  aggregate  of senior  debt  securities,
subordinated  debt securities and preferred stock of HLI ("the HLI securities").
HLI intends to use the proceeds  from any  offering  for the  repayment of debt,
including  outstanding  commercial paper and other third party  indebtedness and
the   satisfaction  of  other   obligations,   for  working   capital,   capital
expenditures,  investments  in or loans to  subsidiaries  and for other  general
corporate purposes.

================================================================================
REGULATORY INITIATIVES
================================================================================

LEGISLATIVE INITIATIVES

Although  the  Federal  government  does not  directly  regulate  the  insurance
business,  Federal initiatives often have an impact on the insurance industry in
a variety of ways.  Legislation has not been introduced in the current  Congress
but has in recent  sessions  which,  if enacted,  would result in  substantially
greater  Federal  regulation  of the property  and  casualty and life  insurance
industries. Current and proposed Federal measures which may significantly affect
the life insurance  business include medical testing for  insurability,  tax law
changes affecting the tax treatment of life insurance products and its impact on
the relative  desirability of various personal  investment vehicles and proposed
legislation to prohibit the use of gender in  determining  insurance and pension
rates and benefits.  Such measures which may  significantly  impact the property
and casualty industry include possible  modifications to the Superfund  program,
the tax laws  governing  property  and  casualty  insurance  companies,  Federal
catastrophe fund legislation and tort reform proposals.

INSOLVENCY FUND

In all states,  insurers  licensed to transact  certain classes of insurance are
required to become members of an insolvency  fund. In most states,  in the event
of the  insolvency  of an insurer  writing  any such class of  insurance  in the
state,  all  members  of the fund are  assessed  to pay  certain  claims  of the
insolvent insurer. A particular state's fund assesses its members based on their
respective  written  premiums in the state for the classes of insurance in which
the insolvent insurer is engaged. Assessments are generally limited for any year
to one or two percent of premiums written per year depending on the state.  Such
assessments  paid by The Hartford  approximated $14 in 1996, $15 in 1995 and $23
in 1994.

================================================================================
EFFECT OF INFLATION
================================================================================

The rate of  inflation as measured by the change in the average  consumer  price
index has not had a material effect on the revenues or operating  results of The
Hartford during the three most recent fiscal years.

                              REPORT OF MANAGEMENT


The management of ITT Hartford Group,  Inc. ("The  Hartford") is responsible for
the  preparation  and  integrity of  information  contained in the  accompanying
consolidated  financial  statements and other sections of the Annual Report. The
financial   statements  are  prepared  in  accordance  with  generally  accepted
accounting principles,  and, where necessary,  include amounts that are based on
management's  informed  judgments  and  estimates.   Management  believes  these
statements  present  fairly The  Hartford's  financial  position  and results of
operation,  and,  that any other  information  contained in the Annual Report is
consistent with the financial statements.

Management has made available The Hartford's  financial records and related data
to Arthur Andersen LLP,  independent  public  accountants,  in order for them to
perform an audit of The  Hartford's  consolidated  financial  statements.  Their
report appears on page F-2.

An essential element in meeting management's  financial  responsibilities is The
Hartford's system of internal controls. These controls, which include accounting
controls and the internal auditing program,  are designed to provide  reasonable
assurance that assets are safeguarded, and transactions are properly authorized,
executed and recorded.  The controls,  which are documented and  communicated to
employees in the form of written  codes of conduct and policies and  procedures,
provide for careful  selection  of  personnel  and for  appropriate  division of
responsibility.  Management  continually  monitors  for  compliance,  while  The
Hartford's  internal  auditors  independently  assess the  effectiveness  of the
controls and make  recommendations  for improvement.  Also,  Arthur Andersen LLP
took  into   consideration   The  Hartford's  system  of  internal  controls  in
determining the nature, timing and extent of its audit tests.

Another important element is management's  recognition of its responsibility for
fostering  a strong,  ethical  climate,  thereby  ensuring  that The  Hartford's
affairs are  transacted  according  to the  highest  standards  of personal  and
professional  conduct. The Hartford has a long-standing  reputation of integrity
in business  conduct and  utilizes  communication  and  education  to create and
fortify a strong compliance culture.

The Audit  Committee  of the Board of  Directors  of The  Hartford,  composed of
non-employee  directors,  meets  periodically  with the  external  and  internal
auditors to evaluate the  effectiveness of work performed by them in discharging
their  respective  responsibilities  and to assure their  independence  and free
access to the Committee.

                    REPORT OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS


TO ITT HARTFORD GROUP, INC.:

We have audited the  accompanying  Consolidated  Balance  Sheets of ITT Hartford
Group,  Inc. ("The  Hartford") (a Delaware  corporation)  and subsidiaries as of
December 31, 1996 and 1995, and the related  Consolidated  Statements of Income,
Stockholders'  Equity and Cash  Flows for each of the three  years in the period
ended  December  31,  1996.  These  consolidated  financial  statements  and the
schedules referred to below are the responsibility of The Hartford's management.
Our  responsibility  is to express an opinion on these financial  statements and
the schedules based on our audits.

We  conducted  our  audits  in  accordance  with  generally   accepted  auditing
standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.  An audit also includes
assessing the  accounting  principles  used and  significant  estimates  made by
management,  as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated  financial statements referred to above present
fairly,  in all material  respects,  the financial  position of The Hartford and
subsidiaries  as of  December  31,  1996  and  1995,  and the  results  of their
operations  and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
December 31, 1996 in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.

As  discussed  in Note 1 of  Notes to  Consolidated  Financial  Statements,  The
Hartford  adopted  new  accounting   standards   promulgated  by  the  Financial
Accounting Standards Board, changing its method of accounting, effective January
1, 1994,  for certain  investments in debt and equity  securities.  The Hartford
also changed,  effective  January 1, 1994,  its method used to discount  certain
workers' compensation liabilities.

Our  audits  were  made for the  purpose  of  forming  an  opinion  on the basic
financial  statements  taken as a whole.  The  schedules  listed in the Index to
Consolidated Financial Statements and Schedules are presented for the purpose of
complying with the Securities and Exchange  Commission's  rules and are not part
of the basic  financial  statements.  These schedules have been subjected to the
auditing procedures applied in the audits of the basic financial statements and,
in our  opinion,  fairly  state in all  material  respects  the  financial  data
required to be set forth therein in relation to the basic  financial  statements
taken as a whole.

                    ITT HARTFORD GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
                   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
   (DOLLAR AMOUNTS IN MILLIONS EXCEPT PER SHARE DATA UNLESS OTHERWISE STATED)

1.  SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

(a)  BASIS OF PRESENTATION

ITT Hartford  Group,  Inc.  together with its  consolidated  subsidiaries  ("The
Hartford" or the "Company")  provide property and casualty and life insurance to
both   individual   and   commercial   customers   in  the  United   States  and
internationally.

In  June  1995,   the  Board  of  Directors  of  ITT   Industries,   Inc.   (the
"Corporation"),  formerly ITT Corporation ("ITT"),  approved the distribution to
holders of the  Corporation's  common stock of all outstanding  shares of common
stock of The  Hartford on a pro rata basis (see Note 2). The  Hartford  became a
publicly  traded  company that includes the  insurance  businesses of the former
ITT. For purposes of these financial statements,  all references to The Hartford
include  the  assets,  liabilities  and  results of  operations  of First  State
Insurance Company and its subsidiaries  ("First State") and Fencourt Reinsurance
Company,  Ltd., which were transferred to The Hartford prior to the distribution
(see Note 2).

These financial statements present the financial position, results of operations
and cash flows of The  Hartford as if it were a separate  entity for all periods
presented.  The Corporation's  historical basis in the assets and liabilities of
certain  companies,  that were  previously not a part of The Hartford,  has been
carried over and included in the  accompanying  financial  statements as if such
companies had been transferred for all periods presented, in a manner similar to
pooling of interest  accounting.  All  material  intercompany  transactions  and
balances  between  The  Hartford,  its  subsidiaries  and  affiliates  have been
eliminated.  The consolidated  financial statements are prepared on the basis of
generally  accepted  accounting  principles  which  differ  materially  from the
accounting prescribed by various insurance regulatory authorities.

The preparation of financial  statements,  in conformity with generally accepted
accounting  principles,  requires  management to make estimates and  assumptions
that affect the reported  amounts of assets and  liabilities  and  disclosure of
contingent  assets and  liabilities at the date of the financial  statements and
the  reported  amounts of revenues  and expenses  during the  reporting  period.
Actual results could differ from those estimates.

The most significant estimates include those used in determining deferred policy
acquisition  costs and the liability for future policy  benefits,  unpaid claims
and claim  adjustment  expenses.  Although some variability is inherent in these
estimates, management believes the amounts provided are adequate.

Certain  reclassifications have been made to prior year financial information to
conform to current year presentation.

(b)  CHANGES IN ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES

On  November  14,  1996,  the  Emerging  Issues  Task Force  ("EITF")  reached a
consensus on Issue No. 96-12,  "Recognition of Interest Income and Balance Sheet
Classification  of Structured  Notes".  This Issue requires  companies to record
income on certain structured securities on a retrospective  interest method. The
Company adopted EITF No. 96-12 for structured securities acquired after November
14,  1996.  Adoption  of EITF No.  96-12 did not have a  material  effect on the
Company's financial condition or results of operations.

In June 1996, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Statement
of Financial  Accounting  Standards ("SFAS") No. 125,  "Accounting for Transfers
and Servicing of Financial Assets and  Extinguishment  of Liabilities"  which is
effective for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of
liabilities  occurring  after  December 31,  1996.  This  statement  established
criteria for determining  whether  transferred assets should be accounted for as
sales or secured  borrowings.  Subsequently,  in December  1996, the FASB issued
SFAS  No.  127,  "Deferral  of  Effective  Date of  Certain  Provisions  of FASB
Statement No. 125, which defers the effective date of certain provisions of SFAS
No.  125 for one  year.  Adoption  of SFAS  No.  125 is not  expected  to have a
material effect on the Company's financial condition or results of operations.

Effective  January 1, 1996, The Hartford  adopted SFAS No. 121,  "Accounting for
the Impairment of Long-Lived  Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to be Disposed of
".  This  statement  establishes  accounting  standards  for the  impairment  of
long-lived assets,  certain  identifiable  intangibles,  and goodwill related to
those  assets  to be  held  and  used  and for  long-lived  assets  and  certain
identifiable  intangibles  to be disposed  of.  Adoption of SFAS No. 121 did not
have a  material  effect on the  Company's  financial  condition  or  results of
operations.

In October  1995,  the FASB  issued SFAS No. 123,  "Accounting  for  Stock-Based
Compensation",  which is effective in 1996 for calendar year end  companies.  As
permitted by SFAS No. 123, The Hartford continues to measure  compensation costs
of employee  stock option plans using the intrinsic  value method  prescribed by
Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25 and has made pro forma disclosures of
net income and earnings per share as if the fair value method prescribed by SFAS
No. 123 had been applied. For additional information, see Note 8.

Effective  January 1, 1994, The Hartford  adopted SFAS No. 115,  "Accounting for
Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities." The standard requires, among
other things,  that securities be classified as  "held-to-maturity",  "available
for sale" or "trading"  based on the  company's  intentions  with respect to the
ultimate disposition of the security and its ability to effect those intentions.
The classification  determines the appropriate  accounting  carrying value (cost
basis or fair value)

(b)  CHANGES IN ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES (CONTINUED)

and, in the case of fair value,  whether the  adjustment  impacts  Stockholders'
Equity  directly  or is  reflected  in the  Consolidated  Statements  of Income.
Investments in equity securities had previously been and continue to be recorded
at fair value with the  corresponding  impact included in Stockholders'  Equity.
Under SFAS No. 115, The Hartford's  fixed maturities are classified as available
for sale and accordingly, these investments are reflected at fair value with the
corresponding  impact included as a component of Stockholders' Equity designated
"unrealized  gain (loss) on  securities,  net of tax". At December 31, 1996, the
net unrealized gain on securities,  net of tax of $190, was $352 including a net
unrealized  gain  pertaining to equity  securities of $186. EITF Issue No. 93-18
prescribes  specific  accounting   treatment  with  respect  to  mortgage-backed
interest-only investments.  EITF Issue No. 93-18 reached the conclusion that the
measure of impairment of these  instruments  should be changed from undiscounted
cash  flows  to fair  value.  Accordingly,  the  amortized  cost  basis  of such
instruments, that were determined to have other-than-temporary impairment losses
at the time of the initial  adoption of SFAS No. 115,  was written  down to fair
value  and  reflected  as a  cumulative  effect  of  accounting  change of $(30)
after-tax as of January 1, 1994 in the accompanying  Consolidated  Statements of
Income.

Effective  January  1,  1994,  The  Hartford  elected  to change  its  method of
discounting to present value certain workers' compensation reserves, principally
for  permanently  disabled  claimants.  This change involved  discounting  these
reserves at a market  interest  rate as compared to  previously  used  statutory
rates  ranging from 3 to 3.5  percent.  The market rate,  which  approximated  7
percent at January 1, 1994,  represents  the rate of return The  Hartford  could
receive on risk-free  investments with maturities  comparable to the duration of
the claim  liabilities.  This  accounting  change  resulted  in a $42  after-tax
cumulative  effect benefit which is reflected in the  accompanying  Consolidated
Statements of Income. The total amount of the reserve discount was $472 and $451
at December 31, 1996 and 1995, respectively.

The  Hartford's  cash flows were not  impacted  by these  changes in  accounting
principles.

(c)  PROPERTY AND CASUALTY INSURANCE OPERATIONS

Policy acquisition costs,  representing  commissions,  premium taxes and certain
other  underwriting  expenses,  are deferred and  amortized  over policy  terms.
Estimates of future revenues,  including net investment income and tax benefits,
are compared to  estimates of future  costs,  including  amortization  of policy
acquisition  costs,  to determine if business  currently in force is expected to
result in a net loss.  No  revenue  deficiencies  have  been  determined  in the
periods presented.

The Hartford  establishes  reserves to provide for the estimated costs of paying
claims made by  policyholders or against  policyholders.  These reserves include
estimates  for both  claims  that have been  reported  and those  that have been
incurred  but not yet  reported to The  Hartford  and include  estimates  of all
expenses  associated with processing and settling these claims.  This estimation
process is primarily  based on historical  experience  and involves a variety of
actuarial  techniques  which  analyze  trends  and  other  relevant  factors.  A
reconciliation  of liabilities for unpaid claims and claim  adjustment  expenses
and a table  depicting the historical  development of the liabilities for unpaid
claims and claim adjustment expenses follows:

The  Company  has an  exposure  to  catastrophe  losses  which  can be caused by
significant  events  including  hurricanes,  severe winter storms,  earthquakes,
windstorms  and  fires.   The  frequency  and  severity  of   catastrophes   are
unpredictable  and the exposure to a catastrophe is a function of both the total
amount  insured in an area  affected by the event and the severity of the event.
Catastrophes generally impact limited geographic areas; however,  certain events
may produce significant damage in

(c)  PROPERTY AND CASUALTY INSURANCE OPERATIONS (CONTINUED)

heavily  populated areas. The Company  generally seeks to reduce its exposure to
catastrophe  losses  through  individual  risk  selection  and the  purchase  of
catastrophe reinsurance.

(d)  LIFE INSURANCE OPERATIONS

Life  insurance  revenues are  comprised of life  insurance  premiums  which are
recognized when due from  policyholders,  accident and health premiums which are
recognized  when earned and  policyholder  charges on  universal  life-type  and
investment contracts. Realized capital gains and losses on security transactions
associated with the Company's immediate  participation  guaranteed contracts are
excluded from revenues and deferred,  since under the terms of the contracts the
realized gains and losses will be credited to  policyholders  in future years as
they  are  entitled  to  receive  them.  Policy  acquisition  costs,   including
commissions  and  certain   underwriting   expenses  associated  with  acquiring
business,  are deferred and amortized over the estimated lives of the contracts,
generally 20 years.  Generally,  acquisition  costs are  deferred and  amortized
using the retrospective  deposit method. Under the retrospective deposit method,
acquisition  costs are  amortized in proportion to the present value of expected
gross profits from surrender charges, investment, mortality and expense margins.
Actual gross profits can vary from management's estimates resulting in increases
or decreases in the rate of amortization.  Management periodically updates these
estimates,  when appropriate,  and evaluates the  recoverability of the deferred
acquisition cost asset. When appropriate,  management revises its assumptions on
the estimated gross profits of these  contracts and the cumulative  amortization
for the books of business are reestimated and readjusted by a cumulative  charge
or credit to income.

Liabilities  for future  policy  benefits are computed by the net level  premium
method  using  interest  assumptions  ranging  from  3% to 11%  and  withdrawal,
mortality and morbidity  assumptions  appropriate  at the time the policies were
issued.  Health  reserves  are  stated at amounts  determined  by  estimates  on
individual  cases and estimates of unreported  claims based on past  experience.
Liabilities  for  universal  life-type  and  investment  contracts are stated at
policyholder account values before surrender charges.

The Company maintains separate account assets and liabilities which are reported
at fair value.  Separate  account assets are segregated from other  investments,
and investment income and gains and losses accrue directly to the policyholders.
Separate  accounts  reflect two  categories of risk  assumption:  non-guaranteed
separate  accounts,  wherein the  policyholder  assumes the investment risk, and
guaranteed separate account assets, wherein the Company contractually guarantees
either a minimum return or account value to the policyholder.


(e)  FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION

Foreign  currency  translation  gains and losses are reflected in  Stockholders'
Equity. Balance sheet accounts are translated at the exchange rates in effect at
each year end and income statement  accounts are translated at the average rates
of  exchange  prevailing  during  the  year.  The  national  currencies  of  the
international operations are generally their functional currencies.

(f)  INVESTMENTS

The  Hartford's  investments  in fixed  maturities  include bonds and commercial
paper which are classified as "available for sale" and  accordingly  are carried
at fair value with the after-tax  difference  from cost reflected as a component
of Stockholders' Equity designated "unrealized gain (loss) on securities, net of
tax".  Equity  securities,  which include  common and  non-redeemable  preferred
stocks,  are  carried  at fair  value with the  after-tax  difference  from cost
reflected in  Stockholders'  Equity.  Fair value for fixed maturities and equity
securities  approximate those quotations published by applicable stock exchanges
or received from other reliable sources.  Net realized capital gains and losses,
after  deducting  life and  pension  policyholders'  share,  are  reported  as a
component  of revenue and are  determined  on a specific  identification  basis.
Policy loans are carried at outstanding balance which approximates fair value.

The Company's  accounting policy for impairment requires recognition of an other
than  temporary  impairment  charge on a security if it is  determined  that the
company is unable to recover all amounts due under the  contractual  obligations
of the security.  In addition,  the Company has established specific criteria to
be used in the  impairment  evaluation  of an  individual  portfolio  of assets.
Specifically, if the asset portfolio is supporting a runoff operation, is forced
to be liquidated prior to maturity to meet liability commitments, and has a fair
value below amortized cost,  which will not materially  fluctuate as a result of
future interest rate changes,  then an other than temporary  impairment has been
determined to have  occurred and is  recognized.  The Company then  continues to
review the impaired securities for appropriate valuation on an ongoing basis.

During 1996, it was determined that a portfolio of assets within the closed book
of guaranteed rate contract business ("Closed Book GRC") was impaired.  With the
initiation of certain hedge transactions,  which eliminated the possibility that
the fair value of the Closed Book GRC investments would recover to their current
amortized  cost, an other than  temporary  impairment  loss of $88 after-tax was
determined to have occurred and was recorded.

(g)  DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

The Hartford uses a variety of derivative financial instruments including swaps,
caps, floors, forwards and exchange traded financial futures and options as part
of an overall risk management strategy. These instruments are used as a means of
hedging exposure to price, foreign currency and/or interest rate risk on planned
investment purchases or existing assets and

                                      F-9

             NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)

1.  SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)


(g)  DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS (CONTINUED)

liabilities.   The  Hartford  does  not  hold  or  issue  derivative   financial
instruments  for trading  purposes.  The  Hartford's  accounting  for derivative
financial  instruments  used to manage risk is in  accordance  with the concepts
established in SFAS No. 80,  "Accounting for Futures  Contracts",  SFAS No. 52 ,
"Foreign  Currency   Translation",   American   Institute  of  Certified  Public
Accountants  Statement of Position  86-2,  "Accounting  for Options" and various
EITF pronouncements.  Written options are used, in all cases in conjunction with
other  assets  and  derivatives  as part of the  Company's  asset and  liability
management  strategy.  Derivative  instruments are carried at values  consistent
with the  asset or  liability  being  hedged.  Derivatives  used to hedge  fixed
maturities or equities are carried at fair value with the  after-tax  difference
from cost reflected in  Stockholders'  Equity.  Derivatives  used to hedge other
invested assets or liabilities are carried at cost.

Derivatives  must be  designated  at  inception  as a  hedge  and  measured  for
effectiveness  both at inception and on an ongoing basis. The Hartford's minimum
correlation  threshold for hedge  designation is 80%. If  correlation,  which is
assessed  monthly and measured  based on a rolling  three month  average,  falls
below 80%, hedge  accounting  will be terminated.  Derivatives  used to create a
synthetic asset must meet synthetic accounting criteria including designation at
inception and  consistency  of terms  between the  synthetic and the  instrument
being  replicated.  Synthetic  instrument  accounting,  consistent with industry
practice,  provides that the synthetic asset is accounted for like the financial
instrument  it is intended  to  replicate.  Derivatives  which fail to meet risk
management  criteria  are  marked to market  with the  impact  reflected  in the
Consolidated Statements of Income.

Gains or losses on financial  futures  contracts entered into in anticipation of
the future  receipt of product cash flows are  deferred  and, at the time of the
ultimate purchase, reflected as a basis adjustment to the purchased asset. Gains
or losses on futures  used in invested  asset risk  management  are deferred and
adjusted  into the basis of the  hedged  asset  when the  contract  futures  are
closed, except for futures used in duration hedging which are deferred and basis
adjusted on a quarterly  basis.  The basis  adjustments  are amortized  into net
investment income over the remaining asset life.

Open forward  commitment  contracts are marked to market  through  Stockholders'
Equity.  Such  contracts are recorded at settlement by recording the purchase of
the specified  securities at the  previously  committed  price.  Gains or losses
resulting from the termination of the forward  commitment  contracts  before the
delivery  of the  securities  are  recognized  immediately  in the  Consolidated
Statements of Income as a component of net investment income.

The cost of options entered into as part of a risk management strategy are basis
adjusted to the  underlying  asset or liability and amortized over the remaining
life of the hedge.  Gains or losses on  expiration or  termination  are adjusted
into the basis of the  underlying  asset or  liability  and  amortized  over the
remaining asset life.

Interest  rate swaps  involve the  periodic  exchange  of  payments  without the
exchange of underlying  principal or notional amounts.  Net receipts or payments
are accrued and recognized  over the life of the swap agreement as an adjustment
to income. Should the swap be terminated,  the gain or loss is adjusted into the
basis of the asset or liability and amortized  over the remaining  life.  Should
the hedged asset be sold or liability  terminated  without  terminating the swap
position,  any swap  gains or losses are  immediately  recognized  in  earnings.
Interest   rate  swaps   purchased  in   anticipation   of  an  asset   purchase
("anticipatory transaction") are recognized consistent with the underlying asset
components such that the settlement  component is recognized in the Consolidated
Statements  of Income  while the  change in  market  value is  recognized  as an
unrealized gain or loss.

Premiums paid on purchased  floor or cap agreements and the premium  received on
issued cap or floor  agreements (used for risk management) are adjusted into the
basis of the applicable asset and amortized over the asset life. Gains or losses
on  termination  of such  positions  are adjusted into the basis of the asset or
liability  and  amortized  over the  remaining  asset  life.  Net  payments  are
recognized as an adjustment to income or basis adjusted and amortized  depending
on the specific hedge strategy.

Forward  exchange  contracts  and foreign  currency  swaps are  accounted for in
accordance with SFAS No. 52. Changes in the spot rate of instruments  designated
as hedges of the net  investment  in a foreign  subsidiary  are reflected in the
cumulative translation adjustments component of Stockholders' Equity.

(h) EARNINGS PER SHARE

Earnings  per  share  for the  years  ended  December  31,  1995 and  1994  were
determined  based on the actual number of common shares  outstanding at December
31, 1995 of 117.1 million.

2.  THE DISTRIBUTION

On December 19, 1995, ITT distributed  all of the  outstanding  shares of common
stock  of  The   Hartford  to  the   shareholders   of  ITT  common  stock  (the
"Distribution"  or "Spin-off").  As a result of the  Distribution,  The Hartford
became an  independent  publicly-traded  company.  "Regular  Way" trading of The
Hartford  common  stock  securities  on the New York Stock  Exchange  (under the
symbol  "HIG")   commenced  on  December  20,  1995.  In  connection  with  this
transaction, ITT transferred First State and Fencourt Reinsurance Company, Ltd.,
both of which were  wholly-owned  companies of ITT, to The Hartford prior to the
Distribution.

The Distribution Agreement entered into by The Hartford, ITT Destinations, Inc.,
and  ITT  Industries,   Inc.  ("the  former  ITT  subsidiaries")  addressed  the
disposition of shared liabilities.  A shared liability is defined as a liability
arising out of, or related

2.  THE DISTRIBUTION (CONTINUED)

to, business  conducted by ITT prior to the Distribution  that was not otherwise
specifically  related  to  one  of  the  former  ITT  subsidiaries.   Under  the
Distribution Agreement,  responsibility for shared liabilities generally will be
borne  equally  by  each  of the  former  ITT  subsidiaries,  including  related
attorney's fees and other out-of-pocket  expenses.  As of December 31, 1996, all
known liabilities covered by this agreement have been accrued.

Additionally,  ITT and The Hartford have entered into a Tax Allocation Agreement
whereby The Hartford  will pay a share of ITT's  consolidated  tax liability for
the tax years that The  Hartford  was  included  in ITT's  consolidated  Federal
income tax return. The Tax Allocation  Agreement provides for the attribution to
specific  companies  of any state,  local and foreign  taxes  related to periods
prior to December 20, 1995.

The amortized  cost and estimated  fair value of fixed  maturity  investments at
December 31, 1996 by maturity are shown to the right.  Asset-backed  securities,
including MBS and CMO's,  are distributed to maturity year based on estimates of
the rate of future  prepayments  of principal  over the  remaining  lives of the

(e)  FIXED MATURITY INVESTMENTS (CONTINUED)

Sales of fixed maturities,  excluding short-term fixed maturities, for the years
ended  December 31, 1996,  1995 and 1994 resulted in proceeds of $11.3  billion,
$10.7 billion and $10.2  billion,  gross gains of $161,  $210 and $188 and gross
losses (including writedowns) of $(408), $(147) and $(212), respectively.  Sales
of equity  security  investments for the years ended December 31, 1996, 1995 and
1994 resulted in proceeds of $1.4 billion, $1.7 billion and $1.7 billion,  gross
gains of $184,  $150 and $135 and  gross  losses  of  $(49),  $(73)  and  $(52),

in The Hartford's  separate account assets.  During 1996, all interest  payments
due were received. The bonds were sold in January 1997 for $40.

Excluding U.S. government and government agency investments, The Hartford is not
exposed to any significant credit concentration risk.

The following  methods and  assumptions  were used to estimate the fair value of
each class of financial  instrument  above for which it is practicable to do so:
policy and mortgage loan carrying amounts approximate fair value; investments in
partnerships and trusts are based on external market valuations from partnership
and trust management; other policy claims and benefits payable are determined by
estimating  future cash flows discounted at the current market rate;  short-term
debt carrying  amounts  approximate  fair value;  and long-term debt,  including
QUIPS,  is based on external  valuation  using  discounted  future cash flows at
current market interest rates.

(h)  DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

The  Hartford  uses a variety of  derivative  financial  instruments,  including
swaps, caps, floors,  forwards and exchange traded financial futures and options
in order to hedge exposure to price, foreign currency and/or interest rate risks
on anticipated investment purchases or existing assets and liabilities. Approved
derivatives  usage must  support at least one of the  following  objectives:  to
manage the risk to the operation  arising from price,  interest rate and foreign
currency volatility,  to manage liquidity,  or to control transaction costs. The
notional amounts of derivative  contracts represent the basis upon which pay and
receive  amounts are calculated  and are not  reflective of credit risk.  Credit
risk for derivative  contracts is limited to the amounts calculated to be due to
The Hartford on such contracts. Payment obligations between The Hartford and its
counterparties  are  typically  netted on a quarterly  basis.  The  Hartford has
policies  regarding  the financial  stability  and credit  standing of its major
counterparties and typically  requires credit enhancement  provisions to further
limit  its  credit  risk for  derivative  contracts.  Many of  these  derivative
contracts are bilateral  agreements that are not assignable  without the consent
of  the  relevant  counterparty.   Notional  amounts  pertaining  to  derivative
financial  instruments  totaled $11.1 billion and $9.8 billion ($8.3 billion and
$7.9 billion related to life insurance operations investments,  $2.6 billion and
$1.7 billion on life insurance operations  liabilities and $200 and $200 related
to variable rate debt) at December 31, 1996 and 1995, respectively.

agreements,  in which life insurance  operations generally pay one variable rate
in exchange for another,  was $2.6 billion and $1.7 billion at December 31, 1996

5.  DEBT (CONTINUED)

SHORT-TERM DEBT - The Hartford's  commercial  paper ranks equally with its other
unsecured and  unsubordinated  indebtedness.  Effective  December 20, 1996,  The
Hartford  entered into an unsecured  aggregate $2.0 billion credit facility with
twenty-nine  banks which is  comprised  of a $1.5  billion  five year  revolving
credit  facility  and a  $500  short-term  credit  facility.  This  facility  is
available for general corporate  purposes and to provide  additional  support to
the Company's  commercial  paper  program.  At December 31, 1996,  there were no
outstanding  borrowings under the facility. On February 10, 1997, Hartford Life,
Inc.  ("HLI"),  a wholly-owned  subsidiary of The Hartford,  entered into a $1.3
billion unsecured short-term credit facility with four banks.

During 1996, The Hartford  expanded its  commercial  paper program by increasing
the maximum  allowable  outstanding  amount of unsecured  short-term  commercial
paper notes from $1.0 billion to $2.0 billion.

LONG-TERM  DEBT  -  The  Hartford's  long-term  debt  securities  are  unsecured
obligations  of The Hartford and rank on a parity with all other  unsecured  and
unsubordinated  indebtedness.  On October 11, 1995,  The Hartford filed with the
Securities  and  Exchange  Commission  a shelf  registration  statement  for the
potential  offering  and  sale  of up to  an  aggregate  $1.0  billion  in  debt
securities and preferred stock. On November 3, 1995, the Company issued and sold
$500 in senior debt  securities in two tranches ($300 of 6.4% notes due 2002 and
$200 in 7.3% debentures due 2015).  On October 2, 1996, this shelf  registration
statement was amended for an additional  $1.25 billion of securities,  making an
aggregate  of  $1.75  billion  available  for  sale.  The  amended  registration
statement also expanded the type of securities which could be offered under this
shelf registration  statement by including provisions for the offering of common
stock,  depositary shares,  warrants,  stock purchase contracts,  stock purchase
units and junior  subordinated  deferrable  interest  debentures of the Company,
preferred  securities  of any of the  Hartford  Trusts  (referred  to below) and
guarantees by the Company with respect to the preferred securities of any of the
Hartford Trusts. After the issuance of Company Obligated Mandatorily  Redeemable
Preferred   Securities  of  Subsidiary   Trusts  Holding  Solely  Parent  Junior
Subordinated  Debentures on October 30, 1996 discussed  below,  The Hartford had
$1.25 billion remaining on this shelf registration at December 31, 1996.

On January 19,  1996,  The  Hartford and several  wholly-owned  special  purpose
trusts ("Hartford  Trusts") formed by The Hartford filed with the Securities and
Exchange  Commission a shelf  registration  statement for the potential offering
and sale of $500 of debt  securities  and  preferred  stock,  including up to an
aggregate  $500  Junior  Subordinated  Deferrable  Interest  Debentures  of  The
Hartford and Preferred  Securities  of the Hartford  Trusts which were issued as
discussed in Note 6.

Interest rate risk relative to The  Hartford's  debt  portfolios is  selectively
managed through  interest rate swap  agreements.  The following table summarizes
the maturities of these interest rate swaps outstanding at December 31, 1996 and
the related weighted average interest pay rates and receive rates.

The fair value of the  interest  rate swaps on  short-term  debt at December 31,
1996 and  December  31,  1995 was $(1) and $(3),  respectively.  Any credit risk
related to these swaps is considered remote.

Interest  expense  incurred  related to short- and long-term  debt totaled $108,
$101 and $76 for 1996, 1995 and 1994, respectively.

6. COMPANY OBLIGATED  MANDATORILY  REDEEMABLE PREFERRED SECURITIES OF SUBSIDIARY
TRUSTS HOLDING SOLELY PARENT JUNIOR SUBORDINATED DEBENTURES

On February 28,  1996,  Hartford  Capital I, a special  purpose  Delaware  trust
formed by The Hartford,  issued 20,000,000  Series A, 7.7% Cumulative  Quarterly
Income Preferred Securities ("Series A Preferred Securities"). The proceeds from
the sale of the  Series A  Preferred  Securities  were used to  acquire  $500 of
Junior   Subordinated   Deferrable  Interest   Debentures,   Series  A  ("Junior
Subordinated  Debentures"),  issued  by The  Hartford.  The  Hartford  used  the
proceeds  from  the  sale  of  such  debentures  for the  partial  repayment  of
outstanding commercial paper and short-term bank indebtedness.

Series A Preferred  Securities  represent undivided  beneficial interests in the
assets of Hartford Capital I. The Hartford owns all of the beneficial  interests
represented  by Series A Common  Securities  of Hartford  Capital I.  Holders of
Series A Preferred  Securities are entitled to receive  preferential  cumulative
cash  distributions  accruing  from  February 28, 1996 and payable  quarterly in
arrears  commencing March 31, 1996 at the annual rate of 7.7% of the liquidation
amount of  $25.00  per  Series A  Preferred  Security.  The  Series A  Preferred
Securities  are subject to  mandatory  redemption  upon  repayment of the Junior
Subordinated  Debentures  at maturity or their  earlier  redemption.  Holders of
Series A Preferred Securities have limited voting rights.

The Junior  Subordinated  Debentures bear interest at the annual rate of 7.7% of
the principal amount,  payable  quarterly in arrears  commencing March 31, 1996,
and  mature on  February  28,  2016.  The  Junior  Subordinated  Debentures  are
unsecured and rank junior and subordinate in right of payment to all senior debt
of The  Hartford  and are  effectively  subordinated  to all existing and future
liabilities of its subsidiaries.

The  Hartford  has the  right  to  defer  payments  of  interest  on the  Junior
Subordinated Debentures by extending the interest

payment period for up to 20 consecutive quarters for each deferral period, up to
the maturity date. During any such period,  interest will continue to accrue and
The Hartford may not declare or pay any cash dividends or  distributions  on The
Hartford's common stock nor make any principal,  interest or premium payments on
or  repurchase  any debt  securities  that rank pari passu with or junior to the
Junior Subordinated  Debentures.  In the event of failure to pay interest for 30
consecutive  days  (subject  to the  deferral  of any due date in the case of an
extension  period),  the  Junior  Subordinated  Debentures  will  become due and
payable.  The Hartford  has  guaranteed,  on a  subordinated  basis,  all of the
Hartford  Capital  I  obligations  under  the  Series  A  Preferred  Securities,
including,   to  pay  the  redemption  price  and  any  accumulated  and  unpaid
distributions to the extent of available funds and upon dissolution,  winding up
or liquidation, but only to the extent that Hartford Capital I has funds to make
such payments.

On October 30,  1996,  Hartford  Capital II, a special  purpose  Delaware  trust
formed by The Hartford,  issued 20,000,000 Series B, 8.35% Cumulative  Quarterly
Income  Preferred  Securities  ("Series B Preferred  Securities").  The material
terms of the Series B Preferred  Securities  are  substantially  the same as the
Series A Preferred  Securities described above, except for the rate and maturity
date.  The Series B Debentures  bear interest at the annual rate of 8.35% of the
principal amount payable quarterly in arrears commencing  December 31, 1996, and
mature on October 30, 2026. The proceeds from the sale of the Series B Preferred
Securities were used to acquire $500 of Junior Subordinated  Deferrable Interest
Debentures,  Series B  ("Series  B  Debentures"),  issued by The  Hartford.  The
Hartford  used  the  proceeds  from  the  sale of such  debentures  for  general
corporate purposes.

Interest expense incurred with respect to the Series A Preferred  Securities and
Series B Preferred Securities totaled approximately $40 in 1996.

7. PENSION PLANS AND POSTRETIREMENT HEALTH CARE AND LIFE INSURANCE BENEFIT PLANS

(a)  PENSION PLANS

The Hartford  has a number of  noncontributory  defined  benefit  pension  plans
covering most U.S. and international  employees.  Plans covering U.S.  employees
provide  pension  benefits that are based on years of service and the employee's
compensation  during the last ten years of employment.  The  Hartford's  funding
policy is to  contribute  annually  at an amount  between  the  minimum  funding
requirements  set forth in the Employee  Retirement  Income Security Act of 1974
and the  maximum  amount  that can be  deducted  for  U.S.  Federal  income  tax
purposes.  Employees  of  international  subsidiaries  are  covered  by  various
postemployment benefit arrangements,  some of which are considered to be defined
benefit plans for accounting purposes.

The  following  table sets forth the defined  benefit  plans'  funded status and
amounts  recognized in the  Consolidated  Balance  Sheets.  International  plans
represent an  immaterial  percentage of total pension  assets,  liabilities  and
expense and, for reporting purposes, are combined with domestic plans.

(b)   INVESTMENT AND SAVINGS PLAN

          Prior to the Distribution,  employees of The Hartford  participated in
ITT's  Investment and Savings Plans.  As part of the  Distribution,  the Company
established  The  Hartford  Investment  and  Savings  Plan.   Substantially  all
employees  are  eligible  to  participate  in this plan under  which  designated
contributions,  which may be invested in common stock of The Hartford or certain
other investments,  are matched, up to 3% of compensation,  by the Company.  The
cost to The Hartford for the  above-mentioned  plans was approximately  $20, $19
and $19 for 1996, 1995 and 1994, respectively.

(c)   POSTRETIREMENT HEALTH CARE AND LIFE INSURANCE BENEFIT PLANS

The  Hartford  provides  certain  health care and life  insurance  benefits  for
eligible retired employees.  A substantial  portion of The Hartford's  employees
may  become  eligible  for  these  benefits  upon  retirement.   The  Hartford's
contribution  for health care benefits  will depend upon the  retiree's  date of
retirement and years of service. In addition,  the plan has a defined dollar cap
which limits average Company contributions. The Hartford has prefunded a portion
of the health care and life insurance obligations through trust funds where such
prefunding can be accomplished on a tax effective basis.  Postretirement  health
care and life  insurance  expense  (benefit)  was  comprised of the following in
1996, 1995 and 1994:

                             1996          1995         1994

The following table sets forth the funded status of the  postretirement  benefit
plans other than  pensions,  the amounts  recognized in The  Hartford's  balance
sheet  at  December  31,  1996  and  1995  and the  principal  weighted  average
assumptions inherent in their determination:

Ultimate health care trend rate                6.00%       6.00%
- ----------------------------------------------------------------


The assumed rate of future  increases in the per capita cost of health care (the
health  care trend  rate) was 9.3% for 1996,  decreasing  ratably to 6.0% in the
year 2001.  Increasing  the table of health  care trend rates by one percent per
year would have the effect of increasing the accumulated  postretirement benefit
obligation  by $7 and the annual  expense  by $1. To the extent  that the actual
experience differs from the inherent  assumptions,  the effect will be amortized
over the average future service of the covered active employees.

8.    STOCK COMPENSATION PLANS

Prior to the Distribution, certain employees of The Hartford were granted awards
under ITT's stock option incentive plans.  Effective  December 19, 1995,  awards
outstanding  under these plans that were held by employees of The Hartford  were
offered  substitute awards under the 1995 ITT Hartford Incentive Stock Plan (the
"Plan").  For the substitute awards, the number of shares subject to options was
increased and the option exercise price was decreased  immediately following the
Distribution  to  preserve,  as closely as possible,  the economic  value of the
options that existed prior to the Distribution.

Under the Plan,  the Company is authorized to issue up to 8,500,000  shares,  of
which no more  that  5,000,000  shares  may be  available  for  incentive  stock
options.  The Plan  contains a formula  that  determines  the maximum  number of
shares with  respect to which awards may be made in any one year and limits such
amount to 1.5% of the total of the  outstanding  shares plus treasury  shares as
reported in ITT Hartford's Form 10-K for the preceding year plus unused portions
of such limit from prior years. All options granted have an exercise price equal
to the market price of the Company's  stock on the date of grant and an option's
maximum  term  is  ten  years.  Certain  options  become  exercisable  upon  the
attainment of specified market price appreciation of the Company's common shares
or at seven years after the date of grant,  while the remaining  options  become
exercisable over a three year period commencing with the date of grant.

Additionally, during the fourth quarter of 1996, the Company established the ITT
Hartford  Employee  Stock  Purchase  Plan  ("ESPP").  Under this plan,  eligible
employees  of The  Hartford  may  purchase  common stock of the Company at a 15%
discount  from the  lower of the  market  price at the  beginning  or end of the
quarterly  offering period. The Company may sell up to 2,700,000 shares of stock
to eligible employees under the ESPP, and 39,214 shares were sold in 1996.

The  Company  applies  Accounting  Principles  Board  Opinion No. 25 and related
interpretations   in  accounting  for  its   stock-based   compensation   plans.
Accordingly,  no compensation cost has been recognized for its stock option plan
and stock purchase plan. Had compensation cost for the Company's two stock-based
compensation plans been determined based on the fair value at

No. 123, the  Company's  net income  (loss) and earnings  (loss) per share would
have been reduced to the pro forma amounts indicated below:

Earnings (loss) per share:     As reported     $(0.84)    $4.77
                               Pro forma       $(0.90)    $4.74
- ------------------------------------------------------------------
Note: The pro forma  disclosures  are not  representative  of the effects on net
income and earnings per share in future years.

The fair value of each option  grant is estimated on the date of the grant using
the  Black-Scholes  options-pricing  model with the  following  weighted-average
assumptions  used for grants in 1996 and 1995:  dividend  yield of 2.9% for both
years,  expected price variability of 20.8% for both years,  risk-free  interest
rates of 5.69% and 5.77% for the 1996 grants under 10,000 shares and grants over
10,000 shares,  respectively,  and 6.28% and 6.31%,  respectively,  for the 1995
grants; and expected lives of five and six years for both years.

A summary of the status of the Company's option plan as of December 31, 1995 and
1996 and changes during the periods December 19, 1995 through December 31, 1995,
and for the year ended December 31, 1996 are presented below:



The weighted-average fair value of The Hartford stock options,  calculated using
the Black-Scholes  option-pricing model, granted during the years ended December
31,  1996 and 1995 were $11.21 and $10.01,  respectively.  The  weighted-average
fair value of shares sold under the ESPP in 1996 was $16.50.

The following table summarizes  information about stock options  outstanding and
exercisable (shares in thousands) at December 31, 1996:

9.    REINSURANCE


The Hartford  cedes  insurance  to other  insurers in order to limit its maximum
loss. Such transfer does not relieve The Hartford of its primary liability.  The
Hartford also assumes  insurance from other  insurers.  Failure of reinsurers to
honor their  obligations  could result in losses to The  Hartford.  The Hartford
evaluates the financial  condition of its reinsurers and monitors  concentration
of credit risk.

The effect of reinsurance on property and casualty  premiums  written and earned
was as follows:

Life insurance recoveries,  which reduce death and other benefits,  approximated
$239,  $162 and $113 for the  years  ended  December  31,  1996,  1995 and 1994,
respectively.

As of  December  31,  1996,  the Company had  reinsurance  recoverables  of $3.8
billion  from Mutual  Benefit Life  Assurance  Corporation  ("Mutual  Benefit"),
supported by assets in a security trust of $3.8 billion  (including policy loans
of $3.3 billion).  The risk of Mutual Benefit becoming insolvent is mitigated by
the reinsurance  agreement's  requirement  that the assets be kept in a security
trust  with  the  Company  as  sole  beneficiary.  The  Hartford  has  no  other
significant reinsurance-related concentrations of credit risk.


10.   TRANSACTIONS WITH AFFILIATES

Prior to the  Distribution  (see Note 2), The Hartford had substantial  dealings
with ITT and its affiliates as described below.

The Hartford and its U.S.  subsidiaries were included in ITT's consolidated U.S.
Federal  income tax return and received from ITT an income tax benefit  computed
in  accordance  with  a  tax-sharing  arrangement.  This  arrangement  generally
reimbursed The Hartford on a current basis for taxes it would have been refunded
if it had filed a separate U.S. Federal income tax return.  The balance due from
ITT as a result of the tax-sharing  arrangement was $90 at December 19, 1995 and
$52 at December  31,  1994.  The  Hartford  filed a separate  consolidated  U.S.
Federal income tax return for the period December 20, 1995 through  December 31,
1995 and will continue to file its owned consolidated returns thereafter.

ITT furnished The Hartford with technical, administrative, personnel, financial,
accounting and operating advice and assistance,  as well as other services.  The
Hartford  reimbursed  ITT for the cost of such  services.  These  reimbursements
totaled $16 in 1995 and $15 in 1994.

In June 1995, ownership of ITT Lyndon Insurance Company was transferred from ITT
to The Hartford via a capital contribution of $180,  representing the net assets
of the company.

In 1995,  The Hartford paid common stock  dividends to ITT  Corporation of $779,
including  cash  dividends of $384 and non-cash  dividends of $395. The non-cash
dividend was primarily Alcatel Alsthom Stock,  which represents a portion of the
total ITT holdings in that company.

11.   PREFERRED STOCK

During 1995, The Hartford  authorized  50,000,000 shares of Preferred Stock, par
value $.01 per share.  The Company may not pay any common stock dividends unless
all preferred dividend requirements on Series A Preferred Stock (300,000 shares)
have  been met.  The  holders  of  Series A  Preferred  Stock  are  entitled  to
cumulative  dividends.  The  holders  of Series A  Preferred  Stock may not vote
separately  as a class,  but may vote  together as one class with the holders of
shares of common  stock.  No shares were issued or  outstanding  at December 31,
1996.

Hartford Fire Insurance Company ("Hartford Fire"), a subsidiary of The Hartford,
had no shares of Class A Preferred  Stock - Series 2 outstanding at December 31,
1996.  During 1995,  1,700,000  shares were redeemed at $50 per share.  Hartford
Fire had no shares of Class E Preferred Stock outstanding.  During 1995, 455,333
shares were redeemed at $10 per share.

A significant  percentage of the consolidated  statutory  surplus is permanently
reinvested  or is subject to various  state and  foreign  government  regulatory
restrictions or other  agreements  which limit the payment of dividends  without
prior approval.  Any statutory dividend which may be paid to ITT Hartford Group,
Inc. by its insurance subsidiaries in 1997 requires prior approval.

The domestic  insurance  subsidiaries of ITT Hartford Group,  Inc. prepare their
statutory   financial   statements  in  accordance  with  accounting   practices
prescribed  by  the  State  of  Connecticut  Insurance  Department.   Prescribed

14.   CONTINGENCIES

(a)   LITIGATION

The Hartford is involved in various legal actions,  some of which involve claims
for substantial  amounts.  In the opinion of management,  the ultimate liability
with respect to such lawsuits is not expected to be material to the consolidated
financial position, results of operations or cash flows of The Hartford.

(b)   ENVIRONMENTAL AND ASBESTOS CLAIMS

Historically,   The  Hartford  has  found  it  difficult  to  estimate  ultimate
liabilities  related to  environmental  and asbestos claims due to uncertainties
surrounding  these  exposures.   Within  the  property  and  casualty  insurance
industry,  progress  has  been  made in  developing  sophisticated,  alternative
methodologies  utilizing company experience and supplemental databases to assess
environmental  and  asbestos  liabilities.  A  study  which  incorporated  these
methodologies  was initiated by The Hartford in April 1996. The study included a
review of identified  environmental and asbestos exposures of the North American
Property & Casualty  segment,  U.S.  exposures of The  Hartford's  International
segment and exposures of the Runoff segment, and covered the Company's Personal,
Commercial and Reinsurance lines of business.  The methodology utilized a ground
up analysis of policy, site and exposure level data for a representative  sample
of The  Hartford's  claims.  The  results of the  evaluation  were  extrapolated
against the balance of the claim  population to estimate the  Company's  overall
exposure for reported claims. In addition to estimating  liabilities on reported
environmental and asbestos claims,  The Hartford  estimated  reserves for claims
incurred  but  not  reported  (IBNR).  The  IBNR  reserve  was  estimated  using
information on reporting patterns of known insureds, characteristics of insureds
such as limits exposed, attachment points and number of coverage years involved,
third party costs, and closed claims.  Also included in The Hartford's  analysis
of environmental and asbestos  exposures was a review of applicable  reinsurance
coverage. Reinsurance coverage applicable to the sample was used to estimate the
reinsurance  coverage that applied to the balance of the reported  environmental
and asbestos claims and to the IBNR estimates.

Upon  completion of the study and assessment of the results in October 1996, the
Company  determined  that its  environmental  and  asbestos  reserves  should be
increased,  on an undiscounted basis, by $493 (net of reinsurance) and $292 (net
of reinsurance), respectively, for the year ended December 31, 1996.

The Hartford  believes that the  environmental and asbestos reserves reported at
December 31, 1996, are a reasonable estimate of the ultimate remaining liability
for these claims based upon known facts,  current assumptions and The Hartford's
methodologies.  Future social,  economic,  legal or legislative developments may
continue to expand the  original  intent of policies  and the scope of coverage.
The Hartford will continue to evaluate new  developments  and  methodologies  as
they become  available for use in supplementing  the Company's  ongoing analysis
and review of its environmental and asbestos exposures. These future reviews may
result in a change in reserves,  impacting The Hartford's  results of operations
in the period in which the reserve  estimates are changed.  While the effects of
future changes in facts,  legal and other issues could have a material effect on
future  results of  operations,  The Hartford does not expect such changes would
have a material effect on its liquidity or financial condition.

15.   SEPARATE ACCOUNTS

The Hartford maintained  separate account assets and liabilities  totaling $50.5
billion and $36.8 billion at December 31, 1996 and 1995, respectively, which are
reported  at fair  value.  Separate  account  assets are  segregated  from other
investments and net investment  income and net realized capital gains and losses
accrue directly to the policyholder. Separate accounts reflect two categories of
risk assumption:  non-guaranteed  separate  accounts  totaling $39.9 billion and
$26.4  billion  at  December  31,  1996  and  1995,  respectively,  wherein  the
policyholder  assumes the  investment  risk, and  guaranteed  separate  accounts
totaling  $10.6  billion  and  $10.4  billion  at  December  31,  1996 and 1995,
respectively,  wherein The Hartford  contractually  guarantees  either a minimum
return or account  value to the  policyholder.  Included  in the  non-guaranteed
category  were policy loans  totaling  $2.0 billion and $1.7 billion at December
31, 1996 and 1995,  respectively.  Net investment income (including net realized
capital  gains and losses) and interest  credited to  policyholders  on separate
account  assets are not  reflected  in the  Consolidated  Statements  of Income.
Non-guaranteed separate accounts are not subject to claims that arise out of any
other business of The Hartford. Separate account management fees, net of minimum
guarantees, were $538, $387 and $256 in 1996, 1995 and 1994, respectively.

The guaranteed separate accounts include modified guaranteed  individual annuity
and modified  guaranteed life insurance.  The average credited  interest rate on
these  contracts  was 6.6% at December 31, 1996.  The assets that support  these
liabilities  were  comprised of $10.3  billion in bonds as of December 31, 1996.
The portfolios are segregated  from other  investments  and are managed so as to
minimize   liquidity   and  interest   rate  risk.   To  minimize  the  risk  of
disintermediation  associated  with early  withdrawals,  individual  annuity and
modified  guaranteed life insurance contracts carry a graded surrender charge as
well as a market value adjustment.  Additional investment risk is hedged using a
variety of  derivatives  which totaled $86 in carrying value and $2.4 billion in
notional amounts as of December 31, 1996.


16.   SUBSEQUENT EVENT

On February 10, 1997, HLI filed a registration statement with the Securities and
Exchange  Commission  relating to an initial public offering of up to 20% of HLI
common stock.  HLI is the holding  company parent of The Hartford's  significant
life insurance and related subsidiaries.  Management intends to use the proceeds
from  the  offering  to  reduce  certain  debt   outstanding,   to  fund  growth
initiatives,  and  for  other  general  corporate  purposes.  Management  of The
Hartford believes the offering will strengthen the Company's  financial position
and flexibility.  If and when the offering is completed,  The Hartford's current
intent is to continue to  beneficially  own at least 80% of HLI, but it is under
no contractual obligation to do so.

17.   BUSINESS SEGMENT INFORMATION

     Any  certificate  or opinion of an  officer  of the  Company  may be based,
insofar as it relates to legal  matters,  upon a  certificate  or opinion of, or
representations  by,  counsel,  unless such officer knows, or in the exercise of
reasonable care should know, that the certificate or opinion or  representations
with  respect to  matters  upon  which his  certificate  or opinion is based are
erroneous. Any such certificate or Opinion of Counsel may be




based,  insofar as it relates to factual matters,  upon a certificate or opinion
of, or  representations  by, an officer or officers of the Company  stating that
the information with respect to such factual matters is in the possession of the
Company, unless such counsel knows, or in the exercise of reasonable care should
know,  that the certificate or opinion or  representations  with respect to such
matters are erroneous.

     Where  any  Person  is  required  to  make,  give  or  execute  two or more
applications,  requests, consents,  certificates,  statements, opinions or other
instruments  under this Indenture,  they may, but need not, be consolidated  and
form one instrument.

      SECTION 104.  Acts of Holders
                    ---------------
     (a) Any request, demand, authorization,  direction, notice, consent, waiver
or other  action  provided by this  Indenture to be given to or taken by Holders
may be embodied in and  evidenced by one or more  instruments  of  substantially
similar tenor signed by such Holders in person or by an agent duly  appointed in
writing;  and, except as herein otherwise expressly provided,  such action shall
become  effective when such instrument or instruments is or are delivered to the
Trustee,  and,  where it is hereby  expressly  required,  to the  Company.  Such
instrument  or  instruments  (and the  action  embodied  therein  and  evidenced
thereby) are herein  sometimes  referred to as the "Act" of the Holders  signing
such instrument or instruments.  Proof of execution of any such instrument or of
a writing  appointing any such agent shall be sufficient for any purpose of this
Indenture  and (subject to Section 601)  conclusive  in favor of the Trustee and
the Company and any agent of the Trustee or the  Company,  if made in the manner
provided in this Section.

     (b) The fact and date of the execution by any Person of any such instrument
or writing may be proved by the  affidavit of a witness of such  execution or by
the certificate of any notary public or other officer  authorized by law to take
acknowledgments of deeds, certifying that the individual signing such instrument
or writing acknowledged to him the execution thereof. Where such execution is by
a Person  acting in other than his  individual  capacity,  such  certificate  or
affidavit shall also constitute sufficient proof of his authority.



     (c) The fact and date of the execution by any Person of any such instrument
or writing,  or the  authority  of the Person  executing  the same,  may also be
proved in any other manner which the Trustee deems  sufficient and in accordance
with such reasonable rules as the Trustee may determine.

     (d)  The ownership of Securities shall be proved by the Securities
Register.

     (e) Any request, demand, authorization,  direction, notice, consent, waiver
or other action by the Holder of any Security  shall bind every future Holder of
the same  Security  and the Holder of every  Security  issued upon the  transfer
thereof or in exchange  therefor or in lieu thereof in respect of anything  done
or  suffered  to be done by the  Trustee  or the  Company in  reliance  thereon,
whether or not notation of such action is made upon such Security.

     (f) The Company may,  but shall not be obligated  to, fix a record date for
the purpose of  determining  the Holders  entitled to take any action under this
Indenture by vote or consent.  Except as otherwise provided herein,  such record
date  shall be the  later of 30 days  prior to the  first  solicitation  of such
consent or vote or the date of the most recent list of Securityholders furnished
to the Trustee pursuant to Section 701 prior to such  solicitation.  If a record
date is fixed,  those persons who were  Securityholders  at such record date (or
their duly  designated  proxies),  and only those persons,  shall be entitled to
take such action by vote or consent or to revoke any vote or consent  previously
given,  whether or not such  persons  continue  to be Holders  after such record
date, provided, however, that unless such vote or consent is obtained from the
      --------  -------
Holders (or their duly designated  proxies) of the requisite principal amount of
Outstanding  Securities  prior to the date  which is the 120th  day  after  such
record date, any such vote or consent  previously given shall  automatically and
without further action by any Holder be canceled and of no further effect.

      SECTION 105.  Notices, Etc. to Trustee and Company.
                    ------------------------------------

     Any request, demand,  authorization,  direction, notice, consent, waiver or
Act of Holders or other  document  provided or permitted by this Indenture to be
made upon, given or furnished to, or filed with,



     (1) the Trustee by any Holder or by the  Company  shall be  sufficient  for
every purpose hereunder if made, given, furnished or filed in writing to or with
the Trustee at its Corporate Trust office, or

     (2) the Company by the  Trustee or by any Holder  shall be  sufficient  for
every purpose (except as otherwise  provided in Section 501 hereof) hereunder if
in writing and mailed, first class, postage prepaid, to the Company addressed to
it at the address of its principal  office  specified in the first  paragraph of
this instrument or at any other address  previously  furnished in writing to the
Trustee by the Company.

      SECTION 106.  Notice to Holders; Waiver.
                    -------------------------

     Where this  Indenture  provides  for  notice to Holders of any event,  such
notice shall be sufficiently given (unless otherwise herein expressly  provided)
if in writing and mailed,  first class postage prepaid,  to each Holder affected
by such event,  at the  address of such  Holder as it appears in the  Securities
Register,  not later than the latest  date,  and not earlier  than the  earliest
date,  prescribed  for the giving of such  notice.  In any case where  notice to
Holders  is given by mail,  neither  the  failure to mail such  notice,  nor any
defect in any  notice so  mailed,  to any  particular  Holder  shall  affect the
sufficiency of such notice with respect to other  Holders.  Where this Indenture
provides  for notice in any manner,  such notice may be waived in writing by the
Person  entitled to receive such notice,  either before or after the event,  and
such waiver shall be the equivalent of such notice. Waivers of notice by Holders
shall be filed  with the  Trustee,  but such  filing  shall  not be a  condition
precedent to the validity of any action taken in reliance upon such waiver.

      SECTION 107.  Conflict With Trust Indenture Act.
                    ---------------------------------

     If any provision of this Indenture limits,  qualifies or conflicts with the
duties imposed by any of Sections 310 to 317, inclusive,  of the Trust Indenture
Act through  operation of Section  318(c)  thereof,  such  imposed  duties shall
control.



     SECTION 108. Effect of Headings and Table of Contents.
                  ----------------------------------------

     The Article and Section  headings  herein and the Table of Contents are for
convenience only and shall not affect the construction hereof.

     SECTION 109. Successors and Assigns.
                  ----------------------

     All  covenants and  agreements in this  Indenture by the Company shall bind
its successors and assigns, whether so expressed or not.

     SECTION 110.  Separability Clause.
                   -------------------

     In case any  provision  in this  Indenture  or in the  Securities  shall be
invalid, illegal or unenforceable,  the validity, legality and enforceability of
the remaining provisions shall not in any way be affected or impaired thereby.

      SECTION 111. Benefits of Indenture.
                   ---------------------

     Nothing in this Indenture or in the Securities,  express or implied,  shall
give to any Person,  other than the parties  hereto,  any Paying Agent and their
successors  and assigns and the  Holders of the  Securities,  any benefit or any
legal or equitable right, remedy or claim under this Indenture.

      SECTION 112. Governing Law.

     This  Indenture  and the  Securities  shall be governed by and construed in
accordance with the laws of the State of New York.

      SECTION 113. Non-Business Days.
                   -----------------

     In any case  where any  Interest  Payment  Date or Stated  Maturity  of any
Security shall not be a Business Day, then  (notwithstanding any other provision
of this Indenture or the  Securities)  payment of interest or principal need not
be made on such date, but may be made on the next succeeding Business Day and no
interest  shall accrue for the period from and after such Interest  Payment Date
or Stated Maturity,  as the case may be, until the next succeeding Business Day,
in each case with the same force and effect as if made on the  Interest  Payment
Date or at the Stated Maturity, except that, if such Business Day is in the next



succeeding  calendar  year,  such  payment  shall  be  made  on the  immediately
preceding Business Day.

officers  executing  such  securities,  as evidenced  by their  execution of the
Securities.  If the form of  Securities of any series is  established  by action
taken pursuant to a Board  Resolution,  a copy of an appropriate  record of such

Order  contemplated  by  Section  303 with  respect  to the  authentication  and

          ITT HARTFORD GROUP,  INC., a corporation  organized and existing under
the laws of Delaware (hereinafter called the "Company",  which term includes any
successor  corporation under the Indenture  hereinafter  referred to), for value
received, hereby promises to pay to _______________,  or registered assigns, the
principal  sum  of  __________________  Dollars  on  ________________________,[;
provided that the Company may (i) change the maturity date upon the occurrence
                               -
of an exchange of the  Securities  for the Trust  Securities  subject to certain
conditions  set forth in Section 314 of the  Indenture,  which changed  maturity
date shall in no case be earlier than , or later than , and (ii) extend
                                                                      --
the maturity date subject to certain conditions specified in Section 314 of the
Indenture, which extended maturity date

date (each such date,  an "Interest  Payment  Date") on which  interest has been
paid or duly provided for, [monthly] [quarterly] [semi-annually] [if applicable,
insert-(subject  to  deferral  as set  forth  herein)]  in  arrears  on  [insert
applicable Interest Payment Dates] of each year,  commencing ______, ___, at the
rate of ___% per annum,  until the  principal  hereof  shall have become due and
payable, [if applicable,  insert- plus Additional  Interest,  if any,] until the
principal  hereof is paid or duly provided for or made available for payment [if
applicable, insert- and on any overdue principal and (without duplication and to
the extent that payment of such interest is enforceable under applicable law) on
any overdue  installment  of interest at the rate of ___% per annum,  compounded
[monthly] [quarterly] [annually].  The amount of interest payable for any period
will be computed on the basis of twelve 30-day  months and a 360-day  year.  The
amount of interest payable for any partial period shall be computed on the basis
of the number of days elapsed in a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months.  In the
event  that any date on which  interest  is payable  on this  Security  is not a
Business Day,  then a payment of the interest  payable on such date will be made
on the next  succeeding day which is a Business Day (and without any interest or
other  payment in respect of any such delay),  except that, if such Business Day
is in the next  succeeding  calendar  year,  such  payment  shall be made on the
immediately  preceding Business Day, in each case with the same force and effect
as if made on the date the payment was originally payable. A "Business Day"

shall mean any day other than a day on which banking institutions in the City of
New York are  authorized or required by law or executive  order to remain closed
or a day on which the  Corporate  Trust  Office of the Trustee  [if  applicable,

Agreement  hereinafter  referred  to for  Hartford  Capital  __,] is closed  for
business.  The interest  installment  so payable,  and  punctually  paid or duly
provided for, on any Interest  Payment Date will, as provided in the  Indenture,
be paid to the Person in whose name this  Security  (or one or more  Predecessor
Securities,  as defined in the Indenture) is registered at the close of business
on the Regular  Record Date for such  interest  installment,  which shall be the
[[insert  Regular  Record  Dates]  (whether  or not a Business  Day)]  [close of
business on the Business Day] next  preceding  such Interest  Payment Date.  Any
such  interest  installment  not so  punctually  paid or duly provided for shall
forthwith cease to be payable to the Holder on



such Regular Record Date and may either be paid to the Person in whose name this
Security (or one or more  Predecessor  Securities) is registered at the close of
business on a Special Record Date for the payment of such Defaulted  Interest to
be fixed by the Trustee,  notice whereof shall be given to Holders of Securities
of this series not less than 10 days prior to such Special  Record  Date,  or be
paid  at any  time  in  any  other  lawful  manner  not  inconsistent  with  the
requirements  of any securities  exchange on which the Securities of this series

any rights pursuant to the Company's Rights Plan, or any successor to such
Rights Plan, and the declaration of a dividend of such rights in the future, and
(c) payments under any Hartford Guarantee (as defined in the Indenture)). Prior
 -
to the termination of any such Extension Period,  the Company may further extend
the interest payment period, provided that such Extension Period together with
                             --------
all such previous and further  extensions of such  Extension  Period,  shall not
exceed __ consecutive  [months] [quarters] or extend beyond the Maturity of this
Security. Upon the termination of any such Extension Period and upon the payment
of all accrued and unpaid  interest and any  Additional  Interest  then due, the
Company may select a new Extension Period, subject to the above requirements. No
interest shall be due and



payable during an Extension Period except at the end thereof.  The Company shall
give the Holder of this  Security and the Trustee  notice of its selection of an
Extension  Period at least one Business  Day prior to the Interest  Payment Date
[if applicable, insert- the earlier of (i) the date the Distributions on the
                                        -
Preferred Securities are payable or (ii) the date the Administrative Trustees

are required to give notice to the New York Stock  Exchange or other  applicable
self-regulatory  organization or to holders of such Preferred  Securities of the
record date or the date such  Distributions  are  payable,  but in any event not
less than one Business Day prior to such record date.

Security will be made at the office or agency of the Company maintained for that
purpose in the United  States,  in such coin or currency of the United States of
America  as at the time of payment  is legal  tender  for  payment of public and
private debts [if applicable, insert-; provided, however, that at the option of
                                       --------  -------
the Company payment of interest may be made (i) by check mailed to the address

of the Person  entitled  thereto as such address shall appear in the  Securities
Register or (ii) by wire transfer in immediately available funds at such place
             --
and to such account as may be designated by the Person entitled thereto as
specified in the Securities Register].

          The indebtedness evidenced by this Security is, to the extent provided
in the  Indenture,  subordinate  and  subject in right of  payments to the prior
payment in full of all Senior Debt,  and this Security is issued  subject to the
provisions of the Indenture with respect thereto.  Each Holder of this Security,
by accepting the same, (a) agrees to and shall be bound by such provisions, (b)
                        -                                                    -

appoints the Trustee his  attorney-in-fact  for any and all such purposes.  Each
Holder hereof, by his acceptance hereof,  waives all notice of the acceptance of
the  subordination  provisions  contained  herein and in the  Indenture  by each
holder of Senior Debt, whether now outstanding or hereafter incurred, and waives
reliance by each such holder upon said provisions.

          Reference is hereby made to the further  provisions  of this  Security
set forth on the reverse hereof, which further provisions shall for all purposes
have the same effect as if set forth at this place.



          Unless the certificate of  authentication  hereon has been executed by
the Trustee referred to on the reverse hereof by manual signature, this Security
shall  not be  entitled  to any  benefit  under  the  Indenture  or be  valid or

manual or facsimile.

       Securities bearing the manual or facsimile  signatures of individuals who
were at any time the proper  officers  of the  Company  shall bind the  Company,
notwithstanding  that such  individuals  or any of them have ceased to hold such
offices prior to the  authentication  and delivery of such Securities or did not
hold such offices at the date of such  Securities.  At any time and from time to
time after the execution and delivery of this Indenture, the Company may deliver
Securities executed by the Company to the Trustee for authentication. Securities
may be  authenticated  on  original  issuance  from  time to time and  delivered
pursuant to such procedures  acceptable to the Trustee  ("Procedures") as may be

Indenture; (ii) the terms of such Securities have been duly authorized and
            --
determined in conformity  with the  provisions  of this  Indenture,  or, if such
terms are to be determined pursuant to Procedures, when so determined such terms

the Board of  Directors  and sold in the  manner  specified  in such  opinion of
Counsel,  will be the  legal,  valid  and  binding  obligations  of the  Company
entitled to the benefits of this  Indenture,  subject to applicable  bankruptcy,
reorganization,  insolvency  and similar  laws  generally  affecting  creditors'
rights,  to general equitable  principles  except as enforcement  thereof may be
limited by (A) requirements that a claim with respect to any Securities
            -
denominated  other than in  Dollars  (or a Foreign  Currency  or  currency  unit
judgment  in  respect  of such  claim) be  converted  into  Dollars at a rate of
exchange  prevailing  on a date  determined  pursuant to  applicable  law or (B)
governmental authority to limit, delay or prohibit                            -



the making of  payments  in Foreign  Currencies  or  currency  units or payments
outside  the United  States and  subject  to such other  qualifications  as such
counsel shall  conclude do not  materially  affect the rights of Holders of such
Securities;

provided, however, that the Trustee shall be entitled to receive the documents
- --------  -------
referred to in Clauses (b), (c) and (d) above only at or prior to the first
                        -    -       -
request of the Company to the Trustee to authenticate Securities of such series.

       Each Security shall be dated the date of its authentication.

       No Security  shall be entitled to any benefit under this  Indenture or be
valid or  obligatory  for any purpose,  unless there  appears on such Security a
certificate  of  authentication  substantially  in the form  provided for herein
executed  by  the  Trustee  by the  manual  signature  of one of its  authorized
officers,  and such certificate upon any Security shall be conclusive  evidence,
and the only  evidence,  that  such  Security  has been duly  authenticated  and
delivered hereunder.

        SECTION 304.    Temporary Securities.
                        --------------------

       Pending the  preparation  of  definitive  Securities  of any series,  the
Company may execute,  and upon Company Order the Trustee shall  authenticate and
deliver,  temporary  Securities  which are printed,  lithographed,  typewritten,
mimeographed or otherwise  produced,  in any denomination,  substantially of the
tenor of the  definitive  Securities  of such  series in lieu of which  they are
issued and with such appropriate insertions, omissions,  substitutions and other
variations as the officers executing such Securities may determine, as evidenced
by their execution of such Securities.

       If temporary  Securities of any series are issued, the Company will cause
definitive  Securities of such series to be prepared without unreasonable delay.
After the preparation of definitive  Securities,  the temporary Securities shall
be  exchangeable  for  definitive  Securities  upon  surrender of the  temporary
Securities  at the office or agency of the Company  designated  for that purpose
without charge to the Holder. Upon surrender for cancellation of any one or more
temporary   Securities,   the  Company  shall  execute  and  the  Trustee  shall
authenticate and deliver in



exchange  therefor a like principal amount of definitive  Securities of the same
series of  authorized  denominations  having  the same  Original  Issue Date and
Stated Maturity and having the same terms as such temporary Securities. Until so
exchanged,  the  temporary  Securities  shall in all respects be entitled to the
same benefits under this Indenture as definitive Securities.

        SECTION 305.    Registration, Transfer and Exchange.
                        -----------------------------------

       The Company shall cause to be kept at the  Corporate  Trust Office of the
Trustee a register in which,  subject to such  reasonable  regulations as it may
prescribe,  the Company shall provide for the  registration of Securities and of
transfers of Securities.  Such register is herein  sometimes  referred to as the
"Securities  Register." The Trustee is hereby appointed  "Securities  Registrar"
for the purpose of registering  Securities and transfers of Securities as herein
provided.

       Upon surrender for registration of transfer of any Security at the office
or agency of the Company  designated for that purpose the Company shall execute,
and the Trustee shall  authenticate  and deliver,  in the name of the designated
transferee or transferees,  one or more new Securities of the same series of any
authorized  denominations,  of a like aggregate  principal  amount,  of the same
original Issue Date and Stated Maturity and having the same terms.

       At the  option  of the  Holder,  Securities  may be  exchanged  for other
Securities  of the  same  series  of  any  authorized  denominations,  of a like
aggregate  principal amount, of the same Original Issue Date and Stated Maturity
and having the same terms,  upon  surrender of the Securities to be exchanged at
such office or agency.  Whenever any securities are so surrendered for exchange,
the Company shall execute,  and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver,  the
Securities which the Holder making the exchange is entitled to receive.

       All Securities  issued upon any transfer or exchange of Securities  shall
be the valid obligations of the Company,  evidencing the same debt, and entitled
to the same benefits under this Indenture,  as the Securities  surrendered  upon
such transfer or exchange.

       Every Security presented or surrendered for transfer or exchange shall
(if so required by the Company or



the  Securities  Registrar) be duly  endorsed,  or be  accompanied  by a written
instrument of transfer in form  satisfactory  to the Company and the  Securities
Registrar,  duly executed by the Holder thereof or his attorney duly  authorized
in writing.

       No service  charge shall be made to a Holder for any transfer or exchange
of Securities,  but the Company may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover
any tax or other governmental  charge that may be imposed in connection with any
transfer or exchange of Securities.

       Notwithstanding  any of the  foregoing,  any Global  Security of a series
shall be exchangeable  pursuant to this Section 305 for Securities registered in
the names of Persons other than the  Depositary for such Security or its nominee
only if (i) such Depositary notifies the Company that it is unwilling or unable
         -
to  continue  as  Depositary  for such  Global  Security  or if at any time such
Depositary  ceases to be a  clearing  agency  registered  under  the  Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, (ii) the Company executes and delivers to the
                                   --
Trustee a Company Order that such Global Security shall be so exchangeable or

(iii) there shall have occurred and be continuing an Event of Default with
- ----
respect  to  the  Securities  of  such  series.  Any  Global  Security  that  is
exchangeable  pursuant  to the  preceding  sentence  shall be  exchangeable  for
Securities registered in such names as such Depositary shall direct.

       Notwithstanding any other provision in this Indenture,  a Global Security
may not be transferred  except as a whole by the Depositary with respect to such
Global  Security  to a  nominee  of  such  Depositary  or by a  nominee  of such
Depositary to such Depositary or another nominee of such Depositary.

       Neither the Company nor the Trustee  shall be  required,  pursuant to the
provisions of this Section, (a) to issue, transfer or exchange any Security of
                             -
any series  during a period  beginning at the opening of business 15 days before
the day of selection for redemption of Securities pursuant to Article Eleven and
ending at the close of business on the day of mailing of notice of redemption or
(b) to transfer or exchange any Security so selected for redemption in whole
    -
or in part, except, in the case of any Security to be redeemed in part, any
portion thereof not to be redeemed.



       SECTION 306.   Mutilated, Destroyed, Lost and Stolen Securities.
                      ------------------------------------------------

       If any mutilated  Security is  surrendered  to the Trustee  together with
such  security or  indemnity as may be required by the Company or the Trustee to
save each of them  harmless,  the Company  shall  execute and the Trustee  shall
authenticate  and deliver in exchange  therefor a new Security of the same issue
and series of like tenor and principal  amount,  having the same Original  Issue
Date and Stated  Maturity and bearing the same Interest  Rate as such  mutilated
Security, and bearing a number not contemporaneously outstanding.

       If there shall be delivered to the Company and to the Trustee (i)
                                                                      -
evidence  to  their  satisfaction  of the  destruction,  loss  or  theft  of any
Security, and (ii) such security or indemnity as may be required by them to save
               --
each of them  harmless,  then,  in the  absence of notice to the  Company or the
Trustee  that such  Security  has been  acquired by a bona fide  purchaser,  the
issuing   Company   shall  execute  and  upon  its  request  the  Trustee  shall
authenticate  and  deliver,  in  lieu of any  such  destroyed,  lost  or  stolen
Security,  a new  Security  of the same  issue  and  series  of like  tenor  and
principal  amount,  having the same Original Issue Date and Stated  Maturity and
bearing the same Interest Rate as such destroyed,  lost or stolen Security,  and
bearing a number not contemporaneously outstanding.

       In case any such mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Security has become
or is about to become  due and  payable,  the  Company  in its  discretion  may,
instead of issuing a new Security, pay such Security.

       Upon the issuance of any new Security under this Section, the Company may
require the payment of a sum  sufficient to cover any tax or other  governmental
charge that may be imposed in relation thereto and any other expenses (including
the fees and expenses of the Trustee) connected therewith.

       Every  new  Security  issued  pursuant  to  this  Section  in lieu of any
destroyed,  lost or stolen  Security  shall  constitute  an original  additional
contractual  obligation of the Company,  whether or not the  destroyed,  lost or
stolen  Security  shall be at any  time  enforceable  by  anyone,  and  shall be
entitled to all the benefits of this Indenture equally and proportionately  with
any and all other Securities duly issued hereunder.



       The  provisions of this Section are exclusive and shall  preclude (to the
extent lawful) all other rights and remedies with respect to the  replacement or
payment of mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Securities.

        SECTION 307.   Payment of Interest; Interest Rights Preserved.
                       ----------------------------------------------

       Interest  on  any  Security  of  any  series  which  is  payable,  and is
punctually  paid or duly  provided for, on any Interest  Payment Date,  shall be
paid to the  Person in whose  name  that  Security  (or one or more  Predecessor
Securities)  is registered  at the close of business on the Regular  Record Date
for such interest in respect of Securities of such series,  except that,  unless
otherwise  provided in the  Securities of such series,  interest  payable on the
Stated  Maturity of a Security  shall be paid to the Person to whom principal is
paid.  The initial  payment of interest on any  Security of any series  which is
issued between a Regular Record Date and the related Interest Payment Date shall
be payable as provided in such Security or in the Board  Resolution  pursuant to
Section 301 with respect to the related series of Securities.

       Any interest on any Security which is payable,  but is not timely paid or
duly  provided for, on any Interest  Payment Date for  Securities of such series
(herein called "Defaulted Interest"), shall forthwith cease to be payable to the
registered  Holder on the relevant  Regular Record Date by virtue of having been
such Holder,  and such  Defaulted  Interest  may be paid by the Company,  at its
election in each case, as provided in Clause (1) or (2) below:

  (1) The Company  may elect to make  payment of any  Defaulted  Interest to the
Persons  in whose  names  the  Securities  of such  series in  respect  of which
interest  is  in  default  (or  their  respective  Predecessor  Securities)  are
registered at the close of business on a Special  Record Date for the payment of
such  Defaulted  Interest,  which shall be fixed in the  following  manner.  The
Company shall notify the Trustee in writing of the amount of Defaulted  Interest
proposed to be paid on each Security and the date of the proposed  payment,  and
at the same time the Company  shall  deposit with the Trustee an amount of money
equal to the aggregate  amount  proposed to be paid in respect of such Defaulted
Interest or shall make arrangements satisfactory to the Trustee for such deposit
prior to the date of the proposed payment, such money when deposited to be held



in trust for the benefit of the Persons  entitled to such Defaulted  Interest as
in this Clause  provided.  Thereupon the Trustee shall fix a Special Record Date
for the payment of such Defaulted  Interest which shall be not more than 15 days
and not less than 10 days prior to the date of the proposed payment and not less
than 10 days  after the  receipt by the  Trustee  of the notice of the  proposed
payment.  The Trustee shall  promptly  notify the Company of such Special Record
Date and, in the name and at the expense of the  Company,  shall cause notice of
the proposed  payment of such  Defaulted  Interest  and the Special  Record Date
therefor  to be  mailed,  first  class,  postage  prepaid,  to each  Holder of a
Security  of such  series at the  address  of such  Holder as it  appears in the
Securities Register not less than 10 days prior to such Special Record Date. The
Trustee may, in its  discretion,  in the name and at the expense of the Company,
cause a similar notice to be published at least once in a newspaper, customarily
published  in  the  English  language  on  each  Business  Day  and  of  general
circulation  in the  Borough  of  Manhattan,  The  City of New  York,  but  such
publication  shall not be a condition  precedent  to the  establishment  of such
Special Record Date.  Notice of the proposed payment of such Defaulted  Interest
and the Special  Record Date  therefor  having  been mailed as  aforesaid,  such
Defaulted Interest shall be paid to the Persons in whose names the Securities of
such series (or their respective Predecessor  Securities) are registered on such
Special  Record Date and shall no longer be payable  pursuant  to the  following
Clause (2).

  (2) The Company may make payment of any Defaulted Interest in any other lawful
manner not  inconsistent  with the  requirements  of any securities  exchange on
which the  Securities  of the series in respect of which  interest is in default
may be listed and,  upon such notice as may be required by such  exchange (or by
the Trustee if the  Securities  are not  listed),  if, after notice given by the
Company to the Trustee of the proposed  payment  pursuant to this  Clause,  such
payment shall be deemed practicable by the Trustee.

       Subject  to the  foregoing  provisions  of this  Section,  each  Security
delivered under this Indenture upon transfer of or in exchange for or in lieu of
any other Security shall carry the rights to interest accrued and unpaid, and to
accrue, which were carried by such other Security.

manner whatsoever, and all Securities so delivered shall be promptly canceled by
the Trustee.  No Securities shall be authenticated in lieu of or in exchange for
any  Securities  canceled  as  provided  in this  Section,  except as  expressly
permitted by this Indenture.  All canceled  Securities shall be destroyed by the
Trustee  and the Trustee  shall  deliver to the  Company a  certificate  of such

    Federal or State  bankruptcy,  insolvency,  reorganization  or other similar
    law,  or the  consent  by it to the  filing of any such  petition  or to the
    appointment of a receiver,  liquidator,  assignee, trustee, sequestrator (or
    other  similar  official) of the Company or of any  substantial  part of its
    property, or the making by it of an assignment for the benefit of creditors,
    or the  admission  by it in  writing  of its  inability  to  pay  its  debts
    generally  as they  become  due  and its  willingness  to be  adjudicated  a
    bankrupt, or the taking of corporate action by the Company in furtherance of
    any such action; or

       (6)  any other Event of Default with respect to Securities of that
    series.

       SECTION 502.   Acceleration of Maturity; Rescission and Annulment.
                      --------------------------------------------------

       If an Event of Default  with respect to  Securities  of any series at the
time  Outstanding  occurs  and is  continuing,  then and in every  such case the
Trustee  or the  Holders  of  not  less  than  25% in  principal  amount  of the
Outstanding  Securities of that series may declare the principal  amount (or, if
the  Securities  of that series are Original  Issue  Discount  Securities,  such
portion of the principal amount as may be specified in the terms of that series)
of all the  Securities  of that series to be due and payable  immediately,  by a
notice in  writing to the  Company  (and to the  Trustee  if given by  Holders),
provided that, in the case of the Securities of a series issued to a Hartford
- --------
Trust, if upon an Event of Default,  the Trustee or the Holders of not less than
25% in principal  amount of the  Outstanding  Securities  of that series fail to
declare the principal of all the Securities of that series to be immediately due
and payable, the holders of at least 25% in aggregate  liquidation amount of the
corresponding  series of Preferred  Securities then outstanding  shall have such
right



by a  notice  in  writing  to the  Company  and the  Trustee;  and upon any such
declaration  such  principal  amount (or  specified  amount) of and the  accrued
interest  (including  any  Additional  Interest) on all the  Securities  of such
series shall become immediately due and payable, provided that the payment of
                                                 --------
principal and interest  (including any Additional  Interest) on such  Securities
shall remain subordinated to the extent provided in Article Thirteen.

       At any time after such a  declaration  of  acceleration  with  respect to
Securities  of any  series  has been made and  before a  judgment  or decree for
payment of the money due has been obtained by the Trustee as hereinafter in this
Article  provided,  the  Holders  of a  majority  in  principal  amount  of  the
Outstanding  Securities of that series, by written notice to the Company and the
Trustee, may rescind and annul such declaration and its consequences if:

       (1)  the Company has paid or deposited with the Trustee a sum sufficient
to pay

       (A)  all overdue installments of interest (including any Additional
Interest) on all Securities of that series,

       (B) the  principal of (and  premium,  if any, on) any  Securities of that
series which have become due otherwise than by such  declaration of acceleration
and interest thereon at the rate borne by the Securities,

       (C) to the extent that payment of such interest is lawful,  interest upon
overdue installments of interest at the rate borne by the Securities, and

       (D) all sums paid or advanced by the Trustee hereunder and the reasonable
compensation,  expenses,  disbursements and advances of the Trustee,  its agents
and counsel; and

       (2) all Events of Default  with  respect to  Securities  of that  series,
other than the  non-payment  of the principal of Securities of that series which
has  become  due  solely  by such  acceleration,  have  been  cured or waived as
provided in Section 513.

       No such  rescission  shall  affect any  subsequent  default or impair any
right consequent thereon.



    Upon  receipt  by  the  Trustee  of  written   notice   declaring   such  an
acceleration, or rescission and annulment thereof, with respect to Securities of
a series all or part of which is represented by a Global Security, a record date
shall be established for determining  Holders of Outstanding  Securities of such
series entitled to join in such notice,  which record date shall be at the close
of business on the day the Trustee  receives  such  notice.  The Holders on such
record date, or their duly designated proxies,  and only such Persons,  shall be
entitled to join in such  notice,  whether or not such  Holders  remain  Holders
after such record date; provided, that, unless such declaration of acceleration,
                        --------
or rescission and annulment,  as the case may be, shall have become effective by
virtue of the requisite percentage having joined in such notice prior to the day
which  is 90 days  after  such  record  date,  such  notice  of  declaration  of
acceleration,   or  rescission  and  annulment,   as  the  case  may  be,  shall
automatically  and without  further  action by any Holder be canceled  and of no
further effect.  Nothing in this paragraph shall prevent a Holder, or a proxy of
a Holder,  from giving,  after  expiration of such 90-day period,  a new written
notice of declaration of acceleration,  or rescission and annulment thereof,  as
the case may be, that is identical to a written  notice which has been  canceled
pursuant to the proviso to the preceding sentence, in which event a new record
                -------
date shall be established pursuant to the provisions of this Section 502.

        SECTION 503. Collection of Indebtedness and Suits for Enforcement by
                     -------------------------------------------------------
                     Trustee.
                     -------

        The Company covenants that if:

        (1)  default  is made in the  payment  of any  installment  of  interest
   (including  any  Additional  Interest)  on any  Security  when such  interest
   becomes due and payable and such default  continues  for a period of 30 days,
   or

        (2)  default is made in the payment of the principal of (and premium,
   if any, on) any Security at the Maturity thereof,

the Company will, upon demand of the Trustee,  pay to it, for the benefit of the
Holders  of such  Securities,  the whole  amount  then due and  payable  on such
Securities  for  principal,  including  any sinking  fund  payment or  analogous
obligations  (and  premium,  if any)  and  interest  (including  any  Additional
Interest), including, to the extent that



payment of such interest shall be lawful, interest on any overdue principal (and
premium if any) and on any  overdue  installments  of  interest  (including  any
Additional  Interest)  at the rate borne by the  Securities;  and,  in  addition
thereto, all amounts owing the Trustee under Section 607.

       If the Company fails to pay such amounts forthwith upon such demand,  the
Trustee,  in its own name and as trustee of an express  trust,  may  institute a
judicial  proceeding for the  collection of the sums so due and unpaid,  and may
prosecute such proceeding to judgment or final decree,  and may enforce the same
against the Company or any other  obligor  upon the  Securities  and collect the
moneys  adjudged  or decreed to be payable in the manner  provided by law out of
the property of the Company or any other obligor upon the  Securities,  wherever
situated.

       If an Event of Default with respect to  Securities  of any series  occurs
and is  continuing,  the  Trustee may in its  discretion  proceed to protect and
enforce its rights and the rights of the Holders of Securities of such series by
such appropriate  judicial  proceedings as the Trustee shall deem most effectual
to protect and enforce any such rights,  whether for the specific enforcement of
any  covenant or  agreement  in this  Indenture or in aid of the exercise of any
power granted herein, or to enforce any other proper remedy.

        SECTION 504.   Trustee May File Proofs of Claim.
                       --------------------------------

        In case of the pendency of any  receivership,  insolvency,  liquidation,
bankruptcy,  reorganization,   arrangement,  adjustment,  composition  or  other
judicial  proceeding  relative  to the  Company  or any other  obligor  upon the
Securities  or the  property  of the  Company or of such other  obligor or their
creditors,

        (a) the Trustee (irrespective of whether the principal of the Securities
   of any series  shall  then be due and  payable  as  therein  expressed  or by
   declaration or otherwise and  irrespective  of whether the Trustee shall have
   made any demand on the  Company  for the  payment of overdue  principal  (and
   premium,  if any) or interest  (including any Additional  Interest)) shall be
   entitled and empowered, by intervention in such proceeding or otherwise,

                (i) to file and prove a claim for the whole  amount of principal
        (and premium, if any) and interest  (including any Additional  Interest)
        owing



        and unpaid in respect to the Securities and to file such other papers or
        documents  as may be  necessary  or  advisable  and to take  any and all
        actions as are authorized under the Trust Indenture Act in order to have
        the claims of the  Holders  and any  predecessor  to the  Trustee  under
        Section 607 and of the Holders allowed in any such judicial proceedings;
        and

                (ii) and in  particular,  the  Trustee  shall be  authorized  to
        collect and receive any moneys or other property  payable or deliverable
        on any such claims and to distribute the same in accordance with Section
        506; and

        (b) any custodian, receiver, assignee, trustee, liquidator, sequestrator
   (or  other  similar  official)  in any such  judicial  proceeding  is  hereby
   authorized  by  each  Holder  to  make  such  payments  to  the  Trustee  for
   distribution  in  accordance  with  Section  506,  and in the event  that the
   Trustee shall consent to the making of such payments directly to the Holders,
   to pay to the Trustee any amount due to it and any predecessor  Trustee under
   Section 607.

        Nothing  herein  contained  shall be deemed to authorize  the Trustee to
authorize  or  consent to or accept or adopt on behalf of any Holder any plan of
reorganization,  arrangement, adjustment or composition affecting the Securities
or the rights of any Holder  thereof,  or to  authorize  the  Trustee to vote in
respect of the claim of any Holder in any such proceeding.

       SECTION 505.    Trustee May Enforce Claim Without Possession of
                       -----------------------------------------------
                       Securities.
                       ----------

       All rights of action and claims under this  Indenture  or the  Securities
may be prosecuted  and enforced by the Trustee  without the possession of any of
the Securities or the production thereof in any proceeding relating thereto, and
any such  proceeding  instituted by the Trustee shall be brought in its own name
as trustee of an express  trust,  and any  recovery  of  judgment  shall,  after
provision  for  the  payment  of all  the  amounts  owing  the  Trustee  and any
predecessor  Trustee  under  Section  607,  its agents and  counsel,  be for the
ratable  benefit  of the  Holders  of the  Securities  in  respect of which such
judgment has been recovered.



        SECTION 506.   Application of Money Collected.
                       ------------------------------

       Any money or  property  collected  or to be applied by the  Trustee  with
respect to a series of  Securities  pursuant to this Article shall be applied in
the following  order,  at the date or dates fixed by the Trustee and, in case of
the  distribution of such money or property on account of principal (or premium,
if any) or interest  (including any Additional  Interest),  upon presentation of
the  Securities  and the notation  thereon of the payment if only partially paid
and upon surrender thereof if fully paid:

       FIRST:  To the payment of all amounts due the Trustee and any predecessor
Trustee under Section 607;

       SECOND:  To the  payment of the  amounts  then due and  unpaid  upon such
series of Securities for principal (and premium, if any) and interest (including
any Additional  Interest),  in respect of which or for the benefit of which such
money has been collected,  ratably,  without preference or priority of any kind,
according  to the  amounts  due and  payable on such  series of  Securities  for
principal  (and  premium,   if  any)  and  interest  (including  any  Additional
Interest), respectively; and

       THIRD:  The balance, if any, to the Person or Persons entitled thereto.

       SECTION 507.     Limitation on Suits.
                        -------------------

       No  Holder  of any  Securities  of any  series  shall  have any  right to
institute any proceeding,  judicial or otherwise, with respect to this Indenture
or  for  the  appointment  of  a  receiver,   assignee,   trustee,   liquidator,
sequestrator  (or other  similar  official) or for any other  remedy  hereunder,
unless:

       (1) such Holder has  previously  given written notice to the Trustee of a
   continuing Event of Default with respect to the Securities of that series;

       (2)  the  Holders  of not  less  than  25%  in  principal  amount  of the
   Outstanding  Securities of that series shall have made written request to the
   Trustee to institute  proceedings  in respect of such Event of Default in its
   own name as Trustee hereunder;



       (3) such  Holder  or  Holders  have  offered  to the  Trustee  reasonable
   indemnity  against  the costs,  expenses  and  liabilities  to be incurred in
   compliance with such request;

       (4) the Trustee for 60 days after its receipt of such notice, request and
   offer of indemnity has failed to institute any such proceeding; and

       (5) no direction inconsistent with such written request has been given to
   the  Trustee  during  such  60-day  period by the  Holders of a  majority  in
   principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of that series;

it being  understood and intended that no one or more of such Holders shall have
any right in any manner  whatever by virtue of, or by availing of, any provision
of this  Indenture  to  affect,  disturb  or  prejudice  the rights of any other
Holders of Securities,  or to obtain or to seek to obtain priority or preference
over any other of such  Holders or to enforce  any right  under this  Indenture,
except in the manner  herein  provided and for the equal and ratable  benefit of
all such Holders.

       SECTION 508.    Unconditional Right of Holders to Receive Principal,
                       ----------------------------------------------------
                       Premium and Interest.
                       --------------------

       Notwithstanding any other provision in this Indenture,  the Holder of any
Security  shall have the right which is absolute  and  unconditional  to receive
payment of the principal of (and  premium,  if any) and (subject to Section 307)
interest (including any Additional  Interest) on such Security on the respective
Stated  Maturities  expressed in such  Security  and to  institute  suit for the
enforcement  of any such payment,  and such right shall not be impaired  without
the consent of such Holder.  In the case of  Securities  of a series issued to a
Hartford Trust, any holder of the corresponding  series of Preferred  Securities
shall have the right upon the  occurrence  of an Event of Default  described  in
Section  501(1) or 501(2)  hereof,  to  institute  a suit  directly  against the
Company for  enforcement of payment to such Holder of principal of (premium,  if
any) and (subject to Section 307) interest  (including any Additional  Interest)
on the Securities  having a principal amount equal to the aggregate  liquidation
preference of the Preferred  Securities of the corresponding series held by such
Holder.



        SECTION 509.   Restoration of Rights and Remedies.
                       ----------------------------------

       If the Trustee or any Holder has instituted any proceeding to enforce any
right or remedy under this Indenture and such  proceeding has been  discontinued
or abandoned for any reason, or has been determined  adversely to the Trustee or
to such  Holder,  then and in every such case the  Company,  the Trustee and the
Holders shall,  subject to any  determination  in such  proceeding,  be restored
severally and respectively to their former positions  hereunder,  and thereafter
all rights and remedies of the Trustee and the Holders shall  continue as though
no such proceeding had been instituted.

        SECTION 510.   Rights and Remedies Cumulative.
                       ------------------------------

       Except as  otherwise  provided in the last  paragraph  of Section 306, no
right or remedy  herein  conferred  upon or  reserved  to the  Trustee or to the
Holders is intended  to be  exclusive  of any other  right or remedy,  and every
right and remedy shall,  to the extent  permitted by law, be  cumulative  and in
addition to every other right and remedy  given  hereunder  or now or  hereafter
existing at law or in equity or  otherwise.  The  assertion or employment of any
right or remedy  hereunder,  or  otherwise,  shall not  prevent  the  concurrent
assertion or employment of any other appropriate right or remedy.

        SECTION 511.   Delay or Omission Not Waiver.
                       ----------------------------

       Except as  otherwise  provided in the last  paragraph  of Section 306, no
delay or omission  of the  Trustee or of any Holder of any  Security to exercise
any right or remedy  accruing  upon any Event of Default  shall  impair any such
right or  remedy  or  constitute  a waiver of any such  Event of  Default  or an
acquiescence therein.

       Every right and remedy  given by this Article or by law to the Trustee or
to the Holders may be exercised from time to time, and as often as may be deemed
expedient, by the Trustee or by the Holders, as the case may be.

        SECTION 512.   Control by Holders.
                       ------------------

       The  Holders  of a  majority  in  principal  amount  of  the  Outstanding
Securities  of any series  shall  have the right to direct the time,  method and
place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Trustee or



exercising  any trust or power  conferred  on the  Trustee,  with respect to the
Securities of such series, provided that:
                           --------

       (1)  such direction shall not be in conflict with any rule of law or
   with this Indenture,

       (2)  the Trustee may take any other action deemed proper by the Trustee
   which is not inconsistent with such direction, and

       (3) subject to the  provisions of Section 601, the Trustee shall have the
   right to decline to follow such direction if the Trustee in good faith shall,
   by a  Responsible  Officer or Officers  of the  Trustee,  determine  that the
   proceeding  so  directed  would be  unjustly  prejudicial  to the Holders not
   joining in any such  direction  or would  involve  the  Trustee  in  personal
   liability.

       Upon  receipt by the Trustee of any written  notice  directing  the time,
method or place of conducting  any such  proceeding or exercising any such trust
or  power,  with  respect  to  Securities  of a  series  all or part of which is
represented  by a Global  Security,  a record  date  shall  be  established  for
determining Holders of Outstanding Securities of such series entitled to join in
such notice,  which record date shall be at the close of business on the day the
Trustee  receives  such notice.  The Holders on such record date,  or their duly
designated  proxies,  and only such  Persons,  shall be entitled to join in such
notice,  whether or not such  Holders  remain  Holders  after such record  date;
provided, that, unless the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the
- --------
Outstanding  Securities of such series shall have joined in such notice prior to
the day which is 90 days after such record date, such notice shall automatically
and without  further action by any Holder be canceled and of no further  effect.
Nothing in this paragraph shall prevent a Holder,  or a proxy of a Holder,  from
giving,  after  expiration of such 90-day  period,  a new notice  identical to a
notice which has been canceled pursuant to the proviso to the preceding
                                               -------
sentence,  in which event a new record date shall be established pursuant to the
provisions of this Section 512.

        SECTION 513.   Waiver of Past Defaults.
                       -----------------------

       The  Holders  of not less  than a  majority  in  principal  amount of the
Outstanding  Securities  of any series  may on behalf of the  Holders of all the
Securities of such



series  waive any past  default  hereunder  with  respect to such series and its
consequences, except a default:

       (1)  in the payment of the principal of (or premium, if any) or interest
   (including any Additional Interest) on any Security of such series, or

       (2) in respect of a covenant or provision hereof which under Article Nine
   cannot be  modified  or  amended  without  the  consent of the Holder of each
   Outstanding Security of such series affected.

       Upon any such waiver, such default shall cease to exist, and any Event of
Default arising  therefrom shall be deemed to have been cured, for every purpose
of this  Indenture;  but no such waiver shall extend to any  subsequent or other
default or impair any right consequent thereon.

       SECTION 514.    Undertaking for Costs.
                       ---------------------

       All parties to this Indenture  agree,  and each Holder of any Security by
his acceptance thereof shall be deemed to have agreed, that any court may in its
discretion require, in any suit for the enforcement of any right or remedy under
this  Indenture,  or in any suit  against the  Trustee  for any action  taken or
omitted by it as  Trustee,  the filing by any party  litigant in such suit of an
undertaking  to pay the  costs of such  suit,  and that  such  court  may in its
discretion  assess  reasonable  costs,  including  reasonable  attorneys'  fees,
against  any party  litigant  in such suit,  having due regard to the merits and
good  faith of the  claims or  defenses  made by such  party  litigant;  but the
provisions  of this  Section  shall  not  apply  to any suit  instituted  by the
Trustee,  to any suit instituted by any Holder, or group of Holders,  holding in
the aggregate more than 10% in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of
any series,  or to any suit  instituted by any Holder for the enforcement of the
payment of the  principal of (or  premium,  if any) or interest  (including  any
Additional  Interest)  on  any  Security  on  or  after  the  respective  Stated
Maturities expressed in such Security.

       SECTION 515.    Waiver of Stay or Extension Laws.
                       --------------------------------

       The Company  covenants (to the extent that it may lawfully do so) that it
will not at any time insist upon, or plead, or in any manner whatsoever claim or
take the benefit or advantage  of, any stay or extension  law wherever  enacted,
now or at any time hereafter in force, which may affect the



covenants or the performance of this  Indenture;  and the Company (to the extent
that it may lawfully do so) hereby  expressly waives all benefit or advantage of
any such  law,  and  covenants  that it will not  hinder,  delay or  impede  the
execution of any power herein granted to the Trustee, but will suffer and permit
the execution of every such power as though no such law had been enacted.

                                   ARTICLE SIX
                                   THE TRUSTEE
                                  -----------

       SECTION 601.    Certain Duties and Responsibilities.
                       -----------------------------------

       (a)  Except during the continuance of an Event of Default,

       (1) the Trustee undertakes to perform such duties and only such duties as
   are  specifically  set forth in this Indenture,  and no implied  covenants or
   obligations shall be read into this Indenture against the Trustee; and

       (2) in the absence of bad faith on its part, the Trustee may conclusively
   rely, as to the truth of the statements  and the  correctness of the opinions
   expressed therein, upon certificates or opinions furnished to the Trustee and
   conforming to the requirements of this Indenture; but in the case of any such
   certificates  or opinions  which by any  provisions  hereof are  specifically
   required to be furnished to the Trustee, the Trustee shall be under a duty to
   examine the same to determine whether or not they conform to the requirements
   of this Indenture.

       (b) In case an Event of  Default  has  occurred  and is  continuing,  the
Trustee  shall  exercise  such of the  rights  and  powers  vested in it by this
Indenture,  and use the same  degree of care and skill in their  exercise,  as a
prudent person would exercise or use under the  circumstances  in the conduct of
his own affairs.

       (c) No  provision  of this  Indenture  shall be  construed to relieve the
Trustee from liability for its own negligent  action,  its own negligent failure
to act, or its own willful misconduct except that



       (1)  this Subsection shall not be construed to limit the effect of
   Subsection (a) of this Section;

       (2)  the Trustee  shall not be liable for any error of  judgment  made in
   good  faith by a  Responsible  Officer,  unless it shall be  proved  that the
   Trustee was negligent in ascertaining the pertinent facts; and

       (3) the Trustee  shall not be liable with  respect to any action taken or
   omitted to be taken by it in good faith in  accordance  with the direction of
   Holders  pursuant  to Section 512  relating to the time,  method and place of
   conducting  any  proceeding  for any  remedy  available  to the  Trustee,  or
   exercising  any  trust  or  power  conferred  upon the  Trustee,  under  this
   Indenture with respect to the Securities of such series.

       (d) No provision of this Indenture shall require the Trustee to expend or
risk its own funds or otherwise incur any financial liability in the performance
of any of its  duties  hereunder,  or in the  exercise  of any of its  rights or
powers,  if there shall be reasonable  grounds for believing  that  repayment of
such  funds  or  adequate  indemnity  against  such  risk  or  liability  is not
reasonably assured to it.

       (e) Whether or not therein expressly so provided, every provision of this
Indenture  relating to the conduct or  affecting  the  liability of or affording
protection to the Trustee shall be subject to the provisions of this Section.

Securities of any series,  the Trustee shall  transmit by mail to all Holders of
Securities of such series, as their names and addresses appear in the Securities
Register,  notice of such default  hereunder  known to the Trustee,  unless such
default shall have been cured or waived; provided, however, that, except in the

case of a default in the payment of the  principal  of (or  premium,  if any) or

                        ------------------------------------------------------

       The recitals contained herein and in the Securities, except the Trustee's
certificates of authentication, shall be taken as the statements of the Company,
and the Trustee assumes no  responsibility  for their  correctness.  The Trustee
makes no  representations as to the validity or sufficiency of this Indenture or
of  the  Securities.  The  Trustee  shall  not be  accountable  for  the  use or
application by the Company of the Securities or the proceeds thereof.


       SECTION 605.    May Hold Securities.
                       -------------------

       The Trustee, any Paying Agent, Securities Registrar or any other agent of
the Company,  in its individual or any other  capacity,  may become the owner or
pledgee of Securities  and,  subject to Sections 608 and 613, may otherwise deal

Paying Agent, Securities Registrar or such other agent.

                       -------------------

liability for interest on any money received by it hereunder except as otherwise
agreed with the Company.



       SECTION 607.    Compensation and Reimbursement.
                       ------------------------------

       The Company agrees

       (1) to pay to the Trustee from time to time reasonable  compensation  for
all  services  rendered by it  hereunder  in such amounts as the Company and the
Trustee shall agree from time to time (which  compensation  shall not be limited
by any provision of law in regard to the compensation of a trustee of an express
trust);

       (2) to  reimburse  the  Trustee  upon  its  request  for  all  reasonable
expenses,  disbursements  and  advances  incurred  or  made  by the  Trustee  in
accordance  with any  provision  of this  Indenture  (including  the  reasonable
compensation  and the expenses  and  disbursements  of its agents and  counsel),
except any such expense,  disbursement  or advance as may be attributable to its
negligence or bad faith; and

       (3) to indemnify  the Trustee for, and to hold it harmless  against,  any
loss,  liability  or expense  (including  the  reasonable  compensation  and the
expenses  and   disbursements  of  its  agents  and  counsel)  incurred  without
negligence or bad faith,  arising out of or in connection with the acceptance or
administration  of  this  trust  or the  performance  of its  duties  hereunder,
including  the costs and  expenses  of  defending  itself  against  any claim or

and the Holders agree that the Trustee shall have a lien prior to the Securities
on all money or  property  held or  collected  by the  Trustee.  Such lien shall
survive the satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture.

       When the Trustee  incurs  expenses or renders  services after an Event of
Default  specified  in  Section  501(4)  or (5)  occurs,  the  expenses  and the
compensation   for  the  services  are  intended  to   constitute   expenses  of
administration under any Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1978 or a successor statute.



       SECTION 608.    Disqualification; Conflicting Interests.
                       ---------------------------------------

       The Trustee for the  Securities of any series issued  hereunder  shall be
subject to the provisions of Section 310(b) of the Trust Indenture Act.  Nothing
herein shall prevent the Trustee from filing with the Commission the application
referred  to in the  second to last  paragraph  of  Section  310(b) of the Trust
Indenture Act.

       SECTION 609.    Corporate Trustee Required; Eligibility.
                       ---------------------------------------

       There shall at all times be a Trustee hereunder which shall be

       (a) a  corporation  organized  and doing  business  under the laws of the
   United  States of America  or of any  State,  Territory  or the  District  of

       (b) a corporation or other Person  organized and doing business under the
   laws of a foreign  government that is permitted to act as Trustee pursuant to
   a rule, regulation or order of the Commission,  authorized under such laws to
   exercise corporate trust powers, and subject to supervision or examination by
   authority  of such  foreign  government  or a political  subdivision  thereof
   substantially  equivalent to supervision or examination  applicable to United
   States institutional trustees,

in either  case having a combined  capital and surplus of at least  $50,000,000,
subject to supervision or  examination  by Federal or State  authority.  If such
corporation publishes reports of condition at least annually, pursuant to law or
to the requirements of the aforesaid  supervising or examining authority,  then,
for the  purpose of this  Section,  the  combined  capital  and  surplus of such
corporation  shall be deemed to be its combined capital and surplus as set forth
in its most recent report of condition so published.  If at any time the Trustee
shall cease to be eligible in accordance with the provisions of this Section, it
shall resign immediately in the manner and with the effect hereinafter specified
in this  Article.  Neither  the Company  nor any Person  directly or  indirectly
controlling, controlled by or



under common  control with the Company shall serve as Trustee for the Securities
of any series issued hereunder.

       SECTION 610.    Resignation and Removal; Appointment of Successor.
                       -------------------------------------------------

       (a) No  resignation  or removal of the  Trustee and no  appointment  of a
successor  Trustee  pursuant to this Article  shall become  effective  until the
acceptance of appointment by the successor Trustee under Section 611.

       (b) The Trustee may resign at any time with respect to the  Securities of
one or more  series by giving  written  notice  thereof  to the  Company.  If an
instrument of acceptance by a successor Trustee shall not have been delivered to
the Trustee within 30 days after the giving of such notice of  resignation,  the
resigning  Trustee may  petition  any court of  competent  jurisdiction  for the
appointment  of a  successor  Trustee  with  respect to the  Securities  of such
series.

       (c) The Trustee may be removed at any time with respect to the Securities
of any series by Act of the  Holders of a majority  in  principal  amount of the
Outstanding  Securities  of such  series,  delivered  to the  Trustee and to the
Company.

       (d)  If at any time:

       (1) the  Trustee  shall fail to comply  with  Section  608 after  written
   request  therefor  by the  Company  or by any Holder who has been a bona fide
   Holder of a Security for at least six months, or

       (2) the Trustee  shall cease to be eligible  under  Section 609 and shall
   fail to resign after written  request  therefor by the Company or by any such
   Holder, or

       (3) the Trustee  shall become  incapable of acting or shall be adjudged a
   bankrupt or insolvent  or a receiver of the Trustee or of its property  shall
   be  appointed  or any  public  officer  shall  take  charge or control of the
   Trustee or of its  property  or affairs  for the  purpose of  rehabilitation,
   conservation or liquidation,

then, in any such case, (i) the Company by Board Resolution may remove the
                         -
Trustee, or (ii) subject to Section 514, any
             --



Holder  who has been a bona fide  Holder of a  Security  for at least six months
may, on behalf of himself and all others similarly situated,  petition any court
of competent  jurisdiction for the removal of the Trustee and the appointment of
a successor Trustee.

       (e) If the  Trustee  shall  resign,  be  removed or become  incapable  of
acting,  or if a vacancy shall occur in the office of Trustee for any cause with
respect  to the  Securities  of one or  more  series,  the  Company,  by a Board
Resolution,  shall  promptly  appoint a successor  Trustee  with  respect to the
Securities of that or those series.  If, within one year after such resignation,
removal or incapability,  or the occurrence of such vacancy, a successor Trustee
with  respect to the  Securities  of any series shall be appointed by Act of the
Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Outstanding  Securities of such
series delivered to the Company and the retiring Trustee,  the successor Trustee
so appointed shall,  forthwith upon its acceptance of such  appointment,  become
the  successor  Trustee  with  respect  to the  Securities  of such  series  and
supersede  the  successor  Trustee  appointed  by the  Company.  If no successor
Trustee  with  respect  to the  Securities  of any  series  shall  have  been so
appointed by the Company or the Holders and accepted  appointment  in the manner
hereinafter  provided,  any Holder who has been a bona fide Holder of a Security
for at least six months  may,  subject to Section  514, on behalf of himself and
all others similarly situated,  petition any court of competent jurisdiction for
the  appointment  of a successor  Trustee with respect to the Securities of such
series.

       (f) The Company shall give notice of each resignation and each removal of
the Trustee with respect to the Securities of any series and each appointment of
a successor  Trustee  with  respect to the  Securities  of any series by mailing
written  notice of such  event by  first-class  mail,  postage  prepaid,  to the
Holders of Securities of such series as their names and addresses  appear in the
Securities Register. Each notice shall include the name of the successor Trustee
with respect to the  Securities  of such series and the address of its Corporate
Trust Office.

       SECTION 611.    Acceptance of Appointment by Successor.
                       --------------------------------------

       (a) In case of the  appointment  hereunder  of a successor  Trustee  with
respect to all  Securities,  every such  successor  Trustee so  appointed  shall
execute, acknowledge and deliver to the Company and to the retiring Trustee an



instrument accepting such appointment,  and thereupon the resignation or removal
of the retiring  Trustee  shall become  effective  and such  successor  Trustee,
without any further act,  deed or  conveyance,  shall become vested with all the
rights,  powers,  trusts and duties of the retiring Trustee; but, on the request
of the Company or the successor  Trustee,  such  retiring  Trustee  shall,  upon
payment of its charges,  execute and deliver an instrument  transferring to such
successor Trustee all the rights,  powers and trusts of the retiring Trustee and

retiring  Trustee and each  successor  Trustee with respect to the Securities of
one or more series shall  execute and deliver an indenture  supplemental  hereto
wherein each successor Trustee shall accept such appointment and which (1) shall
                                                                        -
contain  such  provisions  as shall be  necessary  or  desirable to transfer and
confirm to, and to vest in,  each  successor  Trustee  all the  rights,  powers,
trusts and duties of the retiring Trustee with respect to the Securities of that
or those series to which the appointment of such successor Trustee relates, (2)
                                                                             -
if the retiring  Trustee is not retiring with respect to all  Securities,  shall
contain  such  provisions  as shall be deemed  necessary or desirable to confirm
that all the rights,  powers,  trusts and duties of the  retiring  Trustee  with
respect  to the  Securities  of that or those  series as to which  the  retiring
Trustee is not retiring shall continue to be vested in the retiring Trustee, and
(3) shall add to or change any of the provisions of this Indenture as shall be
 -
necessary  to  provide  for or  facilitate  the  administration  of  the  trusts
hereunder by more than one Trustee,  it being  understood that nothing herein or
in such supplemental indenture shall constitute such Trustees co-trustees of the
same  trust and that each such  Trustee  shall be  trustee  of a trust or trusts
hereunder separate and apart from any trust or trusts hereunder  administered by
any other such Trustee and upon the execution and delivery of such  supplemental
indenture  the  resignation  or removal of the  retiring  Trustee  shall  become
effective  to the  extent  provided  therein  and each such  successor  Trustee,
without any further act,  deed or  conveyance,  shall become vested with all the
rights,  powers,  trusts, and duties of the retiring Trustee with respect to the
Securities of that or those series to which the  appointment  of such  successor
Trustee relates; but, on request of the Company or any



successor Trustee, such retiring Trustee shall duly assign, transfer and deliver
to such successor  Trustee all property and money held by such retiring  Trustee
hereunder  with respect to the  Securities  of that or those series to which the
appointment of such successor Trustee relates.

       (c) Upon request of any such successor Trustee, the Company shall execute
any and all instruments  for more fully and certainly  vesting in and confirming
to such successor Trustee all rights, powers and trusts referred to in paragraph
(a) or (b) of this Section, as the case may be.

       (d) No successor Trustee shall accept its appointment  unless at the time
of such acceptance such successor  Trustee shall be qualified and eligible under
this Article.

       SECTION 612.    Merger, Conversion, Consolidation or Succession to
                       --------------------------------------------------
                       Business.
                       --------

       Any corporation into which the Trustee may be merged or converted or with
which it may be  consolidated,  or any  corporation  resulting  from any merger,
conversion  or  consolidation  to which  the  Trustee  shall be a party,  or any
corporation  succeeding  to all or  substantially  all  of the  corporate  trust
business  of the  Trustee,  shall be the  successor  of the  Trustee  hereunder,
provided such corporation  shall be otherwise  qualified and eligible under this
Article,  without the execution or filing of any paper or any further act on the
part of any of the  parties  hereto.  In case any  Securities  shall  have  been
authenticated,  but not delivered,  by the Trustee then in office, any successor
by merger,  conversion or consolidation to such authenticating Trustee may adopt
such authentication and deliver the Securities so authenticated, and in case any
Securities shall not have been  authenticated,  any successor to the Trustee may
authenticate such Securities either in the name of any predecessor Trustee or in
the  name of  such  successor  Trustee,  and in all  cases  the  certificate  of
authentication  shall have the full force which it is  provided  anywhere in the
Securities or in this Indenture that the certificate of the Trustee shall have.

       SECTION 613.    Preferential Collection of Claims Against Company.
                       -------------------------------------------------

       If and when the Trustee  shall be or become a creditor of the Company (or
any other  obligor  upon the  Securities),  the Trustee  shall be subject to the
provisions



of the Trust  Indenture  Act  regarding  the  collection  of claims  against the
Company (or any such other obligor).

       SECTION 614.    Appointment of Authenticating Agent.
                       -----------------------------------

       The Trustee may appoint an Authenticating Agent or Agents with respect to
one or more series of  Securities  which shall be authorized to act on behalf of
the Trustee to authenticate Securities of such series issued upon original issue
and upon exchange,  registration of transfer or partial redemption thereof,  and
Securities so authenticated  shall be entitled to the benefits of this Indenture
and shall be valid and  obligatory for all purposes as if  authenticated  by the
Trustee  hereunder.  Wherever  reference  is  made  in  this  Indenture  to  the
authentication  and  delivery  of  Securities  by the  Trustee or the  Trustee's
certificate  of  authentication,  such  reference  shall be  deemed  to  include
authentication and delivery on behalf of the Trustee by an Authenticating Agent.
Each  Authenticating  Agent shall be  acceptable to the Company and shall at all
times be a corporation organized and doing business under the laws of the United
States of America,  or of any State,  Territory  or the  District  of  Columbia,
authorized  under such laws to act as  Authenticating  Agent,  having a combined
capital and surplus of not less than  $50,000,000  and subject to supervision or
examination  by  Federal  or  State  authority.  If  such  Authenticating  Agent
publishes  reports of  condition  at least  annually,  pursuant to law or to the
requirements of said supervising or examining  authority,  then for the purposes
of this Section the combined  capital and surplus of such  Authenticating  Agent
shall be deemed to be its combined  capital and surplus as set forth in its most
recent report of condition so published.  If at any time an Authenticating Agent
shall cease to be eligible in  accordance  with the  provisions of this Section,
such  Authenticating  Agent shall resign  immediately in the manner and with the
effect specified in this Section.

       Any  corporation  into  which an  Authenticating  Agent  may be merged or
converted or with which it may be  consolidated,  or any  corporation  resulting
from any merger,  conversion or consolidation to which such Authenticating Agent
shall be a party, or any corporation  succeeding to all or substantially  all of
the corporate trust business of an  Authenticating  Agent shall be the successor
Authenticating  Agent hereunder,  provided such  corporation  shall be otherwise
eligible under this Section, without the execution



or filing of any paper or any further act on the part of the Trustee or the
Authenticating Agent.

       An  Authenticating  Agent may resign at any time by giving written notice
thereof to the Trustee and to the Company. The Trustee may at any time terminate
the agency of an  Authenticating  Agent by giving written notice thereof to such
Authenticating  Agent  and to the  Company.  Upon  receiving  such a  notice  of
resignation  or  upon  such  a  termination,   or  in  case  at  any  time  such
Authenticating  Agent  shall  cease  to  be  eligible  in  accordance  with  the
provisions of this Section,  the Trustee may appoint a successor  Authenticating
Agent  which  shall be  acceptable  to the Company and shall give notice of such
appointment  in the manner  provided in Section 106 to all Holders of Securities
of the series with respect to which such  Authenticating  Agent will serve.  Any
successor  Authenticating  Agent upon  acceptance of its  appointment  hereunder
shall become  vested with all the rights,  powers and duties of its  predecessor
hereunder,  with like effect as if originally named as an Authenticating  Agent.
No successor  Authenticating  Agent shall be appointed unless eligible under the
provision of this Section.

       The Trustee agrees to pay to each Authenticating  Agent from time to time
reasonable  compensation  for its services  under this Section,  and the Trustee
shall be entitled to be reimbursed for such payments,  subject to the provisions
of Section 607.

       If an appointment  with respect to one or more series is made pursuant to
this  Section,  the  Securities  of such series may have  endorsed  thereon,  in
addition  to  the  Trustee's  certificate  of  authentication,   an  alternative
certificate of authentication in the following form:



       This  is one of  the  Securities  referred  to in  the  within  mentioned
Indenture.

corporation or convey, transfer or lease its properties and assets substantially
as an entirety to any Person, and no Person shall consolidate with or merge into

as an entirety to the Company, unless:

       (1) in case the  Company  shall  consolidate  with or merge into  another
corporation or convey, transfer or lease its properties and assets substantially
as an entirety to any Person,  the corporation  formed by such  consolidation or
into which the Company is merged or the Person which  acquires by  conveyance or
transfer,   or  which  leases,   the   properties  and  assets  of  the  Company
substantially as an entirety shall be a corporation organized and existing under
the laws of the  United  States  of  America  or any  State or the  District  of
Columbia,  and shall  expressly  assume,  by an indenture  supplemental  hereto,
executed and delivered to the Trustee, in form satisfactory to the Trustee,  the
due and punctual payment of the principal of (and premium,  if any) and interest
(including any Additional Interest) on all the Securities and the performance of
every  covenant of this  Indenture on the part of the Company to be performed or
observed;

       (2)  immediately  after giving  effect to such  transaction,  no Event of
Default,  and no event  which,  after  notice or lapse of time,  or both,  would
become an Event of Default, shall have happened and be continuing;



       (3) in the case of the Securities of a series issued to a Hartford Trust,
such consolidation, merger, conveyance, transfer or lease is permitted under the
related  Trust  Agreement  and Hartford  Guarantee and does not give rise to any
breach or violation of the related Trust Agreement or Hartford Guarantee; and

       (4) the Company has delivered to the Trustee an Officers' Certificate and
an opinion of Counsel each stating that such consolidation,  merger, conveyance,
transfer or lease and any such supplemental indenture complies with this Article

transaction  have been complied with;  and the Trustee,  subject to Section 601,

evidence that such transaction complies with this Section 801.

       SECTION 802.    Successor Corporation Substituted.
                       ---------------------------------

       Upon any  consolidation  or merger by the Company  with or into any other
corporation,  or  any  conveyance,  transfer  or  lease  by the  Company  of its
properties and assets  substantially  as an entirety to any Person in accordance
with Section 801, the successor corporation formed by such consolidation or into
which the  Company is merged or to which such  conveyance,  transfer or lease is
made shall succeed to, and be substituted  for, and may exercise every right and
power of, the  Company  under  this  Indenture  with the same  effect as if such
successor  corporation had been named as the Company herein; and in the event of
any such conveyance,  transfer or lease the Company shall be discharged from all
obligations  and covenants  under the Indenture  and the  Securities  and may be
dissolved and liquidated.

       Such successor  corporation may cause to be signed,  and may issue either
in its own  name or in the  name of the  Company,  any or all of the  Securities
issuable  hereunder which  theretofore shall not have been signed by the Company
and delivered to the Trustee;  and, upon the order of such successor corporation
instead of the Company and subject to all the terms,  conditions and limitations
in this Indenture  prescribed,  the Trustee shall authenticate and shall deliver
any  Securities  which  previously  shall have been signed and  delivered by the
officers  of the  Company to the  Trustee  for  authentication  pursuant to such
provisions and any Securities which such successor corporation thereafter shall



cause to be signed and  delivered  to the  Trustee on its behalf for the purpose
pursuant to such provisions.  All the Securities so issued shall in all respects
have the same legal rank and  benefit  under this  Indenture  as the  Securities
theretofore or thereafter  issued in accordance with the terms of this Indenture
as though all of such  Securities  had been issued at the date of the  execution
hereof.

       In case of any such  consolidation,  merger,  sale,  conveyance or lease,
such changes in phraseology and form may be made in the Securities thereafter to
be issued as may be appropriate.

long as any of the  corresponding  series of Preferred  Securities  shall remain
outstanding, the holders of such Preferred Securities; or

       (8) to evidence and provide for the acceptance of  appointment  hereunder
by a successor  Trustee with respect to the Securities of one or more series and
to add to or  change  any of the  provisions  of  this  Indenture  as  shall  be
necessary  to  provide  for or  facilitate  the  administration  of  the  trusts

                                                           --------  -------
that no such supplemental



indenture shall, without the consent of the Holder of each Outstanding Security

of interest  thereon or reduce any premium payable upon the redemption  thereof,
or reduce the amount of principal of an Original  Issue  Discount  Security that
would be due and payable  upon a  declaration  of  acceleration  of the Maturity

compliance  with  certain  provisions  of this  Indenture  or  certain  defaults
hereunder and their consequences) provided for in this Indenture, or

  (3) modify any of the provisions of this Section, Section 513 or Section 1006,

the Holder of each Security affected thereby; or

  (4) modify the  provisions in Article  Thirteen of this Indenture with respect
to the subordination of Outstanding Securities of any series in a manner adverse

Securities  of such series and all accrued and unpaid  interest  (including  any
Additional  Interest)  thereon have been paid in full; and provided further that
in the case of the Securities of a series issued to a Hartford Trust, so long as

       A supplemental indenture that changes or eliminates any covenant or other
provision of this  Indenture  that has expressly  been  included  solely for the
benefit of one or more  particular  series of Securities,  or which modifies the
rights of the Holders of Securities of such series with respect to such covenant
or other  provision,  shall be  deemed  not to  affect  the  rights  under  this
Indenture of the Holders of Securities of any other series.

       It shall not be  necessary  for any Act of Holders  under this Section to
approve the particular form of any proposed supplemental indenture, but it shall

supplemental indenture permitted by this Article or the modifications thereby of
the trusts created by this Indenture,  the Trustee shall be entitled to receive,
and  (subject  to Section  601) shall be fully  protected  in relying  upon,  an
Officers'  Certificate  and an Opinion of Counsel  stating that the execution of
such  supplemental  indenture is authorized or permitted by this Indenture,  and
that all  conditions  precedent  have been complied  with.  The Trustee may, but

affects the Trustee's own rights,  duties or immunities  under this Indenture or
otherwise.



       SECTION 904.    Effect of Supplemental Indentures.
                       ---------------------------------

       Upon the execution of any supplemental indenture under this Article, this
Indenture  shall be  modified in  accordance  therewith,  and such  supplemental
indenture shall form a part of this Indenture for all purposes; and every Holder
of Securities  theretofore or thereafter  authenticated and delivered  hereunder
shall be bound thereby.

       SECTION 905.    Conformity with Trust Indenture Act.
                       -----------------------------------

conform to the requirements of the Trust Indenture Act as then in effect.

provided for in such supplemental  indenture. If the Company shall so determine,
new  Securities  of any series so modified as to conform,  in the opinion of the
Trustee and the Board of Directors,  to any such  supplemental  indenture may be
prepared  and  executed by the Company and  authenticated  and  delivered by the
Trustee in exchange for Outstanding Securities of such series.

                                   ARTICLE TEN
                                    COVENANTS
                                    ---------
 
       SECTION 1001.   Payment of Principal, Premium and Interest.
                       ------------------------------------------

       The  Company  covenants  and  agrees for the  benefit  of each  series of
securities  that it will duly and  punctually pay the principal of (and premium,
if any) and interest on the  Securities  of that series in  accordance  with the
terms of such Securities and this Indenture.

       SECTION 1002.   Maintenance of Office or Agency.
                       -------------------------------

       The Company  will  maintain  in each Place of Payment for any series,  an
office or agency where Securities of that series may be presented or surrendered
for payment and an



office or agency where  Securities may be  surrendered  for transfer or exchange
and  where  notices  and  demands  to or upon  the  Company  in  respect  of the
Securities and this Indenture may be served.  The Company initially appoints the
Trustee,  acting  through  its  Corporate  Trust  Office,  as its agent for said
purposes.  The  Company  will give prompt  written  notice to the Trustee of any
change in the location of any such office or agency.  If at any time the Company
shall  fail to  maintain  such  office or agency or shall  fail to  furnish  the
Trustee with the address thereof,  such presentations,  surrenders,  notices and
demands may be made or served at the Corporate Trust Office of the Trustee,  and
the  Company  hereby  appoints  the  Trustee  as its agent to  receive  all such
presentations, surrenders, notices and demands.

       The  Company  may also  from  time to time  designate  one or more  other
offices or agencies where the Securities may be presented or surrendered for any
or all of such  purposes,  and may from time to time rescind such  designations;
provided, however, that no such designation or rescission shall in any manner
- --------  -------
relieve  the Company of its  obligation  to maintain an office or agency in each
Place of Payment for  Securities  of any series for such  purposes.  The Company
will give prompt written notice to the Trustee of any such  designation  and any
change in the location of any such office or agency.

       SECTION 1003.   Money for Security Payments to be Held in Trust.
                       -----------------------------------------------

       If the Company shall at any time act as its own Paying Agent with respect
to any  series  of  Securities,  it  will,  on or  before  each  due date of the
principal of (and premium,  if any) or interest on any of the Securities of such
series,  segregate  and hold in trust for the  benefit of the  Persons  entitled
thereto a sum sufficient to pay the principal (and premium,  if any) or interest
so  becoming  due until  such sums shall be paid to such  Persons  or  otherwise
disposed  of as herein  provided,  and will  promptly  notify the Trustee of its
failure so to act.

       Whenever the Company shall have one or more Paying Agents, it will, prior
to each due date of the principal of or interest on any Securities, deposit with
a Paying Agent a sum  sufficient to pay the principal  (and premium,  if any) or
interest  so becoming  due,  such sum to be held in trust for the benefit of the
Persons entitled to such principal and premium (if any) or interest, and (unless
such Paying Agent



is the Trustee) the Company will promptly notify the Trustee of its failure so
to act.

       The  Company  will  cause each  Paying  Agent  other than the  Trustee to
execute  and  deliver to the Trustee an  instrument  in which such Paying  Agent
shall agree with the Trustee,  subject to the  provisions of this Section,  that
such Paying Agent will:

       (1) hold all sums held by it for the  payment  of the  principal  of (and
premium,  if any) or  interest  on  Securities  in trust for the  benefit of the
Persons  entitled  thereto  until  such sums  shall be paid to such  Persons  or
otherwise disposed of as herein provided;

       (2) give the  Trustee  notice of any default by the Company (or any other
obligor  upon the  Securities)  in the making of any payment of  principal  (and
premium, if any) or interest;

       (3) at any time  during the  continuance  of any such  default,  upon the
written request of the Trustee, forthwith pay to the Trustee all sums so held in
trust by such Paying Agent; and

       (4) comply with the  provisions of the Trust  Indenture Act applicable to
it as a Paying Agent.

       The  Company  may  at  any  time,   for  the  purpose  of  obtaining  the
satisfaction  and discharge of this Indenture or for any other purpose,  pay, or
by Company Order direct any Paying Agent to pay, to the Trustee all sums held in
trust by the Company or such Paying  Agent,  such sums to be held by the Trustee
upon the same  trusts as those upon which such sums were held by the  Company or
such Paying Agent;  and, upon such payment by the Company or any Paying Agent to
the Trustee, such Paying Agent shall be released from all further liability with
respect to such money.

       Any money deposited with the Trustee or any Paying Agent, or then held by
the Company,  in trust for the payment of the principal of (and premium, if any)
or interest on any Security  and  remaining  unclaimed  for two years after such
principal  (and  premium,  if any) or interest has become due and payable  shall
(unless  otherwise  required by  mandatory  provision of  applicable  escheat or
abandoned or unclaimed  property law) be paid on Company Request to the Company,
or (if then held by the Company) shall (unless  otherwise  required by mandatory
provision of applicable escheat or



abandoned or unclaimed  property  law) be  discharged  from such trust;  and the
Holder of such Security shall thereafter, as an unsecured general creditor, look
only to the Company for payment  thereof,  and all  liability  of the Trustee or
such Paying  Agent with respect to such trust  money,  and all  liability of the
Company as trustee thereof, shall thereupon cease; provided, however, that the
                                                   --------  -------
Trustee or such Paying Agent,  before being required to make any such repayment,
may at the expense of the Company  cause to be  published  once,  in a newspaper
published in the English  language,  customarily  published on each Business Day
and of general  circulation  in the Borough of Manhattan,  The City of New York,
notice  that such  money  remains  unclaimed  and that,  after a date  specified
therein, which shall not be less than 30 days from the date of such publication,
any unclaimed balance of such money then remaining will be repaid the Company.

       SECTION 1004.   Payment of Taxes and Other Claims.
                       ---------------------------------

       The  Company  will pay or  discharge  or cause to be paid or  discharged,
before the same shall become delinquent, (1) all taxes, assessments and
                                          -
governmental  charges  levied or  imposed  upon the  Company  or any  Restricted
Subsidiary  or upon the  income,  profits  or  property  of the  Company  or any
Restricted Subsidiary, and (2) all lawful claims for labor, materials and
                            -
supplies which,  if unpaid,  might by law become a lien upon the property of the
Company or any Restricted Subsidiary; provided, however, that the Company shall
                                      --------  -------
not be required to pay or discharge or cause to be paid or  discharged  any such
tax,  assessment,  charge or claim whose  amount,  applicability  or validity is
being contested in good faith by appropriate proceedings.

       SECTION 1005.   Statement as to Compliance.
                       --------------------------

       The Company shall  deliver to the Trustee,  within 120 days after the end
of each calendar year of the Company ending after the date hereof,  an Officers'
Certificate  covering the preceding calendar year, stating whether or not to the
best  knowledge  of  the  signers  thereof  the  Company  is in  default  in the
performance,  observance or fulfillment of or compliance  with any of the terms,
provisions, covenants and conditions of this Indenture, and if the Company shall
be in default, specifying all such defaults and the nature and status thereof of
which they may have knowledge.  For the purpose of this Section 1005, compliance
shall be determined  without regard to any grace period or requirement of notice
provided pursuant to the terms of this Indenture.



       SECTION 1006. Waiver of Certain Covenants.
                     ---------------------------

       The  Company  may omit in any  particular  instance  to  comply  with any
covenant or condition set forth in Section 1004 or as specified as  contemplated
by Section 301 with respect to the Securities of any series,  if before or after
the time for such  compliance  the Holders of at least a majority  in  principal
amount  of the  Outstanding  Securities  of such  series  shall,  by Act of such
Holders,  either  waive such  compliance  in such  instance or  generally  waive
compliance  with such covenant or condition,  but no such waiver shall extend to
or affect such covenant or condition  except to the extent so expressly  waived,
and, until such waiver shall become effective, the obligations of the Company in
respect of any such covenant or condition shall remain in full force and effect.

       SECTION 1007.   Additional Sums.
                       ---------------

       In the case of the  Securities  of a series  issued to a Hartford  Trust,
except as otherwise  specified as contemplated by Section 301, in the event that
(i) a Hartford Trust is the Holder of all of the Outstanding Securities of such
 -
series, (ii) a Tax Event in respect of such Hartford Trust shall have occurred
         --
and be continuing and (iii) the Company shall not have (i) redeemed the

Hartford Trust pursuant to section  902(b) of the related Trust  Agreement,  the
Company  shall pay to such  Hartford  Trust  (and its  permitted  successors  or
assigns under the related Trust  Agreement)  for so long as such Hartford  Trust
(or its  permitted  successor  or  assignee)  is the  registered  holder  of any
Securities of such series,  such additional amounts as may be necessary in order
that the amount of distributions  (including any Additional  Amounts (as defined
in the Trust  Agreement))  then due and  payable by such  Hartford  Trust on the
related  Preferred  Securities  and Common  Securities  that at any time  remain
outstanding  in  accordance  with the terms  thereof  shall not be  reduced as a
result of any Additional Taxes (the "Additional Sums"); provided that, if this

                            REDEMPTION OF SECURITIES
                            ------------------------

       SECTION 1101.   Applicability of This Article.
                       -----------------------------

       Redemption  of  Securities  (whether by  operation  of a sinking  fund or
otherwise) as permitted or required by any form of Security  issued  pursuant to
this Indenture  shall be made in accordance  with such form of Security and this
Article; provided, however, that if any provision of any such form of Security
         --------  -------
shall conflict with any provision of this Article, the provision of such form of
Security shall govern. Except as otherwise set forth in the form of Security for
such series,  each Security shall be subject to partial  redemption  only in the
amount of $25 or, in the case of the Securities of a series issued to a Hartford
Trust, $25, or integral multiples thereof.

       SECTION 1102.   Election to Redeem; Notice to Trustee.
                       -------------------------------------

       The election of the Company to redeem any  Securities  shall be evidenced
by or pursuant to a Board Resolution.  In case of any redemption at the election
of the Company of less than all of the Securities of any  particular  series and
having the same terms, the Company shall, not less than 30 nor more than 60 days
prior to the date  fixed  for  redemption  (unless  a  shorter  notice  shall be
satisfactory  to the  Trustee),  notify  the  Trustee  of such  date  and of the
principal amount of Securities of that series to be redeemed. In the case of any
redemption of Securities  prior to the  expiration  of any  restriction  on such
redemption  provided in the terms of such Securities,  the Company shall furnish
the Trustee with an Officers'  Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel  evidencing
compliance with such restriction.



       SECTION 1103.   Selection of Securities to be Redeemed.
                       --------------------------------------

       If less than all the  Securities  of a  particular  series and having the
same terms are to be redeemed,  the Trustee shall select,  not more than 60 days
prior to the date fixed for redemption, in such manner as in its sole discretion
it shall deem  appropriate and fair, the Securities or portions  thereof of such
series to be redeemed.  The Trustee shall promptly notify the Company in writing
of the  Securities  selected for partial  redemption  and the  principal  amount
thereof to be redeemed.  For all purposes of this Indenture,  unless the context
otherwise  requires,  all  provisions  relating to the  redemption of Securities
shall  relate,  in the case of any Security  redeemed or to be redeemed  only in
part, to the portion of the principal  amount of such Security which has been or
is to be redeemed. If the Company shall so direct,  Securities registered in the
name of the  Company,  any  Affiliate  or any  Subsidiary  thereof  shall not be
included in the Securities selected for redemption.

       SECTION 1104.   Notice of Redemption.
                       --------------------

       Notice of redemption shall be given by first-class mail, postage prepaid,
mailed not later than the thirtieth  day, and not earlier than the sixtieth day,
prior to the date  fixed for  redemption,  to each  Holder of  Securities  to be
redeemed,  at the  address  of  such  Holder  as it  appears  in the  Securities
Register.

       With respect to Securities of each series to be redeemed,  each notice of
redemption shall state:

       (a)  the date fixed for redemption for Securities of such series;

       (b)  the redemption price at which Securities of such series are to be
redeemed;

       (c) if less than all Outstanding Securities of such particular series and
having the same terms are to be redeemed,  the identification  (and, in the case
of partial  redemption,  the  respective  principal  amounts) of the  particular
Securities to be redeemed;

       (d) that on the date fixed for redemption,  the redemption price at which
such  Securities  are to be redeemed  will become due and payable upon each such
Security or



portion thereof, and that interest thereon, if any, shall cease to accrue on and
after said date;

       (e)  the place or places where such Securities are to be surrendered for
payment of the redemption price at which such Securities are to be redeemed; and

       (f)  that the redemption is for a sinking fund, if such is the case.

       Notice of  redemption of Securities to be redeemed at the election of the
Company  shall be given by the  Company  or, at the  Company's  request,  by the
Trustee in the name and at the expense of the  Company.  The notice if mailed in
the manner  herein  provided  shall be  conclusively  presumed to have been duly
given, whether or not the Holder receives such notice. In any case, a failure to
give such  notice  by mail or any  defect  in the  notice  to the  Holder of any
Security  designated  for  redemption as a whole or in part shall not affect the
validity of the proceedings for the redemption of any other Security.

       SECTION 1105. Deposit of Redemption Price.
                     ---------------------------

       Prior to the redemption date specified in the notice of redemption  given
as provided in Section  1104,  the Company will deposit with the Trustee or with
one or more  paying  agents  an  amount  of money  sufficient  to  redeem on the
redemption  date all the  Securities so called for  redemption at the applicable
redemption price.

       SECTION 1106.   Payment of Securities Called for Redemption.
                       -------------------------------------------

       If any notice of  redemption  has been given as provided in Section 1104,
the  Securities or portion of  Securities  with respect to which such notice has
been given  shall  become due and payable on the date and at the place or places
stated in such notice at the applicable  redemption  price. On presentation  and
surrender of such Securities at a place of payment in said notice specified, the
said securities or the specified  portions thereof shall be paid and redeemed by
the Company at the applicable redemption price.

       Upon  presentation  of any  Security  redeemed in part only,  the Company
shall  execute  and the  Trustee  shall  authenticate  and deliver to the Holder
thereof, at the expense of the Company, a new Security or Securities of the



same series, of authorized denominations, in aggregate principal amount equal to
the unredeemed portion of the Security so presented and having the same Original
Issue Date,  Stated  Maturity and terms. If a Global Security is so surrendered,
such new Security will also be a new Global Security.

       SECTION 1107.   Company's Right of Redemption.
                       -----------------------------

       (a) Unless  otherwise  specified  as  contemplated  by  Section  301 with
respect  to the  Securities  of a  particular  series  and  notwithstanding  any
additional  redemption rights that may be so specified,  the Company may, at its
option,  redeem the  Securities of any series on any Interest  Payment Date with
respect  thereto  after  their date of  issuance in whole at any time or in part
from time to time,  subject to the  provisions  of this clause (a) and the other
provisions of this Article Eleven. Unless otherwise specified as contemplated by
Section  301  with  respect  to  the  Securities  of a  particular  series,  the
redemption price for any Security so redeemed  pursuant to this clause (a) shall
equal any accrued and unpaid interest, including any Additional Interest, to the
date fixed for redemption, plus the greater of (a) the principal amount thereof
                                                -
and (b) an amount equal to (i) in respect of the Securities of any series
     -                      -
bearing interest at a fixed rate, the Discounted Remaining Fixed Amount Payments
or (ii) in respect of the Securities of any series bearing interest determined
    --
by reference to a floating rate, the Discounted  Swap Equivalent  Payments.  The
Company  shall not redeem the  Securities  in part unless all accrued and unpaid
interest  (including  any  Additional  Interest)  has  been  paid in full on all
Securities  Outstanding for all interest periods  terminating on or prior to the
date fixed for redemption.  For purposes of this clause (a), the following terms
shall have the meanings set forth below:

       "Discounted Remaining Fixed Amount Payments" means, in respect of a
        ------------------------------------------
Security of any series bearing  interest at a fixed rate, an amount equal to the
sum of the Current  Values of the amounts of interest and  principal  that would
have been payable by the Company  pursuant to the terms of such Security on each
Interest  Payment  Date after the date  fixed for  redemption  pursuant  to this
Section  1107 and at the  Stated  Maturity  of the final  payment  of  principal
thereof  (taking into account any required  sinking fund  payments but otherwise
assuming that the Company had not redeemed  such  Security  prior to such Stated
Maturity).



       "Current Value" means, in respect of any amount, the present value of
        -------------
that amount on the date fixed for redemption pursuant to this Section 1107 after
discounting  that amount on a basis  corresponding to the interest period of the
Securities to be redeemed from the originally  scheduled date for payment on the
basis of the Treasury Rate, all computed in accordance  with generally  accepted
financial practice.

       "Treasury Rate" means a per annum rate (expressed as a decimal and, in
        -------------
the case of United  States  Treasury  bills,  converted  to a per  annum  yield)
determined on the date fixed for redemption  pursuant to this Section 1107 to be
the per annum rate equal to the  semiannual  bond  equivalent  yield to maturity
adjusted, in the case of Securities having monthly or quarterly Interest Payment
Dates, to reflect monthly or quarterly  compounding in accordance with generally
accepted  financial practice for United States Treasury  securities  maturing at
the  Stated  Maturity  of the  final  payment  of  principal  of any  series  of
Securities redeemed pursuant to this Section 1107, as determined (i) by
                                                                  -
reference to the weekly  average  yield to maturity for United  States  Treasury
securities  maturing  on such  Stated  Maturity  as  reported in the most recent
Statistical  Release H.15(519) of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve,
or (ii) if no such weekly average yield is so reported, by interpolation between
    --
the most  recent  weekly  average  yields to  maturity  for two series of United
States Treasury securities, (a) one maturing as close as possible to, but
                             -
earlier than, such Stated Maturity and (b) the other maturing as close as
                                        -
possible to, but later than, such Stated Maturity,  in each case as published in
the most recent  Statistical  Release H.15(519) of the Board of Governors of the
Federal Reserve.

       (b) In the case of the Securities of a series issued to a Hartford Trust,
except as otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 301, if a Special Event
in respect of such  Hartford  Trust shall occur and be  continuing,  the Company
may, at its option, redeem the Securities of such series on any Interest Payment
Date falling within 90 days of the  occurrence of such Special  Event,  in whole
but not in part,  subject  to the  provisions  of this  clause (b) and the other
provisions  of this Article  Eleven.  The  redemption  price for any Security so
redeemed  pursuant  to this  clause (b) shall be equal to 100% of the  principal
amount of such Securities  then  Outstanding  plus accrued and unpaid  interest,
including any Additional Interest, to the date fixed for redemption.



                                 ARTICLE TWELVE
                                  SINKING FUNDS
                                  -------------

       SECTION 1201.   Applicability of Article.
                       ------------------------

       The  provisions  of this Article  shall be applicable to any sinking fund
for the retirement of Securities of any series except as otherwise  specified as
contemplated by Section 301 for such Securities.

       The minimum amount of any sinking fund payment  provided for by the terms
of any  Securities of any series is herein  referred to as a "mandatory  sinking
fund  payment",  and any sinking fund  payment in excess of such minimum  amount
which is permitted to be made by the terms of such  Securities  of any series is
herein referred to as an "optional sinking fund payment". If provided for by the
terms of any  Securities  of any series,  the cash  amount of any  sinking  fund
payment may be subject to  reduction as provided in Section  1202.  Each sinking
fund payment  shall be applied to the  redemption of Securities of any series as
provided for by the terms of such Securities.

       SECTION 1202.   Satisfaction of Sinking Fund Payments with Securities.
                       -----------------------------------------------------

       In lieu of making all or any part of a  mandatory  sinking  fund  payment
with  respect to any  Securities  of a series in cash,  the  Company  may at its
option, at any time no more than 16 months and no less than 30 days prior to the
date on  which  such  sinking  fund  payment  is  due,  deliver  to the  Trustee
Securities  of  such  series  (together  with  the  unmatured  Coupons,  if any,
appertaining  thereto)  theretofore  purchased  or  otherwise  acquired  by  the
Company,  except  Securities of such series that have been redeemed  through the
application of mandatory or optional sinking fund payments pursuant to the terms
of the Securities of such series, accompanied by a Company Order instructing the
Trustee to credit such  obligations  and  stating  that the  Securities  of such
series were  originally  issued by the Company by way of bona fide sale or other
negotiation for value; provided that the Securities to be so credited have not
                       --------
been previously so credited.  The Securities to be so credited shall be received
and credited for such  purpose by the Trustee at the  redemption  price for such
Securities,  as specified in the  Securities so to be redeemed,  for  redemption
through operation of the sinking fund and the



amount of such sinking fund payment shall be reduced accordingly.

       SECTION 1203.   Redemption of Securities for Sinking Fund.
                       -----------------------------------------

       Not less than 60 days prior to each  sinking  fund  payment  date for any
series of  Securities,  the Company  will  deliver to the  Trustee an  Officers'
Certificate  specifying the amount of the next ensuing  sinking fund payment for
such Securities  pursuant to the terms of such Securities,  the portion thereof,
if any, which is to be satisfied by payment of cash in the currency in which the
Securities  of such series are payable  (except as provided  pursuant to Section
301) and the portion thereof, if any, which is to be satisfied by delivering and
crediting  Securities  pursuant  to  Section  1202 and will also  deliver to the
Trustee any Securities to be so delivered. Such Certificate shall be irrevocable
and upon its delivery the Company shall be obligated to make the cash payment or
payments therein  referred to, if any, on or before the succeeding  sinking fund
payment  date.  In the  case of the  failure  of the  Company  to  deliver  such
Certificate (or, as required by this Indenture,  the Securities and coupons,  if
any,  specified  in such  Certificate),  the  sinking  fund  payment  due on the
succeeding  sinking fund payment date for such series shall be paid  entirely in
cash and shall be sufficient to redeem the principal amount of the Securities of
such series  subject to a mandatory  sinking fund  payment  without the right to
deliver or credit  securities  as provided in Section 1202 and without the right
to make the  optional  sinking  fund payment with respect to such series at such
time.

       Any sinking fund payment or payments (mandatory or optional) made in cash
plus any unused balance of any preceding sinking fund payments made with respect
to the Securities of any  particular  series shall be applied by the Trustee (or
by the Company if the Company is acting as its own Paying  Agent) on the sinking
fund  payment  date on which such  payment is made (or, if such  payment is made
before a sinking fund payment date, on the sinking fund payment date immediately
following  the date of such  payment) to the  redemption  of  Securities of such
series at the redemption  price specified in such Securities with respect to the
sinking fund. Any sinking fund moneys not so applied or allocated by the Trustee
(or by the Company if the Company is acting as its own Paying Agent,  segregated
and held in trust as provided in Section 1003) for such series and together with
such payment (or such amount so segregated)



shall be applied in accordance with the provisions of this Section 1203. Any and
all sinking fund moneys with respect to the Securities of any particular  series
held by the  Trustee  (or if the  Company  is  acting as its own  Paying  Agent,
segregated  and held in trust as provided in Section  1003) on the last  sinking
fund payment date with respect to Securities of such series and not held for the
payment or redemption  of particular  Securities of such series shall be applied
by the  Trustee  (or by the  Company if the  Company is acting as its own Paying
Agent),   together  with  other  moneys,  if  necessary,  to  be  deposited  (or
segregated)  sufficient for the purpose,  to the payment of the principal of the
Securities of such series at Maturity.  The Trustee shall select the  Securities
to be redeemed  upon such sinking  fund payment date in the manner  specified in
Section 1103 and cause notice of the redemption  thereof to be given in the name
of and at the  expense of the Company in the manner  provided  in Section  1104.
Such notice having been duly given,  the redemption of such Securities  shall be
made upon the terms and in the manner  stated in Section 1106. On or before each
sinking  fund  payment  date,  the Company  shall pay to the Trustee (or, if the
Company is acting as its own Paying Agent,  the Company shall segregate and hold
in trust as  provided  in Section  1003) in cash a sum in the  currency in which
Securities  of such series are payable  (except as provided  pursuant to Section
301) equal to the principal and any interest  accrued to the redemption date for
Securities or portions  thereof to be redeemed on such sinking fund payment date
pursuant to this Section 1203.

       Neither  the Trustee nor the Company  shall  redeem any  Securities  of a
series with sinking fund moneys or mail any notice of  redemption  of Securities
of such  series by  operation  of the sinking  fund for such  series  during the
continuance  of a default in payment of interest,  if any, on any  Securities of
such series or of any Event of Default (other than an Event of Default occurring
as a  consequence  of this  paragraph)  with respect to the  securities  of such
series,  except  that if the notice of  redemption  shall have been  provided in
accordance  with the  provisions  hereof,  the  Trustee  (or the  Company if the
Company is then acting as its own Paying Agent) shall redeem such  Securities if
cash  sufficient  for that  purpose  shall be  deposited  with the  Trustee  (or
segregated by the Company) for that purpose in accordance with the terms of this
Article  Twelve.  Except as  aforesaid,  any moneys in the sinking fund for such
series at the time when any such default or Event of Default shall occur and any
moneys thereafter paid into such sinking fund



shall,  during the  continuance of such default or Event of Default,  be held as
security for the payment of the Securities and coupons,  if any, of such series;
provided, however, that in case such default or Event of Default shall
- --------  -------
have been cured or waived herein, such moneys shall thereafter be applied on the
next sinking fund payment date for the  Securities  of such series on which such
moneys may be applied pursuant to the provisions of this Section 1203.


                                ARTICLE THIRTEEN

       SECTION 1301.   Securities Subordinate to Senior Debt.
                       -------------------------------------

       The Company covenants and agrees,  and each Holder of a Security,  by its
acceptance  thereof,  likewise covenants and agrees,  that, to the extent and in
the manner  hereinafter set forth in this Article,  the payment of the principal
of (and premium,  if any) and interest  (including any  Additional  Interest) on
each and all of the Securities are hereby expressly made subordinate and subject
in right of payment to the prior  payment  in full of all  amounts  then due and
payable in respect of all Senior Debt.

        SECTION 1302.  Payment Over of Proceeds Upon Dissolution, Etc.
                       ----------------------------------------------

       In case of the  pendency of any  receivership,  insolvency,  liquidation,
bankruptcy,  reorganization,   arrangement,  adjustment,  composition  or  other
judicial  proceeding  relative to the Company (each such event,  if any,  herein
sometimes referred to as a "Proceeding"),  then the holders of Senior Debt shall
be entitled to receive payment in full of principal of (and premium, if any) and
interest,  if any,  on such Senior  Debt,  or  provision  shall be made for such
payment in cash or cash equivalents or otherwise in a manner satisfactory to the
holders of Senior  Debt,  before the Holders of the  Securities  are entitled to
receive or retain any payment or distribution of any kind or character,  whether
in cash, property or securities (including any payment or distribution which may
be  payable  or  deliverable  by reason of the  payment of any other Debt of the
Company (including any series of the Securities)  subordinated to the payment of
the Securities,  such payment or distribution being hereinafter referred to as a
"Junior Subordinated  Payment"), on account of principal of (or premium, if any)
or interest (including any Additional Interest) on the



Securities or on account of the purchase or other  acquisition  of Securities by
the Company or any  Subsidiary  and to that end the holders of Senior Debt shall
be entitled to receive,  for application to the payment thereof,  any payment or
distribution of any kind of character,  whether in cash, property or securities,
including any Junior Subordinated  Payment,  which may be payable or deliverable
in respect of the Securities in any such Proceeding.

       In the event  that,  notwithstanding  the  foregoing  provisions  of this
Section,  the  Trustee or the Holder of any  Security  shall have  received  any
payment  or  distribution  of assets of the  Company  of any kind or  character,
whether in cash,  property  or  securities,  including  any Junior  Subordinated
Payment,  before all Senior Debt is paid in full or payment  thereof is provided
for in cash or cash  equivalents  or otherwise in a manner  satisfactory  to the
holders of Senior Debt, and if such fact shall,  at or prior to the time of such
payment or distribution, have been made known to the Trustee or, as the case may
be, such Holder,  then and in such event such payment or  distribution  shall be
paid  over or  delivered  forthwith  to the  trustee  in  bankruptcy,  receiver,
liquidating trustee,  custodian,  assignee, agent or other Person making payment
or  distribution  of assets of the Company for application to the payment of all
Senior Debt remaining  unpaid, to the extent necessary to pay all Senior Debt in
full,  after giving effect to any concurrent  payment or  distribution to or for
the holders of Senior Debt.

       For purposes of this Article only, the words "any payment or distribution
of any kind or character,  whether in cash, property or securities" shall not be
deemed to include  shares of stock of the Company as  reorganized or readjusted,
or securities of the Company or any other corporation  provided for by a plan of
reorganization  or readjustment  which  securities are  subordinated in right of
payment to all then outstanding  Senior Debt to substantially the same extent as
the  Securities  are  so   subordinated   as  provided  in  this  Article.   The
consolidation  of the Company with,  or the merger of the Company into,  another
Person or the  liquidation or  dissolution of the Company  following the sale of
all or substantially  all of its properties and assets as an entirety to another
Person or the  liquidation or  dissolution of the Company  following the sale of
all or substantially  all of its properties and assets as an entirety to another
Person  upon the terms and  conditions  set forth in Article  Eight shall not be
deemed a Proceeding  for the  purposes of this  Section if the Person  formed by
such consolidation or into which the Company is merged or the



Person which acquires by sale such properties and assets as an entirety,  as the
case may be, shall, as a part of such consolidation, merger, or sale comply with
the conditions set forth in Article Eight.

        SECTION 1303.  Prior Payment to Senior Debt Upon Acceleration of
                       -------------------------------------------------
                       Securities.
                       ----------

       In the event that any  Securities  are  declared  due and payable  before
their  Stated  Maturity,  then and in such event the  holders of the Senior Debt
outstanding  at the time such  Securities  so become  due and  payable  shall be
entitled to receive  payment in full of all amounts due on or in respect of such
Senior Debt (including any amounts due upon acceleration), or provision shall be
made for such  payment  in cash or cash  equivalents  or  otherwise  in a manner
satisfactory to the holders of Senior Debt, before the Holders of the Securities
are entitled to receive any payment or  distribution  of any kind or  character,
whether in cash,  properties or securities  (including  any Junior  Subordinated
Payment) by the Company on account of the  principal of (or premium,  if any) or
interest (including any Additional  Interest) on the Securities or on account of
the  purchase  or  other  acquisition  of  Securities  by  the  Company  or  any
Subsidiary; provided, however, that nothing in this Section shall prevent the
            --------  -------
satisfaction of any sinking fund payment in accordance with this Indenture or as
otherwise  specified as  contemplated  by Section 301 for the  Securities of any
series by  delivering  and  crediting  pursuant to Section  1202 or as otherwise
specified  as  contemplated  by  Section  301 for the  Securities  of any series
Securities which have been acquired (upon redemption or otherwise) prior to such
declaration of acceleration.

       In the event that,  notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall make
any  payment  to the  Trustee or the Holder of any  Security  prohibited  by the
foregoing provisions of this Section, and if such fact shall, at or prior to the
time of such  payment,  have been made known to the  Trustee or, as the case may
be,  such  Holder,  then and in such event such  payment  shall be paid over and
delivered forthwith to the Company.

       (a) In the  event and  during  the  continuation  of any  default  in the
payment of principal of (or premium,  if any) or interest on any Senior Debt, or
in the event that any event of  default  with  respect to any Senior  Debt shall
have  occurred  and be  continuing  and shall have  resulted in such Senior Debt
becoming or being  declared due and payable  prior to the date on which it would
otherwise  have become due and  payable,  unless and until such event of default
shall  have  been  cured  or  waived  or shall  have  ceased  to exist  and such
acceleration  shall have been  rescinded  or  annulled,  or (b) in the event any
judicial proceeding shall be pending with respect to any such default in payment
or such  event  or  default,  then no  payment  or  distribution  of any kind or
character,  whether in cash,  properties  or  securities  (including  any Junior
Subordinated  Payment)  shall be made by the Company on account of  principal of
(or premium, if any) or interest (including any Additional Interest), if any, on
the Securities or on account of the purchase or other  acquisition of Securities
by the Company or any Subsidiary; provided, however, that nothing in this
                                  --------  -------
Section shall prevent the satisfaction of any sinking fund payment in accordance
with this Indenture or as otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 301 for
the  Securities  of any series by delivering  and crediting  pursuant to Section
1202 or as otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 301 for the Securities
of any series Securities which have been acquired (upon redemption or otherwise)
prior to such default in payment or event of default.

       In the event that,  notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall make
any  payment  to the  Trustee or the Holder of any  Security  prohibited  by the
foregoing provisions of this Section, and if such fact shall, at or prior to the
time of such  payment,  have been made known to the  Trustee or, as the case may
be,  such  Holder,  then and in such event such  payment  shall be paid over and
delivered forthwith to the Company.

       The  provisions  of this  Section  shall  not apply to any  payment  with
respect to which Section 1302 would be applicable.



        SECTION 1305.  Payment Permitted If No Default.
                       -------------------------------

       Nothing  contained in this  Article or elsewhere in this  Indenture or in
any of the Securities shall prevent (a) the Company, at any time except during
                                     -
the  pendency  of any  Proceeding  referred  to in  Section  1302 or  under  the
conditions described in Sections 1303 and 1304, from making payments at any time
of principal of (and premium, if any) or interest on the Securities, or (b) the
                                                                         -
application by the Trustee of any money or Government Obligations deposited with
it hereunder to the payment of or on account of the  principal of (and  premium,
if any) or interest (including any Additional Interest) on the Securities or the
retention of such payment by the Holders, if, at the time of such application by
the  Trustee,  it did not have  knowledge  that  such  payment  would  have been
prohibited by the provisions of this Article.

        SECTION 1306.  Subrogation to Rights of Holders of Senior Debt.
                       -----------------------------------------------

       Subject to the payment in full of all Senior Debt,  or the  provision for
such payment in cash or cash  equivalents or otherwise in a manner  satisfactory
to the holders of Senior Debt, the Holders of the Securities shall be subrogated
to the  extent of the  payments  or  distributions  made to the  holders of such
Senior Debt pursuant to the provisions of this Article (equally and ratably with
the holders of all  indebtedness  of the Company  which by its express  terms is
subordinated to Senior Debt of the Company to  substantially  the same extent as
the  Securities  are  subordinated  to the Senior  Debt and is  entitled to like
rights of subrogation by reason of any payments or distributions made to holders
of such Senior Debt) to the rights of the holders of such Senior Debt to receive
payments and  distributions of cash,  property and securities  applicable to the
Senior Debt until the  principal  of (and  premium,  if any) and interest on the
Securities  shall  be  paid  in  full.  For  purposes  of  such  subrogation  or
assignment,  no payments or  distributions  to the holders of the Senior Debt of
any cash,  property or securities to which the Holders of the  Securities or the
Trustee would be entitled  except for the  provisions  of this  Article,  and no
payments  over  pursuant  to the  provisions  of this  Article to the holders of
Senior Debt by Holders of the  Securities  or the Trustee,  shall,  as among the
Company, its creditors other than holders of Senior Debt, and the Holders of the
Securities,  be deemed to be a payment or  distribution  by the Company to or on
account of the Senior Debt.



        SECTION 1307.  Provisions Solely to Define Relative Rights.
                       -------------------------------------------

       The  provisions  of this  Article  are and are  intended  solely  for the
purpose of defining the relative  rights of the Holders of the Securities on the
one hand and the holders of Senior Debt on the other hand.  Nothing contained in
this Article or elsewhere in this  Indenture or in the Securities is intended to
or shall (a) impair, as between the Company and the Holders of the Securities,
          -
the obligations of the Company, which are absolute and unconditional,  to pay to
the  Holders  of the  Securities  the  principal  of (and  premium,  if any) and
interest  (including any Additional  Interest) on the Securities as and when the
same shall become due and payable in accordance with their terms; or (b) affect
                                                                      -
the relative  rights  against the Company of the Holders of the  Securities  and
creditors  of the Company  other than their rights in relation to the holders of
Senior Debt; or (c) prevent the Trustee or the Holder of any Security from
                 -
exercising all remedies otherwise permitted by applicable law upon default under
this Indenture  including,  without limitation,  filing and voting claims in any
Proceeding,  subject to the rights, if any, under this Article of the holders of
Senior  Debt to receive  cash,  property  and  securities  otherwise  payable or
deliverable to the Trustee or such Holder.

        SECTION 1308.  Trustee to Effectuate Subordination.
                       -----------------------------------

       Each Holder of a Security by his or her acceptance thereof authorizes and
directs the Trustee on his or her behalf to take such action as may be necessary
or appropriate to acknowledge or effectuate the  subordination  provided in this
Article and  appoints  the Trustee his or her  attorney-in-fact  for any and all
such purposes.

        SECTION 1309.  No Waiver of Subordination Provisions.
                       -------------------------------------

       No right of any  present or future  holder of any Senior  Debt to enforce
subordination  as herein  provided shall at any time in any way be prejudiced or
impaired  by any act or failure to act on the part of the  Company or by any act
or failure to act, in good faith, by any such holder, or by any noncompliance by
the  Company  with  the  terms,  provisions  and  covenants  of this  Indenture,
regardless  of any  knowledge  thereof  that  any  such  holder  may  have or be
otherwise charged with.




        SECTION 1310.  Notice to Trustee.
                       -----------------

       The Company shall give prompt  written  notice to the Trustee of any fact
known to the Company which would prohibit the making of any payment to or by the
Trustee in respect of the  Securities.  Notwithstanding  the  provisions of this
Article or any other  provision  of this  Indenture,  the  Trustee  shall not be
charged with  knowledge of the  existence of any facts which would  prohibit the
making of any payment to or by the Trustee in respect of the Securities,  unless
and until the  Trustee  shall have  received  written  notice  thereof  from the
Company or a holder of Senior Debt or from any trustee,  agent or representative
therefor (whether or not the facts contained in such notice are true); provided,
                                                                       --------
however, that if the Trustee shall not have received the notice provided for in
- -------
this  Section  at least two  Business  Days  prior to the date upon which by the
terms hereof any monies may become payable for any purpose  (including,  without
limitation,  the payment of the principal of (and  premium,  if any) or interest
(including any  Additional  Interest) on any Security),  then,  anything  herein
contained to the contrary notwithstanding, the Trustee shall have full power and
authority  to receive such monies and to apply the same to the purpose for which
they were received and shall not be affected by any notice to the contrary which
may be received by it within two Business Days prior to such date.

        SECTION 1311.  Reliance on Judicial Order or Certificate of Liquidating
                       --------------------------------------------------------
                       Agent.
                       -----

       Upon any payment or distribution of assets of the Company  referred to in
this  Article,  the Trustee,  subject to the  provisions of Article Six, and the
Holders of the  Securities  shall be  entitled  to rely upon any order or decree
entered  by any court of  competent  jurisdiction  in which such  Proceeding  is
pending,  or a certificate of the trustee in bankruptcy,  receiver,  liquidating
trustee, custodian, assignee for the benefit of creditors, agent or other Person
making such payment or distribution,  delivered to the Trustee or to the Holders
of  Securities,  for  the  purpose  of  ascertaining  the  Persons  entitled  to
participate in such payment or distribution,  the holders of the Senior Debt and
other  indebtedness of the Company,  the amount thereof or payable thereon,  the
amount or amounts  paid or  distributed  thereon and all other  facts  pertinent
thereto or to this Article.



        SECTION 1312.  Trustee Not Fiduciary for Holders of Senior Debt.
                       ------------------------------------------------

       The Trustee,  in its capacity as trustee under this Indenture,  shall not
be deemed to owe any fiduciary  duty to the holders of Senior Debt and shall not
be liable to any such holders if it shall in good faith  mistakenly  pay over or
distribute  to Holders of  Securities  or to the Company or to any other  Person
cash,  property  or  securities  to which any  holders  of Senior  Debt shall be
entitled by virtue of this Article or otherwise.

        SECTION 1313.  Rights of Trustee as Holder of Senior Debt; Preservation
                       --------------------------------------------------------
                       of Trustee's Rights.
                       --------------------

       The  Trustee in its  individual  capacity  shall be  entitled  to all the
rights set forth in this  Article  with  respect to any Senior Debt which may at
any time be held by it, to the same extent as any other  holder of Senior  Debt,
and nothing in this Indenture  shall deprive the Trustee of any of its rights as
such holder.

        SECTION 1314.  Article Applicable to Paying Agents.
                       -----------------------------------

       In case at any time any Paying  Agent other than the  Trustee  shall have
been appointed by the Company and be then acting  hereunder,  the term "Trustee"
as used in this  Article  shall  in such  case  (unless  the  context  otherwise
requires) be construed  as extending to and  including  such Paying Agent within
its meaning as fully for all intents and  purposes as if such Paying  Agent were
named in this Article in addition to or in place of the Trustee.

        SECTION 1315.  Certain Conversions or Exchanges Deemed Payment.
                       -----------------------------------------------

to  constitute  a payment or  distribution  on account of the  principal  of (or
premium, if any) or interest  (including any Additional  Interest) on Securities
or on account of the purchase or other acquisition of Securities, and (b) the
                                                                       -
payment, issuance or delivery of cash, property or securities (other than junior
securities)  upon  conversion  or  exchange  of a  Security  shall be  deemed to
constitute  payment  on  account  of the  principal  of such  security.  For the
purposes of this



Section, the term "junior securities" means (i) shares of any stock of any class
                                             -
of the Company and (ii) securities of the Company which are subordinated in
                    --
right of  payment to all Senior  Debt  which may be  outstanding  at the time of
issuance or delivery of such securities to substantially  the same extent as, or
to a greater extent than, the Securities are so subordinated as provided in this

                                -------
                  (a)        This Guarantee Agreement shall be held by
                           the Guarantee Trustee for the benefit of the
                           Holders, and the Guarantee Trustee shall not
                           transfer this Guarantee Agreement to any
                           Person except a Holder exercising his or her
                           rights pursuant to Section 504(iv) or to a
                           Successor Guarantee Trustee on acceptance by
                           such Successor Guarantee Trustee of its


 
                           appointment to act as Successor Guarantee Trustee.
                           The right, title and interest of the Guarantee
                           Trustee shall automatically vest in any Successor
                           Guarantee Trustee, upon acceptance by such Successor
                           Guarantee Trustee of its appointment hereunder, and
                           such vesting and cessation of title shall be
                           effective whether or not conveyancing documents have
                           been executed and delivered pursuant to the
                           appointment of such Successor Guarantee Trustee.

                  (b)        If an Event of Default has occurred and is
                           continuing, the Guarantee Trustee shall enforce this
                           Guarantee Agreement for the benefit of the Holders.

                  (c)        The Guarantee Trustee, before the
                           occurrence of any Event of Default and after
                           the curing of all Events of Default that may
                           have occurred, shall undertake to perform
                           only such duties as are specifically set
                           forth in this Guarantee Agreement, and no
                           implied covenants shall be read into this
                           Guarantee Agreement against the Guarantee
                           Trustee.  In case an Event of Default has
                           occurred (that has not been cured or waived
                           pursuant to Section 206), the Guarantee
                           Trustee shall exercise such of the rights and
                           powers vested in it by this Guarantee
                           Agreement, and use the same degree of care
                           and skill in its exercise thereof, as a
                           prudent person would exercise or use under
                           the circumstances in the conduct of his or
                           her own affairs.

                  (d)        No provision of this Guarantee Agreement shall be
                           construed to relieve the Guarantee Trustee from
                           liability for its own negligent action, its own
                           negligent failure to act or its own willful
                           misconduct, except that:

                  (i) prior to the occurrence of any Event of Default and after
         the curing or waiving of all such Events of Default that may have
         occurred:

                           (A) the duties and obligations of the Guarantee
                  Trustee shall be determined solely by the express provisions
                  of this Guarantee Agreement,


 
                  and the Guarantee Trustee shall not be liable except for the
                  performance of such duties and obligations as are specifically
                  set forth in this Guarantee Agreement; and

                           (B) in the absence of bad faith on the part of the
                  Guarantee Trustee, the Guarantee Trustee may conclusively
                  rely, as to the truth of the statements and the correctness of
                  the opinions expressed therein, upon any certificates or
                  opinions furnished to the Guarantee Trustee and con forming to
                  the requirements of this Guarantee Agreement; but in the case
                  of any such certifi cates or opinions that by any provision
                  hereof or of the Trust Indenture Act are specifically required
                  to be furnished to the Guarantee Trustee, the Guarantee
                  Trustee shall be under a duty to examine the same to determine
                  whether or not they conform to the requirements of this
                  Guarantee Agreement;

                  (ii) the Guarantee Trustee shall not be liable for any error
         of judgment made in good faith by a Responsible Officer of the
         Guarantee Trustee, unless it shall be proved that the Guarantee Trustee
         was negligent in ascertaining the pertinent facts upon which such
         judgment was made;

                  (iii) the Guarantee Trustee shall not be liable with respect
         to any action taken or omitted to be taken by it in good faith in
         accordance with the direction of the Holders of not less than a
         Majority in liquidation preference of the Preferred Securities relating
         to the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any
         remedy available to the Guarantee Trustee, or exercising any trust or
         power conferred upon the Guarantee Trustee under this Guarantee
         Agreement; and

                  (iv)  no provision of this Guarantee Agreement shall require
         the Guarantee Trustee to expend or risk its own funds or otherwise
         incur personal financial liability in the performance of any of its
         duties or in the exercise of any of its rights or powers, if the
         Guarantee Trustee shall have reasonable grounds for believing that the
         repayment of such funds or liability is not reasonably assured to it
         under the terms of this Guarantee Agreement or adequate indemnity
         against such risk or liability is not reasonably assured to it.

                                Trustee.
                                -------
                  (a)  Subject to the provisions of Section 301:

                     (i) The Guarantee Trustee may rely and shall be fully
         protected in acting or refraining from acting upon any resolution,
         certificate, statement, instrument, opinion, report, notice, request,
         direction, consent, order, bond, debenture, note, other evidence of
         indebtedness or other paper or document believed by it to be genuine
         and to have been signed, sent or presented by the proper party or
         parties.

                  (ii)   Any direction or act of the Guarantor contemplated by
         this Guarantee Agreement shall be sufficiently evidenced by an
         Officers' Certificate unless otherwise prescribed herein.

                  (iii)  Whenever, in the administration of this Guarantee
         Agreement, the Guarantee Trustee shall deem it desirable that a matter
         be proved or established before taking, suffering or omitting to take
         any action hereunder, the Guarantee Trustee (unless other evidence is
         herein specifically prescribed) may, in the absence of bad faith on its
         part, request and rely upon an Officers' Certificate which, upon
         receipt of such request from the Guarantee Trustee, shall be promptly
         delivered by the Guarantor.

                  (iv)   The Guarantee Trustee may consult with legal counsel,
         and the written advice or opinion of such legal counsel with respect to
         legal matters shall be full and complete authorization and protection
         in respect of any action taken, suffered or omitted to be taken by it
         hereunder in good faith and in accordance with such advice or opinion.
         Such legal counsel may be legal counsel to the Guarantor or any of its
         Affiliates and may be one of its employees. The Guarantee Trustee shall
         have the right at any time to seek instructions concerning the
         administration of this Guarantee Agreement from any court of competent
         jurisdiction.

                  (v)    The Guarantee Trustee shall be under no obligation to
         exercise any of the rights or powers vested in it by this Guarantee
         Agreement at the request or direction of any Holder, unless such Holder
         shall have provided to the Guarantee Trustee such adequate security and
         indemnity as would satisfy a reasonable


 
         person in the position of the Guarantee Trustee, against the costs,
         expenses (including attorneys' fees and expenses) and liabilities that
         might be incurred by it in complying with such request or direction,
         including such reasonable advances as may be requested by the
         Guarantee Trustee; provided that, nothing contained in this Section
         302(a)(v) shall be taken to relieve the Guarantee Trustee, upon the
         occurrence of an Event of Default, of its obligation to exercise the
         rights and powers vested in it by this Guarantee Agreement.

                  (vi)   The Guarantee Trustee shall not be bound to make any

         certificate, statement, instrument, opinion, report, notice, request,
         direction, consent, order, bond, debenture, note, other evidence of
         indebtedness or other paper or document, but the Guarantee Trustee, in
         its discretion, may make such further inquiry or investigation into
         such facts or matters as it may see fit.

                  (vii)  The Guarantee Trustee may execute any of the trusts or
         powers hereunder or perform any duties hereunder either directly or by
         or through its agents or attorneys, and the Guarantee Trustee shall not
         be responsible for any misconduct or negligence on the part of any such
         agent or attorney appointed with due care by it hereunder.

                  (viii) Whenever in the administration of this Guarantee
         Agreement the Guarantee Trustee shall deem it desirable to receive
         instructions with respect to enforcing any remedy or right or taking
         any other action hereunder, the Guarantee Trustee (A) may request
         instructions from the Holders, (B) may refrain from enforcing such
         remedy or right or taking such other action until such instructions are
         received, and (C) shall be protected in acting in accordance with such
         instructions.

                  (b)        No provision of this Guarantee Agreement
                           shall be deemed to impose any duty or
                           obligation on the Guarantee Trustee to
                           perform any act or acts or exercise any
                           right, power, duty or obligation conferred or
                           imposed on it in any jurisdiction in which it
                           shall be illegal, or in which the Guarantee
                           Trustee shall be unqualified or incompetent
                           in accordance with applicable law, to perform



 
                           any such act or acts or to exercise any such right,
                           power, duty or obligation. No permissive power or
                           authority available to the Guarantee Trustee shall be
                           construed to be a duty to act in accordance with such
                           power and authority.

liability in connection with the exercise or performance of any of its powers
or duties hereunder. The Guarantee Trustee will not claim or exact any lien or
charge on any Guarantee Payments as a result of any amount due to it under this
Guarantee Agreement.

                  (a)        There shall at all times be a Guarantee
                           Trustee which shall:

                  (i)  not be an Affiliate of the Guarantor; and

         Indenture Act to act as such and has a combined capital and surplus of
         at least 50 million U.S. dollars ($50,000,000), and shall be a

         its combined capital and surplus as set forth in its most recent report
         of condition so published.


 
                  (b)       If at any time the Guarantee Trustee shall cease to
                           be eligible to so act under Section 401(a), the
                           Guarantee Trustee shall immediately resign in the

                  (c)       If the Guarantee Trustee has or shall acquire any
                           "conflicting interest" within the meaning of Section
                           310(b) of the Trust Indenture Act, the Guarantee
                           Trustee and Guarantor shall in all respects comply

                           Trustee may be appointed or removed without

                           Successor Guarantee Trustee has been appointed and
                           has accepted such appointment by written instrument
                           executed by such Successor Guarantee Trustee and
                           delivered to

                           the Guarantor.

                  (c)        The Guarantee Trustee appointed hereunder

                           Trustee shall have been appointed or until
                           its removal or resignation.  The Guarantee
                           Trustee may resign from office (without need
                           for prior or subsequent accounting) by an
                           instrument in writing executed by the
                           Guarantee Trustee and delivered to the
                           Guarantor, which resignation shall not take
                           effect until a Successor Guarantee Trustee
                           has been appointed and has accepted such
                           appointment by instrument in writing executed
                           by such Successor Guarantee Trustee and
                           delivered to the Guarantor and the resigning
                           Guarantee Trustee.

                  (d)        If no Successor Guarantee Trustee shall have been
                           appointed and accepted appointment as provided in
                           this Section 402 within 60 days after delivery to the
                           Guarantor of an instrument of resignation, the
                           resigning

                           Guarantor, any court of competent jurisdiction for
                           appointment of a Successor Guarantee Trustee. Such
                           court may thereupon, after prescribing such notice,
                           if any, as it may deem proper, appoint a Successor
                           Guarantee Trustee.

                  The Guarantor irrevocably and unconditionally agrees to pay in
full to the Holders the Guarantee Payments (without duplication of amounts
theretofore paid by or on behalf of the Issuer), as and when due, regardless of
any defense, right of set-off or counterclaim which the Issuer may have or
assert. The Guarantor's obligation to make a Guarantee Payment may be satisfied

                                --------------------

                                -----------------------

                  The Guarantor acknowledges that its obligations hereunder are
independent of the obligations of the Issuer with respect to the Preferred
Securities and that the Guarantor shall be liable as principal and as debtor
hereunder to make Guarantee Payments pursuant to the terms of this


 
Guarantee Agreement notwithstanding the occurrence of any event referred to in
subsections (a) through (g), inclusive, of Section 503 hereof.

                                ---------------------

                  SECTION 701.  Termination.
                                -----------
                  This Guarantee Agreement shall terminate and be of no further
force and effect upon (i) full payment of the Redemption Price of all Preferred
Securities, (ii) the distribution of Debentures to the Holders in ex change for
all of the Preferred Securities or (iii) full payment of the amounts payable in
accordance with the Trust Agreement upon liquidation of the Issuer.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Guarantee Agreement will continue to be
effective or will be reinstated, as the case may be, if at any time any Holder
must restore payment of any sums paid with respect to Preferred Securities or
this Guarantee Agreement.

                           CREDIT  FACILITY  AGREEMENT  (as it  may be  amended,
                           supplemented or otherwise modified,  the "Agreement")
                           dated as of December  20,  1996,  among ITT  HARTFORD
                           GROUP, INC., a Delaware  corporation (the "Company"),
                           each Borrowing  Subsidiary party hereto,  the lenders
                           listed  in  Schedule   2.01   (together   with  their
                           permitted  assignees,  the  "Lenders")  and THE CHASE
                           MANHATTAN  BANK, a New York banking  corporation,  as
                           administrative   agent  for  the   Lenders  (in  such
                           capacity, the "Administrative Agent").


                  The  Lenders  have  been  requested  to  extend  credit to the
Borrowers  (such term and each  other  capitalized  term used but not  otherwise
defined herein having the meaning  assigned to them in Article I) to enable them
to borrow on a standby  revolving  credit basis on and after the date hereof and
at any time and from time to time prior to the Maturity Date a principal  amount
not in excess of $1,500,000,000  at any time outstanding.  The Lenders have also
been requested to provide a procedure pursuant to which the Borrowers may invite
the  Lenders to bid on an  uncommitted  basis on  short-term  borrowings  by the
Borrowers.  The proceeds of such  borrowings are to be used for working  capital
and other general corporate  purposes.  The Lenders are willing to extend credit
on the terms and subject to the conditions herein set forth.

                  Accordingly, the parties hereto agree as follows:


                                                 ARTICLE I

                                                DEFINITIONS

               SECTION  1.01.  Defined  Terms.  As used in this  Agreement,  the
following terms shall have the meanings specified below:

               "ABR Borrowing" shall mean a Borrowing comprised of ABR Loans.

               "ABR Loan" shall mean any ABR Standby Loan.

               "ABR Standby  Loan" shall mean any Standby Loan bearing  interest
at a rate  determined by reference to the Alternate Base Rate in accordance with
the provisions of Article II.

               "Administrative  Fees"  shall have the  meaning  assigned to such
term in Section 2.06(b).

               "Administrative   Questionnaire"  shall  mean  an  Administrative
Questionnaire in the form of Exhibit B hereto.

                  "Affiliate"  shall mean, when used with respect to a specified
person,  another person that directly or indirectly controls or is controlled by
or is under common control with the person specified.


               "Agreement Currency" shall have the meaning assigned to such term
in Section 9.16(b).

               "Alternate  Base Rate" shall mean,  for any day, a rate per annum
(rounded upwards, if necessary,  to the next 1/16 of 1%) equal to the greater of
(a) the Prime  Rate in effect on such day and (b) the  Federal  Funds  Effective
Rate in effect on such day plus 1/2 of 1%. For  purposes  hereof,  "Prime  Rate"
shall mean the rate of interest per annum  publicly  announced from time to time
by the Administrative  Agent as its prime rate in effect at its principal office
in New York City;  each change in the Prime Rate shall be  effective on the date
such change is publicly  announced as effective.  "Federal Funds Effective Rate"
shall mean, for any day, the weighted average of the rates on overnight  Federal
funds  transactions  with  members of the  Federal  Reserve  System  arranged by
Federal funds brokers,  as released on the next  succeeding  Business Day by the
Federal  Reserve  Bank of New York,  or, if such rate is not so released for any
day which is a Business Day, the arithmetic average (rounded upwards to the next
1/100th of 1%), as determined by the Administrative Agent, of the quotations for
the day of such  transactions  received by the  Administrative  Agent from three
Federal funds brokers of recognized  standing  selected by it. If for any reason
the  Administrative  Agent shall have determined (which  determination  shall be
conclusive  absent  manifest  error) that it is unable to ascertain  the Federal
Funds  Effective Rate for any reason,  including the inability or failure of the
Administrative  Agent to obtain  sufficient  quotations in  accordance  with the
terms  thereof,  the Alternate  Base Rate shall be determined  without regard to
clause (b) of the first  sentence  of this  definition  until the  circumstances
giving rise to such inability no longer exist.  Any change in the Alternate Base
Rate due to a change in the Prime Rate or the Federal Funds Effective Rate shall
be  effective  on the  effective  date of such  change in the Prime  Rate or the
Federal Funds Effective Rate, respectively.

               "Annual  Statement"  shall mean,  with respect to the  Restricted
Subsidiaries,  the Annual Statement of such Restricted Subsidiary required to be
filed with the  Applicable  Insurance  Regulatory  Authority in accordance  with
state law, including any exhibits, schedules, certificates or actuarial opinions
filed or delivered therewith.

               "Applicable  Insurance  Regulatory  Authority"  shall mean,  with
respect  to any  Insurance  Subsidiary,  the  insurance  commission  or  similar
Governmental  Authority located in the state in which such Insurance  Subsidiary
is domiciled and any Federal insurance Governmental Authority.

               "Applicable  Percentage"  shall mean on any date, with respect to
Eurocurrency  Standby Loans or with respect to the Facility Fee, as the case may
be, the applicable  percentage  set forth below under the caption  "Eurocurrency
Spread" or "Facility Fee Percentage", as the case may be, based upon the Ratings
in effect on such date:

- ----------                  -------------------         -----------------------

AA- or higher by D&P;              .115%                           .060%

A1 or A2 by Moody's;
A+ or A by S&P



Category 3
- ----------

A- by D&P;                         .170%                           .080%

Category 5
- ----------

BBB by D&P;                        .225%                           .125%
Baa2 by Moody's;

For purposes of the  foregoing,  (i) if the Ratings shall fall within  different
Categories,  the Applicable Percentage shall be based upon the Category in which
the largest number of Ratings falls or is deemed to fall; provided that if there
shall be no such Category, one Rating shall be excluded from each of the highest
and the lowest  Categories in which Ratings shall fall or be deemed to fall, and
the Applicable Percentage shall be based upon the remaining Rating; (ii) if only
two  Ratings  exist,  the  Applicable  Percentage  shall be based upon the lower
(numerically  higher Category) of the available Ratings,  (iii) if only a single
Rating  exists,  the  Applicable  Percentage  shall  be  based  upon  the  lower
(numerically higher) of Category 5 and the Category  corresponding to the single
available Rating; provided, however, that if only a single rating exists because
D&P,  Moody's  or S&P  ceases  to be in the  business  of rating  the  Company's
corporate debt  obligations,  the Applicable  Percentage shall be based upon the
Category  in which such  single  Rating  falls;  (iv) if no Ratings  exist,  the
Applicable  Percentage  shall be based  upon  Category  6, and (v) if any Rating
shall be changed (other than as a result of a change in the rating system of the
applicable  Rating  Agency),  such change  shall be  effective as of the date on
which it is first  announced by the Rating Agency making such change.  Each such
change in the Applicable Percentage shall apply to all outstanding  Eurocurrency
Standby Loans during the period  commencing on the effective date of such change
and ending on the date immediately preceding the effective date of the next such
change.  If the rating  system of any Rating  Agency shall  change,  the parties
hereto shall negotiate in good faith to amend the references to specific ratings
in this definition to reflect such changed rating system.

Insurance  Subsidiary,  SAP,  in  each  case as in  effect  from  time to  time;
provided, however, that for purposes of determining compliance with any covenant
set forth in Article V, such terms shall be construed in accordance with GAAP or
SAP,  as  applicable,  as in  effect  on the  date  hereof  applied  on a  basis
consistent  with  the  application  used  in  preparing  the  Company's  audited
financial statements referred to in Section 3.05.


                                   ARTICLE II

                                   THE CREDITS

               SECTION  2.01.   Commitments.   (a)  Subject  to  the  terms  and
conditions and relying upon the representations and warranties herein set forth,
each Lender  agrees,  severally  and not jointly,  to make Standby  Loans to the
Borrowers, at any time and from time to time on and after the Effective Date and
until the earlier of the Maturity Date and the  termination of the Commitment of
such Lender.
               (b)  Subject to the terms and  conditions  and  relying  upon the
representations  and  warranties  set forth herein and in the  applicable  Local
Currency Addendum, each Local Currency Lender agrees, severally and not jointly,
to make Local  Currency Loans to the Borrowers at any time and from time to time
on and after the execution of the applicable  Local Currency  Addendum and until
the earlier of the Maturity Date and the  termination  of the Commitment (or the
commitment under such Local Currency Addendum) of such Local Currency Lender.

               (c)  Notwithstanding  anything to the contrary  contained in this
Agreement,  in no event may Standby  Loans or Local  Currency  Loans be borrowed
under this  Article II if, after giving  effect  thereto (and to any  concurrent
repayment or prepayment of Loans),  (i) the sum of the aggregate  Standby Credit
Exposures and the aggregate  Competitive  Loan Exposures  would exceed the Total
Commitment then in effect,  (ii) the Standby Credit Exposure of any Lender would
exceed such Lender's  Commitment or (iii) the Dollar Equivalent of the aggregate
principal amount of outstanding  Local Currency Loans denominated in a specified
Local  Currency  would exceed the applicable  Local  Currency  Facility  Maximum
Borrowing Amount.

               Within the foregoing  limits,  the  Borrowers may borrow,  pay or
prepay and reborrow  Standby Loans and Local  Currency Loans  hereunder,  on and
after the Effective Date and prior to the Maturity  Date,  subject to the terms,
conditions and limitations set forth herein.



               SECTION 2.02.  Loans. (a) Each Standby Loan shall be made as part
of a  Borrowing  consisting  of  Standby  Loans made by the  Lenders  ratably in
accordance with their respective Available Commitments;  provided, however, that
the failure of any Lender to make any Standby  Loan shall not in itself  relieve
any other  Lender of its  obligation  to lend  hereunder  (it being  understood,
however, that no Lender shall be responsible for the failure of any other Lender
to make any Loan required to be made by such other Lender).  Each Local Currency
Loan shall be made as part of a Borrowing  consisting  of Local  Currency  Loans
made by the Local  Currency  Lenders  ratably in accordance  with the applicable
Local Currency Lender Maximum Borrowing  Amounts;  provided,  however,  that the
failure of any Local  Currency  Lender to make any Local Currency Loan shall not
in itself  relieve any other Local  Currency  Lender of its  obligation  to lend
hereunder (it being understood,  however, that no Local Currency Lender shall be
responsible for the failure of any other Local Currency Lender to make any Local
Currency Loan  required to be made by such other Local  Currency  Lender).  Each
Competitive  Loan shall be made in accordance  with the  procedures set forth in
Section 2.03.  The Loans  comprising  any Borrowing  shall be (i) in the case of
Competitive  Loans,  in an  aggregate  principal  amount  which  is an  integral
multiple of $1,000,000 and not less than $5,000,000, (ii) in the case of Standby
Loans,  in an  aggregate  principal  amount  which is an  integral  multiple  of
$5,000,000 and not less than $20,000,000 (or an aggregate principal amount equal
to the remaining balance of the Available  Commitments) and (iii) in the case of
Local Currency Loans, in an aggregate  principal  amount which complies with the
requirements  set forth in the applicable Local Currency  Addendum.  All Standby
Loans  and  Competitive  Loans  made  pursuant  to  this  Article  II  shall  be
denominated in Dollars.

               (b) Each  Competitive  Borrowing  shall be comprised  entirely of
Eurocurrency  Competitive  Loans or Fixed Rate Loans, and each Standby Borrowing
shall be comprised  entirely of Eurocurrency  Standby Loans or ABR Loans, as the
Borrower  may request  pursuant to Section  2.03 or 2.04,  as  applicable.  Each
Lender may at its option make any  Eurocurrency  Loan by causing any domestic or
foreign branch,  agency or Affiliate of such Lender to make such Loan;  provided
that any exercise of such option shall not affect the obligation of the Borrower
to repay such Loan in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. Borrowings of
more than one Type may be  outstanding  at the same time.  For  purposes  of the
foregoing,  Loans having different Interest Periods,  regardless of whether they
commence on the same date, shall be considered separate Loans.

               (c)  Subject  to  Section  2.05  and,  in the  case of any  Local
Currency Loan, to any alternative  procedures set forth in the applicable  Local
Currency  Addendum,  each Lender shall make each Loan to be made by it hereunder
on the proposed date thereof by wire transfer of immediately  available funds to
the  Administrative  Agent in New York, New York, not later than 12:00 noon, New
York City time, and the  Administrative  Agent shall by 2:00 p.m., New York City
time,  credit the amounts so received to the account or accounts  specified from
time  to  time  in  one  or  more  notices  delivered  by  the  Company  to  the
Administrative Agent or, if a Borrowing shall not occur on such date because any
condition precedent herein specified shall not have been met, return the amounts
so received to the respective  Lenders.  Competitive  Loans shall be made by the
Lender or Lenders  whose  Competitive  Bids  therefor are  accepted  pursuant to
Section 2.03 in the amounts so accepted.  Standby Loans and Local Currency Loans
shall be made by the Lenders and the Local Currency Lenders, as applicable,  pro
rata in accordance with Section 2.16. Unless the Administrative Agent shall have
received  notice  from a  Lender  prior  to the  date  (or,  in the  case of ABR
Borrowings,  on the  date)  of any  Borrowing  that  such  Lender  will not make
available to the  Administrative  Agent such Lender's portion of such Borrowing,
the  Administrative  Agent may assume  that such  Lender  has made such  portion
available  to the  Administrative  Agent  on  the  date  of  such  Borrowing  in
accordance with this paragraph (c) and the Administrative Agent may, in reliance
upon  such   assumption,   make  available  to  the  Borrower  on  such  date  a
corresponding  amount in the required  currency.  If and to the extent that such
Lender shall not have made such portion available to the  Administrative  Agent,
such Lender and the Borrower severally



agree  to  repay  to  the   Administrative   Agent   forthwith  on  demand  such
corresponding  amount together with interest thereon in such currency,  for each
day from the date such amount is made  available to the Borrower  until the date
such  amount  is repaid  to the  Administrative  Agent at (i) in the case of the
Borrower,  the interest rate applicable at the time to the Loans comprising such
Borrowing  and  (ii) in the  case  of  such  Lender,  a rate  determined  by the
Administrative  Agent to represent its cost of overnight  funds.  If such Lender
shall repay to the Administrative  Agent such corresponding  amount, such amount
shall  constitute  such Lender's Loan as part of such  Borrowing for purposes of
this Agreement.

               (d) Each  Competitive  Loan shall be a  Eurocurrency  Competitive
Loan or a Fixed Rate Loan.  Each  Standby Loan shall be a  Eurocurrency  Standby
Loan or an ABR Standby Loan.  Each Local  Currency Loan shall be a  Eurocurrency
Local Currency Loan or shall bear interest at a rate specified in the applicable
Loan Currency Addendum.

               SECTION 2.03. Competitive Bid Procedure.  (a) In order to request
Competitive  Bids, a Borrower (the "Applicable  Borrower") shall hand deliver or
telecopy to the Administrative Agent a duly completed Competitive Bid Request in
the form of Exhibit A-1 hereto, to be received by the  Administrative  Agent (i)
in the case of a Eurocurrency  Competitive  Loan, not later than 10:00 a.m., New
York City time, four Business Days before a proposed  Competitive  Borrowing and
(ii) in the case of a Fixed Rate Borrowing,  not later than 10:00 a.m., New York
City time, one Business Day before a proposed Competitive Borrowing. No ABR Loan
shall be  requested  in, or made  pursuant  to, a  Competitive  Bid  Request.  A
Competitive  Bid Request  that does not conform  substantially  to the format of
Exhibit A-1 may be rejected in the Administrative  Agent's sole discretion,  and
the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify the Borrower of such rejection by
telecopy. Each Competitive Bid Request shall refer to this Agreement and specify
(w) whether the Borrowing then being requested is to be a Eurocurrency Borrowing
or a Fixed Rate  Borrowing,  (x) the date of such  Borrowing  (which  shall be a
Business Day) and the  aggregate  principal  amount  thereof which shall be in a
minimum  principal  amount  of  $10,000,000  and  in  an  integral  multiple  of
$5,000,000 and (y) the Interest  Period with respect  thereto (which may not end
after the  Maturity  Date).  Promptly  after its  receipt of a  Competitive  Bid
Request  that is not  rejected  as  aforesaid,  the  Administrative  Agent shall
telecopy to the Lenders a Notice of Competitive Bid Request inviting the Lenders
to bid,  on the terms and  conditions  of this  Agreement,  to make  Competitive
Loans.

               (b) Each Lender invited to bid may, in its sole discretion,  make
one or more  Competitive  Bids to the  Applicable  Borrower  responsive  to such
Borrower's  Competitive  Bid Request.  Each  Competitive Bid by a Lender must be
received by the  Administrative  Agent by  telecopy,  in the form of Exhibit A-3
hereto, (i) in the case of a Eurocurrency  Competitive Loan, not later than 9:30
a.m.,  New York City time,  three  Business  Days before a proposed  Competitive
Borrowing  and (ii) in the case of a Fixed Rate  Borrowing,  not later than 9:30
a.m.,  New York City time,  on the day of a proposed  Competitive  Borrowing.  A
Lender may submit multiple bids to the  Administrative  Agent.  Competitive Bids
that do not conform  substantially  to the format of Exhibit A-3 may be rejected
by the  Administrative  Agent,  and the  Administrative  Agent shall  notify the
Lender making such  nonconforming  bid of such rejection as soon as practicable.
Each Competitive Bid shall refer to this Agreement and specify (x) the principal
amount (which shall be in a minimum  principal  amount of  $5,000,000  and in an
integral  multiple of $1,000,000 and which may equal the entire principal amount
of the Competitive  Borrowing  requested) of the Competitive  Loan or Loans that
the Lender is willing to make,  (y) the  Competitive  Bid Rate or Rates at which
the  Lender  is  prepared  to make the  Competitive  Loan or  Loans  and (z) the
Interest  Period and the last day  thereof.  If any Lender  invited to bid shall
elect  not  to  make  a  Competitive  Bid,  such  Lender  shall  so  notify  the
Administrative  Agent by telecopy  (I) in the case of  Eurocurrency  Competitive
Loans, not later than



9:30 a.m., New York City time, three Business Days before a proposed Competitive
Borrowing,  and (II) in the case of Fixed Rate Loans,  not later than 9:30 a.m.,
New York City time, on the day of a proposed  Competitive  Borrowing;  provided,
however,  that  failure by any Lender to give such  notice  shall not cause such
Lender to be obligated to make any Competitive  Loan as part of such Competitive
Borrowing.  A Competitive  Bid submitted by a Lender  pursuant to this paragraph
(b) shall be irrevocable.

               (c) The  Administrative  Agent shall as  promptly as  practicable
notify  the  Borrower,  by  telecopy,  of all the  Competitive  Bids  made,  the
Competitive  Bid Rate  and the  principal  amount  of each  Competitive  Loan in
respect of which a Competitive  Bid was made and the identity of the Lender that
made each bid.  The  Administrative  Agent shall send a copy of all  Competitive
Bids to the Borrower for its records as soon as practicable  after completion of
the bidding process set forth in this Section 2.03.

               (d) The Borrower may in its sole and absolute discretion, subject
only to the provisions of this paragraph (d),  accept or reject any  Competitive
Bid  referred  to  in  paragraph  (c)  above.  The  Borrower  shall  notify  the
Administrative  Agent  by  telephone,  confirmed  by  telecopy  in the form of a
Competitive Bid Accept/Reject Letter,  whether and to what extent it has decided
to accept or reject any of or all the bids  referred to in  paragraph  (c) above
not more than one hour  after it shall  have been  notified  of such bids by the
Administrative Agent pursuant to such paragraph (c); provided, however, that (i)
the  failure  of the  Borrower  to give  such  notice  shall be  deemed  to be a
rejection of all the bids referred to in paragraph (c) above,  (ii) the Borrower
shall  not  accept a bid  made at a  particular  Competitive  Bid Rate if it has
decided  to  reject  a bid  made at a lower  Competitive  Bid  Rate,  (iii)  the
aggregate  amount of the  Competitive  Bids  accepted by the Borrower  shall not
exceed the principal  amount  specified in the Competitive Bid Request,  (iv) if
the Borrower  shall accept a bid or bids made at a  particular  Competitive  Bid
Rate but the amount of such bid or bids shall cause the total  amount of bids to
be accepted to exceed the amount specified in the Competitive Bid Request,  then
the  Borrower  shall  accept a portion of such bid or bids in an amount equal to
the amount specified in the Competitive Bid Request less the amount of all other
Competitive  Bids accepted with respect to such  Competitive Bid Request,  which
acceptance,  in the case of multiple bids at such Competitive Bid Rate, shall be
made pro rata in accordance with the amount of each such bid at such Competitive
Bid Rate, and (v) except pursuant to clause (iv) above, no bid shall be accepted
for a Competitive Loan unless such  Competitive  Loan is in a minimum  principal
amount of $5,000,000 and an integral  multiple of $1,000,000;  provided further,
however,  that if a Competitive  Loan must be in an amount less than  $5,000,000
because of the provisions of clause (iv) above, such Competitive Loan may be for
a minimum of $1,000,000 or any integral multiple thereof, and in calculating the
pro rata  allocation of acceptances of portions of multiple bids at a particular
Competitive  Bid Rate  pursuant to clause  (iv) the amounts  shall be rounded to
integral multiples of $1,000,000 in a manner which shall be in the discretion of
the  Borrower.   A  notice  given  pursuant  to  this  paragraph  (d)  shall  be
irrevocable.

               (e) The  Administrative  Agent shall promptly notify each bidding
Lender whether or not its  Competitive Bid has been accepted (and if so, in what
amount and at what Competitive Bid Rate) by telecopy, and each successful bidder
will thereupon become bound, subject to the other applicable  conditions hereof,
to make the Competitive Loan in respect of which its bid has been accepted.

               (f) No Competitive Borrowing shall be requested or made hereunder
if after giving effect  thereto any of the conditions set forth in paragraph (c)
of Section 2.01 would not be met.

               (g)  If  the  Administrative   Agent  shall  elect  to  submit  a
Competitive  Bid in its capacity as a Lender,  it shall submit such bid directly
to the  Applicable  Borrower one quarter of an hour earlier than the latest time
at  which  the  other   Lenders  are  required  to  submit  their  bids  to  the
Administrative Agent pursuant to paragraph (b) above.



               (h) All notices  required by this  Section 2.03 shall be given in
accordance with Section 9.01.

               SECTION 2.04. Standby and Local Currency Borrowing Procedure. (a)
In order to  request a Standby  Borrowing,  a  Borrower  shall  hand  deliver or
telecopy to the Administrative  Agent a duly completed Standby Borrowing Request
in the form of Exhibit A-5 (i) in the case of a  Eurocurrency  Standby Loan, not
later than 10:30 a.m., New York City time (or, if the Standby  Borrowing request
is delivered or telecopied  to the  Administrative  Agent in London,  9:30 a.m.,
London time), three Business Days before such Borrowing, and (ii) in the case of
an ABR  Borrowing,  not later than 10:30 a.m., New York City time, on the day of
such  Borrowing.  No Fixed Rate Loan shall be  requested  or made  pursuant to a
Standby  Borrowing  Request.  Such notice shall be irrevocable and shall in each
case  specify  (A)  whether  the  Borrowing  then  being  requested  is  to be a
Eurocurrency  Standby  Loan or an ABR  Borrowing;  (B) the date of such  Standby
Borrowing  (which shall be a Business  Day) and the amount  thereof;  and (C) if
such  Borrowing is to be a Eurocurrency  Standby Loan, the Interest  Period with
respect thereto,  which shall not end after the Maturity Date. If no election as
to the Type of Standby  Borrowing  is  specified  in any such  notice,  then the
requested  Standby  Borrowing  shall be an ABR Borrowing.  If no Interest Period
with respect to any  Eurocurrency  Standby Loan is specified in any such notice,
then the  Borrower  shall be deemed to have  selected an Interest  Period of one
month's duration.  Notwithstanding  any other provision of this Agreement to the
contrary,  no Standby  Borrowing  shall be requested if the Interest Period with
respect  thereto would end after the Maturity  Date.  The  Administrative  Agent
shall  promptly  advise each of the Lenders of any notice given pursuant to this
Section 2.04 and of each Lender's portion of the requested Borrowing.

               (b) In order to request a Local  Currency  Borrowing,  a Borrower
shall give the notice required under the applicable Local Currency  Addendum and
shall simultaneously deliver a copy of such notice to the Administrative Agent.

               SECTION 2.05.  Conversion and Continuation of Standby Loans. Each
Borrower shall have the right at any time upon prior  irrevocable  notice to the
Administrative  Agent (i) not later than 10:30 a.m.,  New York City time, on the
day of the conversion,  to convert all or any part of any  Eurocurrency  Standby
Loan into an ABR Standby Loan, and (ii) not later than 10:30 a.m., New York City
time,  three Business Days prior to conversion or  continuation,  to convert any
ABR  Standby  Loan  into  a  Eurocurrency   Standby  Loan  or  to  continue  any
Eurocurrency  Standby  Loan as a  Eurocurrency  Standby  Loan for an  additional
Interest Period, subject in each case to the following:

               (a) if less  than all the  outstanding  principal  amount  of any
          Standby  Borrowing  shall be converted  or  continued,  the  aggregate
          principal amount of the Standby Borrowing converted or continued shall
          be an integral multiple of $5,000,000 and not less than $20,000,000;

               (b) accrued interest on a Standby  Borrowing (or portion thereof)
          being  converted  shall  be  paid  by  the  Borrower  at the  time  of
          conversion;

               (c) if any Eurocurrency Standby Loan is converted at a time other
          than the end of the Interest Period applicable  thereto,  the Borrower
          shall pay,  upon  demand,  any amounts due to the Lenders  pursuant to
          Section 2.15;

               (d) any portion of a Standby Borrowing maturing or required to be
          repaid in less than one month may not be  converted  into or continued
          as a Eurocurrency Standby Loan;


               (e) any portion of a  Eurocurrency  Standby  Loan which cannot be
          continued as a Eurocurrency Standby Loan by reason of clause (d) above
          shall be automatically  converted at the end of the Interest Period in
          effect for such Eurocurrency Standby Loan into an ABR Borrowing;

               (f) no  Interest  Period  may be  selected  for any  Eurocurrency
          Standby Borrowing that would end later than the Maturity Date; and

               (g) at any time when there shall have  occurred and be continuing
          any Default or Event of Default, no Borrowing may be converted into or
          continued as a Eurocurrency Standby Loan.

          Each notice  pursuant to this  Section 2.05 shall be  irrevocable  and
shall refer to this  Agreement  and specify (i) the  identity  and amount of the
Standby  Borrowing  to be  converted  or  continued,  (ii)  whether such Standby
Borrowing is to be converted to or continued as a  Eurocurrency  Standby Loan or
an ABR Standby Loan,  (iii) if such notice  requests a  conversion,  the date of
such  conversion  (which  shall be a  Business  Day)  and  (iv) if such  Standby
Borrowing is to be converted to or continued as a Eurocurrency Standby Loan, the
Interest Period with respect thereto.  If no Interest Period is specified in any
such notice with respect to any conversion to or  continuation as a Eurocurrency
Standby Loan, the Borrower  shall be deemed to have selected an Interest  Period
of one month's  duration.  If no notice shall have been given in accordance with
this  Section 2.05 to convert or continue  any Standby  Borrowing,  such Standby
Borrowing  shall, at the end of the Interest Period  applicable  thereto (unless
repaid  pursuant to the terms  hereof),  automatically  be continued  into a new
Interest Period as an ABR Standby Loan.

          SECTION  2.06.  Fees.  (a) The Company  agrees to pay to each  Lender,
through the  Administrative  Agent, on each March 31, June 30,  September 30 and
December 31 (with the first  payment being due on December 31, 1996) and on each
date on which the  Commitment  of such Lender  shall be  terminated  as provided
herein,  a facility  fee (a  "Facility  Fee"),  at a rate per annum equal to the
Applicable  Percentage  from  time  to  time  in  effect  on the  amount  of the
Commitment of such Lender,  whether used or unused, during the preceding quarter
(or other period  commencing on the Effective  Date, or ending with the Maturity
Date or any date on which the  Commitment  of such Lender shall be  terminated).
All  Facility  Fees shall be computed on the basis of the actual  number of days
elapsed in a year of 365 or 366 days,  as the case may be. The  Facility Fee due
to each Lender shall commence to accrue on the Effective Date and shall cease to
accrue on the earlier of the Maturity Date and the termination of the Commitment
of such Lender as provided herein.

          (b) The Company agrees to pay the  Administrative  Agent,  for its own
account,  the  administrative and other fees separately agreed to by the Company
and the Administrative Agent (the "Administrative Fees").

          (c) All Fees shall be paid on the dates due, in immediately  available
funds,  to the  Administrative  Agent for  distribution,  if and as appropriate,
among the  Lenders,  except  that the  Administrative  Agent  Fees shall be paid
pursuant to paragraph (b) above. Once paid, none of the Fees shall be refundable
under any circumstances.

          SECTION 2.07. Repayment of Loans;  Evidence of Debt. (a) Each Borrower
hereby  agrees that the  outstanding  principal  balance of each Standby Loan or
Local  Currency  Loan shall be payable on the  Maturity  Date (unless an earlier
date is specified in the Local Currency Addendum relating to such Local Currency
Loan) and that the outstanding principal balance of each Competitive



Loan shall be payable on the last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto.
Each Loan shall bear interest on the  outstanding  principal  balance thereof as
set forth in Section 2.08.

          (b) Each Lender shall  maintain in accordance  with its usual practice
an account or accounts evidencing the indebtedness to such Lender resulting from
each Loan  made by such  Lender  from time to time,  including  the  amounts  of
principal  and interest  payable and paid to such Lender from time to time under
this Agreement.

          (c) The  Administrative  Agent shall (i) maintain accounts in which it
will  record (A) the amount of each Loan made  hereunder,  the  currency of each
Loan,  the  Borrower of each Loan,  the Type of each Loan made and the  Interest
Period applicable  thereto,  (B) the amount of any principal or interest due and
payable or to become due and payable from each Borrower to each Lender hereunder
and (C) the amount of any sum  received by the  Administrative  Agent  hereunder
from each Borrower and each Lender's share thereof and (ii) provide a summary to
the Company in writing on a quarterly basis.

          (d) The entries made in the accounts maintained pursuant to paragraphs
(b) and (c) of this Section 2.07 shall,  to the extent  permitted by  applicable
law, be prima facie  evidence of the  existence  and amounts of the  obligations
therein  recorded;  provided,  however,  that the  failure  of any Lender or the
Administrative Agent to maintain such accounts or any error therein shall not in
any  manner  affect  the  obligations  of the  Borrowers  to repay  the Loans in
accordance with their terms.

          SECTION  2.08.  Interest on Loans.  (a) Subject to the  provisions  of
Section  2.09,  the Loans  comprising  each  Eurocurrency  Borrowing  shall bear
interest (computed on the basis of the actual number of days elapsed over a year
of 360 days) at a rate per annum  equal to (i) in the case of each  Eurocurrency
Standby Loan, the LIBO Rate for the Interest Period in effect for such Borrowing
plus the Applicable  Percentage from time to time in effect, (ii) in the case of
each  Eurocurrency  Competitive  Loan, the LIBO Rate for the Interest  Period in
effect for such Borrowing plus the Margin offered by the Lender making such Loan
and accepted by the  Borrower  pursuant to Section 2.03 and (iii) in the case of
each Eurocurrency  Local Currency Loan, the LIBO Rate for the Interest Period in
effect for such Loan plus any spread  specified in the applicable Local Currency
Addendum (or, if no such spread shall be specified, the Applicable Percentage).

          (b) Subject to the  provisions of Section 2.09,  the Loans  comprising
each ABR  Borrowing  shall bear  interest  (computed  on the basis of the actual
number of days elapsed  over a year of 365 or 366 days,  as the case may be, for
periods  during which the Alternate  Base Rate is determined by reference to the
Prime  Rate and 360 days for other  periods)  at a rate per  annum  equal to the
Alternate Base Rate.

          (c) Subject to the  provisions of Section  2.09,  each Fixed Rate Loan
shall bear  interest  at a rate per annum  (computed  on the basis of the actual
number  of days  elapsed  over a year of 360 days)  equal to the  fixed  rate of
interest  offered by the Lender  making such Loan and  accepted by the  Borrower
pursuant to Section 2.03.

          (d) Subject to the provisions of Section 2.09, any Local Currency Loan
that is not a  Eurocurrency  Loan shall bear  interest  at the rate or rates per
annum set forth in the applicable Local Currency Addendum.

          (e)  Interest on each Loan shall be payable on each  Interest  Payment
Date  applicable to such Loan except as otherwise  provided in this Agreement or
in an applicable Local Currency Addendum.  The applicable LIBO Rate or Alternate
Base Rate for each Interest Period or day within an 



Interest Period,  as the case may be, shall be determined by the  Administrative
Agent, and such determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error.

          SECTION 2.09.  Default  Interest.  If a Borrower  shall default in the
payment of the principal of or interest on any Loan or any other amount becoming
due hereunder, whether by scheduled maturity, notice of prepayment, acceleration
or  otherwise,  such  Borrower  shall  on  demand  from  time to time  from  the
Administrative  Agent pay  interest,  to the extent  permitted  by law,  on such
defaulted  amount up to (but not including) the date of actual payment (after as
well as before  judgment)  at a rate per annum  (computed as provided in Section
2.08(b))  equal to the  Alternate  Base Rate  plus 2% (or,  in the case of Local
Currency  Loans,  such other rate as may be  specified in the  applicable  Local
Currency Addendum).

          SECTION 2.10.  Alternate Rate of Interest.  In the event,  and on each
occasion,  that on the day two Business  Days prior to the  commencement  of any
Interest Period for a Eurocurrency  Borrowing,  the  Administrative  Agent shall
have  determined (i) that deposits in the currency and principal  amounts of the
Eurocurrency Loans comprising such Borrowing are not generally  available in the
London market or (ii) that reasonable  means do not exist for  ascertaining  the
LIBO Rate, the  Administrative  Agent shall, as soon as practicable  thereafter,
give  telecopy  notice  of such  determination  to the  Company  and  applicable
Borrower and the Lenders.  In the event of any such determination  under clauses
(i) or (ii) above, until the Administrative Agent shall have advised the Company
and the  Lenders  that the  circumstances  giving  rise to such notice no longer
exist,  (x) any  request  by a  Borrower  for a  Eurocurrency  Competitive  Loan
pursuant to Section  2.03 shall be of no force and effect and shall be denied by
the  Administrative  Agent,  (y) any  request by a Borrower  for a  Eurocurrency
Standby Loan pursuant to Section  2.04(a) shall be deemed to be a request for an
ABR  Borrowing  and (z) any  request  for a  Eurocurrency  Local  Currency  Loan
pursuant to Section 2.04(b) and to a Local Currency  Addendum shall be deemed to
be a request for a Local Currency Loan bearing interest by reference to the rate
specified  in the  applicable  Local  Currency  Addendum  (provided  that if the
requested  Eurocurrency  Local  Currency Loan was to be made pursuant to a Local
Currency  Addendum in which no rate is  specified  such  request  shall be of no
force and effect and shall be denied by the Administrative  Agent). In the event
the Required  Lenders  notify the  Administrative  Agent that the rates at which
Dollar  deposits are being offered will not  adequately  and fairly  reflect the
cost to such  Lenders  of making or  maintaining  Eurocurrency  Loans in Dollars
during  such  Interest  Period,  the  Administrative   Agent  shall  notify  the
applicable  Borrower of such notice and until the  Required  Lenders  shall have
advised  the  Administrative  Agent that the  circumstances  giving rise to such
notice no longer exist, any request by such Borrower for a Eurocurrency  Standby
Loan shall be deemed a request for an ABR Borrowing.  Each  determination by the
Administrative  Agent  hereunder  shall  be made  in good  faith  and  shall  be
conclusive absent manifest error.

          SECTION  2.11.  Termination  and  Reduction  of  Commitments.  (a) The
Commitments  shall be automatically  terminated on the Maturity Date;  provided,
however,  that if the  Effective  Date does not occur on or before  December 31,
1996, the Commitments shall terminate on such date.

          (b) Upon at least  three  Business  Days' prior  irrevocable  telecopy
notice  to the  Administrative  Agent,  the  Company  may at any  time in  whole
permanently  terminate,  or from time to time in part  permanently  reduce,  the
Total  Commitment;  provided,  however,  that (i) each partial  reduction of the
Total  Commitment  shall be in an  integral  multiple  of  $10,000,000  and in a
minimum  principal  amount  of  $50,000,000  and  (ii)  no such  termination  or
reduction shall be made (A) which would reduce the Total Commitment to an amount
less than the sum of the aggregate  Standby Credit Exposures and the Competitive
Loan  Exposures or (B) which would reduce any Lender's  Commitment  to an amount
that is less than such Lender's Standby Credit Exposure.



          (c) Each  reduction in the Total  Commitment  hereunder  shall be made
ratably among the Lenders in accordance with their respective  Commitments.  The
Borrowers shall pay to the Administrative  Agent for the account of the Lenders,
on the date of each  reduction  or  termination  of the  Total  Commitment,  the
Facility Fees on the amount of the  Commitments  terminated  accrued through the
date of such termination or reduction.

          SECTION 2.12.  Prepayment.  (a) Each Borrower  shall have the right at
any time and from time to time to prepay any Standby Borrowing or Local Currency
Borrowing,  as the case may be, in whole or in part, upon giving telecopy notice
(or  telephone  notice  promptly  confirmed by  telecopy) to the  Administrative
Agent:  (i) before 10:00 a.m., New York City time,  three Business Days prior to
prepayment,  in the case of  Eurocurrency  Standby Loans,  and (ii) before 10:00
a.m., New York City time,  one Business Day prior to prepayment,  in the case of
ABR Standby Loans and (iii) in the case of Local Currency Loans, by such time as
shall be specified in the applicable Local Currency Addendum; provided, however,
that each partial  prepayment  shall be in an amount which is (x) in the case of
any Standby  Borrowing,  an integral  multiple of $10,000,000  and not less than
$50,000,000,  and (ii) in the case of any Local Currency Borrowing, an amount in
which  prepayments are permitted to be made under the applicable  Local Currency
Addendum. No prepayment may be made in respect of any Competitive Borrowing.

          (b) On the date of any  termination  or reduction  of the  Commitments
pursuant  to  Section  2.11,  the  Borrowers  shall pay or prepay so much of the
Standby  Borrowings as shall be necessary in order that the aggregate sum of the
Competitive  Loan  Exposures and Standby  Credit  Exposures  will not exceed the
Total Commitment, after giving effect to such termination or reduction.

          (c) Each notice of prepayment  shall specify the  prepayment  date and
the principal amount of each Borrowing (or portion thereof) to be prepaid, shall
be irrevocable and shall commit the applicable Borrower to prepay such Borrowing
(or portion  thereof) by the amount stated  therein on the date stated  therein.
All  prepayments  under this  Section  2.12 shall be subject to Section 2.15 but
otherwise  without premium or penalty.  All prepayments  under this Section 2.12
shall be accompanied by accrued  interest on the principal  amount being prepaid
to the date of payment.

          SECTION  2.13.  Reserve  Requirements;  Change in  Circumstances.  (a)
Notwithstanding  any other provision herein, if after the date of this Agreement
any  change  in  applicable  law  or  regulation  or in  the  interpretation  or
administration   thereof  by  any  Governmental   Authority   charged  with  the
interpretation  or  administration  thereof  (whether or not having the force of
law)  shall  result in the  imposition,  modification  or  applicability  of any
reserve, special deposit or similar requirement against assets of, deposits with
or for the account of or credit  extended by any Lender,  or shall result in the
imposition  on (i) any  Lender  or the  London  interbank  market  of any  other
condition  affecting this Agreement,  (ii) such Lender's Commitment or (iii) any
Eurocurrency Loan or Fixed Rate Loan made by such Lender,  and the result of any
of the  foregoing  shall be to  increase  the cost to such  Lender  of making or
maintaining any Eurocurrency  Loan or Fixed Rate Loan or to reduce the amount of
any sum received or receivable by such Lender  hereunder  (whether of principal,
interest  or  otherwise)  by an amount  reasonably  deemed by such  Lender to be
material,  then such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender
for such  additional  costs or reduction  will be paid by the  Borrowers to such
Lender upon demand.  Notwithstanding the foregoing,  no Lender shall be entitled
to request  compensation  under this paragraph  with respect to any  Competitive
Loan if the change giving rise to such request was  applicable to such Lender at
the time of submission of the Competitive Bid pursuant to which such Competitive
Loan was made.



          (b) If any Lender shall have  determined that the adoption of any law,
rule,  regulation or guideline  arising out of the July 1988 report of the Basle
Committee   on  Banking   Regulations   and   Supervisory   Practices   entitled
"International Convergence of Capital Measurement and Capital Standards", or the
adoption after the date hereof of any other law,  rule,  regulation or guideline
regarding  capital  adequacy,  or any change in any of the  foregoing  or in the
interpretation  or  administration  of any of the foregoing by any  Governmental
Authority,  central bank or comparable agency charged with the interpretation or
administration  thereof,  or compliance by any Lender (or any lending  office of
such  Lender) or any  Lender's  holding  company  with any request or  directive
regarding  capital adequacy (whether or not having the force of law) of any such
authority,  central bank or comparable  agency,  has or would have the effect of
reducing  the rate of return on (i) such  Lender's  capital or on the capital of
such Lender's holding company, if any, as a consequence of this Agreement,  (ii)
such Lender's  Commitment or (iii) the Loans made by such Lender pursuant hereto
to a level below that which such Lender or such Lender's  holding  company could
have  achieved  but  for  such  adoption,  change  or  compliance  (taking  into
consideration  such Lender's  policies and the policies of such Lender's holding
company with respect to capital adequacy) by an amount reasonably deemed by such
Lender to be material,  then from time to time such additional amount or amounts
as will  compensate such Lender for such reduction will be paid by the Borrowers
to such Lender.

          (c) A certificate  of any Lender  setting forth such amount or amounts
as shall be  necessary  to  compensate  such Lender or its holding  company,  as
applicable,  as  specified in  paragraph  (a) or (b) above,  as the case may be,
shall be delivered to the Company and shall be conclusive absent manifest error.
The  Borrowers  shall  pay  such  Lender  the  amount  shown  as due on any such
certificate delivered by it within 10 days after its receipt of the same.

          (d) Failure on the part of any Lender to demand  compensation  for any
increased  costs or reduction in amounts  received or receivable or reduction in
return on capital with  respect to any period  shall not  constitute a waiver of
such Lender's  right to demand  compensation  with respect to such period or any
other  period;   provided,   however,  that  no  Lender  shall  be  entitled  to
compensation  under  this  Section  2.13 for any costs  incurred  or  reductions
suffered with respect to any date unless it shall have notified the Company that
it will demand  compensation  for such costs or reductions  under  paragraph (c)
above not more  than 90 days  after the later of (i) such date and (ii) the date
on which it shall have become aware of such costs or reductions.  The protection
of this Section  shall be available  to each Lender  regardless  of any possible
contention of the invalidity or  inapplicability  of the law, rule,  regulation,
guideline  or other  change or  condition  which  shall  have  occurred  or been
imposed.

          SECTION  2.14.  Change  in  Legality.  (a)  Notwithstanding  any other
provision   herein,   if  any  change  in  any  law  or  regulation  or  in  the
interpretation   thereof  by  any  Governmental   Authority   charged  with  the
administration or  interpretation  thereof shall make it unlawful for any Lender
or any of its Affiliates  which shall be party to a Local  Currency  Addendum to
make or maintain any Eurocurrency  Loan or Local Currency Loan or to give effect
to its obligations as contemplated  hereby with respect to any Eurocurrency Loan
or Local  Currency Loan, or shall limit the  convertibility  into Dollars of any
Local Currency (or make such conversion  commercially  impracticable),  then, by
written notice to the Company and to the Administrative Agent, such Lender may:

          (i) declare that  Eurocurrency  Loans or Loans in any  affected  Local
     Currency will not  thereafter be made by such Lender  hereunder,  whereupon
     such Lender shall not submit a Competitive Bid in response to a request for
     a Eurocurrency  Competitive  Loan,  any request for a Eurocurrency  Standby
     Loan shall,  as to such Lender  only,  be deemed a request for an ABR Loan,
     and any request for a Local Currency Borrowing in such Local Currency shall
     be disregarded,  unless such declaration  shall be subsequently  withdrawn;
     and


          (ii) require that all outstanding  Eurocurrency  Loans in Dollars made
     by it be converted  to ABR Loans and that all  outstanding  Local  Currency
     Loans made by it in the affected  Local  Currency be promptly  prepaid,  in
     which event all such  Eurocurrency  Loans in Dollars shall be automatically
     converted to ABR Loans as of the effective  date of such notice as provided
     in paragraph (b) below and all such Local  Currency Loans shall be promptly
     prepaid.

In the event any Lender shall exercise its rights under subparagraph (i) or (ii)
above  with  respect  to  Eurocurrency  Loans  in  Dollars,   all  payments  and
prepayments  of principal  which would  otherwise have been applied to repay the
Eurocurrency  Loans that would  have been made by such  Lender or the  converted
Eurocurrency  Loans,  of such Lender  shall  instead be applied to repay the ABR
Loans made by such Lender in lieu of, or resulting  from the conversion of, such
Eurocurrency Loans.

          (b) For purposes of this Section 2.14, a notice by any Lender shall be
effective as to each Eurocurrency Loan or Local Currency Loan, if lawful, on the
last day of the Interest Period currently  applicable to such  Eurocurrency Loan
or Local Currency Loan; in all other cases such notice shall be effective on the
date of receipt.

          SECTION 2.15.  Indemnity.  The Borrowers  shall  indemnify each Lender
against any out-of-pocket loss or expense which such Lender may sustain or incur
as a  consequence  of (a) any  failure  to borrow or to  refinance,  convert  or
continue  any  Loan  hereunder  after  irrevocable  notice  of  such  borrowing,
refinancing, conversion or continuation has been given pursuant to Section 2.03,
2.04 or 2.05 or  pursuant  to any  Local  Currency  Addendum,  (b) any  payment,
prepayment  or  conversion,  or  assignment  required  under  Section 2.20, of a
Eurocurrency Loan required by any other provision of this Agreement or otherwise
made or deemed made on a date other than the last day of the Interest Period, if
any,  applicable  thereto,  (c) any  default  in payment  or  prepayment  of the
principal amount of any Loan or any part thereof or interest accrued thereon, as
and  when  due and  payable  (at the due  date  thereof,  whether  by  scheduled
maturity,  acceleration,  irrevocable  notice of prepayment or otherwise) or (d)
the occurrence of any Event of Default,  including,  in each such case, any loss
or  reasonable  expense  sustained or incurred or to be sustained or incurred in
liquidating  or  employing  deposits  from third  parties  acquired to effect or
maintain such Loan or any part thereof as a Eurocurrency  Loan or Local Currency
Loan.  Such loss or  reasonable  expense  shall  include an amount  equal to the
excess,  if any, as  reasonably  determined  by such Lender,  of (i) its cost of
obtaining the funds for the Loan being paid, prepaid, refinanced or not borrowed
(assumed to be the LIBO Rate applicable thereto) for the period from the date of
such payment,  prepayment,  refinancing or failure to borrow or refinance to the
last day of the  Interest  Period for such Loan (or, in the case of a failure to
borrow or refinance the Interest Period for such Loan which would have commenced
on the date of such  failure)  over (ii) the amount of interest  (as  reasonably
determined by such Lender) that would be realized by such Lender in  reemploying
the funds so paid,  prepaid or not  borrowed  or  refinanced  for such period or
Interest  Period,  as the case may be. A certificate of any Lender setting forth
any amount or amounts which such Lender is entitled to receive  pursuant to this
Section  shall be delivered  to such  Borrower  and shall be  conclusive  absent
manifest error.

          SECTION 2.16.  Pro Rata  Treatment.  Except as required under Sections
2.14 and 2.20, each payment or prepayment of principal of any Standby Borrowing,
each  payment of interest on the Standby  Loans,  each  payment of the  Facility
Fees, each reduction of the  Commitments  and each  refinancing or conversion of
any Standby  Borrowing with a Standby  Borrowing of any Type, shall be allocated
pro rata among the Lenders in accordance with their respective  Commitments (or,
if such Commitments  shall have expired or been  terminated,  in accordance with
the respective  principal  amounts of their  outstanding  Standby  Loans).  Each
payment of principal of any  Competitive  Borrowing  shall be allocated pro rata
among  the  Lenders  participating  in such  Borrowing  in  accordance  with the
respective



principal  amounts  of  their  outstanding  Competitive  Loans  comprising  such
Borrowing.  Each  payment of  interest  on any  Competitive  Borrowing  shall be
allocated  pro  rata  among  the  Lenders  participating  in such  Borrowing  in
accordance  with the respective  amounts of accrued and unpaid interest on their
outstanding  Competitive  Loans  comprising  such  Borrowing.  For  purposes  of
determining  the  Available  Commitments  of  the  Lenders  at  any  time,  each
outstanding   Competitive  Borrowing  shall  be  deemed  to  have  utilized  the
Commitments  of the Lenders  (including  those Lenders which shall not have made
Loans as part of such  Competitive  Borrowing) pro rata in accordance  with such
respective  Commitments.  Each Lender  agrees that in  computing  such  Lender's
portion of any Borrowing to be made hereunder,  the Administrative Agent may, in
its  discretion,  round each Lender's  percentage of such  Borrowing to the next
higher or lower whole Dollar amount.

          SECTION 2.17. Sharing of Setoffs. Each Lender agrees that if it shall,
through the exercise of a right of banker's  lien,  setoff or  counterclaim,  or
pursuant to a secured  claim under  Section 506 of Title 11 of the United States
Code or other  security or interest  arising  from,  or in lieu of, such secured
claim,  received by such Lender under any applicable  bankruptcy,  insolvency or
other similar law or otherwise, or by any other means, obtain payment (voluntary
or involuntary) in respect of any Standby Loan or Loans as a result of which the
unpaid principal portion of its Standby Loans shall be proportionately less than
the unpaid principal  portion of the Standby Loans of any other Lender, it shall
be deemed simultaneously to have purchased from such other Lender at face value,
and  shall  promptly  pay to  such  other  Lender  the  purchase  price  for,  a
participation  in the Standby Loans of such other Lender,  so that the aggregate
unpaid principal amount of the Standby Loans and  participations  in the Standby
Loans  held by each  Lender  shall be in the same  proportion  to the  aggregate
unpaid  principal  amount of all Standby Loans then outstanding as the principal
amount of its Standby Loans prior to such exercise of banker's  lien,  setoff or
counterclaim  or other event was to the  principal  amount of all Standby  Loans
outstanding  prior to such exercise of banker's lien,  setoff or counterclaim or
other  event;  provided,  however,  that,  if any such  purchase or purchases or
adjustments  shall be made pursuant to this Section 2.17 and the payment  giving
rise  thereto  shall  thereafter  be  recovered,  such  purchase or purchases or
adjustments  shall be rescinded to the extent of such  recovery and the purchase
price or prices or adjustment  restored without  interest.  Any Lender holding a
participation  in a Standby Loan deemed to have been so  purchased  may exercise
any and all rights of banker's lien,  setoff or counterclaim with respect to any
and all moneys owing to such Lender by reason thereof as fully as if such Lender
had made a Standby Loan in the amount of such participation.

          SECTION  2.18.  Payments.  (a) The  Borrowers  shall make each payment
(including  principal  of or  interest  on any  Borrowing  and any Fees or other
amounts)  hereunder  from an account  in the United  States not later than 12:00
noon,  local time at the place of payment,  on the date when due, without setoff
or counterclaim,  in immediately  available funds to the Administrative Agent at
its  offices at 270 Park  Avenue,  New York,  New York (or, in the case of Local
Currency  Loans,  such  other  time  and  place as  shall  be  specified  in the
applicable Local Currency Addendum).  Each such payment (other than principal of
and interest on Local  Currency  Loans which shall be made in the Local Currency
of such Local Currency Loan) shall be made in Dollars.

          (b)  Whenever any payment  (including  principal of or interest on any
Borrowing or any Fees or other amounts) hereunder shall become due, or otherwise
would occur,  on a day that is not a Business  Day,  such payment may be made on
the next succeeding  Business Day, and such extension of time shall in such case
be included in the computation of interest or Fees, if applicable.

          SECTION 2.19. Taxes. (a) Any and all payments to the Lenders hereunder
shall be made,  in accordance  with Section 2.18,  free and clear of and without
deduction for any and all current or future taxes, levies, imposts,  deductions,
charges or withholdings, and all liabilities with respect thereto,



excluding (i) income taxes imposed on the income of the Administrative  Agent or
any Lender (or any  transferee or assignee  thereof,  including a  participation
holder (any such entity a "Transferee")) and (ii) franchise taxes imposed on the
income,  assets or net worth of the  Administrative  Agent,  or any  Lender  (or
Transferee),  in each  case by the  jurisdiction  under  the laws of  which  the
Administrative  Agent or such  Lender  (or  Transferee)  is  organized  or doing
business (other than as a result of entering into this Agreement, performing any
obligations hereunder,  receiving any payments hereunder or enforcing any rights
hereunder),  or any political  subdivision  thereof (all such nonexcluded taxes,
levies, imposts, deductions, charges, withholdings and liabilities, collectively
or individually, "Taxes"). If any Borrower shall be required to deduct any Taxes
from  or in  respect  of any  sum  payable  hereunder  to  any  Lender  (or  any
Transferee) or the Administrative  Agent, (i) the sum payable shall be increased
by the amount  (an  "additional  amount")  necessary  so that  after  making all
required deductions  (including deductions applicable to additional sums payable
under this Section 2.19) such Lender (or Transferee),  the Administrative  Agent
(as the case may be)  shall  receive  an amount  equal to the sum it would  have
received had no such  deductions  been made,  (ii) such Borrower shall make such
deductions  and (iii) such  Borrower  shall pay the full amount  deducted to the
relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law.

          (b) In addition,  the Borrowers shall pay to the relevant Governmental
Authority  in  accordance  with  applicable  law any current or future  stamp or
documentary  taxes or any other  excise or  property  taxes,  charges or similar
levies  that  arise  from any  payment  made  hereunder  or from the  execution,
delivery or registration of, or otherwise with respect to, this Agreement or any
other Loan Document ("Other Taxes").

          (c) The Borrowers shall indemnify each Lender (or Transferee), and the
Administrative  Agent for the full  amount of Taxes and Other Taxes paid by such
Lender (or Transferee) or the Administrative  Agent, as the case may be, and any
liability  (including  penalties,  interest and expenses  (including  reasonable
attorney's  fees and  expenses))  arising  therefrom  or with  respect  thereto,
whether or not such Taxes or Other Taxes were  correctly or legally  asserted by
the relevant  Governmental  Authority.  A  certificate  as to the amount of such
payment or liability  prepared by a Lender (or Transferee) or the Administrative
Agent on its behalf,  absent  manifest  error,  shall be final,  conclusive  and
binding  for all  purposes.  Such  indemnification  shall be made within 30 days
after the date any Lender (or  Transferee) or the  Administrative  Agent, as the
case may be, makes written demand  therefor,  which written demand shall be made
within 60 days of the date such  Lender (or  Transferee)  or the  Administrative
Agent receives  written demand for payment of such Taxes or Other Taxes from the
relevant Governmental Authority.

          (d) If a Lender (or  Transferee)  or the  Administrative  Agent  shall
become aware that it is entitled to claim a refund from a Governmental Authority
in respect of Taxes or Other  Taxes as to which it has been  indemnified  by the
Borrowers,  or with respect to which the Borrowers have paid additional amounts,
pursuant to this Section  2.19,  it shall  promptly  notify the Borrowers of the
availability  of such refund claim and shall,  within 30 days after receipt of a
request by the Borrowers,  make a claim to such Governmental  Authority for such
refund  at  the  Borrowers'   expense.  If  a  Lender  (or  Transferee)  or  the
Administrative Agent receives a refund (including pursuant to a claim for refund
made pursuant to the preceding  sentence) in respect of any Taxes or Other Taxes
as to which it has been  indemnified  by the  Borrowers or with respect to which
the Borrowers  have paid  additional  amounts  pursuant to this Section 2.19, it
shall  within 30 days from the date of such  receipt pay over such refund to the
Borrowers  (but only to the extent of indemnity  payments  made,  or  additional
amounts paid, by the Borrowers under this Section 2.19 with respect to the Taxes
or Other Taxes giving rise to such refund), net of all out-of-pocket expenses of
such Lender (or  Transferee) or the  Administrative  Agent and without  interest
(other than interest paid by the relevant Governmental Authority with respect to
such refund);



provided,  however,  that the  Borrowers,  upon the  request of such  Lender (or
Transferee) or the Administrative  Agent, agree to repay the amount paid over to
the Borrowers  (plus  penalties,  interest or other  charges) to such Lender (or
Transferee)  or  the   Administrative   Agent  in  the  event  such  Lender  (or
Transferee),  such Issuing Bank or the Administrative Agent is required to repay
such refund to such Governmental Authority.

          (e) As soon as  practicable  after the date of any payment of Taxes or
Other  Taxes  by the  Borrowers  to the  relevant  Governmental  Authority,  the
Borrowers will deliver to the  Administrative  Agent, at its address referred to
in Section 9.01,  the original or a certified  copy of a receipt  issued by such
Governmental Authority evidencing payment thereof.

          (f) Without prejudice to the survival of any other agreement contained
herein,  the  agreements  and  obligations  contained in this Section 2.19 shall
survive the payment in full of the  principal  of and interest on all Loans made
hereunder.

          (g) Each Lender (or Transferee)  that is organized under the laws of a
jurisdiction  other than the United States, any State thereof or the District of
Columbia  (a  "Non-U.S.   Lender")   shall   deliver  to  the  Company  and  the
Administrative Agent two copies of either United States Internal Revenue Service
Form 1001 or Form 4224, or, in the case of a Non-U.S.  Lender claiming exemption
from U.S.  Federal  withholding  tax under Section  871(h) or 881(c) of the Code
with respect to payments of "portfolio interest",  a Form W-8, or any subsequent
versions thereof or successors thereto (and, if such Non-U.S.  Lender delivers a
Form W-8, a certificate representing that such Non-U.S. Lender is not a bank for
purposes of Section 881(c) of the Code, is not a 10 percent  shareholder (within
the  meaning of Section  871(h)(3)(B)  of the Code) of the  Company and is not a
controlled  foreign  corporation  related to the Company  (within the meaning of
Section  864(d)(4) of the Code)),  properly  completed and duly executed by such
Non-U.S.  Lender  claiming  complete  exemption  from,  or reduced rate of, U.S.
Federal  withholding tax on payments by the Company under this  Agreement.  Such
forms  shall be  delivered  by each  Non-U.S.  Lender on or  before  the date it
becomes a party to this  Agreement  (or, in the case of a  Transferee  that is a
participation  holder, on or before the date such participation holder becomes a
Transferee  hereunder)  and on or before the date, if any, such Non-U.S.  Lender
changes its applicable  lending office by designating a different lending office
(a "New Lending Office"). In addition,  each Non-U.S.  Lender shall deliver such
forms  promptly  upon the  obsolescence  or  invalidity  of any form  previously
delivered by such Non-U.S.  Lender.  Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Section  2.19(g),  a Non-U.S.  Lender  shall not be required to deliver any form
pursuant to this Section  2.19(g) that such Non-U.S.  Lender is not legally able
to deliver.

          (h) The  Company  shall not be  required  to  indemnify  any  Non-U.S.
Lender, or to pay any additional  amounts to any Non-U.S.  Lender, in respect of
United States Federal  withholding tax pursuant to paragraph (a) or (c) above to
the extent that (i) the  obligation  to withhold  amounts with respect to United
States Federal withholding tax existed on the date such Non-U.S. Lender became a
party to this Agreement (or, in the case of a Transferee that is a participation
holder, on the date such participation holder became a Transferee hereunder) or,
with respect to payments to a New Lending Office, the date such Non-U.S.  Lender
designated  such New Lending Office with respect to a Loan;  provided,  however,
that this clause (i) shall not apply to any  Transferee  or New  Lending  Office
that becomes a Transferee  or New Lending  Office as a result of an  assignment,
participation,  transfer or designation made at the request of the Company;  and
provided  further,  however,  that this clause (i) shall not apply to the extent
the  indemnity  payment or  additional  amounts  any  Transferee,  or Lender (or
Transferee) through a New Lending Office,  would be entitled to receive (without
regard to this clause  (i)) do not exceed the  indemnity  payment or  additional
amounts that the person making the assignment, participation or transfer to such
Transferee, or Lender (or Transferee) making the



designation of such New Lending  Office,  would have been entitled to receive in
the absence of such assignment,  participation,  transfer or designation or (ii)
the  obligation to pay such  additional  amounts would not have arisen but for a
failure by such Non-U.S.  Lender to comply with the  provisions of paragraph (g)
above.

          (i) Any Lender  (or  Transferee)  claiming  any  indemnity  payment or
additional  amounts  payable  pursuant to this Section 2.19 shall use reasonable
efforts  (consistent  with  legal  and  regulatory  restrictions)  to  file  any
certificate  or document  reasonably  requested  in writing by the Company or to
change the jurisdiction of its applicable lending office if the making of such a
filing or change  would  avoid  the need for or  reduce  the  amount of any such
indemnity  payment or additional  amounts that may  thereafter  accrue and would
not,  in  the  determination  of  such  Lender  (or  Transferee),  be  otherwise
disadvantageous to such Lender (or Transferee).

          (j) Nothing  contained in this  Section 2.19 shall  require any Lender
(or  Transferee)  or the  Administrative  Agent to make available any of its tax
returns  (or  any  other  information  that  it  deems  to  be  confidential  or
proprietary).

          SECTION  2.20.  Duty to  Mitigate;  Assignment  of  Commitments  Under
Certain  Circumstances.  (a) Any Lender (or Transferee)  claiming any additional
amounts  payable  pursuant to Section  2.13 or Section  2.19 or  exercising  its
rights under Section 2.14 shall use reasonable  efforts  (consistent  with legal
and regulatory  restrictions)  to file any certificate or document  requested by
the Company or to change the  jurisdiction  of its applicable  lending office if
the  making of such a filing or change  would  avoid the need for or reduce  the
amount of any such additional  amounts which may thereafter  accrue or avoid the
circumstances  giving rise to such exercise and would not, in the  determination
of such Lender (or Transferee),  be otherwise disadvantageous to such Lender (or
Transferee).

          (b) In the event that any  Lender  shall  have  delivered  a notice or
certificate  pursuant to Section 2.13 or 2.14,  or the Company shall be required
to make additional  payments to any Lender under Section 2.19, the Company shall
have  the  right,  at its  own  expense,  upon  notice  to such  Lender  and the
Administrative  Agent,  to require  such Lender to transfer  and assign  without
recourse  (in  accordance  with and  subject to the  restrictions  contained  in
Section  9.04) all  interests,  rights and  obligations  contained  hereunder to
another  financial  institution  approved  by the  Administrative  Agent  (which
approval  shall  not  be   unreasonably   withheld)   which  shall  assume  such
obligations;  provided that (i) no such assignment  shall conflict with any law,
rule or regulation or order of any Governmental  Authority and (ii) the assignee
or the  Company,  as the  case  may be,  shall  pay to the  affected  Lender  in
immediately  available funds on the date of such assignment the principal of and
interest  accrued to the date of payment on the Loans made by it  hereunder  and
all other amounts accrued for its account or owed to it hereunder.

          SECTION 2.21. Terms of Local Currency Facilities.  (a) The Company may
in its discretion  from time to time elect to borrow,  or elect that one or more
Borrowing  Subsidiaries  may borrow,  Local Currency Loans on a revolving  basis
from any one or more Local Currency Lenders, with the consent of each such Local
Currency Lender in its sole discretion,  by delivering a Local Currency Addendum
to the  Administrative  Agent  and  the  Local  Currency  Lenders  (through  the
Administrative  Agent),  executed by the Company, each such Borrowing Subsidiary
and each such Local Currency Lender;  provided,  however,  that on the effective
date of such  election,  and after giving effect  thereto,  (i) an Exchange Rate
with  respect to each Local  Currency  covered by such Local  Currency  Addendum
shall be determinable by reference to the Reuters  currency pages (or comparable
publicly  available  screen),  (ii) no Default  or Event of  Default  shall have
occurred and be continuing and (iii) the aggregate



amount of all Local Currency  Facility Maximum Borrowing Amounts under all Local
Currency  Addenda  at the time in effect  shall not  exceed  $350,000,000.  Each
Borrower and, by agreeing to any Local  Currency  Addendum,  each relevant Local
Currency  Lender,  acknowledges and agrees that each reference in this Agreement
to any Lender shall,  to the extent  applicable,  be deemed to be a reference to
such Local Currency Lender,  subject to the second sentence of the definition of
such term.

          (b) Each  Local  Currency  Addendum  shall set  forth (i) the  maximum
amount (expressed in Dollars and without  duplication)  available to be borrowed
from all Local Currency Lenders under such Local Currency  Addendum (as the same
may be reduced  from time to time  pursuant to Section  2.22(c) or (d), a "Local
Currency Facility Maximum Borrowing Amount") and (ii) with respect to each Local
Currency  Lender  party to such Local  Currency  Addendum,  the  maximum  amount
(expressed  in Dollars and without  duplication)  available to be borrowed  from
such Local Currency  Lender  thereunder (as the same may be reduced from time to
time  pursuant  to  Section  2.22(c) or (d), a "Local  Currency  Lender  Maximum
Borrowing Amount"). In no event shall the aggregate of all Local Currency Lender
Maximum  Borrowing  Amounts in respect of any Local Currency  Lender at any time
exceed such  Lender's  Commitment.  Except as provided in Section  2.21(c),  the
making of Local Currency Loans by a Local Currency Lender under a Local Currency
Addendum shall under no circumstances reduce the amount available to be borrowed
from such Lender under any other Local Currency Addendum to which such Lender is
a party.

          (c) Except as otherwise  required by applicable law, in no event shall
the Local Currency Lenders have the right to accelerate the Local Currency Loans
outstanding under any Local Currency Addendum, or to terminate their commitments
(if any) thereunder to make Local Currency Loans prior to the stated termination
date in respect thereof,  except that such Local Currency Lenders shall, in each
case,  have such rights upon an  acceleration  of the Loans and a termination of
the Commitments pursuant to Article VI, respectively. No Local Currency Loan may
be made if (i) an Exchange  Rate with respect to such Local  Currency  cannot be
determined,  (ii) a Default or an Event of Default  shall have  occurred  and be
continuing or would result  therefrom or (iii) after giving effect thereto,  (A)
the sum of the  aggregate  principal  amount of the  Dollar  Loans  (other  than
Competitive  Loans) and Local Currency  Loans (Dollar  Equivalent) of any Lender
(and the  Affiliates  of such  Lender  that are  Local  Currency  Lenders)  then
outstanding would exceed such Lender's Commitment,  (B) the Dollar Equivalent of
the aggregate  principal amount of outstanding  Local Currency Loans denominated
in a  specified  Local  Currency  would  exceed the  applicable  Local  Currency
Facility Maximum Borrowing Amount or (C) the sum of the aggregate Standby Credit
Exposures and the aggregate  Competitive  Loan Exposures  would exceed the Total
Commitment.

          (d) The applicable Borrower and the applicable Local Currency Lenders,
or, if so specified in the relevant Local Currency Addendum,  an agent acting on
their behalf, shall furnish to the Administrative  Agent, promptly following the
making, payment or prepayment of each Local Currency Loan, and at any other time
at the  request of the  Administrative  Agent,  a  statement  setting  forth the
outstanding Local Currency Loans made under such Local Currency Addendum.

          (e) The applicable Borrower shall furnish to the Administrative  Agent
copies of any amendment,  supplement or other  modification  to the terms of any
Local Currency Addendum promptly after the effectiveness thereof.

          (f) The Company may terminate any Local  Currency  Addendum,  if there
are not any Loans outstanding  thereunder,  in its sole discretion (or, if there
are Loans outstanding thereunder, with the consent of each Local Currency Lender
party  thereto),  by written notice to the  Administrative  Agent,  which notice
shall be executed by the Company,  each relevant  Borrowing  Subsidiary  and, if
their consent



is required, each such Local Currency Lender. Once notice of such termination is
received by the Administrative Agent, such Local Currency Addendum and the loans
and other  obligations  outstanding  thereunder  shall  immediately  cease to be
subject to the terms of this Agreement.

          SECTION  2.22.  Currency  Fluctuations,  etc.  (a) Not later than 1:00
p.m., New York City time, on each  Calculation  Date, the  Administrative  Agent
shall (i) determine the Exchange Rate as of such  Calculation  Date with respect
to each Local Currency covered by a Local Currency Addendum and (ii) give notice
thereof to the Lenders, the Company and the relevant Borrowing Subsidiaries. The
Exchange  Rates so determined  shall become  effective on the first Business Day
immediately  following the relevant  Calculation Date (a "Reset Date") and shall
remain effective until the next succeeding Reset Date.

          (b) Not later than 5:00 p.m.,  New York City time,  on each Reset Date
and each Borrowing Date, the Administrative Agent shall (i) determine the Dollar
Equivalent of the Local Currency Loans then outstanding  (after giving effect to
any Local  Currency Loans to be made or repaid on such date) and (ii) notify the
Lenders,  the Company and the relevant Borrowing  Subsidiaries of the results of
such determination.

          (c) If, on any Reset Date or any  Borrowing  Date (after giving effect
to (i) any  Loans to be made or  repaid  on such  date  and (ii) any  amendment,
supplement or other  modification  to any Local Currency  Addendum  effective on
such date of which the Administrative  Agent has received notice), the aggregate
outstanding Dollar Standby Extensions of Credit of any Lender exceeds the Dollar
Standby  Credit  Overage of such Lender (the amount of such excess  being called
the "Dollar  Standby Credit  Excess"),  then such Lender's Local Currency Lender
Maximum Borrowing Amount under each Local Currency Addendum to which such Lender
is a party  shall be reduced on such date by an amount  equal to the  product of
such Dollar Standby Credit Excess times a fraction, the numerator of which shall
equal the Local  Currency  Lender  Maximum  Borrowing  Amount  under  such Local
Currency  Addendum and the denominator of which shall equal the aggregate of the
Local Currency  Lender Maximum  Borrowing  Amounts of such Lender.  After giving
effect to any such reduction in Local Currency Lender Maximum Borrowing Amounts,
the Local Currency  Facility Maximum Borrowing Amount with respect to each Local
Currency Addendum shall, in turn, be reduced to an amount equal to the aggregate
of the Local Currency Lender Maximum  Borrowing  Amounts of all Lenders party to
such Local  Currency  Addendum.  Reductions in Local Currency  Facility  Maximum
Borrowing  Amounts and Local Currency Lender Maximum  Borrowing Amounts pursuant
to this Section  2.22(c)  shall be effective  until the amount  thereof shall be
recalculated by the  Administrative  Agent on the next succeeding  Reset Date or
Borrowing  Date,  and shall not be deemed  to reduce  the  stated  amount of any
commitment  of any Local  Currency  Lender  in  respect  of any  Local  Currency
Addendum.

          (d) If, on any Reset Date or Borrowing  Date (after  giving  effect to
(i) any Loans to be made or repaid on such date, (ii) any amendment,  supplement
or other  modification to any Local Currency Addendum  effective on such date of
which the  Administrative  Agent has received  notice and (iii) any reduction in
the Local  Currency  Facility  Maximum  Borrowing  Amounts  pursuant  to Section
2.22(c) effective on such date), the sum of (A) the aggregate outstanding Dollar
Standby  Extensions  of  Credit  of  all  the  Lenders  and  (B)  the  aggregate
Competitive  Loan Exposures  exceed the Dollar  Facility  Overage (the amount of
such excess being called the "Dollar Facility Excess"),  then the Local Currency
Facility Maximum  Borrowing  Amount under each Local Currency  Addendum shall be
reduced on such date by an amount  equal to the product of such Dollar  Facility
Excess times a fraction,  the numerator of which shall equal the Local  Currency
Facility  Maximum  Borrowing  Amount under such Local Currency  Addendum and the
denominator  of which shall equal the aggregate of the Local  Currency  Facility
Maximum Borrowing Amounts with respect to all Local Currency Addenda. Each such


reduction in the Local Currency  Facility Maximum Borrowing Amount under a Local
Currency  Addendum shall, in turn,  reduce the respective  Local Currency Lender
Maximum  Borrowing  Amounts of each Local  Currency  Lender  party to such Local
Currency Addendum, pro rata on the basis of the respective Local Currency Lender
Maximum  Borrowing  Amounts of such Local Currency Lenders  immediately prior to
such reduction.  Reductions in Local Currency Facility Maximum Borrowing Amounts
and Local Currency  Lender Maximum  Borrowing  Amounts  pursuant to this Section
2.22(d) shall be effective until the amount thereof shall be recalculated by the
Administrative  Agent on the next  succeeding  Reset Date or Borrowing Date, and
shall not be deemed to reduce the stated  amount of any  commitment of any Local
Currency Lender in respect of any Local Currency Addendum.

          (e) If, on any Reset Date, the Dollar Equivalent of the Local Currency
Loans  outstanding  under a Local  Currency  Addendum  exceeds 105% of the Local
Currency  Facility  Maximum  Borrowing Amount with respect thereto (after giving
effect to any reductions  therein effected pursuant to Section 2.22(c) or (d) on
such date), then the relevant  Borrower shall,  within three Business Days after
notice thereof from the  Administrative  Agent,  (i) increase the Local Currency
Facility Maximum  Borrowing Amount with respect to such Local Currency  Facility
in accordance  with Section  2.21(e) and/or (ii) prepay Local Currency Loans, in
either case in an aggregate amount such that,  after giving effect thereto,  (x)
the Dollar Equivalent of all such Local Currency Loans shall be equal to or less
than such Local Currency  Facility  Maximum  Borrowing Amount and (y) the Dollar
Equivalent of the Local Currency  Loans of each relevant  Local Currency  Lender
shall be equal to or less than  such  Local  Currency  Lender's  Local  Currency
Lender Maximum Borrowing Amount with respect to such Local Currency Addendum.

          (f) If, on any Reset Date, the Standby  Credit  Exposure of any Lender
exceeds 105% of such Lender's Commitment, then, within three Business Days after
notice thereof from the  Administrative  Agent,  the Company shall prepay and/or
cause the relevant Borrowing Subsidiaries to prepay the Loans in accordance with
this Agreement,  in an aggregate  amount such that, after giving effect thereto,
the Standby  Credit  Exposure of such Lender shall be equal to or less than such
Lender's Standby Credit Commitment.

          (g) The  Administrative  Agent  shall  promptly  notify  the  relevant
Lenders of the  amount of any  reductions  in Local  Currency  Facility  Maximum
Borrowing  Amounts or Local Currency Lender Maximum  Borrowing  Amounts required
pursuant to this Section 2.22.

                                   ARTICLE III

                         REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

       Each Borrower represents and warrants to each of the Lenders that:

                  SECTION 3.01. Organization;  Powers. Each Borrower and each of
the  Restricted  Subsidiaries  (a)  is a  corporation  duly  organized,  validly
existing  and in  good  standing  under  the  laws  of the  jurisdiction  of its
organization,  (b) has all requisite power and authority to own its property and
assets and to carry on its  business  as now  conducted  and as  proposed  to be
conducted,  (c) is  qualified  to do business in every  jurisdiction  where such
qualification  is  required,  except  where the failure so to qualify  would not
result in a Material Adverse Effect,  and (d) in the case of each Borrower,  has
the  corporate  power  and  authority  to  execute,   deliver  and  perform  its
obligations under the Loan Documents and to borrow hereunder and thereunder.



                  SECTION  3.02.  Authorization.  The  execution,  delivery  and
performance by the Borrowers of this  Agreement,  the promissory  notes, if any,
issued pursuant to Section 9.04(i) and each Local Currency  Addendum (and by the
Borrowing   Subsidiaries  of  each  Borrowing  Subsidiary   Agreement)  and  the
Borrowings  hereunder  (collectively,  the  "Transactions")  (a) have  been duly
authorized  by all requisite  corporate  action and (b) will not (i) violate (A)
any  provision of any law,  statute,  rule or regulation  (including  the Margin
Regulations)  or of the  certificate  of  incorporation  or  other  constitutive
documents  or  by-laws  of the  Borrowers,  (B) any  order  of any  Governmental
Authority or (C) any provision of any indenture,  agreement or other  instrument
to which any Borrower is a party or by which it or any of its property is or may
be bound,  (ii) be in conflict with,  result in a breach of or constitute (alone
or with  notice  or lapse of time or both) a default  under any such  indenture,
agreement or other  instrument  or (iii) result in the creation or imposition of
any lien upon any property or assets of any Borrower.

                  SECTION  3.03.  Enforceability.  This  Agreement and each Loan
Document to which a Borrower is a party  constitutes a legal,  valid and binding
obligation of each such Borrower enforceable in accordance with its terms.

                  SECTION 3.04.  Governmental  Approvals.  No action, consent or
approval of,  registration  or filing with or other  action by any  Governmental
Authority,  other than those which have been taken,  given or made,  as the case
may be, is or will be required with respect to any Borrower in  connection  with
the Transactions.

                  SECTION  3.05.  Financial  Statements.  (a)  The  Company  has
heretofore  furnished to the Administrative  Agent and the Lenders copies of its
consolidated balance sheet and statements of income, cash flow and stockholders'
equity as of and for the year ended December 31, 1995, and the nine months ended
September 30, 1996. Such financial  statements  present fairly,  in all material
respects,  the consolidated financial condition and the results of operations of
the  Company  and the  Subsidiaries  as of such  dates and for such  periods  in
accordance with GAAP or SAP, as requested.

                  (b) As of the date hereof,  there has been no material adverse
change  in  the  consolidated   financial  condition  of  the  Company  and  the
Subsidiaries  taken as a whole  from the  financial  condition  reported  in the
financial statements referenced in paragraph (a) of this Section 3.05.

                  SECTION 3.06. Litigation;  Compliance with Laws. (a) There are
no actions,  proceedings  or  investigations  filed or (to the  knowledge of the
Borrowers)  threatened  against any Borrower or any  Subsidiary  in any court or
before  any  Governmental  Authority  or  arbitration  board or  tribunal  which
question the validity or legality of this  Agreement,  the  Transactions  or any
action taken or to be taken  pursuant to this Agreement and no order or judgment
has been  issued  or  entered  restraining  or  enjoining  any  Borrower  or any
Subsidiary from the execution,  delivery or performance of this Agreement nor is
there any other action,  proceeding or investigation  filed or (to the knowledge
of any  Borrower  or any  Subsidiary)  threatened  against  any  Borrower or any
Subsidiary  in any court or before any  Governmental  Authority  or  arbitration
board or  tribunal  which  would be  reasonably  likely to result in a  Material
Adverse Effect or materially restrict the ability of any Borrower to comply with
its obligations under the Loan Documents.

                  (b) Neither any Borrower nor any Subsidiary is in violation of
any law, rule or regulation  (including any law, rule or regulation  relating to
the  protection  of the  environment  or to employee  health or  safety),  or in
default  with  respect  to any  judgment,  writ,  injunction  or  decree  of any
Governmental  Authority,  where such  violation or default  would be  reasonably
likely to result in a Material Adverse Effect.



                  (c) No exchange control law or regulation materially restricts
any  Borrower  from  complying  with its  obligations  in respect of any Loan or
otherwise under this Agreement or any Local Currency Addendum.

                  SECTION 3.07.  Federal Reserve Regulations.  (a)  Neither any 
Borrower nor any Subsidiary that will receive proceeds of the Loans hereunder is
engaged principally,  or as one of its important activities,  in the business of
extending credit for the purpose of purchasing or carrying Margin Stock.

                  (b) No part of the proceeds of any Loan will be used,  whether
directly or indirectly, and whether immediately,  incidentally or ultimately, to
purchase or carry Margin Stock or to refund indebtedness originally incurred for
such purpose, or for any other purpose which entails a violation of, or which is
inconsistent with, the provisions of the Margin Regulations.

                  SECTION 3.08.  Investment  Company Act; Public Utility Holding
Company  Act.  No  Borrower  is (a) an  "investment  company"  as defined in, or
subject to regulation under, the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the "1940 Act")
or (b) a "holding  company" as defined in, or subject to regulation  under,  the
Public  Utility  Holding  Company Act of 1935.  While  certain  subsidiaries  of
Hartford Life  Insurance  Company are  "investment  companies" as defined in the
1940 Act, the  transactions  contemplated  by this Agreement will not violate or
require any  approval  under such Act or any  regulations  promulgated  pursuant
thereto.

                  SECTION 3.09.  Use of Proceeds.  All proceeds of the Loans 
shall be used for the purposes referred to in the recitals to this Agreement.

                  SECTION 3.10. Full Disclosure; No Material Misstatements. None
of the  representations  or warranties  made by any Borrower in connection  with
this  Agreement as of the date such  representations  and warranties are made or
deemed made, and no report,  financial statement or other information  furnished
by or on  behalf  of any  Borrower  to the  Administrative  Agent or any  Lender
pursuant  to or in  connection  with this  Agreement  or the  credit  facilities
established hereby,  contains or will contain any material  misstatement of fact
or  omits  or will  omit to  state  any  material  fact  necessary  to make  the
statements  therein,  in the light of the circumstances under which they were or
will be made, not misleading.

                  SECTION 3.11.  Taxes. Each Borrower and each of the Restricted
Subsidiaries  have filed or caused to be filed all Federal,  state and local tax
returns  which are  required to be filed by them,  and have paid or caused to be
paid all taxes shown to be due and payable on such returns or on any assessments
received by any of them,  other than any taxes or  assessments,  the validity of
which is being  contested  in good  faith by  appropriate  proceedings  and with
respect to which appropriate  accounting reserves have to the extent required by
GAAP or SAP, as applicable, been set aside.

                  SECTION 3.12.  Employee  Pension  Benefit  Plans.  The present
aggregate  value  of  accumulated   benefit  obligations  of  all  unfunded  and
underfunded  pension plans of the Company and its  Subsidiaries  (based on those
assumptions used for disclosure in corporate financial  statements in accordance
with GAAP or SAP, as  applicable)  did not, as of December 31,  1994,  exceed by
more than  $70,000,000 the value of the assets of all such plans. In these cases
the Company has recorded book reserves to meet the obligations.



                                   ARTICLE IV

                              CONDITIONS OF LENDING

                  The  obligations  of the Lenders to make Loans  hereunder  are
subject to the satisfaction of the following conditions:

                  SECTION 4.01.  All Borrowings.  On the date of each Borrowing:

                  (a)  The Administrative Agent shall have received a notice of
         such Borrowing as required by Section 2.03 or Section 2.04, as
         applicable.

                  (b) The  representations  and  warranties set forth in Article
         III hereof shall be true and correct in all material respects on and as
         of the date of such  Borrowing  with the same  effect as though made on
         and as of such date,  except to the  extent  such  representations  and
         warranties expressly relate to an earlier date.

                  (c) At the time of and  immediately  after such  Borrowing  no
         Event of Default or Default shall have occurred and be continuing.

Each Borrowing  shall be deemed to constitute a  representation  and warranty by
each  Borrower  on the date of such  Borrowing  as to the matters  specified  in
paragraphs (b) and (c) of this Section 4.01.

                  SECTION 4.02.  Effective Date.  On the Effective Date:

                  (a) The  Administrative  Agent shall have received a favorable
written  opinion  of Michael  S.  Wilder,  Esq.,  dated the  Effective  Date and
addressed to the Lenders and  satisfactory  to the Lenders,  the  Administrative
Agent and Cravath,  Swaine & Moore, counsel for the Administrative Agent, to the

the  certificate  of  incorporation,  including all amendments  thereto,  of the
Company, certified as of a recent date by the Secretary of State of its state of
incorporation,  and a certificate as to the good standing of the Company as of a

to the date of the resolutions  described in clause (B) below, (B) that attached
thereto is a true and complete copy of resolutions  duly adopted by the Board of
Directors of the Company authorizing the execution,  delivery and performance of
this  Agreement  and any  other  documents  related  to this  Agreement  and the

         (ii)  is to  cause,  or  to  permit  the  holder  or  holders  of  such
         Indebtedness  or a trustee on its or their  behalf (with or without the

         foregoing;

                  (i) one or more final  judgments shall be entered by any court
         against the Company or any of the Subsidiaries for the payment of money
         in an aggregate  amount in excess of $50,000,000,  and such judgment or
         judgments  shall not have been paid,  discharged or stayed for a period
         of 60 days, or a warrant of attachment or execution or similar  process
         shall have been issued or levied against property of the Company or any
         of the Subsidiaries to enforce any such judgment or judgments;

                  (j) an ERISA Event shall have occurred that, in the opinion of
         the Required  Lenders,  when taken  together  with all other such ERISA
         Events,  could  reasonably be expected to result in a Material  Adverse
         Effect; or

                  (k) a Change in Control shall occur;

then,  and in every such event  (other than an event with respect to the Company
or any Restricted  Subsidiary  described in paragraph (g) or (h) above),  and at
any time  thereafter  during the continuance of such event,  the  Administrative
Agent, at the request of the Required Lenders,  shall, by notice to the 



Company,  take either or both of the following actions, at the same or different
times:  (i) terminate  forthwith the Commitments and (ii) declare the Loans then
outstanding  to be forthwith due and payable in whole or in part,  whereupon the
principal of the Loans so declared to be due and payable,  together with accrued
interest  thereon and any unpaid  accrued Fees and all other  liabilities of the
Borrowers accrued hereunder,  without presentment,  demand, protest or any other
notice of any kind, all of which are hereby expressly waived anything  contained
herein to the  contrary  notwithstanding;  and,  in the case of any  event  with
respect to the Company or any Restricted  Subsidiary  described in paragraph (g)
or (h) above, the Commitments shall automatically terminate and the principal of
the Loans then  outstanding,  together  with  accrued  interest  thereon and any
unpaid accrued Fees and all other liabilities of the Borrowers accrued hereunder
shall automatically become due and payable, without presentment, demand, protest
or any other  notice  of any kind,  all of which  are  hereby  expressly  waived
anything contained herein to the contrary notwithstanding.


                                   ARTICLE VII

                                    GUARANTEE

                  The Company unconditionally and irrevocably guarantees the due
and punctual payment and performance,  when and as due, whether at maturity,  by
acceleration,  upon one or more dates set for  prepayment or  otherwise,  of the
Guaranteed   Obligations.   The  Company  further  agrees  that  the  Guaranteed
Obligations may be extended or renewed,  in whole or in part,  without notice or
further  assent  from it and  that it  will  remain  bound  upon  its  guarantee
notwithstanding any extension or renewal of any Guaranteed Obligations.

                  The Company waives  presentment to, demand of payment from and
protest to the Borrowing Subsidiaries of any of the Guaranteed Obligations,  and
also waives  notice of  acceptance  of its  guarantee  and notice of protest for
nonpayment.  The  obligations of the Company  hereunder shall not be affected by
(a) the  failure of any  Lender to assert any claim or demand or to enforce  any
right or remedy against the Borrowing  Subsidiaries under the provisions of this
Agreement or otherwise; (b) any rescission, waiver, amendment or modification of
any of the terms or  provisions  of this  Agreement,  any guarantee or any other
agreement;  or (c) the  failure  of any Lender to  exercise  any right or remedy
against any other guarantor of the Guaranteed Obligations.

                  The Company  further  agrees that its guarantee  constitutes a
guarantee  of payment  when due and not of  collection,  and waives any right to
require that any resort be had by the Administrative  Agent or any Lender to any
security,  if any,  held for  payment of the  Guaranteed  Obligations  or to any
balance of any deposit account or credit on its books, in favor of the Borrowing
Subsidiaries or any other person.

                  The obligations of the Company  hereunder shall not be subject
to  any  reduction,  limitation,  impairment  or  termination  for  any  reason,
including any claim of waiver, release, surrender, alteration or compromise, and
shall not be subject  to any  defense or  setoff,  counterclaim,  recoupment  or
termination   whatsoever   by   reason   of  the   invalidity,   illegality   or
unenforceability  of the Guaranteed  Obligations or otherwise.  Without limiting
the generality of the foregoing,  the obligations of the Company hereunder shall
not be  discharged  or  impaired  or  otherwise  affected  by the failure of the
Administrative  Agent or any  Lender to assert any claim or demand or to enforce
any remedy under this Agreement,  any guarantee or any other  agreement,  by any
waiver or  modification  of any provision  thereof,  by any default,  failure or
delay, willful or otherwise, in the performance of the Guaranteed 



Obligations, or by any other act or omission which may or might in any manner or
to any extent vary the risk of the Company or  otherwise  operate as a discharge
of the Company as a matter of law or equity.

                  To the extent  permitted by applicable law, the Company waives
any defense  based on or arising out of any defense  available to the  Borrowing
Subsidiaries, including any defense based on or arising out of any disability of
the  Borrowing   Subsidiaries,   or  the   unenforceability  of  the  Guaranteed
Obligations or any part thereof from any cause,  or the cessation from any cause
of the liability of the Borrowing Subsidiaries, other than final payment in full
of the Guaranteed Obligations.  The Administrative Agent and the Lenders may, at
their election,  foreclose on any security held by one or more of them by one or
more  judicial or non  judicial  sales,  or  exercise  any other right or remedy
available to them against the Borrowing  Subsidiaries,  or any security  without
affecting or impairing in any way the liability of the Company  hereunder except
to the extent the Guaranteed  Obligations  have been fully and finally paid. The
Company  waives any defense  arising out of any such  election  even though such
election  operates  to impair or to  extinguish  any right of  reimbursement  or
subrogation  or other  right or  remedy of the  Company  against  the  Borrowing
Subsidiaries or any security.

                  The Company  further agrees that its guarantee  shall continue
to be effective or be reinstated, as the case may be, if at any time payment, or
any part thereof,  of principal of or interest on any  Guaranteed  Obligation is
rescinded  or must  otherwise be restored by any Lender upon the  bankruptcy  or
reorganization of any Borrowing Subsidiary or otherwise.

                  In  furtherance  of the foregoing and not in limitation of any
other right which the  Administrative  Agent or any Lender may have at law or in
equity against the Company by virtue  hereof,  upon the failure of any Borrowing
Subsidiary to pay any  Guaranteed  Obligation  when and as the same shall become
due,  whether at  maturity,  by  acceleration,  after  notice of  prepayment  or
otherwise,  the Company  hereby  promises to and will,  upon  receipt of written
demand by the Administrative  Agent or any Lender,  forthwith pay or cause to be
paid to the  Administrative  Agent or such  Lender  in cash the  amount  of such
unpaid Guaranteed Obligation.

                  Until the  termination of this  Agreement and the  commitments
hereunder,  and the  repayment in full of all amounts due under this  Agreement,
the  Company  hereby  irrevocably  waives  and  releases  any and all  rights of
subrogation, indemnification, reimbursement and similar rights which it may have
against or in respect of the Borrowing  Subsidiaries at any time relating to the
Guaranteed  Obligations,  including  all rights  that would  result in its being
deemed a "creditor" of the Borrowing  Subsidiaries  under the United States Code
as now in  effect or  hereafter  amended,  or any  comparable  provision  of any
successor statute.


                                  ARTICLE VIII

                            THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT

                  In order to expedite  the  transactions  contemplated  by this
Agreement, The Chase Manhattan Bank is hereby appointed to act as Administrative
Agent  on  behalf  of the  Lenders.  Each  of  the  Lenders  hereby  irrevocably
authorizes  the  Administrative  Agent to take  such  actions  on behalf of such
Lender  and to  exercise  such  powers  as  are  specifically  delegated  to the
Administrative  Agent by the terms and  provisions  hereof,  together  with such
actions and powers as are  reasonably  incidental  thereto.  The  Administrative
Agent is hereby expressly authorized by the Lenders, without hereby limiting any
implied  authority,  (a) to receive on behalf of the  Lenders  all  payments  of
principal of and interest on the Loans and all other  amounts due to the Lenders
hereunder,  and promptly to  distribute  to each Lender its 



proper share of each  payment so received;  (b) to give notice on behalf of each
of  the  Lenders  to  the  Borrowers  of any  Event  of  Default  of  which  the
Administrative Agent has actual knowledge acquired in connection with its agency
hereunder; and (c) to distribute to each Lender copies of all notices, financial
statements  and other  materials  delivered  by the  Borrowers  pursuant to this
Agreement as received by the Administrative Agent.

                  Neither  the  Administrative  Agent nor any of its  directors,
officers,  employees  or agents  shall be liable as such for any action taken or
omitted  by any of them  except  for its or his or her own gross  negligence  or
willful   misconduct,   or  be  responsible  for  any  statement,   warranty  or
representation  herein or the contents of any document  delivered in  connection
herewith,  or be required to  ascertain  or to make any inquiry  concerning  the
performance  or  observance  by the  Borrowers of any of the terms,  conditions,
covenants or agreements  contained in this Agreement.  The Administrative  Agent
shall not be  responsible  to the  Lenders for the due  execution,  genuineness,
validity, enforceability or effectiveness of this Agreement or other instruments
or  agreements.  The  Administrative  Agent may deem and treat the Lender  which
makes any Loan as the holder of the  indebtedness  resulting  therefrom  for all
purposes hereof until it shall have received  notice from such Lender,  given as
provided herein, of the transfer thereof.  The Administrative Agent shall in all
cases be fully  protected in acting,  or refraining  from acting,  in accordance
with  written  instructions  signed  by the  Required  Lenders  and,  except  as
otherwise  specifically  provided  herein,  such  instructions and any action or
inaction   pursuant   thereto   shall  be  binding  on  all  the  Lenders.   The
Administrative  Agent shall,  in the absence of knowledge  to the  contrary,  be
entitled to rely on any  instrument or document  believed by it in good faith to
be genuine and  correct and to have been signed or sent by the proper  person or
persons.  Neither the Administrative  Agent nor any of its directors,  officers,
employees or agents shall have any responsibility to the Borrowers on account of
the  failure  of or delay in  performance  or breach by any Lender of any of its
obligations  hereunder or to any Lender on account of the failure of or delay in
performance  or  breach by any other  Lender  or the  Borrowers  of any of their
respective  obligations hereunder or in connection herewith.  The Administrative
Agent may execute any and all duties hereunder by or through agents or employees
and shall be  entitled to rely upon the advice of legal  counsel  selected by it
with respect to all matters  arising  hereunder  and shall not be liable for any
action  taken or suffered in good faith by it in  accordance  with the advice of
such counsel.

                  The Lenders hereby acknowledge that the  Administrative  Agent
shall be under no duty to take any discretionary action permitted to be taken by
it pursuant to the provisions of this Agreement  unless it shall be requested in
writing to do so by the Required Lenders.

                  Subject  to the  appointment  and  acceptance  of a  successor
Administrative  Agent as provided below, the Administrative  Agent may resign at
any time by notifying  the Lenders and the Company.  Upon any such  resignation,
the Required Lenders shall have the right to appoint a successor  Administrative
Agent acceptable to the Company. If no successor shall have been so appointed by
the Required  Lenders and shall have  accepted such  appointment  within 30 days
after the retiring  Administrative  Agent gives notice of its resignation,  then
the  retiring  Administrative  Agent may,  on behalf of the  Lenders,  appoint a
successor  Administrative  Agent  which  shall be a bank  with an  office in the
United States, having a combined capital and surplus of at least $500,000,000 or
an  Affiliate  of any such  bank.  Upon the  acceptance  of any  appointment  as
Administrative Agent hereunder by a successor bank, such successor shall succeed
to and become vested with all the rights,  powers,  privileges and duties of the
retiring  Administrative  Agent and the retiring  Administrative  Agent shall be
discharged from its duties and obligations  hereunder.  After the Administrative
Agent's resignation  hereunder,  the provisions of this Article and Section 9.05
shall  continue  in effect for its  benefit in respect of any  actions  taken or
omitted to be taken by it while it was acting as Administrative Agent.



                  With  respect  to  the  Loans  made  by  it   hereunder,   the
Administrative  Agent in its individual capacity and not as Administrative Agent
shall have the same rights and powers as any other  Lender and may  exercise the
same as  though it were not the  Administrative  Agent,  and the  Administrative
Agent and its Affiliates may accept  deposits from,  lend money to and generally
engage in any kind of business  with the  Borrowers or any  Subsidiary  or other
Affiliate thereof as if it were not the Administrative Agent.

                  Each Lender agrees (i) to reimburse the Administrative  Agent,
on  demand,  in the  amount  of its pro  rata  share  (based  on its  Commitment
hereunder or, if the Commitments  shall have been terminated,  the amount of its
outstanding  Loans) of any  expenses  incurred for the benefit of the Lenders by
the Administrative Agent,  including counsel fees and compensation of agents and
employees paid for services  rendered on behalf of the Lenders,  which shall not
have been  reimbursed  by the  Borrowers and (ii) to indemnify and hold harmless
the  Administrative  Agent  and any of its  directors,  officers,  employees  or
agents,  on demand,  in the amount of such pro rata share,  from and against any
and all liabilities,  taxes, obligations,  losses, damages, penalties,  actions,
judgments,  suits,  costs,  expenses  or  disbursements  of any  kind or  nature
whatsoever  which may be imposed on,  incurred by or asserted  against it in its
capacity as the  Administrative  Agent in any way  relating to or arising out of
this  Agreement or any action taken or omitted by it under this Agreement to the
extent the same shall not have been  reimbursed by the Borrowers;  provided that
no Lender  shall be liable to the  Administrative  Agent for any portion of such
liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits,
costs,  expenses or disbursements  resulting from the gross negligence or wilful
misconduct  of the  Administrative  Agent  or any  of its  directors,  officers,
employees or agents.  Each Lender agrees that any allocation  made in good faith
by the  Administrative  Agent of expenses or other  amounts  referred to in this
paragraph  between this Agreement and the Facility A Credit  Agreement  shall be
conclusive and binding for all purposes absent manifest error.

                  Each  Lender  acknowledges  that  it  has,  independently  and
without reliance upon the Administrative  Agent or any other Lender and based on
such documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own credit
analysis  and  decision  to  enter  into  this   Agreement.   Each  Lender  also
acknowledges  that  it  will,   independently  and  without  reliance  upon  the
Administrative  Agent  or any  other  Lender  and  based on such  documents  and
information as it shall from time to time deem appropriate, continue to make its
own decisions in taking or not taking action under or based upon this  Agreement
or any related agreement or any document furnished hereunder or thereunder.

                  SECTION  9.04.  Successors  and Assigns.  (a) Whenever in this

                  (b) Each Lender may assign to one or more  assignees  all or a
portion of its interests, rights and obligations under this Agreement (including
all or a  portion  of its  Commitment  and the  Loans at the time  owing to it);
provided,  however,  that (i) except in the case of an assignment to a Lender or
an Affiliate  of a Lender,  the Company and the  Administrative  Agent must give
their prior written  consent  (except when there exists a Default or an Event of
Default) to such assignment (which consent shall not be unreasonably  withheld),
(ii) the  parties  to each such  assignment  shall  execute  and  deliver to the
Administrative  Agent  an  Assignment  and  Acceptance,  and  a  processing  and
recordation  fee of  $3,000,  (iii) the  assignee,  if it shall not be a Lender,
shall deliver to the Administrative Agent an Administrative  Questionnaire,  and
(iv) the amount of the  Commitment of the assigning  Lender subject to each such

(A) the  assignee  thereunder  shall be a party hereto and, to the extent of the

obligations  of a Lender  under  this  Agreement  and (B) the  assigning  Lender
thereunder  shall, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and
Acceptance,  be released from its obligations  under this Agreement 



(and, in the case of an Assignment and Acceptance  covering all or the remaining
portion of an assigning  Lender's rights and  obligations  under this Agreement,
such Lender shall cease to be a party hereto (but shall  continue to be entitled
to the benefits of Sections  2.13,  2.15,  2.19 and 9.05, as well as to any Fees
accrued  for its  account  hereunder  and not yet  paid)).  Notwithstanding  the
foregoing,  any Lender assigning its rights and obligations under this Agreement
may retain any  Competitive  Loans made by it  outstanding  at such time, and in
such case shall retain its rights  hereunder in respect of any Loans so retained
until such Loans have been repaid in full in accordance with this Agreement.

the interest  being assigned  thereby free and clear of any adverse claim,  (ii)
except as set forth in (i) above,  such assigning Lender makes no representation
or  warranty  and  assumes no  responsibility  with  respect to any  statements,
warranties or representations  made in or in connection with this Agreement,  or
the execution, legality, validity, enforceability,  genuineness,  sufficiency or
value of this Agreement or any other instrument or document  furnished  pursuant
hereto  or the  financial  condition  of the  Borrowers  or the  performance  or
observance by the Borrowers of any obligations under this Agreement or any other
instrument or document furnished pursuant hereto; (iii) such assignee represents
and warrants  that it is legally  authorized to enter into such  Assignment  and
Acceptance;  (iv) such  assignee  confirms  that it has  received a copy of this
Agreement,  together  with  copies  of  the  most  recent  financial  statements
delivered  pursuant to Section 5.03 and such other  documents and information as

into such Assignment and Acceptance;  (v) such assignee will  independently  and
without  reliance upon the  Administrative  Agent,  such assigning Lender or any
other  Lender  and based on such  documents  and  information  as it shall  deem
appropriate at the time,  continue to make its own credit decisions in taking or
not  taking  action  under  this  Agreement;  (vi) such  assignee  appoints  and
authorizes the  Administrative  Agent to take such action as agent on its behalf
and to  exercise  such  powers  under this  Agreement  as are  delegated  to the

reasonably  incidental  thereto;  and (vii) such  assignee  agrees  that it will
perform in accordance with their terms all the obligations which by the terms of
this Agreement are required to be performed by it as a Lender.

                  (d) The  Administrative  Agent  shall  maintain  at one of its
offices  in The  City  of New  York a copy  of each  Assignment  and  Acceptance
delivered to it and a register for the recordation of the names and addresses of
the Lenders,  and the Commitment of, and the principal amount of the Loans owing
to, each Lender pursuant to the terms hereof from time to time (the "Register").
The entries in the Register shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error
and the  Borrowers,  the  Administrative  Agent and the  Lenders  may treat each
person whose name is recorded in the Register  pursuant to the terms hereof as a
Lender  hereunder  for all purposes of this  Agreement.  The  Register  shall be
available for inspection by each party hereto,  at any reasonable  time and from
time to time upon reasonable prior notice.

                  (e)  Upon  its  receipt  of a duly  completed  Assignment  and
Acceptance  executed by an  assigning  Lender and an assignee  together  with an
Administrative  Questionnaire  completed in respect of the assignee  (unless the
assignee shall already be a Lender  hereunder),  the processing and  recordation
fee referred to in paragraph (b) above and the written consent of the Company to
such assignment,  the Administrative  Agent shall (i) accept such Assignment and
Acceptance and (ii) record the information contained therein in the Register.

                  (f) Each Lender may sell  participations  to one or more banks
or other entities in all or a portion of its rights and  obligations  under this
Agreement  (including  all or a portion of its Commitment



and  the  Loans  owing  to  it);  provided,  however,  that  (i)  such  Lender's
obligations under this Agreement shall remain unchanged,  (ii) such Lender shall
remain solely  responsible  to the other parties  hereto for the  performance of
such  obligations,  (iii)  each  participating  bank or  other  entity  shall be
entitled to the benefit of the cost protection  provisions contained in Sections
2.13,  2.15 and 2.19 to the same  extent as if it were the  selling  Lender (and
limited to the amount that could have been claimed by the selling  Lender had it
continued  to hold the  interest of such  participating  bank or other  entity),
except that all claims made pursuant to such Sections shall be made through such
selling Lender, and (iv) the Borrowers,  the Administrative  Agent and the other
Lenders shall  continue to deal solely and directly with such selling  Lender in
connection with such Lender's rights and obligations under this Agreement.

                  (g) Any Lender or  participant  may,  in  connection  with any
assignment or participation or proposed assignment or participation  pursuant to
this Section,  disclose to the assignee or participant  or proposed  assignee or
participant any information  relating to the Borrowers furnished to such Lender;
provided that, prior to any such  disclosure,  each such assignee or participant
or proposed  assignee or  participant  shall  execute an agreement  whereby such
assignee  or  participant  shall  agree  (subject to  customary  exceptions)  to
preserve the confidentiality of any such information.

                  (h) The Borrowers  shall not assign or delegate any rights and
duties hereunder without the prior written consent of all Lenders.

                  (i) Any  Lender may at any time  pledge all or any  portion of
its rights under this Agreement to a Federal Reserve Bank; provided that no such
pledge shall release any Lender from its obligations hereunder or substitute any
such Bank for such  Lender as a party  hereto.  In order to  facilitate  such an
assignment to a Federal Reserve Bank, each Borrower shall, at the request of the
assigning Lender,  duly execute and deliver to the assigning Lender a promissory
note or notes evidencing the Loans made to such Borrower by the assigning Lender
hereunder.

                  SECTION 9.05. Expenses;  Indemnity. (a) The Borrowers agree to
pay all reasonable  out-of-pocket  expenses incurred by the Administrative Agent
in  connection  with  entering  into this  Agreement or in  connection  with any
amendments,  modifications or waivers of the provisions  hereof,  or incurred by
the  Administrative  Agent or any Lender in connection  with the  enforcement or
protection  of their rights in connection  with this  Agreement or in connection
with the Loans made  hereunder or under any Local Currency  Addendum,  including
the fees and  disbursements of counsel for the  Administrative  Agent or, in the
case of enforcement, the Lenders.

                  (b) The Borrowers agree to indemnify the Administrative Agent,
each Lender, each of their Affiliates and the directors, officers, employees and
agents of the foregoing (each such person being called an "Indemnitee") against,
and to hold each Indemnitee harmless from, any and all losses, claims,  damages,
liabilities  and  related  expenses,   including  reasonable  counsel  fees  and
expenses,  incurred by or asserted against any Indemnitee arising out of (i) the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (ii) the use of
the  proceeds  of the Loans or (iii) any  claim,  litigation,  investigation  or
proceeding relating to any of the foregoing,  whether or not any Indemnitee is a
party thereto;  provided that such indemnity shall not, as to any Indemnitee, be
available  to the extent  that such  losses,  claims,  damages,  liabilities  or
related  expenses  are  determined  by a final  judgment of a court of competent
jurisdiction to have resulted from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of
such Indemnitee.

                  (c) The provisions of this Section shall remain  operative and
in full  force  and  effect  regardless  of the  expiration  of the term of this
Agreement,  the  consummation  of  the  transactions  contemplated  hereby,  the
repayment of any of the Loans, the invalidity or unenforceability of any term or



provision  of this  Agreement or any  investigation  made by or on behalf of the
Administrative  Agent or any Lender. All amounts due under this Section shall be
payable on written demand therefor.

                  SECTION 9.06.  APPLICABLE LAW. THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE 
CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH AND GOVERNED BY THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK.

                  SECTION 9.07. Waivers;  Amendment.  (a) No failure or delay of
the  Administrative  Agent  or any  Lender  in  exercising  any  power  or right
hereunder  shall  operate as a waiver  thereof,  nor shall any single or partial
exercise of any such right or power,  or any  abandonment or  discontinuance  of
steps to enforce such a right or power,  preclude any other or further  exercise
thereof or the exercise of any other right or power.  The rights and remedies of
the  Administrative  Agent and the Lenders  hereunder are cumulative and are not
exclusive of any rights or remedies which they would  otherwise  have. No waiver
of any provision of this Agreement or consent to any departure  therefrom  shall
in any event be effective  unless the same shall be  permitted by paragraph  (b)
below,  and then such waiver or consent shall be effective  only in the specific
instance  and for the  purpose  for  which  given.  No  notice  or demand on any
Borrower or any  Subsidiary in any case shall entitle such party to any other or
further notice or demand in similar or other circumstances.

                  (b) Neither this  Agreement  nor any  provision  hereof may be
waived,  amended or modified  except  pursuant to an agreement or  agreements in
writing  entered  into by the  Borrowers  and the  Required  Lenders;  provided,
however,  that no such agreement shall (i) decrease the principal  amount of, or
extend the maturity of or any scheduled  principal  payment date or date for the
payment of any  interest on any Loan or waive or excuse any such  payment or any
part  thereof,  or decrease the rate of interest on any Loan,  without the prior
written consent of each Lender affected thereby, (ii) increase the Commitment or
decrease  the Facility Fee of any Lender  without the prior  written  consent of
such Lender,  (iii) limit or release the  guarantee set forth in Article VII, or
(iv) amend or modify the  provisions  of Section  2.16 or Section  9.04(h),  the
provisions of this Section or the definition of the "Required Lenders",  without
the prior written consent of each Lender;  provided  further,  however,  that no
such agreement shall amend,  modify or otherwise  affect the rights or duties of
the  Administrative  Agent  hereunder  without the prior written  consent of the
Administrative  Agent.  Each Lender  shall be bound by any waiver,  amendment or
modification  authorized by this Section and any consent by any Lender  pursuant
to this Section shall bind any assignee of its rights and interests hereunder.

                  SECTION  9.08.  Entire  Agreement.   This  Agreement  and  the
agreements  referred to in Section 2.06(b)  constitute the entire contract among
the parties relative to the subject matter hereof.  Any previous agreement among
the parties  with respect to the subject  matter  hereof is  superseded  by this
Agreement.  Nothing in this  Agreement,  expressed  or  implied,  is intended to
confer  upon any party  other  than the  parties  hereto any  rights,  remedies,
obligations or liabilities under or by reason of this Agreement.

                  SECTION  9.09.  Severability.  In the event any one or more of
the provisions  contained in this Agreement  should be held invalid,  illegal or
unenforceable in any respect,  the validity,  legality and enforceability of the
remaining  provisions  contained  herein  shall  not in any way be  affected  or
impaired  thereby.  The parties  shall  endeavor in good-faith  negotiations  to
replace the invalid,  illegal or unenforceable  provisions with valid provisions
the economic  effect of which comes as close as possible to that of the invalid,
illegal or unenforceable provisions.



                  SECTION 9.10. Counterparts.  This Agreement may be executed in
two or more counterparts,  each of which shall constitute an original but all of
which when taken  together shall  constitute but one contract,  and shall become
effective as provided in Section 9.03.

                  SECTION 9.11.  Headings.  Article and Section headings and the
Table of Contents used herein are for  convenience  of reference  only,  are not
part of this Agreement and are not to affect the construction of, or to be taken
into consideration in interpreting, this Agreement.

                  SECTION  9.12.  Right of Setoff.  If an Event of Default shall
have occurred and be  continuing,  each Lender is hereby  authorized at any time
and from time to time,  to the fullest  extent  permitted by law, to set off and
apply any and all deposits (general or special,  time or demand,  provisional or
final) at any time held and other  indebtedness at any time owing by such Lender
to or for the credit or obligations of the Company and any Borrowing  Subsidiary
now or hereafter existing under this Agreement held by such Lender, irrespective
of whether or not such Lender  shall have made any demand  under this  Agreement
and although such  obligations may be unmatured.  Each Lender agrees promptly to
notify  the  Company  and  the  Administrative   Agent  after  such  setoff  and
application  made by such Lender,  but the failure to give such notice shall not
affect the  validity of such setoff and  application.  The rights of each Lender
under this Section are in addition to other rights and remedies (including other
rights of setoff) which such Lender may have.

                  SECTION 9.13. Jurisdiction; Consent to Service of Process. (a)
Each Borrower hereby irrevocably and unconditionally submits, for itself and its
property,  to the  nonexclusive  jurisdiction  of any New  York  State  court or
Federal  court of the United States of America  sitting in New York County,  and
any appellate court from any thereof, in any action or proceeding arising out of
or relating to this Agreement,  any Local Currency Addendum,  or for recognition
or  enforcement  of  any  judgment,  and  each  of  the  parties  hereto  hereby
irrevocably  and  unconditionally  agrees that all claims in respect of any such
action or proceeding  may be heard and  determined in such New York State or, to
the extent  permitted by law, in such Federal court.  Each of the parties hereto
agrees  that a  final  judgment  in any  such  action  or  proceeding  shall  be
conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or
in any other manner  provided by law.  Subject to the foregoing and to paragraph
(b)  below,  nothing  in this  Agreement  shall  affect any right that any party
hereto may  otherwise  have to bring any action or  proceeding  relating to this
Agreement,  any Local  Currency  Addendum  against any other party hereto in the
courts of any jurisdiction.

                  (b)  Each  Borrower  hereby  irrevocably  and  unconditionally
waives,  to the  fullest  extent  it may  legally  and  effectively  do so,  any
objection  which it may now or  thereafter  have to the  laying  of venue of any
suit,  action or proceeding  arising out of or relating to this Agreement or any
Local  Currency  Addendum  in any New York State or Federal  court.  Each of the
parties hereto hereby  irrevocably  waives,  to the fullest extent  permitted by
law, the defense of an  inconvenient  forum to the maintenance of such action or
proceeding in any such court.

                  (c)  Each  party to this  Agreement  irrevocably  consents  to
service of process in the manner  provided for notices in Section 9.01.  Nothing
in this  Agreement will affect the right of any party to this Agreement to serve
process in any other manner permitted by law.

                  SECTION 9.14.  Waiver of Jury Trial.  EACH PARTY HERETO HEREBY
WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE
TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION  DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY  ARISING
OUT OF,  UNDER OR IN  CONNECTION  WITH THIS  AGREEMENT.  Each  party  hereto (a)
certifies  that no  representative,  agent or  attorney  of any other  party has



represented,  expressly  or  otherwise,  that such other party would not, in the
event of litigation,  seek to enforce the foregoing  waiver and (b) acknowledges
that it and other parties  hereto have been induced to enter into this Agreement
by, among other things, the mutual waivers and certification in this Section.

                  SECTION  9.15.  Addition  of  Borrowing   Subsidiaries.   Each
Borrowing Subsidiary which shall deliver to the Administrative Agent a Borrowing
Subsidiary  Agreement  executed by such  Subsidiary and the Company shall,  upon
such  delivery  and without  further  act,  become a party hereto and a Borrower
hereunder  with the same  effect  as if it had  been an  original  party to this
Agreement.

                  SECTION  9.16.  Conversion  of  Currencies.  (a)  If,  for the
purpose of  obtaining  judgment in any court,  it is  necessary to convert a sum
owing hereunder in one currency into another currency, each party hereto agrees,
to the fullest  extent that it may  effectively do so, that the rate of exchange
used shall be that at which in accordance with normal banking  procedures in the
relevant  jurisdiction  the first  currency  could be purchased  with such other
currency  on the  Business  Day  immediately  preceding  the day on which  final
judgment is given.

                  (b) The obligations of the Borrowers in respect of any sum due
to any  party  hereto or any  holder of the  obligations  owing  hereunder  (the
"Applicable  Creditor") shall,  notwithstanding  any judgment in a currency (the
"Judgment  Currency")  other than the currency in which such sum is stated to be
due hereunder (the "Agreement Currency"), be discharged only to the extent that,
on the  Business Day  following  receipt by the  Applicable  Creditor of any sum
adjudged to be so due in the Judgment Currency,  the Applicable  Creditor may in
accordance with normal banking procedures in the relevant  jurisdiction purchase
the  Agreement  Currency  with  the  Judgment  Currency;  if the  amount  of the
Agreement  Currency  so  purchased  is less than the sum  originally  due to the
Applicable  Creditor  in the  Agreement  Currency,  the  Borrowers  agree,  as a
separate  obligation and  notwithstanding  any such  judgment,  to indemnify the
Applicable  Creditor  against  such  loss.  The  obligations  of  the  Borrowers
contained in this Section 9.16 shall survive the  termination  of this Agreement
and the payment of all other amounts owing hereunder.


                  IN WITNESS  WHEREOF,  the  parties  hereto  have  caused  this
Agreement to be duly executed by their respective  authorized officers as of the
day and year first above written.

                           CREDIT  FACILITY  AGREEMENT  (as it  may be  amended,
                           supplemented or otherwise modified,  the "Agreement")
                           dated as of December  20,  1996,  among ITT  HARTFORD
                           GROUP, INC., a Delaware  corporation (the "Company"),
                           each Borrowing  Subsidiary party hereto,  the lenders
                           listed in Schedule 2.01 together with their permitted
                           assignees,  the  "Lenders")  and THE CHASE  MANHATTAN
                           BANK,   a   New   York   banking   corporation,    as
                           administrative   agent  for  the   Lenders  (in  such
                           capacity, the "Administrative Agent").


                  The  Lenders  have  been  requested  to  extend  credit to the
Borrowers  (such term and each  other  capitalized  term used but not  otherwise
defined herein having the meaning assigned to it in Article I) to enable them to
borrow on a standby  revolving  credit basis on and after the date hereof and at
any time and from time to time prior to the Maturity Date a principal amount not
in excess of  $500,000,000 at any time  outstanding.  The Lenders have also been
requested to provide a procedure  pursuant to which the Borrowers may invite the
Lenders  to  bid  on an  uncommitted  basis  on  short-term  borrowings  by  the
Borrowers.  The proceeds of such  borrowings are to be used for working  capital
and other general corporate  purposes.  The Lenders are willing to extend credit
on the terms and subject to the conditions herein set forth.

                  Accordingly, the parties hereto agree as follows:


                                                 ARTICLE I

                                                DEFINITIONS

                  SECTION 1.01.  Defined Terms.  As used in this Agreement, the 
following terms shall have the meanings specified below:

                  "ABR Borrowing" shall mean a Borrowing comprised of ABR Loans.

                  "ABR Loan" shall mean any Standby Loan  bearing  interest at a
rate  determined by reference to the Alternate Base Rate in accordance  with the
provisions of Article II.

                  "Administrative Fees" shall have the meaning assigned to such 
term in Section 2.06(b).

                  "Administrative Questionnaire" shall mean an Administrative 
Questionnaire in the form of Exhibit B hereto.

                  "Affiliate"  shall mean, when used with respect to a specified
person,  another person that directly or indirectly controls or is controlled by
or is under common control with the person specified.

                  "Alternate  Base  Rate"  shall  mean,  for any day, a rate per
annum  (rounded  upwards,  if  necessary,  to the next  1/16 of 1%) equal to the
greater  of (a) the Prime Rate in effect on such day and (b) the  Federal  Funds
Effective Rate in effect on such day plus 1/2 of 1%. For purposes hereof, "Prime


Rate" shall mean the rate of interest per annum publicly  announced from time to
time by the  Administrative  Agent as its prime rate in effect at its  principal
office in New York City; each change in the Prime Rate shall be effective on the
date such change is publicly  announced as effective.  "Federal Funds  Effective
Rate" shall mean,  for any day, the  weighted  average of the rates on overnight
Federal funds  transactions  with members of the Federal Reserve System arranged
by Federal funds brokers, as released on the next succeeding Business Day by the
Federal  Reserve  Bank of New York,  or, if such rate is not so released for any
day which is a Business Day, the arithmetic average (rounded upwards to the next
1/100th of 1%), as determined by the Administrative Agent, of the quotations for
the day of such  transactions  received by the  Administrative  Agent from three
Federal funds brokers of recognized  standing  selected by it. If for any reason
the  Administrative  Agent shall have determined (which  determination  shall be
conclusive  absent  manifest  error) that it is unable to ascertain  the Federal
Funds  Effective Rate for any reason,  including the inability or failure of the
Administrative  Agent to obtain  sufficient  quotations in  accordance  with the
terms  thereof,  the Alternate  Base Rate shall be determined  without regard to
clause (b) of the first  sentence  of this  definition  until the  circumstances
giving rise to such inability no longer exist.  Any change in the Alternate Base
Rate due to a change in the Prime Rate or the Federal Funds Effective Rate shall
be  effective  on the  effective  date of such  change in the Prime  Rate or the
Federal Funds Effective Rate, respectively.

                  "Annual  Statement" shall mean, with respect to the Restricted
Subsidiaries,  the Annual Statement of such Restricted Subsidiary required to be
filed with the  Applicable  Insurance  Regulatory  Authority in accordance  with
state law, including any exhibits, schedules, certificates or actuarial opinions
filed or delivered therewith.

                  "Applicable  Insurance Regulatory  Authority" shall mean, with
respect  to any  Insurance  Subsidiary,  the  insurance  commission  or  similar
Governmental  Authority located in the state in which such Insurance  Subsidiary
is domiciled and any Federal insurance Governmental Authority.

                  "Applicable  Percentage"  shall mean on any date, with respect
to Eurodollar Standby Loans or with respect to the Facility Fee, as the case may
be, the  applicable  percentage  set forth below  under the caption  "Eurodollar
Spread" or "Facility Fee Percentage", as the case may be, based upon the Ratings
in effect on such date:

Category 1                    Eurodollar Spread          Facility Fee Percentage
- ----------                    -----------------          -----------------------

AA- or higher by D&P;              .135%                              .040%

A1 or A2 by Moody's;
A+ or A by S&P

Category 3
- ----------

A- by D&P;                         .190%                              .060%

Baa1 by Moody's;
BBB+ by S&P

Category 5
- ----------

BBB- or lower by S&P

For purposes of the  foregoing,  (i) if the Ratings shall fall within  different
Categories,  the Applicable Percentage shall be based upon the Category in which
the  largest  number of Ratings  falls or is deemed to fall,  provided,  that if
there shall be no such  Category,  one Rating shall be excluded from each of the
highest and the lowest  Categories  in which  Ratings shall fall or be deemed to
fall, and the Applicable  Percentage  shall be based upon the remaining  Rating;
(ii) if only two Ratings exist,  the Applicable  Percentage  shall be based upon
the lower (numerically higher Category) of the available Ratings,  (iii) if only
a single Rating exists, the Applicable  Percentage shall be based upon the lower
(numerically higher) of Category 5 and the Category  corresponding to the single
available Rating; provided, however, that if only a single rating exists because
D&P,  Moody's  or S&P  ceases  to be in the  business  of rating  the  Company's
corporate debt  obligations,  the Applicable  Percentage shall be based upon the
Category  in which such  single  Rating  falls;  (iv) if no Ratings  exist,  the
Applicable  Percentage  shall be based  upon  Category  6, and (v) if any Rating
shall be changed (other than as a result of a change in the rating system of the
applicable  Rating  Agency),  such change  shall be  effective as of the date on
which it is first  announced by the Rating Agency making such change.  Each such
change in the Applicable  Percentage  shall apply to all outstanding  Eurodollar
Standby Loans during the period  commencing on the effective date of such change
and ending on the date immediately preceding the effective date of the next such
change.  If the rating  system of any Rating  Agency shall  change,  the parties
hereto shall negotiate in good faith to amend the references to specific ratings
in this definition to reflect such changed rating system.

                  "Borrowing  Subsidiary"  shall mean any Subsidiary which shall
have  executed  and  delivered  to the  Administrative  Agent and each  Lender a

open for  business  in New York  City;  provided,  however,  that,  when used in
connection  with a Eurodollar  Loan,  the term "Business Day" shall also exclude

account of maintenance and repairs, insurance,  taxes, assessments,  water rates
and similar charges.

Lender  agrees,  severally  and  not  jointly,  to  make  Standby  Loans  to the
Borrowers, at any time and from time to time on and after the Effective Date and
until the earlier of the Maturity Date and the  termination of the Commitment of
such Lender,  in an aggregate  principal  amount at any time  outstanding not to

Loans  made by all  Lenders  plus (y) the  outstanding  principal  amount of all

that any exercise of such option shall not affect the obligation of the Borrower
to repay such Loan in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. Borrowings of
more than one Type may be  outstanding  at the same time.  For  purposes  of the
foregoing,  Loans having different Interest Periods,  regardless of whether they
commence on the same date, shall be considered separate Loans.

                  (c) Subject to Section 2.05,  each Lender shall make each Loan
to be made by it  hereunder on the  proposed  date  thereof by wire  transfer of
immediately  available funds to the Administrative  Agent in New York, New York,
not later than 12:00  noon,  New York City time,  and the  Administrative  Agent
shall by 2:00 p.m.,  New York City time,  credit the  amounts so received to the
account or accounts specified from time to time in one or more notices delivered
by the Company to the Administrative Agent or, if a Borrowing shall not occur on
such date because any condition  precedent  herein


specified  shall  not have been met,  return  the  amounts  so  received  to the
respective  Lenders.  Competitive  Loans  shall be made by the Lender or Lenders
whose  Competitive  Bids  therefor are accepted  pursuant to Section 2.03 in the
amounts so  accepted.  Standby  Loans  shall be made by the  Lenders pro rata in
accordance  with  Section  2.16.  Unless  the  Administrative  Agent  shall have
received  notice  from a  Lender  prior  to the  date  (or,  in the  case of ABR
Borrowings,  on the  date)  of any  Borrowing  that  such  Lender  will not make
available to the  Administrative  Agent such Lender's portion of such Borrowing,
the  Administrative  Agent may assume  that such  Lender  has made such  portion
available  to the  Administrative  Agent  on  the  date  of  such  Borrowing  in
accordance with this paragraph (c) and the Administrative Agent may, in reliance
upon  such   assumption,   make  available  to  the  Borrower  on  such  date  a
corresponding  amount. If and to the extent that such Lender shall not have made
such portion available to the Administrative Agent, such Lender and the Borrower
severally  agree to repay to the  Administrative  Agent forthwith on demand such
corresponding  amount together with interest thereon, for each day from the date
such  amount is made  available  to the  Borrower  until the date such amount is
repaid  to the  Administrative  Agent  at (i) in the case of the  Borrower,  the
interest rate applicable at the time to the Loans  comprising such Borrowing and
(ii) in the case of such  Lender,  the Federal  Funds  Effective  Rate.  If such
Lender shall repay to the Administrative  Agent such corresponding  amount, such
amount  shall  constitute  such  Lender's  Loan as part  of such  Borrowing  for
purposes of this Agreement.

                  SECTION  2.03.  Competitive  Bid  Procedure.  (a) In  order to
request  Competitive  Bids, a Borrower (the  "Applicable  Borrower")  shall hand
deliver or telecopy to the Administrative Agent a duly completed Competitive Bid
Request in the form of Exhibit A-1 hereto, to be received by the  Administrative
Agent (i) in the case of a  Eurodollar  Competitive  Loan,  not later than 10:00
a.m.,  New York City time,  four  Business  Days  before a proposed  Competitive
Borrowing and (ii) in the case of a Fixed Rate  Borrowing,  not later than 10:00
a.m.,  New York City  time,  one  Business  Day  before a  proposed  Competitive
Borrowing. No ABR Loan shall be requested in, or made pursuant to, a Competitive
Bid Request.  A Competitive Bid Request that does not conform  substantially  to
the format of Exhibit  A-1 may be rejected in the  Administrative  Agent's  sole
discretion,  and the Administrative  Agent shall promptly notify the Borrower of
such  rejection by telecopy.  Each  Competitive  Bid Request shall refer to this
Agreement and specify (w) whether the Borrowing then being  requested is to be a
Eurodollar  Borrowing or a Fixed Rate Borrowing,  (x) the date of such Borrowing
(which shall be a Business Day) and the aggregate principal amount thereof which
shall  be in a  minimum  principal  amount  of  $10,000,000  and in an  integral
multiple of $5,000,000 and (y) the Interest  Period with respect  thereto (which
may  not  end  after  the  Maturity  Date).  Promptly  after  its  receipt  of a
Competitive  Bid Request that is not rejected as aforesaid,  the  Administrative
Agent shall telecopy to the Lenders a Notice of Competitive Bid Request inviting
the  Lenders to bid,  on the terms and  conditions  of this  Agreement,  to make
Competitive Loans.

                  (b) Each Lender  invited to bid may,  in its sole  discretion,
make one or more Competitive Bids to the Applicable  Borrower responsive to such
Borrower's  Competitive  Bid Request.  Each  Competitive Bid by a Lender must be
received by the  Administrative  Agent by  telecopy,  in the form of Exhibit A-3
hereto,  (i) in the case of a Eurodollar  Competitive  Loan, not later than 9:30
a.m.,  New York City time,  three  Business  Days before a proposed  Competitive
Borrowing  and (ii) in the case of a Fixed Rate  Borrowing,  not later than 9:30
a.m.,  New York City time,  on the day of a proposed  Competitive  Borrowing.  A
Lender may submit multiple bids to the  Administrative  Agent.  Competitive Bids
that do not conform  substantially  to the format of Exhibit A-3 may be rejected
by the  Administrative  Agent,  and the  Administrative  Agent shall  notify the
Lender making such  nonconforming  bid of such rejection as soon as practicable.
Each Competitive Bid shall refer to this Agreement and specify (x) the principal
amount (which shall be in a minimum  principal  amount of  $5,000,000  and in an
integral  multiple of $1,000,000 and which may equal the entire principal amount
of the Competitive  Borrowing  requested) of the Competitive  Loan or Loans that
the Lender is willing to make,  (y) the  Competitive  Bid


Rate or Rates at which the Lender is  prepared to make the  Competitive  Loan or
Loans  and (z) the  Interest  Period  and the last day  thereof.  If any  Lender
invited to bid shall elect not to make a  Competitive  Bid, such Lender shall so
notify  the  Administrative  Agent by  telecopy  (I) in the  case of  Eurodollar
Competitive  Loans, not later than 9:30 a.m., New York City time, three Business
Days before a proposed Competitive Borrowing, and (II) in the case of Fixed Rate
Loans,  not later than 9:30 a.m.,  New York City time,  on the day of a proposed
Competitive  Borrowing;  provided,  however,  that failure by any Lender to give
such notice shall not cause such Lender to be obligated to make any  Competitive
Loan as part of such  Competitive  Borrowing.  A Competitive  Bid submitted by a
Lender pursuant to this paragraph (b) shall be irrevocable.

                  (c) The Administrative  Agent shall as promptly as practicable
notify  the  Borrower,  by  telecopy,  of all the  Competitive  Bids  made,  the
Competitive  Bid Rate  and the  principal  amount  of each  Competitive  Loan in
respect of which a Competitive  Bid was made and the identity of the Lender that
made each bid.  The  Administrative  Agent shall send a copy of all  Competitive
Bids to the Borrower for its records as soon as practicable  after completion of
the bidding process set forth in this Section 2.03.

                  (d) The  Borrower  may in its  sole and  absolute  discretion,
subject  only to the  provisions  of this  paragraph  (d),  accept or reject any
Competitive  Bid referred to in paragraph (c) above.  The Borrower  shall notify
the  Administrative  Agent by telephone,  confirmed by telecopy in the form of a
Competitive Bid Accept/Reject Letter,  whether and to what extent it has decided
to accept or reject any of or all the bids  referred to in  paragraph  (c) above
not more than one hour  after it shall  have been  notified  of such bids by the
Administrative Agent pursuant to such paragraph (c); provided, however, that (i)
the  failure  of the  Borrower  to give  such  notice  shall be  deemed  to be a
rejection of all the bids referred to in paragraph (c) above,  (ii) the Borrower
shall  not  accept a bid  made at a  particular  Competitive  Bid Rate if it has
decided  to  reject  a bid  made at a lower  Competitive  Bid  Rate,  (iii)  the
aggregate  amount of the  Competitive  Bids  accepted by the Borrower  shall not
exceed the principal  amount  specified in the Competitive Bid Request,  (iv) if
the Borrower  shall accept a bid or bids made at a  particular  Competitive  Bid
Rate but the amount of such bid or bids shall cause the total  amount of bids to
be accepted to exceed the amount specified in the Competitive Bid Request,  then
the  Borrower  shall  accept a portion of such bid or bids in an amount equal to
the amount specified in the Competitive Bid Request less the amount of all other
Competitive  Bids accepted with respect to such  Competitive Bid Request,  which
acceptance,  in the case of multiple bids at such Competitive Bid Rate, shall be
made pro rata in accordance with the amount of each such bid at such Competitive
Bid Rate, and (v) except pursuant to clause (iv) above, no bid shall be accepted
for a Competitive Loan unless such  Competitive  Loan is in a minimum  principal
amount of $5,000,000 and an integral  multiple of $1,000,000;  provided further,
however,  that if a Competitive  Loan must be in an amount less than  $5,000,000
because of the provisions of clause (iv) above, such Competitive Loan may be for
a minimum of $1,000,000 or any integral multiple thereof, and in calculating the
pro rata  allocation of acceptances of portions of multiple bids at a particular
Competitive  Bid Rate  pursuant to clause  (iv) the amounts  shall be rounded to
integral multiples of $1,000,000 in a manner which shall be in the discretion of
the  Borrower.   A  notice  given  pursuant  to  this  paragraph  (d)  shall  be
irrevocable.

                  (e)  The  Administrative  Agent  shall  promptly  notify  each
bidding Lender whether or not its  Competitive Bid has been accepted (and if so,
in what  amount  and at  what  Competitive  Bid  Rate)  by  telecopy,  and  each
successful  bidder will thereupon become bound,  subject to the other applicable
conditions  hereof, to make the Competitive Loan in respect of which its bid has
been accepted.

                  (f) No  Competitive  Borrowing  shall  be  requested  or  made
hereunder  if after giving  effect  thereto any of the  conditions  set forth in
subsections (i) or (ii) of Section 2.01 would not be met.


                  (g) If the  Administrative  Agent  shall  elect  to  submit  a
Competitive  Bid in its capacity as a Lender,  it shall submit such bid directly
to the  Applicable  Borrower one quarter of an hour earlier than the latest time
at  which  the  other   Lenders  are  required  to  submit  their  bids  to  the
Administrative Agent pursuant to paragraph (b) above.

                  (h) All notices  required by this  Section 2.03 shall be given
in accordance with Section 9.01.

                  SECTION 2.04. Standby Borrowing Procedure. In order to request
a  Standby  Borrowing,  a  Borrower  shall  hand  deliver  or  telecopy  to  the
Administrative  Agent a duly completed  Standby Borrowing Request in the form of
Exhibit A-5 (a) in the case of a Eurodollar  Standby Loan,  not later than 10:30
a.m., New York City time, three Business Days before such Borrowing,  and (b) in
the case of an ABR Borrowing,  not later than 10:30 a.m., New York City time, on
the day of such  Borrowing.  No  Fixed  Rate  Loan  shall be  requested  or made
pursuant to a Standby  Borrowing  Request.  Such notice shall be irrevocable and
shall in each case specify (i) whether the Borrowing then being  requested is to
be a Eurodollar Standby Loan or an ABR Borrowing;  (ii) the date of such Standby
Borrowing  (which shall be a Business Day) and the amount thereof;  and (iii) if
such  Borrowing is to be a Eurodollar  Standby  Loan,  the Interest  Period with
respect thereto,  which shall not end after the Maturity Date. If no election as
to the Type of Standby  Borrowing  is  specified  in any such  notice,  then the
requested  Standby  Borrowing  shall be an ABR Borrowing.  If no Interest Period
with  respect to any  Eurodollar  Standby  Loan is specified in any such notice,
then the  Borrower  shall be deemed to have  selected an Interest  Period of one
month's duration,  in the case of a Eurodollar  Borrowing.  Notwithstanding  any
other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, no Standby Borrowing shall be
requested  if the  Interest  Period  with  respect  thereto  would end after the
Maturity  Date.  The  Administrative  Agent  shall  promptly  advise each of the
Lenders of any notice given  pursuant to this Section 2.04 and of each  Lender's
portion of the requested Borrowing.

                  SECTION 2.05.  Conversion and  Continuation  of Standby Loans.
Each Borrower shall have the right at any time upon prior irrevocable  notice to
the  Administrative  Agent (i) not later than 10:30 a.m., New York City time, on
the day of the conversion,  to convert all or any part of any Eurodollar Standby
Loan into an ABR  Borrowing,  and (ii) not later than 10:30 a.m.,  New York City
time,  three Business Days prior to conversion or  continuation,  to convert any
ABR  Borrowing  into a Eurodollar  Standby  Loan or to continue  any  Eurodollar
Standby Loan as a Eurodollar  Standby Loan for an  additional  Interest  Period,
subject in each case to the following:

                  (a) if less than all the outstanding  principal  amount of any
         Standby  Borrowing  shall be  converted  or  continued,  the  aggregate
         principal amount of the Standby Borrowing  converted or continued shall
         be an integral multiple of $5,000,000 and not less than $20,000,000;

                  (b) accrued interest on a Standby Borrowing (or portion 
         thereof) being converted shall be paid by the Borrower at the time of 
         conversion;

                  (c) if any  Eurodollar  Standby  Loan is  converted  at a time
         other  than the end of the  Interest  Period  applicable  thereto,  the
         Borrower  shall  pay,  upon  demand,  any  amounts  due to the  Lenders
         pursuant to Section 2.15;

                  (d) any portion of a Standby Borrowing maturing or required to
         be repaid in less than one month may not be converted into or continued
         as a Eurodollar Standby Loan;


                  (e) any portion of a  Eurodollar  Standby Loan which cannot be
         continued  as a  Eurodollar  Standby Loan by reason of clause (d) above
         shall be  automatically  converted at the end of the Interest Period in
         effect for such Eurodollar Standby Loan into an ABR Borrowing;

                  (f) no Interest Period may be selected for any Eurodollar 
         Standby Loan that would end later than the Maturity Date; and

                  (g)  at  any  time  when  there  shall  have  occurred  and be
         continuing  any  Default  or  Event of  Default,  no  Borrowing  may be
         converted into or continued as a Eurodollar Standby Loan.

                  Each notice pursuant to this Section 2.05 shall be irrevocable
and shall refer to this Agreement and specify (i) the identity and amount of the
Standby  Borrowing  to be  converted  or  continued,  (ii)  whether such Standby
Borrowing is to be converted to or continued as a Eurodollar  Standby Loan or an
ABR  Borrowing,  (iii) if such notice  requests a  conversion,  the date of such
conversion (which shall be a Business Day) and (iv) if such Standby Borrowing is
to be  converted to or continued  as a  Eurodollar  Standby  Loan,  the Interest
Period with  respect  thereto.  If no Interest  Period is  specified in any such
notice with respect to any conversion to or continuation as a Eurodollar Standby
Loan,  the Borrower  shall be deemed to have selected an Interest  Period of one
month's  duration.  If no notice shall have been given in  accordance  with this
Section  2.05 to  convert  or  continue  any  Standby  Borrowing,  such  Standby
Borrowing  shall, at the end of the Interest Period  applicable  thereto (unless
repaid  pursuant to the terms  hereof),  automatically  be continued  into a new
Interest Period as an ABR Borrowing.

                  SECTION  2.06.  Fees.  (a) The  Company  agrees to pay to each
Lender,  through the Administrative  Agent, on each March 31, June 30, September
30 and December 31 (with the first  payment  being due on December 31, 1996) and
on each date on which the  Commitment  of such  Lender  shall be  terminated  as
provided herein, a facility fee (a "Facility Fee"), at a rate per annum equal to
the  Applicable  Percentage  from time to time in  effect  on the  amount of the
Commitment of such Lender,  whether used or unused, during the preceding quarter
(or other period  commencing on the Effective  Date, or ending with the Maturity
Date or any date on which the  Commitment  of such Lender shall be  terminated).
All  Facility  Fees shall be computed on the basis of the actual  number of days
elapsed in a year of 365 or 366 days,  as the case may be. The  Facility Fee due
to each Lender shall commence to accrue on the Effective Date and shall cease to
accrue on the earlier of the Maturity Date and the termination of the Commitment
of such Lender as provided herein.

                  (b) The Company agrees to pay the  Administrative  Agent,  for
its own account,  the  administrative and other fees separately agreed to by the
Company and the Administrative Agent (the "Administrative Fees").

                  (c) All Fees  shall be paid on the dates due,  in  immediately
available  funds,  to  the  Administrative  Agent  for  distribution,  if and as
appropriate, among the Lenders except that the Administrative Fees shall be paid
pursuant to paragraph (b) above. Once paid, none of the Fees shall be refundable
under any circumstances.

                  SECTION 2.07.  Repayment of Loans;  Evidence of Debt. (a) Each
Borrower  hereby agrees that the outstanding  principal  balance of each Standby
Loan shall be payable on the Maturity  Date and that the  outstanding  principal
balance  of each  Competitive  Loan  shall  be  payable  on the  last day of the
Interest  Period  applicable  thereto.  Each Loan  shall  bear  interest  on the
outstanding principal balance thereof as set forth in Section 2.08.


                  (b) Each Lender shall  maintain in  accordance  with its usual
practice  an account or  accounts  evidencing  the  indebtedness  to such Lender
resulting  from each Loan made by such Lender from time to time,  including  the
amounts of principal  and interest  payable and paid to such Lender from time to
time under this Agreement.

                  (c) The  Administrative  Agent shall (i) maintain  accounts in
which it will record (A) the amount of each Loan made hereunder, the Borrower of
each  Loan,  the Type of each  Loan  made  and the  Interest  Period  applicable
thereto,  (B) the amount of any  principal  or  interest  due and  payable or to
become due and payable from each  Borrower to each Lender  hereunder and (C) the
amount of any sum  received  by the  Administrative  Agent  hereunder  from each
Borrower  and each  Lender's  share  thereof  and (ii)  provide a summary to the
Company in writing on a quarterly basis.

                  (d) The entries  made in the accounts  maintained  pursuant to
paragraphs  (b) and (c) of this Section 2.07 shall,  to the extent  permitted by
applicable  law, be prima facie  evidence  of the  existence  and amounts of the
obligations therein recorded;  provided, however, that the failure of any Lender
or the Administrative Agent to maintain such accounts or any error therein shall
not in any manner affect the  obligations of the Borrowers to repay the Loans in
accordance with their terms.

                  SECTION 2.08. Interest on Loans. (a) Subject to the provisions
of Section 2.09,  the Loans  comprising  each  Eurodollar  Borrowing  shall bear
interest (computed on the basis of the actual number of days elapsed over a year
of 360  days) at a rate per  annum  equal to (i) in the case of each  Eurodollar
Standby Loan, the LIBO Rate for the Interest Period in effect for such Borrowing
plus the Applicable  Percentage from time to time in effect and (ii) in the case
of each  Eurodollar  Competitive  Loan, the LIBO Rate for the Interest Period in
effect for such Borrowing plus the Margin offered by the Lender making such Loan
and accepted by the Borrower pursuant to Section 2.03.

                  (b)  Subject  to the  provisions  of Section  2.09,  the Loans
comprising each ABR Borrowing shall bear interest  (computed on the basis of the
actual  number of days elapsed  over a year of 365 or 366 days,  as the case may
be, for periods  during which the Alternate Base Rate is determined by reference
to the Prime Rate and 360 days for other  periods)  at a rate per annum equal to
the Alternate Base Rate.

                  (c) Subject to the provisions of Section 2.09, each Fixed Rate
Loan  shall  bear  interest  at a rate per annum  (computed  on the basis of the
actual  number of days  elapsed over a year of 360 days) equal to the fixed rate
of interest  offered by the Lender making such Loan and accepted by the Borrower
pursuant to Section 2.03.

                  (d)  Interest  on each Loan shall be payable on each  Interest
Payment  Date  applicable  to such Loan  except as  otherwise  provided  in this
Agreement.  The  applicable  LIBO Rate or Alternate  Base Rate for each Interest
Period or day within an Interest Period, as the case may be, shall be determined
by the Administrative  Agent, and such determination  shall be conclusive absent
manifest error.

                  SECTION 2.09. Default Interest. If a Borrower shall default in
the payment of the  principal  of or  interest  on any Loan or any other  amount
becoming due  hereunder,  whether by scheduled  maturity,  notice of prepayment,
acceleration or otherwise,  such Borrower shall on demand from time to time from
the Administrative  Agent pay interest,  to the extent permitted by law, on such
defaulted  amount up to (but not including) the date of actual payment (after as
well as before  judgment)  at a rate per annum  (computed as provided in Section
2.08(b)) equal to the Alternate Base Rate plus 2%.


                  SECTION 2.10. Alternate Rate of Interest. In the event, and on
each occasion,  that on the day two Business Days prior to the  commencement  of
any Interest Period for a Eurodollar  Borrowing,  the Administrative Agent shall
have determined (i) that dollar  deposits in the currency and principal  amounts
of the Eurodollar Loans comprising such Borrowing are not generally available in
the London market or (ii) that  reasonable  means do not exist for  ascertaining
the  LIBO  Rate,  the  Administrative   Agent  shall,  as  soon  as  practicable
thereafter,  give  telecopy  notice of such  determination  to the  Company  and
applicable  Borrower  and the  Lenders.  In the event of any such  determination
under  clauses  (i) or (ii)  above,  until the  Administrative  Agent shall have
advised the Borrower and the Lenders that the circumstances  giving rise to such
notice  no  longer  exist,  (x)  any  request  by a  Borrower  for a  Eurodollar
Competitive  Loan  pursuant to Section  2.03 shall be of no force and effect and
shall be denied by the  Administrative  Agent and (y) any  request by a Borrower
for a Eurodollar  Standby Loan  pursuant to Section 2.04 shall be deemed to be a
request  for an ABR  Borrowing.  In the event the  Required  Lenders  notify the
Administrative  Agent that the rates at which dollar  deposits are being offered
will not  adequately  and fairly  reflect the cost to such  Lenders of making or
maintaining  Eurodollar  Loans during such Interest Period,  the  Administrative
Agent shall notify the applicable Borrower of such notice and until the Required
Lenders  shall have  advised  the  Administrative  Agent that the  circumstances
giving rise to such notice no longer  exist,  any request by such Borrower for a
Eurodollar  Standby  Loan shall be deemed a request for an ABR  Borrowing.  Each
determination by the Administrative  Agent hereunder shall be made in good faith
and shall be conclusive absent manifest error.

                  SECTION 2.11.  Termination and Reduction of  Commitments.  (a)
The  Commitments  shall  be  automatically  terminated  on  the  Maturity  Date;
provided,  however,  that if the  Effective  Date  does not  occur on or  before
December 31, 1996, the Commitments shall terminate on such date.

                  (b) Upon at  least  three  Business  Days'  prior  irrevocable
telecopy  notice to the  Administrative  Agent,  the  Company may at any time in
whole permanently  terminate,  or from time to time in part permanently  reduce,
the Total Commitment;  provided, however, that (i) each partial reduction of the
Total  Commitment  shall be in an  integral  multiple  of  $10,000,000  and in a
minimum  principal  amount  of  $50,000,000  and  (ii)  no such  termination  or
reduction  shall be made which would  reduce the Total  Commitment  to an amount
less  than the sum of the  aggregate  Standby  Credit  Exposures  and  aggregate
outstanding principal amount of the Competitive Loans.

                  (c) Each reduction in the Total Commitment  hereunder shall be
made ratably among the Lenders in accordance with their respective  Commitments.
The  Borrowers  shall pay to the  Administrative  Agent for the  account  of the
Lenders,  on the date of each reduction or termination of the Total  Commitment,
the Facility Fees on the amount of the  Commitments  terminated  accrued through
the date of such termination or reduction.

                  SECTION 2.12.  Prepayment.  (a) Each  Borrower  shall have the
right at any time and from  time to time to prepay  any  Standby  Borrowing,  in
whole or in part,  upon giving  telecopy  notice (or telephone  notice  promptly
confirmed by telecopy) to the  Administrative  Agent: (i) before 10:00 a.m., New
York  City  time,  three  Business  Days  prior  to  prepayment,  in the case of
Eurodollar  Loans,  and (ii) before 10:00 a.m., New York City time, one Business
Day prior to prepayment, in the case of ABR Loans; provided,  however, that each
partial  prepayment  shall be in an  amount  which is an  integral  multiple  of
$10,000,000 and not less than $50,000,000.  No prepayment may be made in respect
of any Competitive Borrowing.

                  (b) On  the  date  of  any  termination  or  reduction  of the
Commitments  pursuant to Section 2.11, the Borrowers shall pay or prepay so much
of the Standby  Borrowings as shall be necessary


in order that the aggregate sum of the  Competitive  Loan  Exposures and Standby
Credit  Exposures will not exceed the Total  Commitment,  after giving effect to
such termination or reduction.

                  (c) Each notice of  prepayment  shall  specify the  prepayment
date and the  principal  amount of each  Borrowing  (or  portion  thereof) to be
prepaid, shall be irrevocable and shall commit the applicable Borrower to prepay
such  Borrowing (or portion  thereof) by the amount  stated  therein on the date
stated  therein.  All  prepayments  under this  Section 2.12 shall be subject to
Section 2.15 but otherwise  without premium or penalty.  All  prepayments  under
this  Section 2.12 shall be  accompanied  by accrued  interest on the  principal
amount being prepaid to the date of payment.

                  SECTION 2.13. Reserve  Requirements;  Change in Circumstances.
(a)  Notwithstanding  any  other  provision  herein,  if after  the date of this
Agreement any change in applicable law or regulation or in the interpretation or
administration   thereof  by  any  Governmental   Authority   charged  with  the
interpretation  or  administration  thereof  (whether or not having the force of
law)  shall  result in the  imposition,  modification  or  applicability  of any
reserve, special deposit or similar requirement against assets of, deposits with
or for the account of or credit  extended by any Lender,  or shall result in the
imposition  on (i) any  Lender  or the  London  interbank  market  of any  other
condition  affecting this Agreement,  (ii) such Lender's Commitment or (iii) any
Eurodollar  Loan or Fixed Rate Loan made by such Lender and the result of any of
the  foregoing  shall  be to  increase  the cost to such  Lender  of  making  or
maintaining  any  Eurodollar  Loan or Fixed Rate Loan or to reduce the amount of
any sum received or receivable by such Lender  hereunder  (whether of principal,
interest  or  otherwise)  by an amount  reasonably  deemed by such  Lender to be
material,  then such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender
for such  additional  costs or reduction  will be paid by the  Borrowers to such
Lender upon demand.  Notwithstanding the foregoing,  no Lender shall be entitled
to request  compensation  under this paragraph  with respect to any  Competitive
Loan if the change giving rise to such request was  applicable to such Lender at
the time of submission of the Competitive Bid pursuant to which such Competitive
Loan was made.

                  (b) If any Lender shall have  determined  that the adoption of
any law,  rule,  regulation or guideline  arising out of the July 1988 report of
the Basle Committee on Banking  Regulations and Supervisory  Practices  entitled
"International Convergence of Capital Measurement and Capital Standards", or the
adoption after the date hereof of any other law,  rule,  regulation or guideline
regarding  capital  adequacy,  or any change in any of the  foregoing  or in the
interpretation  or  administration  of any of the foregoing by any  Governmental
Authority,  central bank or comparable agency charged with the interpretation or
administration  thereof,  or compliance by any Lender (or any lending  office of
such  Lender) or any  Lender's  holding  company  with any request or  directive
regarding  capital adequacy (whether or not having the force of law) of any such
authority,  central bank or comparable  agency,  has or would have the effect of
reducing  the rate of return on (i) such  Lender's  capital or on the capital of
such Lender's holding company, if any, as a consequence of this Agreement,  (ii)
such Lender's  Commitment or (iii) the Loans made by such Lender pursuant hereto
to a level below that which such Lender or such Lender's  holding  company could
have  achieved  but  for  such  adoption,  change  or  compliance  (taking  into
consideration  such Lender's  policies and the policies of such Lender's holding
company with respect to capital adequacy) by an amount reasonably deemed by such
Lender to be material,  then from time to time such additional amount or amounts
as will  compensate such Lender for such reduction will be paid by the Borrowers
to such Lender.  It is acknowledged that this Agreement is being entered into by
the  Lenders on the  understanding  that the  Lenders  will not be  required  to
maintain  capital against their  Commitments  under currently  applicable  laws,
regulations  and  regulatory  guidelines.  In the event that any Lender shall be
advised by any Governmental  Authority or shall otherwise determine on the basis
of  pronouncements  of any  Governmental  Authority that such  understanding  is
incorrect,  it is agreed that the Lenders  will be entitled to make claims under
this paragraph (b) based


upon market  requirements  prevailing on the date hereof for  commitments  under
comparable credit facilities against which capital is required to be maintained.

                  (c) A certificate  of any Lender  setting forth such amount or
amounts as shall be necessary to compensate such Lender or its holding  company,
as applicable,  as specified in paragraph (a) or (b) above,  as the case may be,
shall be delivered to the Company and shall be conclusive absent manifest error.
The  Borrowers  shall  pay  such  Lender  the  amount  shown  as due on any such
certificate delivered by it within 10 days after its receipt of the same.

                  (d)  Failure on the part of any Lender to demand  compensation
for any  increased  costs or  reduction  in amounts  received or  receivable  or
reduction in return on capital with respect to any period shall not constitute a
waiver of such Lender's right to demand compensation with respect to such period
or any other  period;  provided,  however,  that no Lender  shall be entitled to
compensation  under  this  Section  2.13 for any costs  incurred  or  reductions
suffered with respect to any date unless it shall have notified the Company that
it will demand  compensation  for such costs or reductions  under  paragraph (c)
above not more  than 90 days  after the later of (i) such date and (ii) the date
on which it shall have become aware of such costs or reductions.  The protection
of this Section  shall be available  to each Lender  regardless  of any possible
contention of the invalidity or  inapplicability  of the law, rule,  regulation,
guideline  or other  change or  condition  which  shall  have  occurred  or been
imposed.

                  SECTION  2.14.  Change in Legality.  (a)  Notwithstanding  any
other  provision  herein,  if any  change  in any  law or  regulation  or in the
interpretation   thereof  by  any  Governmental   Authority   charged  with  the
administration or  interpretation  thereof shall make it unlawful for any Lender
to make or maintain any Eurodollar  Loan or to give effect to its obligations as
contemplated hereby with respect to any Eurodollar Loan, then, by written notice
to the Company and to the Administrative Agent, such Lender may:

                  (i) declare that Eurodollar  Loans will not thereafter be made
         by such Lender  hereunder,  whereupon  such  Lender  shall not submit a
         Competitive  Bid in response to a request for a Eurodollar  Competitive
         Loan and any request for a Eurodollar  Standby  Loan shall,  as to such
         Lender  only,  be  deemed  a  request  for an  ABR  Loan,  unless  such
         declaration shall be subsequently withdrawn; and

                  (ii) require that all outstanding Eurodollar Loans, made by it
         be converted  to ABR Loans,  in which event all such  Eurodollar  Loans
         shall be automatically  converted to ABR Loans as of the effective date
         of such notice as provided in paragraph (b) below.

In the event any Lender shall exercise its rights under subparagraph (i) or (ii)
above, all payments and prepayments of principal which would otherwise have been
applied to repay the Eurodollar  Loans that would have been made by such Lender,
or the converted  Eurodollar  Loans of such Lender,  shall instead be applied to
repay  the ABR Loans  made by such  Lender  in lieu of,  or  resulting  from the
conversion of, such Eurodollar Loans.

                  (b) For purposes of this Section  2.14, a notice by any Lender
shall be effective as to each Eurodollar Loan, if lawful, on the last day of the
Interest Period currently applicable to such Eurodollar Loan; in all other cases
such notice shall be effective on the date of receipt.

                  SECTION 2.15.  Indemnity.  The Borrowers  shall indemnify each
Lender against any  out-of-pocket  loss or expense which such Lender may sustain
or incur as a consequence of (a) any failure to borrow or to refinance,  convert
or continue  any Loan  hereunder  after  irrevocable  notice of such


borrowing,  refinancing,  conversion or continuation  has been given pursuant to
Section  2.03,  2.04 or 2.05,  (b) any payment,  prepayment  or  conversion,  or
assignment  required  under Section  2.20, of a Eurodollar  Loan required by any
other  provision of this  Agreement  or otherwise  made or deemed made on a date
other than the last day of the Interest Period, if any, applicable thereto,  (c)
any default in payment or prepayment of the principal  amount of any Loan or any
part thereof or interest  accrued  thereon,  as and when due and payable (at the
due date  thereof,  whether by  scheduled  maturity,  acceleration,  irrevocable
notice  of  prepayment  or  otherwise)  or (d) the  occurrence  of any  Event of
Default,  including, in each such case, any loss or reasonable expense sustained
or incurred or to be sustained or incurred in liquidating or employing  deposits
from third parties  acquired to effect or maintain such Loan or any part thereof
as a Eurodollar  Loan.  Such loss or reasonable  expense shall include an amount
equal to the excess, if any, as reasonably determined by such Lender, of (i) its
cost of obtaining the funds for the Loan being paid, prepaid,  refinanced or not
borrowed  (assumed to be the LIBO Rate  applicable  thereto) for the period from
the date of such  payment,  prepayment,  refinancing  or  failure  to  borrow or
refinance to the last day of the Interest  Period for such Loan (or, in the case
of a failure  to borrow or  refinance  the  Interest  Period for such Loan which
would  have  commenced  on the date of such  failure)  over  (ii) the  amount of
interest  (as  reasonably  determined  by such Lender) that would be realized by
such  Lender  in  reemploying  the funds so paid,  prepaid  or not  borrowed  or
refinanced for such period or Interest Period, as the case may be. A certificate
of any Lender  setting forth any amount or amounts which such Lender is entitled
to receive  pursuant to this Section  shall be  delivered  to such  Borrower and
shall be conclusive absent manifest error.

                  SECTION 2.16.  Pro Rata  Treatment.  Except as required  under
Sections  2.14 and 2.20,  each payment or prepayment of principal of any Standby
Borrowing,  each payment of interest on the Standby  Loans,  each payment of the
Facility  Fees,  each  reduction  of the  Commitments  and each  refinancing  or
conversion of any Standby  Borrowing with a Standby Borrowing of any Type, shall
be  allocated  pro rata among the Lenders in  accordance  with their  respective
Commitments (or, if such Commitments  shall have expired or been terminated,  in
accordance with the respective  principal amounts of their  outstanding  Standby
Loans).  Each  payment  of  principal  of any  Competitive  Borrowing  shall  be
allocated  pro  rata  among  the  Lenders  participating  in such  Borrowing  in
accordance  with  the  respective   principal   amounts  of  their   outstanding
Competitive  Loans  comprising such  Borrowing.  Each payment of interest on any
Competitive   Borrowing   shall  be   allocated   pro  rata  among  the  Lenders
participating  in such Borrowing in accordance  with the  respective  amounts of
accrued and unpaid interest on their  outstanding  Competitive  Loans comprising
such  Borrowing.  For purposes of determining  the available  Commitments of the
Lenders at any time, each outstanding  Competitive  Borrowing shall be deemed to
have  utilized the  Commitments  of the Lenders  (including  those Lenders which
shall not have made  Loans as part of such  Competitive  Borrowing)  pro rata in
accordance  with  such  respective  Commitments.  Each  Lender  agrees  that  in
computing  such  Lender's  portion of any  Borrowing to be made  hereunder,  the
Administrative  Agent may, in its discretion,  round each Lender's percentage of
such Borrowing to the next higher or lower whole Dollar amount.

                  SECTION 2.17.  Sharing of Setoffs.  Each Lender agrees that if
it  shall,  through  the  exercise  of a  right  of  banker's  lien,  setoff  or
counterclaim,  or pursuant to a secured  claim under  Section 506 of Title 11 of
the United  States Code or other  security or interest  arising from, or in lieu
of, such secured claim, received by such Lender under any applicable bankruptcy,
insolvency  or other  similar law or  otherwise,  or by any other means,  obtain
payment  (voluntary or involuntary) in respect of any Standby Loan or Loans as a
result of which the unpaid  principal  portion  of its  Standby  Loans  shall be
proportionately  less than the unpaid principal  portion of the Standby Loans of
any other Lender, it shall be deemed  simultaneously to have purchased from such
other  Lender at face value,  and shall  promptly  pay to such other  Lender the
purchase price for, a  participation  in the Standby Loans of such other Lender,
so  that  the  aggregate  unpaid  principal  amount  of the  Standby  Loans  and
participations  in the 


Standby  Loans  held by each  Lender  shall  be in the  same  proportion  to the
aggregate  unpaid  principal amount of all Standby Loans then outstanding as the
principal  amount of its Standby Loans prior to such exercise of banker's  lien,
setoff or counterclaim or other event was to the principal amount of all Standby
Loans   outstanding   prior  to  such  exercise  of  banker's  lien,  setoff  or
counterclaim or other event;  provided,  however,  that, if any such purchase or
purchases  or  adjustments  shall be made  pursuant to this Section 2.17 and the
payment  giving rise thereto shall  thereafter  be  recovered,  such purchase or
purchases or  adjustments  shall be rescinded to the extent of such recovery and
the purchase price or prices or adjustment restored without interest. Any Lender
holding a  participation  in a Standby Loan deemed to have been so purchased may
exercise  any and all  rights of  banker's  lien,  setoff or  counterclaim  with
respect to any and all moneys owing to such Lender by reason thereof as fully as
if such Lender had made a Standby Loan in the amount of such participation.

                  SECTION  2.18.  Payments.  (a) The  Borrowers  shall make each
payment  (including  principal of or interest on any  Borrowing  and any Fees or
other  amounts)  hereunder  from an account in the United  States not later than
12:00 noon,  local time at the place of payment,  on the date when due,  without
setoff or counterclaim,  to the Administrative  Agent at its offices at 270 Park
Avenue,  New York, New York, in immediately  available funds.  Each such payment
shall be made in Dollars.

                  (b) Whenever any payment  (including  principal of or interest
on any Borrowing or any Fees or other  amounts)  hereunder  shall become due, or
otherwise  would occur, on a day that is not a Business Day, such payment may be
made on the next  succeeding  Business Day, and such  extension of time shall in
such case be included in the computation of interest or Fees, if applicable.

                  SECTION 2.19.  Taxes.  (a) Any and all payments to the Lenders
hereunder  shall be made, in accordance with Section 2.18, free and clear of and
without  deduction  for any and all current or future  taxes,  levies,  imposts,
deductions,  charges or withholdings,  and all liabilities with respect thereto,
excluding (i) income taxes imposed on the income of the Administrative  Agent or
any Lender (or any  transferee or assignee  thereof,  including a  participation
holder (any such entity a "Transferee")) and (ii) franchise taxes imposed on the
income,  assets  or net  worth of the  Administrative  Agent or any  Lender  (or
Transferee),  in each  case by the  jurisdiction  under  the laws of  which  the
Administrative  Agent or such  Lender  (or  Transferee)  is  organized  or doing
business (other than as a result of entering into this Agreement, performing any
obligations hereunder,  receiving any payments hereunder or enforcing any rights
hereunder),  or any political  subdivision  thereof (all such nonexcluded taxes,
levies, imposts, deductions, charges, withholdings and liabilities, collectively
or individually, "Taxes"). If any Borrower shall be required to deduct any Taxes
from  or in  respect  of any  sum  payable  hereunder  to  any  Lender  (or  any
Transferee) or the Administrative  Agent, (i) the sum payable shall be increased
by the amount  (an  "additional  amount")  necessary  so that  after  making all
required deductions  (including deductions applicable to additional sums payable
under this Section 2.19) such Lender (or Transferee) or the Administrative Agent
(as the case may be)  shall  receive  an amount  equal to the sum it would  have
received had no such  deductions  been made,  (ii) such Borrower shall make such
deductions  and (iii) such  Borrower  shall pay the full amount  deducted to the
relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law.

                  (b) In  addition,  the  Borrowers  shall  pay to the  relevant
Governmental  Authority in accordance  with applicable law any current or future
stamp or  documentary  taxes or any other excise or property  taxes,  charges or
similar levies that arise from any payment made hereunder or from the execution,
delivery or registration of, or otherwise with respect to, this Agreement or any
other Loan Document ("Other Taxes").


                  (c) The Borrowers  shall indemnify each Lender (or Transferee)
and the  Administrative  Agent for the full amount of Taxes and Other Taxes paid
by such Lender (or Transferee) or the Administrative  Agent, as the case may be,
and  any  liability  (including  penalties,  interest  and  expenses  (including
reasonable  attorney's  fees and  expenses))  arising  therefrom or with respect
thereto,  whether or not such Taxes or Other  Taxes  were  correctly  or legally
asserted by the relevant Governmental  Authority. A certificate as to the amount
of such  payment  or  liability  prepared  by a Lender  (or  Transferee)  or the
Administrative  Agent on its  behalf,  absent  manifest  error,  shall be final,
conclusive  and binding for all  purposes.  Such  indemnification  shall be made
within 30 days after the date any Lender (or  Transferee) or the  Administrative
Agent, as the case may be, makes written demand  therefor,  which written demand
shall be made  within 60 days of the date such  Lender  (or  Transferee)  or the
Administrative  Agent receives written demand for payment of such Taxes or Other
Taxes from the relevant Governmental Authority.

                  (d) If a Lender (or  Transferee) or the  Administrative  Agent
shall  become  aware that it is entitled  to claim a refund from a  Governmental
Authority in respect of Taxes or Other Taxes as to which it has been indemnified
by the Borrowers,  or with respect to which the Borrowers  have paid  additional
amounts,  pursuant to this Section 2.19, it shall promptly  notify the Borrowers
of the availability of such refund claim and shall, within 30 days after receipt
of a request by the Borrowers,  make a claim to such Governmental  Authority for
such  refund at the  Borrowers'  expense.  If a Lender  (or  Transferee)  or the
Administrative Agent receives a refund (including pursuant to a claim for refund
made pursuant to the preceding  sentence) in respect of any Taxes or Other Taxes
as to which it has been  indemnified  by the  Borrowers or with respect to which
the Borrowers  have paid  additional  amounts  pursuant to this Section 2.19, it
shall  within 30 days from the date of such  receipt pay over such refund to the
Borrowers  (but only to the extent of indemnity  payments  made,  or  additional
amounts paid, by the Borrowers under this Section 2.19 with respect to the Taxes
or Other Taxes giving rise to such refund), net of all out-of-pocket expenses of
such Lender (or  Transferee) or the  Administrative  Agent and without  interest
(other than interest paid by the relevant Governmental Authority with respect to
such refund);  provided,  however, that the Borrowers,  upon the request of such
Lender (or Transferee) or the  Administrative  Agent,  agree to repay the amount
paid over to the Borrowers (plus  penalties,  interest or other charges) to such
Lender (or Transferee) or the Administrative  Agent in the event such Lender (or
Transferee) or the Administrative Agent is required to repay such refund to such
Governmental Authority.

                  (e) As soon as  practicable  after the date of any  payment of
Taxes or Other Taxes by the  Borrowers to the relevant  Governmental  Authority,
the Borrowers will deliver to the Administrative  Agent, at its address referred
to in Section 9.01, the original or a certified copy of a receipt issued by such
Governmental Authority evidencing payment thereof.

                  (f) Without  prejudice to the survival of any other  agreement
contained herein, the agreements and obligations  contained in this Section 2.19
shall  survive the payment in full of the principal of and interest on all Loans
made hereunder.

                  (g) Each Lender (or  Transferee)  that is organized  under the
laws of a jurisdiction  other than the United  States,  any State thereof or the
District of Columbia (a "Non-U.S.  Lender") shall deliver to the Company and the
Administrative Agent two copies of either United States Internal Revenue Service
Form 1001 or Form 4224, or, in the case of a Non-U.S.  Lender claiming exemption
from U.S.  Federal  withholding  tax under Section  871(h) or 881(c) of the Code
with respect to payments of "portfolio interest",  a Form W-8, or any subsequent
versions thereof or successors thereto (and, if such Non-U.S.  Lender delivers a
Form W-8, a certificate representing that such Non-U.S. Lender is not a bank for
purposes of Section 881(c) of the Code, is not a 10 percent  shareholder (within
the  meaning of


Section 871(h)(3)(B) of the Code) of the Company and is not a controlled foreign
corporation  related to the Company (within the meaning of Section  864(d)(4) of
the  Code)),  properly  completed  and duly  executed  by such  Non-U.S.  Lender
claiming complete  exemption from, or reduced rate of, U.S. Federal  withholding
tax on  payments  by the  Company  under this  Agreement.  Such  forms  shall be
delivered  by each  Non-U.S.  Lender on or before the date it becomes a party to
this Agreement (or, in the case of a Transferee that is a participation  holder,
on or before the date such participation holder becomes a Transferee  hereunder)
and on or before the date, if any, such Non-U.S.  Lender  changes its applicable
lending  office by  designating  a  different  lending  office  (a "New  Lending
Office").  In addition,  each Non-U.S.  Lender shall deliver such forms promptly
upon the  obsolescence  or invalidity of any form  previously  delivered by such
Non-U.S. Lender.  Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section 2.19(g), a
Non-U.S.  Lender  shall not be  required  to deliver  any form  pursuant to this
Section 2.19(g) that such Non-U.S. Lender is not legally able to deliver.

                  (h)  The  Company  shall  not be  required  to  indemnify  any
Non-U.S.  Lender,  or to pay any additional  amounts to any Non-U.S.  Lender, in
respect of United States  Federal  withholding  tax pursuant to paragraph (a) or
(c) above to the extent that (i) the obligation to withhold amounts with respect
to United  States  Federal  withholding  tax  existed on the date such  Non-U.S.
Lender became a party to this Agreement (or, in the case of a Transferee that is
a  participation  holder,  on  the  date  such  participation  holder  became  a
Transferee  hereunder) or, with respect to payments to a New Lending Office, the
date such Non-U.S.  Lender  designated such New Lending Office with respect to a
Loan; provided,  however, that this clause (i) shall not apply to any Transferee
or New  Lending  Office that  becomes a  Transferee  or New Lending  Office as a
result of an  assignment,  participation,  transfer or  designation  made at the
request of the Company;  and  provided  further,  however,  that this clause (i)
shall not apply to the extent the indemnity  payment or  additional  amounts any
Transferee,  or Lender (or Transferee)  through a New Lending  Office,  would be
entitled  to  receive  (without  regard to this  clause  (i)) do not  exceed the
indemnity  payment or additional  amounts that the person making the assignment,
participation or transfer to such Transferee,  or Lender (or Transferee)  making
the designation of such New Lending Office,  would have been entitled to receive
in the absence of such  assignment,  participation,  transfer or  designation or
(ii) the obligation to pay such additional amounts would not have arisen but for
a failure by such Non-U.S. Lender to comply with the provisions of paragraph (g)
above.

                  (i) Any Lender (or Transferee)  claiming any indemnity payment
or additional amounts payable pursuant to this Section 2.19 shall use reasonable
efforts  (consistent  with  legal  and  regulatory  restrictions)  to  file  any
certificate  or document  reasonably  requested  in writing by the Company or to
change the jurisdiction of its applicable lending office if the making of such a
filing or change  would  avoid  the need for or  reduce  the  amount of any such
indemnity  payment or additional  amounts that may  thereafter  accrue and would
not,  in  the  determination  of  such  Lender  (or  Transferee),  be  otherwise
disadvantageous to such Lender (or Transferee).

                  (j) Nothing  contained in this Section 2.19 shall  require any
Lender (or Transferee) or the Administrative  Agent to make available any of its
tax  returns  (or any  other  information  that it deems to be  confidential  or
proprietary).

                  SECTION  2.20.  Duty to Mitigate;  Assignment  of  Commitments
Under  Certain  Circumstances.  (a) Any  Lender  (or  Transferee)  claiming  any
additional  amounts  payable  pursuant  to  Section  2.13  or  Section  2.19  or
exercising  its  rights  under  Section  2.14  shall  use   reasonable   efforts
(consistent  with legal and regulatory  restrictions) to file any certificate or
document  requested  by  the  Company  or to  change  the  jurisdiction  of  its
applicable  lending  office if the making of such a filing or change would avoid
the need for or reduce  the  amount  of any such  additional  amounts  which may


thereafter  accrue or avoid the  circumstances  giving rise to such exercise and
would not, in the  determination  of such Lender (or  Transferee),  be otherwise
disadvantageous to such Lender (or Transferee).

                  (b) In the event that any Lender shall have delivered a notice
or  certificate  pursuant  to  Section  2.13 or 2.14,  or the  Company  shall be
required to make  additional  payments to any Lender  under  Section  2.19,  the
Company shall have the right, at its own expense, upon notice to such Lender and
the Administrative  Agent, to require such Lender to transfer and assign without
recourse  (in  accordance  with and  subject to the  restrictions  contained  in
Section  9.04) all  interests,  rights and  obligations  contained  hereunder to
another  financial  institution  approved  by the  Administrative  Agent  (which
approval  shall  not  be   unreasonably   withheld)   which  shall  assume  such
obligations;  provided that (i) no such assignment  shall conflict with any law,
rule or regulation or order of any Governmental  Authority and (ii) the assignee
or the  Company,  as the  case  may be,  shall  pay to the  affected  Lender  in
immediately  available funds on the date of such assignment the principal of and
interest  accrued to the date of payment on the Loans made by it  hereunder  and
all other amounts accrued for its account or owed to it hereunder.


                                   ARTICLE III

                         REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

                  Each Borrower  represents  and warrants to each of the Lenders
that:

                  SECTION 3.01. Organization;  Powers. Each Borrower and each of
the  Restricted  Subsidiaries  (a)  is a  corporation  duly  organized,  validly
existing  and in  good  standing  under  the  laws  of the  jurisdiction  of its
organization,  (b) has all requisite power and authority to own its property and
assets and to carry on its  business  as now  conducted  and as  proposed  to be
conducted,  (c) is  qualified  to do business in every  jurisdiction  where such
qualification  is  required,  except  where the failure so to qualify  would not
result in a Material Adverse Effect,  and (d) in the case of each Borrower,  has
the  corporate  power  and  authority  to  execute,   deliver  and  perform  its
obligations under the Loan Documents and to borrow hereunder and thereunder.

                  SECTION  3.02.  Authorization.  The  execution,  delivery  and
performance by the Borrowers of this  Agreement,  the promissory  notes, if any,
issued  pursuant to Section  9.04(i) (and by the Borrowing  Subsidiaries of each
Borrowing Subsidiary Agreement) and the Borrowings hereunder (collectively,  the
"Transactions")  (a) have been duly authorized by all requisite corporate action
and (b) will not (i)  violate (A) any  provision  of any law,  statute,  rule or
regulation   (including  the  Margin  Regulations)  or  of  the  certificate  of
incorporation or other constitutive  documents or by-laws of the Borrowers,  (B)
any order of any  Governmental  Authority or (C) any provision of any indenture,
agreement or other instrument to which any Borrower is a party or by which it or
any of its property is or may be bound,  (ii) be in conflict  with,  result in a
breach  of or  constitute  (alone  or with  notice  or  lapse of time or both) a
default under any such indenture,  agreement or other instrument or (iii) result
in the  creation or  imposition  of any lien upon any  property or assets of any
Borrower.

                  SECTION  3.03.  Enforceability.  This  Agreement and each Loan
Document to which a Borrower is a party  constitutes a legal,  valid and binding
obligation of each such Borrower enforceable in accordance with its terms.

                  SECTION 3.04.  Governmental  Approvals.  No action, consent or
approval of,  registration  or filing with or other  action by any  Governmental
Authority,  other than those which have 


been  taken,  given or made,  as the case may be,  is or will be  required  with
respect to any Borrower in connection with the Transactions.

                  SECTION  3.05.  Financial  Statements.  (a)  The  Company  has
heretofore  furnished to the Administrative  Agent and the Lenders copies of its
consolidated balance sheet and statements of income, cash flow and stockholders'
equity as of and for the year ended  December 31, 1995 and the nine months ended
September 30, 1996. Such financial  statements  present fairly,  in all material
respects,  the consolidated financial condition and the results of operations of
the  Company  and the  Subsidiaries  as of such  dates and for such  periods  in
accordance with GAAP or SAP, as requested.

                  (b) As of the date hereof,  there has been no material adverse
change  in  the  consolidated   financial  condition  of  the  Company  and  the
Subsidiaries  taken as a whole  from the  financial  condition  reported  in the
financial statements referenced in paragraph (a) of this Section 3.05.

                  SECTION 3.06. Litigation;  Compliance with Laws. (a) There are
no actions,  proceedings  or  investigations  filed or (to the  knowledge of the
Borrowers)  threatened  against any Borrower or any  Subsidiary  in any court or
before  any  Governmental  Authority  or  arbitration  board or  tribunal  which
question the validity or legality of this  Agreement,  the  Transactions  or any
action taken or to be taken  pursuant to this Agreement and no order or judgment
has been  issued  or  entered  restraining  or  enjoining  any  Borrower  or any
Subsidiary from the execution,  delivery or performance of this Agreement nor is
there any other action,  proceeding or investigation  filed or (to the knowledge
of any  Borrower  or any  Subsidiary)  threatened  against  any  Borrower or any
Subsidiary  in any court or before any  Governmental  Authority  or  arbitration
board or  tribunal  which  would be  reasonably  likely to result in a  Material
Adverse Effect or materially restrict the ability of any Borrower to comply with
its obligations under the Loan Documents.

                  (b) Neither any Borrower nor any Subsidiary is in violation of
any law, rule or regulation  (including any law, rule or regulation  relating to
the  protection  of the  environment  or to employee  health or  safety),  or in
default  with  respect  to any  judgment,  writ,  injunction  or  decree  of any
Governmental  Authority,  where such  violation or default  would be  reasonably
likely to result in a Material Adverse Effect.

                  SECTION 3.07.  Federal Reserve Regulations.  (a)  Neither any
Borrower nor any Subsidiary that will receive proceeds of the Loans hereunder is
engaged principally,  or as one of its important activities,  in the business of
extending credit for the purpose of purchasing or carrying Margin Stock.

                  (b) No part of the proceeds of any Loan will be used,  whether
directly or indirectly, and whether immediately,  incidentally or ultimately, to
purchase or carry Margin Stock or to refund indebtedness originally incurred for
such purpose, or for any other purpose which entails a violation of, or which is
inconsistent with, the provisions of the Margin Regulations.

                  SECTION 3.08.  Investment  Company Act; Public Utility Holding
Company  Act.  No  Borrower  is (a) an  "investment  company"  as defined in, or
subject to regulation under, the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the "1940 Act")
or (b) a "holding  company" as defined in, or subject to regulation  under,  the
Public  Utility  Holding  Company Act of 1935.  While  certain  subsidiaries  of
Hartford Life  Insurance  Company are  "investment  companies" as defined in the
1940 Act, the  transactions  contemplated  by this Agreement will not violate or
require any  approval  under such Act or any  regulations  promulgated  pursuant
thereto.



                  SECTION 3.09.  Use of Proceeds.  All proceeds of the Loans 
shall be used for the purposes referred to in the recitals to this Agreement.

                  SECTION 3.10. Full Disclosure; No Material Misstatements. None
of the  representations  or warranties  made by any Borrower in connection  with
this  Agreement as of the date such  representations  and warranties are made or
deemed made, and no report,  financial statement or other information  furnished
by or on  behalf  of any  Borrower  to the  Administrative  Agent or any  Lender
pursuant  to or in  connection  with this  Agreement  or the  credit  facilities
established hereby,  contains or will contain any material  misstatement of fact
or  omits  or will  omit to  state  any  material  fact  necessary  to make  the
statements  therein,  in the light of the circumstances under which they were or
will be made, not misleading.

                  SECTION 3.11.  Taxes. Each Borrower and each of the Restricted
Subsidiaries  have filed or caused to be filed all Federal,  state and local tax
returns  which are  required to be filed by them,  and have paid or caused to be
paid all taxes shown to be due and payable on such returns or on any assessments
received by any of them,  other than any taxes or  assessments  the  validity of
which is being  contested  in good faith by  appropriate  proceedings,  and with
respect to which appropriate  accounting reserves have to the extent required by
GAAP or SAP, as applicable, been set aside.

                  SECTION 3.12.  Employee  Pension  Benefit  Plans.  The present
aggregate  value  of  accumulated   benefit  obligations  of  all  unfunded  and
underfunded  pension plans of the Company and its  Subsidiaries  (based on those
assumptions used for disclosure in corporate financial  statements in accordance
with GAAP or SAP, as  applicable)  did not, as of December 31,  1994,  exceed by
more than  $70,000,000 the value of the assets of all such plans. In these cases
the Company has recorded book reserves to meet the obligations.

insured against by extended coverage,  as is customary with companies  similarly
situated and in the same or similar  businesses  (it being  understood  that the
Borrowers  and  the  Restricted  Subsidiaries  may  self-insure  to  the  extent

liabilities,  in each case before the same shall become delinquent or in default
and before penalties accrue thereon,  unless and to the extent that the same are
being contested in good faith by appropriate  proceedings and adequate  reserves
with  respect  thereto  shall,  to the  extent  required  by  GAAP  or  SAP,  as
applicable, have been set aside.

                  SECTION 5.06.  Litigation and Other Notices.  Give the

                  In case of the happening of any of the following  events (each

                  (a) any  representation  or warranty made or deemed made in or
         in connection  with the execution and delivery of this Agreement or the

                  (b) default  shall be made in the payment of any  principal of
         any Loan when and as the same shall become due and payable,  whether at
         the due date  thereof or at a date fixed for  prepayment  thereof or by
         acceleration thereof or otherwise;

                  (c) default  shall be made in the  payment of any  interest on

         become due and payable,  and such default shall continue unremedied for
         a period of ten days;

                  (d) default shall be made in the due observance or performance

         5.10,  5.11,  5.12,  5.13,  5.14,  5.15 or 5.16 and, in the case of any

         30 days  after  notice  thereof  from the  Administrative  Agent or any
         Lender to the Company;

                  (f) the  Company or any  Subsidiary  shall (i) fail to pay any
         principal  or  interest,  regardless  of amount,  due in respect of any

         assets of the Company or any Restricted  Subsidiary,  under Title 11 of
         the United States Code, as now constituted or hereafter amended, or any

         foregoing;

                  (i) one or more final  judgments shall be entered by any court
         against the Company or any of the Subsidiaries for the payment of money
         in an aggregate  amount in excess of $50,000,000,  and such judgment or
         judgments  shall not have been paid,  discharged or stayed for a period
         of 60 days, or a warrant of attachment or execution or similar  process
         shall have been issued or levied against property of the Company or any
         of the Subsidiaries to enforce any such judgment or judgments;

                  (j) an ERISA Event shall have occurred that, in the opinion of
         the Required  Lenders,  when taken  together  with all other such ERISA
         Events,  could  reasonably be expected to result in a Material  Adverse
         Effect; or

                  (k) a Change in Control shall occur;

then,  and in every such event  (other than an event with respect to the Company
or any Restricted  Subsidiary  described in paragraph (g) or (h) above),  and at
any time  thereafter  during the continuance of such event,  the  Administrative
Agent, at the request of the Required Lenders,  shall, by notice to the Company,
take either or both of the following  actions,  at the same or different  times:
(i)  terminate  forthwith  the  Commitments  and (ii)  declare  the  Loans  then
outstanding  to be forthwith due and payable in whole or in part,  whereupon the
principal of the Loans so declared to be due and payable,  together with accrued
interest  thereon and any unpaid  accrued Fees and all other  liabilities of the
Borrowers accrued hereunder,  without presentment,  demand, protest or any other
notice of any kind, all of which are hereby expressly waived anything  contained
herein to the  contrary  notwithstanding;  and,  in the case of any  event  with
respect to the Company or any Restricted  Subsidiary  described in paragraph (g)
or (h) above, the Commitments shall automatically terminate and the principal of
the Loans then  outstanding,  together  with  accrued  interest  thereon and any
unpaid accrued Fees and all other liabilities of the Borrowers accrued hereunder
shall automatically become due and payable, without presentment, demand, protest
or any other  notice  of any kind,  all of which  are  hereby  expressly  waived
anything contained herein to the contrary notwithstanding.


                                   ARTICLE VII

                                    GUARANTEE

                  The Company unconditionally and irrevocably guarantees the due
and punctual payment and performance,  when and as due, whether at maturity,  by
acceleration,  upon one or more dates set for  prepayment or  otherwise,  of the
Guaranteed   Obligations.   The  Company  further  agrees  that  the  Guaranteed
Obligations may be extended or renewed,  in whole or in part,  without notice or
further  assent  


from it and that it will remain  bound upon its  guarantee  notwithstanding  any
extension or renewal of any Guaranteed Obligations.

                  The Company waives  presentment to, demand of payment from and
protest to the Borrowing Subsidiaries of any of the Guaranteed Obligations,  and
also waives  notice of  acceptance  of its  guarantee  and notice of protest for
nonpayment.  The  obligations of the Company  hereunder shall not be affected by
(a) the  failure of any  Lender to assert any claim or demand or to enforce  any
right or remedy against the Borrowing  Subsidiaries under the provisions of this
Agreement or otherwise; (b) any rescission, waiver, amendment or modification of
any of the terms or  provisions  of this  Agreement,  any guarantee or any other
agreement;  or (c) the  failure  of any Lender to  exercise  any right or remedy
against any other guarantor of the Guaranteed Obligations.

                  The Company  further  agrees that its guarantee  constitutes a
guarantee  of payment  when due and not of  collection,  and waives any right to
require that any resort be had by the Administrative  Agent or any Lender to any
security,  if any,  held for  payment of the  Guaranteed  Obligations  or to any
balance of any deposit account or credit on its books, in favor of the Borrowing
Subsidiaries or any other person.

                  The obligations of the Company  hereunder shall not be subject
to  any  reduction,  limitation,  impairment  or  termination  for  any  reason,
including any claim of waiver, release, surrender, alteration or compromise, and
shall not be subject  to any  defense or  setoff,  counterclaim,  recoupment  or
termination   whatsoever   by   reason   of  the   invalidity,   illegality   or
unenforceability  of the Guaranteed  Obligations or otherwise.  Without limiting
the generality of the foregoing,  the obligations of the Company hereunder shall
not be  discharged  or  impaired  or  otherwise  affected  by the failure of the
Administrative  Agent or any  Lender to assert any claim or demand or to enforce
any remedy under this Agreement,  any guarantee or any other  agreement,  by any
waiver or  modification  of any provision  thereof,  by any default,  failure or
delay, wilful or otherwise, in the performance of the Guaranteed Obligations, or
by any other act or  omission  which may or might in any manner or to any extent
vary the risk of the Company or otherwise  operate as a discharge of the Company
as a matter of law or equity.

                  To the extent  permitted by applicable law, the Company waives
any defense  based on or arising out of any defense  available to the  Borrowing
Subsidiaries, including any defense based on or arising out of any disability of
the  Borrowing   Subsidiaries,   or  the   unenforceability  of  the  Guaranteed
Obligations or any part thereof from any cause,  or the cessation from any cause
of the liability of the Borrowing Subsidiaries, other than final payment in full
of the Guaranteed Obligations.  The Administrative Agent and the Lenders may, at
their election,  foreclose on any security held by one or more of them by one or
more  judicial or  non-judicial  sales,  or  exercise  any other right or remedy
available to them against the Borrowing  Subsidiaries,  or any security  without
affecting or impairing in any way the liability of the Company  hereunder except
to the extent the Guaranteed  Obligations  have been fully and finally paid. The
Company  waives any defense  arising out of any such  election  even though such
election  operates  to impair or to  extinguish  any right of  reimbursement  or
subrogation  or other  right or  remedy of the  Company  against  the  Borrowing
Subsidiaries or any security.

                  The Company  further agrees that its guarantee  shall continue
to be effective or be reinstated, as the case may be, if at any time payment, or
any part thereof,  of principal of or interest on any  Guaranteed  Obligation is
rescinded  or must  otherwise be restored by any Lender upon the  bankruptcy  or
reorganization of any Borrowing Subsidiary or otherwise.

                  In  furtherance  of the foregoing and not in limitation of any
other right which the  Administrative  Agent or any Lender may have at law or in
equity against the Company by virtue  hereof,  


upon the failure of any Borrowing  Subsidiary to pay any  Guaranteed  Obligation
when and as the same shall  become due,  whether at maturity,  by  acceleration,
after notice of  prepayment  or otherwise,  the Company  hereby  promises to and
will, upon receipt of written demand by the Administrative  Agent or any Lender,
forthwith pay or cause to be paid to the Administrative  Agent or such Lender in
cash the amount of such unpaid Guaranteed Obligation.

                  Until the  termination of this  Agreement and the  commitments
hereunder,  and the  repayment in full of all amounts due under this  Agreement,
the  Company  hereby  irrevocably  waives  and  releases  any and all  rights of
subrogation, indemnification, reimbursement and similar rights which it may have
against or in respect of the Borrowing  Subsidiaries at any time relating to the
Guaranteed  Obligations,  including  all rights  that would  result in its being
deemed a "creditor" of the Borrowing  Subsidiaries  under the United States Code
as now in  effect or  hereafter  amended,  or any  comparable  provision  of any
successor statute.


                                  ARTICLE VIII

                            THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT

                  In order to expedite  the  transactions  contemplated  by this
Agreement, The Chase Manhattan Bank is hereby appointed to act as Administrative
Agent  on  behalf  of the  Lenders.  Each  of  the  Lenders  hereby  irrevocably
authorizes  the  Administrative  Agent to take  such  actions  on behalf of such
Lender  and to  exercise  such  powers  as  are  specifically  delegated  to the
Administrative  Agent by the terms and  provisions  hereof,  together  with such
actions and powers as are  reasonably  incidental  thereto.  The  Administrative
Agent is hereby expressly authorized by the Lenders, without hereby limiting any
implied  authority,  (a) to receive on behalf of the  Lenders  all  payments  of
principal of and interest on the Loans and all other  amounts due to the Lenders
hereunder,  and promptly to  distribute  to each Lender its proper share of each
payment so received;  (b) to give notice on behalf of each of the Lenders to the
Borrowers of any Event of Default of which the  Administrative  Agent has actual
knowledge  acquired  in  connection  with  its  agency  hereunder;  and  (c)  to
distribute to each Lender copies of all notices,  financial statements and other
materials  delivered by the Borrowers  pursuant to this Agreement as received by
the Administrative Agent.

                  Neither  the  Administrative  Agent nor any of its  directors,
officers,  employees  or agents  shall be liable as such for any action taken or
omitted  by any of them  except  for its or his or her own gross  negligence  or
willful   misconduct,   or  be  responsible  for  any  statement,   warranty  or
representation  herein or the contents of any document  delivered in  connection
herewith,  or be required to  ascertain  or to make any inquiry  concerning  the
performance  or  observance  by the  Borrowers of any of the terms,  conditions,
covenants or agreements  contained in this Agreement.  The Administrative  Agent
shall not be  responsible  to the  Lenders for the due  execution,  genuineness,
validity, enforceability or effectiveness of this Agreement or other instruments
or  agreements.  The  Administrative  Agent may deem and treat the Lender  which
makes any Loan as the holder of the  indebtedness  resulting  therefrom  for all
purposes hereof until it shall have received  notice from such Lender,  given as
provided herein, of the transfer thereof.  The Administrative Agent shall in all
cases be fully  protected in acting,  or refraining  from acting,  in accordance
with  written  instructions  signed  by the  Required  Lenders  and,  except  as
otherwise  specifically  provided  herein,  such  instructions and any action or
inaction   pursuant   thereto   shall  be  binding  on  all  the  Lenders.   The
Administrative  Agent shall,  in the absence of knowledge  to the  contrary,  be
entitled to rely on any  instrument or document  believed by it in good faith to
be genuine and  correct and to have been signed or sent by the proper  person or
persons.  Neither the Administrative  Agent nor any of its directors,  officers,
employees or agents shall have any responsibility to the Borrowers on account


of the failure of or delay in  performance or breach by any Lender of any of its
obligations  hereunder or to any Lender on account of the failure of or delay in
performance  or  breach by any other  Lender  or the  Borrowers  of any of their
respective  obligations hereunder or in connection herewith.  The Administrative
Agent may execute any and all duties hereunder by or through agents or employees
and shall be  entitled to rely upon the advice of legal  counsel  selected by it
with respect to all matters  arising  hereunder  and shall not be liable for any
action  taken or suffered in good faith by it in  accordance  with the advice of
such counsel.

                  The Lenders hereby acknowledge that the  Administrative  Agent
shall be under no duty to take any discretionary action permitted to be taken by
it pursuant to the provisions of this Agreement  unless it shall be requested in
writing to do so by the Required Lenders.

                  Subject  to the  appointment  and  acceptance  of a  successor
Administrative  Agent as provided below, the Administrative  Agent may resign at
any time by notifying  the Lenders and the Company.  Upon any such  resignation,
the Required Lenders shall have the right to appoint a successor  Administrative
Agent acceptable to the Company. If no successor shall have been so appointed by
the Required  Lenders and shall have  accepted such  appointment  within 30 days
after the retiring  Administrative  Agent gives notice of its resignation,  then
the  retiring  Administrative  Agent may,  on behalf of the  Lenders,  appoint a
successor  Administrative  Agent  which  shall be a bank  with an  office in the
United States, having a combined capital and surplus of at least $500,000,000 or
an  Affiliate  of any such  bank.  Upon the  acceptance  of any  appointment  as
Administrative Agent hereunder by a successor bank, such successor shall succeed
to and become vested with all the rights,  powers,  privileges and duties of the
retiring  Administrative  Agent and the retiring  Administrative  Agent shall be
discharged from its duties and obligations  hereunder.  After the Administrative
Agent's resignation  hereunder,  the provisions of this Article and Section 9.05
shall  continue  in effect for its  benefit in respect of any  actions  taken or
omitted to be taken by it while it was acting as Administrative Agent.

                  With  respect  to  the  Loans  made  by  it   hereunder,   the
Administrative  Agent in its individual capacity and not as Administrative Agent
shall have the same rights and powers as any other  Lender and may  exercise the
same as  though it were not the  Administrative  Agent,  and the  Administrative
Agent and its Affiliates may accept  deposits from,  lend money to and generally
engage in any kind of business  with the  Borrowers or any  Subsidiary  or other
Affiliate thereof as if it were not the Administrative Agent.

                  Each Lender agrees (i) to reimburse the Administrative  Agent,
on  demand,  in the  amount  of its pro  rata  share  (based  on its  Commitment
hereunder or, if the Commitments  shall have been terminated,  the amount of its
outstanding  Loans) of any  expenses  incurred for the benefit of the Lenders by
the Administrative Agent,  including counsel fees and compensation of agents and
employees paid for services  rendered on behalf of the Lenders,  which shall not
have been  reimbursed  by the  Borrowers and (ii) to indemnify and hold harmless
the  Administrative  Agent  and any of its  directors,  officers,  employees  or
agents,  on demand,  in the amount of such pro rata share,  from and against any
and all liabilities,  taxes, obligations,  losses, damages, penalties,  actions,
judgments,  suits,  costs,  expenses  or  disbursements  of any  kind or  nature
whatsoever  which may be imposed on,  incurred by or asserted  against it in its
capacity as the  Administrative  Agent in any way  relating to or arising out of
this  Agreement or any action taken or omitted by it under this Agreement to the
extent the same shall not have been  reimbursed by the Borrowers;  provided that
no Lender  shall be liable to the  Administrative  Agent for any portion of such
liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits,
costs,  expenses or disbursements  resulting from the gross negligence or wilful
misconduct  of the  Administrative  Agent  or any  of its  directors,  officers,
employees or agents.  Each Lender agrees that any allocation  made in good faith
by the  Administrative  Agent of expenses or other  amounts  referred to in this
paragraph  between this 


Agreement and the Facility B Credit  Agreement  shall be conclusive  and binding
for all purposes absent manifest error.

                  Each  Lender  acknowledges  that  it  has,  independently  and
without reliance upon the Administrative  Agent or any other Lender and based on
such documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own credit
analysis  and  decision  to  enter  into  this   Agreement.   Each  Lender  also
acknowledges  that  it  will,   independently  and  without  reliance  upon  the
Administrative  Agent  or any  other  Lender  and  based on such  documents  and
information as it shall from time to time deem appropriate, continue to make its
own decisions in taking or not taking action under or based upon this  Agreement
or any related agreement or any document furnished hereunder or thereunder.

latest  unrevoked  direction  from  such  party  given in  accordance  with this

                  SECTION   9.02.   Survival  of   Agreement.   All   covenants,
agreements,  representations  and warranties made by the Borrowers herein and in
the certificates or other  instruments  prepared or delivered in connection with
or pursuant to this  Agreement  shall be  considered to have been relied upon by
the Lenders and shall survive the making by the Lenders of the Loans  regardless
of any investigation  made by the Lenders or on their behalf, and shall continue
in full force and effect as long as the principal of or any accrued  interest on
any  Loan or any  Fee or any  other  amount  payable  under  this  Agreement  is
outstanding and unpaid or the Commitments have not been terminated.

                  SECTION 9.03.  Binding  Effect.  This  Agreement  shall become
effective on the Effective  Date when it shall have been executed by the Company
and the  Administrative  Agent  and when the  Administrative  Agent  shall  have
received  copies hereof  (telecopied or otherwise)  which,  when taken together,
bear the  signature of each  Lender,  and  thereafter  shall be binding upon and
inure to the benefit


of the parties hereto and their respective  successors and assigns,  except that
the  Borrowers  shall not have the right to assign any rights  hereunder  or any
interest herein without the prior consent of all the Lenders.

                  SECTION  9.04.  Successors  and Assigns.  (a) Whenever in this
Agreement  any of the parties  hereto is referred  to, such  reference  shall be
deemed to include the successors  and assigns of such party;  and all covenants,
promises and  agreements by or on behalf of any party that are contained in this
Agreement shall bind and inure to the benefit of its successors and assigns.

                  (b) Each Lender may assign to one or more  assignees  all or a
portion of its interests, rights and obligations under this Agreement (including
all or a  portion  of its  Commitment  and the  Loans at the time  owing to it);
provided,  however,  that (i) except in the case of an assignment to a Lender or
an Affiliate  of a Lender,  the Company and the  Administrative  Agent must give
their  written  consent  (except  when  there  exists a  Default  or an Event of
Default) to such assignment (which consent shall not be unreasonably  withheld),
(ii) the  parties  to each such  assignment  shall  execute  and  deliver to the
Administrative  Agent  an  Assignment  and  Acceptance,  and  a  processing  and
recordation  fee of  $3,000,  (iii) the  assignee,  if it shall not be a Lender,
shall deliver to the Administrative Agent an Administrative  Questionnaire,  and
(iv) the amount of the  Commitment of the assigning  Lender subject to each such
assignment (determined as of the date the Assignment and Acceptance with respect
to such assignment is delivered to the  Administrative  Agent) shall not be less
than $5,000,000 and the amount of the Commitment of such Lender  remaining after
such  assignment  shall  not be less  than  $5,000,000  or shall  be zero.  Upon
acceptance  and recording  pursuant to paragraph  (e) of this Section,  from and
after the effective date  specified in each  Assignment  and  Acceptance,  which
effective date shall be at least five Business Days after the execution thereof,
(A) the  assignee  thereunder  shall be a party hereto and, to the extent of the
interest  assigned  by such  Assignment  and  Acceptance,  have the  rights  and
obligations  of a Lender  under  this  Agreement  and (B) the  assigning  Lender
thereunder  shall, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and
Acceptance,  be released from its obligations  under this Agreement (and, in the
case of an Assignment and Acceptance covering all or the remaining portion of an
assigning  Lender's  rights and obligations  under this  Agreement,  such Lender
shall  cease to be a party  hereto  (but shall  continue  to be  entitled to the
benefits of Sections 2.13,  2.15,  2.19 and 9.05, as well as to any Fees accrued
for its account hereunder and not yet paid)). Notwithstanding the foregoing, any
Lender assigning its rights and obligations  under this Agreement may retain any
Competitive  Loans made by it  outstanding  at such time, and in such case shall
retain its rights hereunder in respect of any Loans so retained until such Loans
have been repaid in full in accordance with this Agreement.

                  (c) By executing and delivering an Assignment and  Acceptance,
the assigning Lender  thereunder and the assignee  thereunder shall be deemed to
confirm to and agree with each other and the other  parties  hereto as  follows:
(i) such assigning  Lender warrants that it is the legal and beneficial owner of
the interest  being assigned  thereby free and clear of any adverse claim,  (ii)
except as set forth in (i) above,  such assigning Lender makes no representation
or  warranty  and  assumes no  responsibility  with  respect to any  statements,
warranties or representations  made in or in connection with this Agreement,  or
the execution, legality, validity, enforceability,  genuineness,  sufficiency or
value of this Agreement or any other instrument or document  furnished  pursuant
hereto  or the  financial  condition  of the  Borrowers  or the  performance  or
observance by the Borrowers of any obligations under this Agreement or any other
instrument or document furnished pursuant hereto; (iii) such assignee represents
and warrants  that it is legally  authorized to enter into such  Assignment  and
Acceptance;  (iv) such  assignee  confirms  that it has  received a copy of this
Agreement,  together  with  copies  of  the  most  recent  financial  statements
delivered  pursuant to Section 5.03 and such other  documents and information as
it has deemed  appropriate to make its own credit analysis and decision to enter
into such Assignment and Acceptance;  (v) such assignee will  independently  and
without  reliance upon the  Administrative  Agent,

such  assigning  Lender or any other  Lender  and  based on such  documents  and
information as it shall deem  appropriate at the time,  continue to make its own
credit decisions in taking or not taking action under this Agreement;  (vi) such
assignee appoints and authorizes the Administrative Agent to take such action as
agent on its behalf and to exercise  such  powers  under this  Agreement  as are
delegated to the  Administrative  Agent by the terms hereof,  together with such
powers as are reasonably incidental thereto; and (vii) such assignee agrees that
it will perform in accordance with their terms all the obligations  which by the
terms of this Agreement are required to be performed by it as a Lender.

                  (d) The  Administrative  Agent  shall  maintain  at one of its
offices  in The  City  of New  York a copy  of each  Assignment  and  Acceptance
delivered to it and a register for the recordation of the names and addresses of
the Lenders,  and the Commitment of, and the principal amount of the Loans owing
to, each Lender pursuant to the terms hereof from time to time (the "Register").
The entries in the Register shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error
and the  Borrowers,  the  Administrative  Agent and the  Lenders  may treat each
person whose name is recorded in the Register  pursuant to the terms hereof as a
Lender  hereunder  for all purposes of this  Agreement.  The  Register  shall be
available for inspection by each party hereto,  at any reasonable  time and from
time to time upon reasonable prior notice.

                  (e)  Upon  its  receipt  of a duly  completed  Assignment  and
Acceptance  executed by an  assigning  Lender and an assignee  together  with an
Administrative  Questionnaire  completed in respect of the assignee  (unless the
assignee shall already be a Lender  hereunder),  the processing and  recordation
fee referred to in paragraph (b) above and the written consent of the Company to
such assignment,  the Administrative  Agent shall (i) accept such Assignment and
Acceptance and (ii) record the information contained therein in the Register.

                  (f) Each Lender may sell  participations  to one or more banks
or other entities in all or a portion of its rights and  obligations  under this
Agreement  (including  all or a portion of its Commitment and the Loans owing to
it); provided,  however, that (i) such Lender's obligations under this Agreement
shall remain unchanged,  (ii) such Lender shall remain solely responsible to the
other  parties  hereto  for the  performance  of such  obligations,  (iii)  each
participating  bank or other entity shall be entitled to the benefit of the cost
protection  provisions  contained  in Sections  2.13,  2.15 and 2.19 to the same
extent as if it were the selling  Lender  (and  limited to the amount that could
have been claimed by the selling Lender had it continued to hold the interest of
such participating  bank or other entity),  except that all claims made pursuant
to such  Sections  shall  be made  through  such  selling  Lender,  and (iv) the
Borrowers, the Administrative Agent and the other Lenders shall continue to deal
solely and directly with such selling  Lender in  connection  with such Lender's
rights and obligations under this Agreement.

                  (g) Any Lender or  participant  may,  in  connection  with any
assignment or participation or proposed assignment or participation  pursuant to
this Section,  disclose to the assignee or participant  or proposed  assignee or
participant any information  relating to the Borrowers furnished to such Lender;
provided that, prior to any such  disclosure,  each such assignee or participant
or proposed  assignee or  participant  shall  execute an agreement  whereby such
assignee  or  participant  shall  agree  (subject to  customary  exceptions)  to
preserve the confidentiality of any such information.

                  (h) The Borrowers  shall not assign or delegate any rights and
duties hereunder without the prior written consent of all Lenders.

                  (i) Any  Lender may at any time  pledge all or any  portion of
its rights under this Agreement to a Federal Reserve Bank; provided that no such
pledge shall release any Lender from its obligations hereunder or substitute any
such Bank for such  Lender as a party  hereto.  In order to  facilitate


such an  assignment  to a Federal  Reserve Bank,  each  Borrower  shall,  at the
request of the  assigning  Lender,  duly  execute and  deliver to the  assigning
Lender a promissory note or notes  evidencing the Loans made to such Borrower by
the assigning Lender hereunder.

                  SECTION 9.05. Expenses;  Indemnity. (a) The Borrowers agree to
pay all reasonable  out-of-pocket  expenses incurred by the Administrative Agent
in  connection  with  entering  into this  Agreement or in  connection  with any
amendments,  modifications or waivers of the provisions  hereof,  or incurred by
the  Administrative  Agent or any Lender in connection  with the  enforcement or
protection  of their rights in connection  with this  Agreement or in connection
with the Loans made hereunder,  including the fees and  disbursements of counsel
for the Administrative Agent or, in the case of enforcement, the Lenders.

                  (b) The Borrowers agree to indemnify the Administrative Agent,
each Lender, each of their Affiliates and the directors, officers, employees and
agents of the foregoing (each such person being called an "Indemnitee") against,
and to hold each Indemnitee harmless from, any and all losses, claims,  damages,
liabilities  and  related  expenses,   including  reasonable  counsel  fees  and
expenses,  incurred by or asserted against any Indemnitee arising out of (i) the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (ii) the use of
the  proceeds  of the Loans or (iii) any  claim,  litigation,  investigation  or
proceeding relating to any of the foregoing,  whether or not any Indemnitee is a
party thereto;  provided that such indemnity shall not, as to any Indemnitee, be
available  to the extent  that such  losses,  claims,  damages,  liabilities  or
related  expenses  are  determined  by a final  judgment of a court of competent
jurisdiction to have resulted from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of
such Indemnitee.

                  (c) The provisions of this Section shall remain  operative and
in full  force  and  effect  regardless  of the  expiration  of the term of this
Agreement,  the  consummation  of  the  transactions  contemplated  hereby,  the
repayment of any of the Loans, the invalidity or unenforceability of any term or
provision  of this  Agreement or any  investigation  made by or on behalf of the
Administrative  Agent or any Lender. All amounts due under this Section shall be
payable on written demand therefor.

                  SECTION 9.06.  APPLICABLE LAW.  THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE 
CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH AND GOVERNED BY THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK.

                  SECTION 9.07. Waivers;  Amendment.  (a) No failure or delay of
the  Administrative  Agent  or any  Lender  in  exercising  any  power  or right
hereunder  shall  operate as a waiver  thereof,  nor shall any single or partial
exercise of any such right or power,  or any  abandonment or  discontinuance  of
steps to enforce such a right or power,  preclude any other or further  exercise
thereof or the exercise of any other right or power.  The rights and remedies of
the  Administrative  Agent and the Lenders  hereunder are cumulative and are not
exclusive of any rights or remedies which they would  otherwise  have. No waiver
of any provision of this Agreement or consent to any departure  therefrom  shall
in any event be effective  unless the same shall be  permitted by paragraph  (b)
below,  and then such waiver or consent shall be effective  only in the specific
instance  and for the  purpose  for  which  given.  No  notice  or demand on any
Borrower or any  Subsidiary in any case shall entitle such party to any other or
further notice or demand in similar or other circumstances.

                  (b) Neither this  Agreement  nor any  provision  hereof may be
waived,  amended or modified  except  pursuant to an agreement or  agreements in
writing  entered  into by the  Borrowers  and the  Required  Lenders;  provided,
however,  that no such agreement shall (i) decrease the principal  amount of, or
extend the maturity of or any scheduled  principal  payment date or date for the
payment of any interest on any Loan,  or waive or excuse any such payment or any
part  thereof,  or decrease the rate of interest on 


any Loan,  without the prior written  consent of each Lender  affected  thereby,
(ii) increase the  Commitment or decrease the Facility Fee of any Lender without
the prior written  consent of such Lender,  (iii) limit or release the guarantee
set forth in Article VII, or (iv) amend or modify the provisions of Section 2.16
or Section  9.04(h),  the  provisions  of this Section or the  definition of the
"Required Lenders",  without the prior written consent of each Lender;  provided
further, however, that no such agreement shall amend, modify or otherwise affect
the rights or duties of the  Administrative  Agent  hereunder  without the prior
written consent of the  Administrative  Agent. Each Lender shall be bound by any
waiver,  amendment or modification authorized by this Section and any consent by
any Lender  pursuant to this  Section  shall bind any assignee of its rights and
interests hereunder.

                  SECTION  9.08.  Entire  Agreement.   This  Agreement  and  the
agreements  referred to in Section 2.06(b)  constitute the entire contract among
the parties relative to the subject matter hereof.  Any previous agreement among
the parties  with respect to the subject  matter  hereof is  superseded  by this
Agreement.  Nothing in this  Agreement,  expressed  or  implied,  is intended to
confer  upon any party  other  than the  parties  hereto any  rights,  remedies,
obligations or liabilities under or by reason of this Agreement.

                  SECTION  9.09.  Severability.  In the event any one or more of
the provisions  contained in this Agreement  should be held invalid,  illegal or
unenforceable in any respect,  the validity,  legality and enforceability of the
remaining  provisions  contained  herein  shall  not in any way be  affected  or
impaired  thereby.  The parties  shall  endeavor in good-faith  negotiations  to
replace the invalid,  illegal or unenforceable  provisions with valid provisions
the economic  effect of which comes as close as possible to that of the invalid,
illegal or unenforceable provisions.

                  SECTION 9.10. Counterparts.  This Agreement may be executed in
two or more counterparts,  each of which shall constitute an original but all of
which when taken  together shall  constitute but one contract,  and shall become
effective as provided in Section 9.03.

                  SECTION 9.11.  Headings.  Article and Section headings and the
Table of Contents used herein are for  convenience  of reference  only,  are not
part of this Agreement and are not to affect the construction of, or to be taken
into consideration in interpreting, this Agreement.

                  SECTION  9.12.  Right of Setoff.  If an Event of Default shall
have occurred and be  continuing,  each Lender is hereby  authorized at any time
and from time to time,  to the fullest  extent  permitted by law, to set off and
apply any and all deposits (general or special,  time or demand,  provisional or
final) at any time held and other  indebtedness at any time owing by such Lender
to or for the credit or obligations of the Company and any Borrowing  Subsidiary
now or hereafter existing under this Agreement held by such Lender, irrespective
of whether or not such Lender  shall have made any demand  under this  Agreement
and although such  obligations may be unmatured.  Each Lender agrees promptly to
notify  the  Company  and  the  Administrative   Agent  after  such  setoff  and
application  made by such Lender,  but the failure to give such notice shall not
affect the  validity of such setoff and  application.  The rights of each Lender
under this Section are in addition to other rights and remedies (including other
rights of setoff) which such Lender may have.

                  SECTION 9.13. Jurisdiction; Consent to Service of Process. (a)
Each Borrower hereby irrevocably and unconditionally submits, for itself and its
property,  to the  nonexclusive  jurisdiction  of any New  York  State  court or
Federal  court of the United States of America  sitting in New York County,  and
any appellate court from any thereof, in any action or proceeding arising out of
or  relating  to  this  Agreement,  or for  recognition  or  enforcement  of any
judgment,  and each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably and unconditionally
agrees that all claims in respect of any such action or proceeding  may be heard
and  determined  in such New York State or, to the extent  permitted  by law, in
such Federal  court.  Each of the parties hereto agrees that a final judgment in
any such action or 


proceeding  shall be conclusive  and may be enforced in other  jurisdictions  by
suit on the  judgment or in any other  manner  provided  by law.  Subject to the
foregoing and to paragraph (b) below, nothing in this Agreement shall affect any
right that any party hereto may otherwise have to bring any action or proceeding
relating to this  Agreement  against any other party hereto in the courts of any
jurisdiction.

                  (b)  Each  Borrower  hereby  irrevocably  and  unconditionally
waives,  to the  fullest  extent  it may  legally  and  effectively  do so,  any
objection  which it may now or  thereafter  have to the  laying  of venue of any
suit,  action or proceeding  arising out of or relating to this Agreement in any
New York State or Federal court.  Each of the parties hereto hereby  irrevocably
waives,  to the fullest extent  permitted by law, the defense of an inconvenient
forum to the maintenance of such action or proceeding in any such court.

                  (c)  Each  party to this  Agreement  irrevocably  consents  to
service of process in the manner  provided for notices in Section 9.01.  Nothing
in this  Agreement will affect the right of any party to this Agreement to serve
process in any other manner permitted by law.

                  SECTION 9.14.  Waiver of Jury Trial.  EACH PARTY HERETO HEREBY
WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE
TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION  DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY  ARISING
OUT OF,  UNDER OR IN  CONNECTION  WITH THIS  AGREEMENT.  Each  party  hereto (a)
certifies  that no  representative,  agent or  attorney  of any other  party has
represented,  expressly  or  otherwise,  that such other party would not, in the
event of litigation,  seek to enforce the foregoing  waiver and (b) acknowledges
that it and other parties  hereto have been induced to enter into this Agreement
by, among other things, the mutual waivers and certification in this Section.

                  SECTION  9.15.  Addition  of  Borrowing   Subsidiaries.   Each
Borrowing Subsidiary which shall deliver to the Administrative Agent a Borrowing
Subsidiary  Agreement  executed by such  Subsidiary and the Company shall,  upon
such  delivery  and without  further  act,  become a party hereto and a Borrower
hereunder  with the same  effect  as if it had  been an  original  party to this
Agreement.



                  IN WITNESS  WHEREOF,  the  parties  hereto  have  caused  this
Agreement to be duly executed by their respective  authorized officers as of the
day and year first above written.
